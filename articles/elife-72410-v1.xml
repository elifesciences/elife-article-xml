(<italic>C. elegans</italic>) as an animal model, crotamiton (<italic>N</italic>-ethyl-o-crotonotoluidide) showed anti-aging activity and was selected for further structural optimization. After replacing the ortho-methyl of crotamiton with ortho-fluoro, crotamiton derivative JM03 was obtained and showed better activity in terms of lifespan-extension and stress resistance than crotamiton. It was further explored that JM03 extended the lifespan of <italic>C. elegans</italic> through osmotic avoidance abnormal-9 (OSM-9). Besides, JM03 improves the ability of nematode to resist oxidative stress and hypertonic stress through OSM-9, but not osm-9/capsaicin receptor related-2 (OCR-2). Then the inhibition of OSM-9 by JM03 reduces the aggregation of Q35 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> via upregulating the genes associated with proteostasis. SKN-1 signaling was also found to be activated after JM03 treatment, which might contribute to proteostasis, stress resistance and lifespan extension. In summary, this study explored a new small molecule derived from crotamiton, which has efficient anti-oxidative, anti-hypertonic, and anti-aging effects, and could further lead to promising application prospects.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>crotamiton derivative</kwd><kwd>lifespan</kwd><kwd>OSM-9</kwd><kwd>proteostasis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>22037002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Jian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Program for Professor of Special Appointment</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TP2018025</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Zelan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007219</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21ZR1416700</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Zelan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021-01-07-00-02-E00104</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Jian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chinese Special Fund for Special Key Laboratory of Bioreactor Rngineering</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2060204</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Jian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In a chemical genetics study, JM03 derived from crotamiton, an inhibitor of trainsient receptor potential vanilloid-4 channels, was identified to extend lifespan and improve oxidative and hypertonic stress resistance in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> via inhibiting OSM-9.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In spite the fact that aging is an inevitable process, many efforts have been made to uncover drugs which could delay aging. Numerous aging associated signaling pathways, discovered in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, are found to be conserved in the mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kenyon, 2010</xref>). Moreover, many compounds, which extended the lifespan of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, also showed anti-aging effects in the mice model. For example, urolithin A was found to prolong the lifespan and normal activity including mobility and pharyngeal pumping in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and it also improved the exercise capacity in mice with age-related decline of muscle function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ryu et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, rapamycin has been also found to increase the lifespan in worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Robida-Stubbs et al., 2012</xref>), yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Medvedik et al., 2007</xref>), and flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bjedov et al., 2010</xref>), as well as mean and maximum lifespans in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harrison et al., 2009</xref>). Metformin, a first-line drug for type 2 diabetes treatment, has been widely studied to extend the lifespan both in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cabreiro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Haes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2017</xref>) and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anisimov et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Martin-Montalvo et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In order to discover novel anti-aging compounds, we screened our in-house 1072 marketed drugs using <italic>C. elegans</italic> as an animal model for their ability to extend the lifespan. As marketed drugs generally have definite pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics properties and are useful for drug repurposing, our research group is focused on searching compounds for drug repurposing. Herein, in this study, the approved drug crotamiton has been found to show anti-aging activity for the first time and was further selected for the structural optimization.</p><p>Crotamiton is an inhibitor of TRPV4 (Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid-4) channel and has been used as anti-scabies and anti-itch agent in humans for nearly 70 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kittaka et al., 2017</xref>). TRPV subfamily proteins are encoded by five genes in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, including <italic>osm-9</italic> (<italic><underline>osm</underline></italic>otic avoidance abnormal), <italic>ocr-1</italic> (<italic><underline>o</underline></italic>sm-9/<italic><underline>c</underline></italic>apsaicin receptor <italic><underline>r</underline></italic>elated), <italic>ocr-2</italic>, <italic>ocr-3</italic> and <italic>ocr-4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xiao and Xu, 2009</xref>). Only loss of <italic>osm-9</italic> or <italic>ocr-2</italic> in worms resulted in the lifespan extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sheng et al., 2017</xref>). OSM-9 and OCR-2 can form heterotetrameric channels which transduce signals from olfactory, nociceptive, and serotonergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tobin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ohnishi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>); however, the role of OSM-9 and OCR-2 in the regulation of stress resistance involves different mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moriuchi et al., 2018</xref>). It has been shown in previous studies that the inactivation of OCR-2 extends the L1 starvation survival, while null mutations in <italic>osm-9</italic> did not alter L1 starvation survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee and Ashrafi, 2008</xref>). <italic>Osm-9</italic> null mutants showed more resistance to oxidative or hypertonic stress than the control worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). Noticeably, it was reported that taurine, an essential amino acid involved in various physiological functions, promoted longevity of <italic>C. elegans</italic> in oxidative stress condition by inhibiting OSM-9 but not OCR-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moriuchi et al., 2018</xref>). Taken together, further extensive research is still needed to decipher the downstream signaling pathways after OSM-9 or OCR-2 activation.</p><p>With an aim to get a potential anti-ageing tool molecule, structural optimization based on crotamiton led to the identification of JM03. This molecule displayed better activity than crotamiton in terms of the lifespan extension and stress resistance of <italic>C. elegans</italic>. To further decipher the mechanisms of JM03 involved in the anti-aging activity, this study was conducted with special emphasis on its interaction with OSM-9 or OCR-2.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Crotamiton prolongs lifespan of <italic>C. elegans</italic></title><p>To identify candidate anti-aging compounds, we initially performed a phenotypic screening of our in-house 1072 marketed drugs with 15 worms per concentration (100 μM) using an <italic>C. elegans</italic> model for their abilities of lifespan extension (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Thereafter, 125 drugs which showed up to 10% increase in mean lifespan extension as compared to the controls were selected for the secondary screening with 30 worms per concentration (100 μM) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>).

However, moving the methyl group to the <italic>para</italic>-position (JM02) resulted in better activity. Replacing the <italic>ortho</italic>-methyl with <italic>ortho</italic>-fluoro (JM03), chloro (JM04), and bromo (JM05) significantly increased the activity. Additionally, incorporation of the carboxyl (JM06, JM07) on the benzene ring did not increase the activity. Since the introduction of a carboxyl at the terminal of alkenyl of crotamiton (JM08) improved the activity, we conducted additional modification based on the potent compounds JM02 and JM03. Unfortunately, no remarkable increased activity was observed after this step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Moreover, the movement of the fluoro substituent from the <italic>ortho</italic>-position (JM03) to the <italic>para</italic>-position (JM13) had no effect on the activity. Further adding carboxyl (JM14) or ethoxycarbonyl (JM15) was found to be detrimental. Considering the introduction of fluorine substituents into drugs can enhance biological activity and increase chemical or metabolic stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hagmann, 2008</xref>), JM03 was selected for the following study. The lifespan of worms treated with JM03 increased significantly as compared to those treated with crotamiton (p &lt; 0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Since 5-Fluorodeoxyuridine (FUdR) was used as contraceptive in our lifespan assay and is known to impact lifespan, we also tested the lifespan-extension effect of crotamiton and JM03 without FUdR and found two compounds could both prolong the lifespan of <italic>C. elegans</italic> in the absence of FUdR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). It has been reported that aging would lead to slower and uncoordinated body movement in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Herndon et al., 2002</xref>). Therefore, keeping this in view, we measured the age-dependent muscle deterioration and diminished pharyngeal pumping rate in worms to assess the healthspan of worms treated with JM03. It was found that JM03 did not change the body bend rate of <italic>C. elegans</italic> at different age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). JM03-treated groups exhibited increased pharyngeal pumping rate at day 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). Additionally, no changed reproductive capacity was observed in JM03-treated worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>).

Subsequently, we also confirmed the increased expression of glutathione S-transferase-4 (<italic>gst-4</italic>), a key downstream target of SKN-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2019b</xref>), based on the GFP fluorescence signal of <italic>gst-4::gfp</italic> worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). In addition, JM03 did not extend the lifespan of <italic>skn-1(zu135)</italic> mutants under oxidative stress condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>). In conclusion, JM03 prolongs the lifespan and improves stress-resistance ability of <italic>C. elegans</italic> through SKN-1 pathway.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Drug repurposing has emerged as an effective approach for the rapid identification and development of pharmaceutical molecules with novel activities against various diseases based on the already known marketed drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pushpakom et al., 2019</xref>). Herein, we explored the possibility of identifying the potent drugs which could increase the longevity by screening our in-house marketed drugs using lifespan extension assays in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. In the first round, a large-scale anti-aging drug screening was conducted with the sample size of 15 animals per drug at a single concentration and only the cohorts with +10% or over increase in lifespan made them the second round. The power of detection of the first-round screen is roughly less than 15% based on the power calculation tables provided by recent computational analysis of lifespan experiment reproducibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Petrascheck and Miller, 2017</xref>). In addition, all drugs were screened in the first and second round at a single concentration (100 μM) and this concentration is not modified based on the compound of interest. The concentration optimization was only performed in the third-round screen for the confirmed 10 hit compounds. Therefore, our screening strategy indeed brought a number of false negatives and miss a substantial number of anti-aging compounds.</p><p>After three rounds of screening, crotamiton, which was known as an anti-scabies and anti-itch agent was found to increase the lifespan. It has been reported that crotamiton is an inhibitor of human TRPV4 channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kittaka et al., 2017</xref>), which is homologous to OSM-9 and OCR-2 channels in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xiao and Xu, 2009</xref>). Loss of OCR-2 or OSM-9, can result in the lifespan extension in <italic>C. elegans (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Riera et al., 2014</xref>). In our study, JM03 further increased the lifespan for the <italic>ocr-2</italic> knockdown <italic>C. elegans</italic>, but was ineffective for the knockdown or knockout of <italic>osm-9</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), which suggested JM03 selectively acted on OSM-9, not OCR-2. Furthermore, JM03 improved the antioxidant and anti-hyperosmotic stress resistance of wild type worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a and d</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>osm-9</italic> mutants showed enhanced ability to resist oxidative stress and hypertonic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b and e</xref>), while <italic>ocr-2</italic> mutants did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c and f</xref>). These results also supported that JM03 selectively acted on OSM-9, not OCR-2. Consistently, JM03 still had significant anti-oxidant and anti-hyperosmotic effects on <italic>ocr-2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c and f</xref>), but not <italic>osm-9</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b and e</xref>). It is noted that OSM-9 is not the only mechanism that mediate the anti-hyperosmotic effect of JM03 because JM03 retained a slight effect on osmotic pressure resistance of the <italic>osm-9</italic> mutants.</p><p>OSM-9 plays major roles in transduction and regulation of signals in several sensory neurons and is important for processes such as volatile chemotaxis and osmotic avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Colbert et al., 1997</xref>). <italic>Osm-9</italic> null mutant was reported to show enhanced survival in hypertonic environments, not due to altered systemic volume regulation or glycerol accumulation and instead may be due to enhanced proteostasis capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). Consistently, JM03 treatment also enhanced proteostasis capacity in <italic>C. elegans</italic> revealed by reduced aggregation of Q35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). Besides, JM03 can upregulate the expression of the genes that play known or presumptive roles in proteostasis in <italic>N2</italic> worms but not in <italic>osm-9(ky10)</italic> mutant by transcriptome analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). Among these genes, the increased expression of <italic>aquaporin-8</italic> (<italic>aqp-8</italic>) in <italic>osm-9(ok1677)</italic> mutant was also reported by a Germany lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Igual Gil et al., 2017</xref>). Considering the essential roles of AQP-8 in sustaining the salt/water balance in various cells types and tissues, the loss/inhibition of <italic>osm-9</italic> might help to maintain the salt/water balance to promote proteostasis during the response to hyperosmotic stress.</p><p>To investigate which downstream signaling was activated after OSM-9 inhibition by JM03, two important stress response transcription factors DAF-16 and SKN-1 were examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mark et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alavez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cohen et al., 2006</xref>). Lifespan analysis showed that JM03 extended the lifespan through SKN-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>), but not DAF-16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Then our RNA-sequencing and qPCR data both showed the transcriptional expression of <italic>skn-1</italic> itself and <italic>skn-1</italic> regulated genes were significantly increased in JM03-treated worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b and d</xref>). The expression of SKN-1 and GST-4 was confirmed by using GFP translational reporter worms (<italic>skn-1::gfp</italic> and <italic>gst-4::gfp</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c and e</xref>). These results provide the evidence that JM03 activates SKN-1 signaling that regulates longevity, stress resistance, and proteostasis. But how JM03 activates SKN-1 signaling after inhibiting OSM-9 remained to be studied.</p><p>In conclusion, overall results showed that JM03 increased the lifespan of <italic>C. elegans</italic> by inhibiting OSM-9, and then activated SKN-1, which improved proteostasis, stress resistance and lifespan extension in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Since OSM-9 is the homologous to mammal TRPV channels, it’s very interesting to examine whether JM03 acts selectively on a certain TRPV subtypes in mice in future studies.</p><fig id="fig7"

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Carlos Isales as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The cohort size of 15 animals/drugs during the screen suggests that there must have been a substantial amount of false negatives. That cohort size only detects 50% of all drugs that extend lifespan by 20% and miss roughly 80% of the drugs that extend lifespan by 10%, the cut-off criteria for hits. There is nothing wrong with this strategy, but the text should clearly state that not having found the effect of a drug in a screen is not evidence for the absence of an effect.</p><p>The authors should roughly outline their power of detection in the screen and that the way they have done the experiment will have caused them to miss a substantial number of compounds. Rough estimations for their power of detection can be derived from the tables in PMID: 28713422. The authors should clarify this point as otherwise, there is the danger that absence of evidence will be interpreted as evidence for absence, and any future group that finds a compound that has been missed will be forced to explain why they found effects while Bao et al. did not.</p><p>2) Another concern is the fact that all drugs are screened at a single concentration (100uM) – and this concentration is not modified based on the compound of interest. Dose / conc optimization is only performed at the final (third) screening stage for 10 of the confirmed hits. I appreciate that at this scale this might be the only way to go – but the authors should, again, clearly discuss this limitation as several well-known lifespan extending drugs show optimal effects at concentrations that are different from the one used for screening here.</p><p>3) Similarly, the effect of the JM03 is relatively small, making it more difficult to show that there is no effect in a given strain. To show the absence of an effect in osm-9, the authors use cohorts of roughly 150 animals in each arm to ensure that they can detect a longevity effect if it is present. The source data show that they used enough animals for figure 3 (10 x15 animals) and should detect a longevity effect of JM03 if there were one in osm-9. However, all the animals combined amounts to essentially one experiment, and a second repeat of that size is necessary for a firm conclusion in the paper. There should therefore be a second experiment with a four-way comparison N2, osm-9 +/- JM03 again with a cohort of ~150 animals each to ensure that there is no effect. Given the central importance of these data for the proposed mechanism, it is essential to present data from two independent experiments to support osm-9 to be a lifespan target, one with RNAi and one with the mutant.</p><p>4) The drug screen uses FUdR as contraceptive. This, again, is expected and probably inevitable for this scale of screen – but it might be valuable to confirm the drug effect of the best hits (or of cotamitron at least) in the absence of FUdR as FUdR is known to impact lifespan and possibly proteostasis. The authors should present these data to ensure that the effect is not dependent on FUdR being resent.</p><p>5) I appreciate the attempt to add mammalian data but the tissue culture segment of the investigation seems disconnected and raises some questions. Why would cell &quot;viability&quot; increase over 100%? The control cells seem viable (as far as I can judge) – is there any death in the controls? Also, statistically, it is inappropriate to do several t-tests – surely an ANOVA test would be more appropriate here. The authors should revisit this aspect of the work and maybe limit the claims to stating that no toxicity was observed. Tissue culture experiments would be more valuable if there was more connection with other parts of the study – did the authors do any mechanistic work in cells – e.g. qPCR?</p><p>6) Regarding the RNA seq data analysis; The cluster analysis shown in Figure 4i suggests that there is substantial variability in the RNAseq data. However, a principal component (PCA) plot shown in the supplemental figures and demonstrating that the three control and the JM03 treated samples cluster appropriately would strengthen confidence in the RNAseq data and the conclusions the authors draw from it. This figure should be generated and referenced appropriately in the main text.</p><p>7) The authors should cite PMID24855942 because this paper shows the longevity of osm-9 and that it may be conserved in mammals.</p><p>8) Both reviewers asked for more details on the pharmacological space covered by the initial screen. The authors should add a figure like a pie chart showing an overview of which pharmacological activities were tested.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>There are some limitations to the lifespan screen. First, the cohort size is only 15 animals, meaning that many potential hits will have been missed and some false positives would have been generated. This is not a major concern as there is a second stage, re-screening 125 &quot;hits&quot;, which should remove most false positives. However, the authors should maybe comment clearly on the power analysis of this design.</p><p>Another concern is the fact that all drugs are screened at a single concentration (100uM) – and this concentration is not modified based on the compound of interest. Dose / conc optimization is only performed at the final (third) screening stage for 10 of the confirmed hits. I appreciate that at this scale this might be the only way to go – but the authors should, again, clearly discuss this limitation as several well-known lifespan extending drugs show optimal effects at concentrations that are different from the one used for screening here.</p><p>The drug screen also uses FUdR as contraceptive.

I appreciate the attempt to add mammalian data but this part of the investigation seems disconnected and raises some questions. Why would cell &quot;viability&quot; increase over 100%? The control cells seem viable (as far as I can judge) – is there any death in the controls?

The authors should revisit this aspect of the work and maybe limit the claims to stating that no toxicity was observed. Tissue culture experiments would be more valuable if there was more connection with other parts of the study – did the authors do any mechanistic work in cells – e.g. qPCR?</p><p>The authors then carry out chemical lead optimization and try to establish a mechanism of action. Beyond some questions regarding the power of some of these studies (see minor comments), I think the structural optimization is convincing and a strong point of this manuscript – although I cannot comment on the chemistry here.</p><p>In terms of the mode of action, the evidence remains somewhat circumstantial. Yes, JM03 does not seem to further extend the lifespan of (long-lived) osm-9 KD animals -but that does not prove that it directly binds OSM9. Some further support would be useful here. For example, the authors might carry out RNAseq comparing osm-9 KD and WT with and without JM03 treatment. Of course, direct confirmation of binding would be ideal but is also hard.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Sample sizes:</p><p>The authors should roughly outline their power of detection in the screen and that the way they have done the experiment will have caused them to miss a substantial number of compounds.</p><p>Rough estimations for their power of detection can be derived from the tables in PMID: 28713422. As outlined in the public review section, a strategy with false negatives is fine, but the authors should clarify that. Otherwise, there is the danger that absence of evidence will turn into evidence for absence, and any future group that finds a compound that has been missed will be forced to explain why they found effects while Bao et al. did not.</p><p>Pharmacological space covered:</p><p>The authors should add a figure like a pie chart showing an overview of which pharmacological activities were tested.</p><p>Repeat osm-9:</p><p>-There should be a second experiment with a four-way comparison N2, osm-9 +/- JM03 again with a cohort of ~150 animals each to ensure that there is no effect. I know that this is a lot of work, but as is, and unless I missed it, two experiments support osm-9 to be a lifespan target, one with RNAi and one with the mutant.</p><p>RNAseq:</p><p>The cluster analysis shown in Figure 4i suggests that there is substantial variability in the RNAseq data. However, a principal component (PCA) plot shown in the supplemental figures shows that the three control and 3 JM03 treated samples cluster would strengthen confidence in the RNAseq data and the conclusions the authors draw from it.</p><p>Direct interaction:</p><p>If the authors could come up with an experiment that clearly shows that JM03 interacts with osm-9, or at least TRPV4, or reduces its activity in vitro, that would go a long way and make this a solid mechanistic paper. However, I won't insist on this since som-9 is a channel in the membrane, and it is notoriously difficult to show interactions for labs that are not specialized in channels.</p><p>Citations:</p><p>I think the authors should cite PMID24855942 because this paper shows the longevity of osm-9 and that it may be conserved in mammals.</p><p>I am hesitant to make comments on the English not being a native speaker myself, but I think there are a few mistakes still:</p><p>Line 159: should say &quot;it was shown&quot;</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72410.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The cohort size of 15 animals/drugs during the screen suggests that there must have been a substantial amount of false negatives.

We conducted a large-scale anti-aging drug screening with the sample size of 15 animals per drug at a single concentration in the first round and only the cohorts with +10% or over increase in lifespan made them the second round. The power of detection in the first-round screen is roughly less than 15% based on the tables in PMID: 28713422. As the reviewer’s suggested, we roughly outlined the power of detection in our screening and stated that negative compounds might be false negatives in the manuscript. So, it is probable to discover lifespan-extension ability of some negative compounds in the future study.

All drugs were screened in the first and second round at a single concentration (100 μM) and this concentration is not modified based on the compound of interest. The concentration optimization was only performed in the third-round screen for the confirmed 10 hit compounds. In this process, we missed several positive compounds because of concentration setting deficiency. Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we added detailed discussion of this limitation.

In our manuscript, significant differences were calculated using t-tests in cell viability assays. Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we changed t-tests to ANOVA test (page 34, line 686-687; page 42, line 791-792). Here, cell viability assay was usually used to test the toxicity of chemicals under different concentrations. JM03 showed cell viability increase over 100% in 200 μM but we didn’t observe obvious cell death through light field microscopy. We really agree that it’s better to limit the claims stating that no toxicity was observed. As showed in Figure 5a in the revised manuscript, both Cro and JM03 have no toxicity in MRC-5 cells under the tested concentrations (page 5, line 95-96; page 10, line 186-187).</p><p>For further mechanism study of JM03 in MRC-5 cells, we selected the concentration of 400 μM which has no toxicity and viability increasing effects to perform a qPCR assay.

First, the cohort size is only 15 animals, meaning that many potential hits will have been missed and some false positives would have been generated. This is not a major concern as there is a second stage, re-screening 125 &quot;hits&quot;, which should remove most false positives. However, the authors should maybe comment clearly on the power analysis of this design.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your professional suggestion. We conducted a large-scale anti-aging drug screening with the sample size of 15 animals per drug at a single concentration in the first round and only the cohorts with +10% or over increase in lifespan made them the second round. The power of detection in the first-round screen is roughly less than 15% based on the tables in PMID: 28713422. As the reviewer’s suggested, we roughly outlined the power of detection in our screening and stated that negative compounds might be false negatives in the manuscript. So, it is probable to discover lifespan-extension ability of some negative compounds in the future study. Please see page 12 line 247-255, page 13 line 258-260 in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another concern is the fact that all drugs are screened at a single concentration (100uM) – and this concentration is not modified based on the compound of interest. Dose / conc optimization is only performed at the final (third) screening stage for 10 of the confirmed hits. I appreciate that at this scale this might be the only way to go – but the authors should, again, clearly discuss this limitation as several well-known lifespan extending drugs show optimal effects at concentrations that are different from the one used for screening here.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this helpful suggestion. All drugs were screened in the first and second round at a single concentration (100 μM) and this concentration is not modified based on the compound of interest. The concentration optimization was only performed in the third-round screen for the confirmed 10 hit compounds. In this process, we missed several positive compounds because of concentration setting deficiency. Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we added detailed discussion of this limitation. Please see page 13 line 255-260 in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The drug screen also uses FUdR as contraceptive. This, again, is expected and probably inevitable for this scale of screen – but it might be valuable to confirm the drug effect of the best hits (or of cotamitron at least) in the absence of FUdR as FUdR is known to impact lifespan and possibly proteostasis.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your useful suggestion. We added a lifespan assay of Cro and JM03 without FUdR and found that the two compounds could also extend lifespan in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (Cro, <italic>P</italic>=0.0513; JM03, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001, Figure 2c). The results showed that lifespan-extension effect of Cro and JM03 is not dependent on the existence of FUdR Please see page 7 line 132-135 in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is a little bit of tissue culture data on human cells. I appreciate the attempt to add mammalian data but this part of the investigation seems disconnected and raises some questions. Why would cell &quot;viability&quot; increase over 100%? The control cells seem viable (as far as I can judge) – is there any death in the controls? Also, statistically, it is inappropriate to do several t-tests – surely an ANOVA test would be more appropriate here. The authors should revisit this aspect of the work and maybe limit the claims to stating that no toxicity was observed. Tissue culture experiments would be more valuable if there was more connection with other parts of the study – did the authors do any mechanistic work in cells – e.g. qPCR?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this professional suggestion. In our manuscript, significant differences were calculated using t-tests in cell viability assays. Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we changed t-tests to ANOVA test (page 34, line 685-687; page 42, line 791-792). Here, cell viability assay was usually used to test the toxicity of chemicals under different concentrations. JM03 showed cell viability increase over 100% in 200 μM but we didn’t observe obvious cell death through light field microscopy. We really agree that it’s better to limit the claims stating that no toxicity was observed. As showed in Figure 5a in the revised manuscript, both Cro and JM03 have no toxicity in MRC-5 cells under the tested concentrations (page 5, line 95-96; page 10, line 186-187).</p><p>For further mechanism study of JM03 in MRC-5 cells, we selected the concentration of 400 μM which has no toxicity and viability increasing effects to perform a qPCR assay. As showed in Figure 5b in the revised manuscript, proteostasis related genes (<italic>Psmb1, Hsf1, Clusterin, Nrf2, Keap1, Nqo1 and Txnrd1</italic>) were tested and the results demonstrated JM03 indeed upregulated antioxidant genes which is accord with the mechanisms in worms (page 10, line 187-190).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors then carry out chemical lead optimization and try to establish a mechanism of action. Beyond some questions regarding the power of some of these studies (see minor comments), I think the structural optimization is convincing and a strong point of this manuscript – although I cannot comment on the chemistry here.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this encouraging comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In terms of the mode of action, the evidence remains somewhat circumstantial. Yes, JM03 does not seem to further extend the lifespan of (long-lived) osm-9 KD animals -but that does not prove that it directly binds OSM9. Some further support would be useful here. For example, the authors might carry out RNAseq comparing osm-9 KD and WT with and without JM03 treatment. Of course, direct confirmation of binding would be ideal but is also hard.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your helpful suggestion.
