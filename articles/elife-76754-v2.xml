the mammalian genomes in a tissue- and cell-specific manner. The identity of REST target genes and molecular details of how REST regulates them are emerging. We performed conditional null deletion of <italic>Rest</italic> (cKO), mainly restricted to murine hair cells (HCs) and auditory neurons (aka spiral ganglion neurons [SGNs]). Null inactivation of full-length REST did not affect the development of normal HCs and SGNs but manifested as progressive hearing loss in adult mice. We found that the inactivation of REST resulted in an increased abundance of K<sub>v</sub>7.4 channels at the transcript, protein, and functional levels. Specifically, we found that SGNs and HCs from <italic>Rest</italic> cKO mice displayed increased K<sub>v</sub>7.4 expression and augmented K<sub>v</sub>7 currents; SGN’s excitability was also significantly reduced. Administration of a compound with K<sub>v</sub>7.4 channel activator activity, fasudil, recapitulated progressive hearing loss in mice. In contrast, inhibition of the K<sub>v</sub>7 channels by XE991 rescued the auditory phenotype of <italic>Rest</italic> cKO mice. Previous studies identified some loss-of-function mutations within the K<sub>v</sub>7.4-coding gene, <italic>Kcnq4</italic>, as a causative factor for progressive hearing loss in mice and humans. Thus, the findings reveal that a critical homeostatic K<sub>v</sub>7.4 channel level is required for proper auditory functions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mouse</kwd><kwd>human</kwd><kwd>hearing loss</kwd><kwd>repressor element</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC015135</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yamoah</surname><given-names>Ebenezer N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG060504-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yamoah</surname><given-names>Ebenezer N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC016099</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yamoah</surname><given-names>Ebenezer N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01 AG051443</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yamoah</surname><given-names>Ebenezer N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In the cochlea, repressor element 1-silencing transcription factor (REST) regulates the expression levels of K<sub>v</sub>7.4 and alterations of REST functions result in progressive hearing loss.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The repressor element 1-silencing transcription factor (REST), also known as neuronal restriction-silencing factor (NRSF), is a transcriptional repressor that binds a specific 21 bp consensus sequence named repressor element 1 (RE-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chong et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schoenherr and Anderson, 1995</xref>). REST recruits multiple chromatin remodeling factors through its DNA-binding domain to form a repressor complex, ultimately repressing the transcription of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ooi and Wood, 2007</xref>). REST is expressed in embryonic stem cells, neural stem cells, and non-neural cells during embryogenesis. It maintains embryonic stem cells' pluripotency and promotes stem cell differentiation and neuronal development, which are essential for neuronal diversity, plasticity, and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sun et al., 2005</xref>). In non-neuronal cells, REST maintains a non-neuronal cell gene expression pattern by suppressing the expression of neural-related genes through histone deacetylation, chromatin remodeling, and methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 1998</xref>). Recent studies suggest that the role of REST expands beyond neuronal development. There are nearly 2000 genes containing predicted REST binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bruce et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Johnson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Seki et al., 2014</xref>), and up to 90% of these REST target genes are tissue- and cell-type-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bruce et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hohl and Thiel, 2005</xref>). As a result, REST is involved in numerous physiological and pathological processes. For example, REST was suggested to have a neuroprotective role in Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lu et al., 2014</xref>). Upregulation of REST in peripheral somatosensory neurons was shown to contribute to the development of neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rose et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, longevity in humans was associated with REST upregulation and repression of neuronal excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zullo et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Cochlear hair cells (HCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) play essential roles in transmitting auditory signals. Inner hair cells (IHCs) convert mechanical stimuli into electrochemical signals transmitted to and conducted along auditory nerve fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ó Maoiléidigh and Ricci, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fettiplace, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yu and Goodrich, 2014</xref>). In contrast, outer hair cells (OHCs) act as mechanical amplifiers that enhance the sensitivity to weak sounds in the cochlea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dallos et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liberman et al., 2002</xref>). SGNs are at the bottleneck between HCs and the brain, preserving sound information’s amplitude, frequency, and temporal features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meyer and Moser, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Taberner and Liberman, 2005</xref>). Since HCs and SGNs in the mature mammalian cochlea do not regenerate, their damage or dysfunction leads to permanent sensorineural hearing loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fujioka et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>A recent study reported that the exon 4-containing REST splice variant (<italic>Rest<sup>4</sup></italic>) is expressed in cochlear HCs and that its deletion results in abnormally high REST expression and is associated with DFNA27 hearing loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakano et al., 2018</xref>). Yet, the role of the full-length REST in hearing is still unknown. We generated a mouse model with REST conditionally knocked out in the cochlea. We show that REST is expressed in cochlear HCs and SGNs of adult mice and that the conditional deletion of REST in these cells results in progressive hearing loss. No detectable loss of cochlear HCs and SGNs was found at P1–P14 during development, but significant degeneration of OHCs and SGNs was detected at 3 months. Examination of the function of HCs and SGNs showed that K<sub>v</sub>7.4 channel expression was upregulated, reducing SGNs’ excitability. Consistently, administration of the compound with K<sub>v</sub>7.4 channel activator activity, fasudil, caused hearing loss in wild-type mice, while inhibition of the K<sub>v</sub>7 channels by XE991 rescued the hearing phenotype of <italic>Rest</italic> cKO mice. In summary, our results demonstrate that REST is essential for hearing and its deficiency causes upregulation of K<sub>v</sub>7.4 channels contributing to the dysfunction of SGNs and HCs and deafness in mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>REST is expressed in SGNs and HCs and is required for hearing</title><p>To examine the role of REST in hearing, we first examined the expression of REST in the cochlea of 1-month-old wild-type (WT) mice.

Our results suggest that 1-month-old <italic>Rest</italic> cKO mice showed no degeneration of SGNs and HCs, which indicates that enhanced K<sub>v</sub>7.4 expression/current can also lead to hearing loss. Our findings reinforce a hypothesis whereby a specific range of basal K<sub>v</sub>7.4 functional expression is necessary for good hearing. A reduction or increase outside of this safety range causes cochlear dysfunction. It is currently unclear whether the upregulation of K<sub>v</sub>7.4 and degeneration of SGNs and HCs, observed in 3-month-old <italic>Rest</italic> cKO mice, are related phenomena; this will require further investigation.

REST was first identified in the chick cochlea by RT-PCR in 2002 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Roberson et al., 2002</xref>).

The K<sub>v</sub>7 channels are widely distributed in the neurons, heart, vascular smooth muscle cells, and cochlea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brueggemann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Delmas and Brown, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jentsch, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kharkovets et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Neyroud et al., 1997</xref>). In the cochlea, K<sub>v</sub>7.4 is mainly expressed in the OHCs, IHCs, and SGNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beisel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dierich et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kharkovets et al., 2000</xref>). When expressed in heterologous expression systems, K<sub>v</sub>7.4 channels conduct slowly activating and deactivating currents that do not inactivate (i.e., as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). We noted that the XE991-sensitive currents recorded from OHCs had faster kinetics than those expected from heterologously expressed K<sub>v</sub>7.4 homo-tetramers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Hence, we suggest that OHCs may contain endogenous factors or modulators that alter the K<sub>v</sub>7.4 channel kinetics. On the other hand, currents recorded from SGNs had an ‘M-like’ slow-kinetics component, especially in neurons from <italic>Rest</italic> cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

REST regulates the expression of a variety of ion channel genes, including genes coding for HCN channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kuwahara, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McClelland et al., 2011</xref>), Na<sub>v</sub>1.2 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Armisén et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pozzi et al., 2013</xref>), K<sub>v</sub>7.2/K<sub>v</sub>7.3 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mucha et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rose et al., 2011</xref>), and T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">van Loo et al., 2012</xref>). Although some ion channel-related REST target genes were also expressed in the cochlea, our results showed that REST deletion only significantly upregulated K<sub>v</sub>7.4 channels in SGNs and HCs (amongst genes tested here, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). REST deletion specifically upregulates <italic>Kcnq4</italic> but not other RE1-containing ion channel-related genes in the cochlea that remain to be investigated. However, it is worth noting that different RE1 sites bind REST with different affinities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ooi and Wood, 2007</xref>); hence, at least some potentially REST-targeted genes may not be tonically suppressed (and, thus, not affected by REST deletion). In addition, REST could suppress additional regulators of other genes. Therefore, the outcome of REST deletion may not necessarily affect the expression of all RE1-containing genes in the same way. Moreover, the genes involved may be cell- and tissue-specific.</p><p>To verify that upregulation of K<sub>v</sub>7.4 channels can cause hearing loss, we treated mice with the compound with K<sub>v</sub>7.4 channel activator activity, fasudil. Although fasudil was initially described as a ROCK inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shi and Wei, 2013</xref>), recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2017</xref> found that fasudil selectively increased K<sub>v</sub>7.4 channel currents in dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Moreover, Zhang et al. revealed that fasudil selectively activated K<sub>v</sub>7.4 channels in vascular smooth muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). It was further demonstrated that fasudil has a selective direct opening effect on K<sub>v</sub>7.4 channels without significantly affecting other members of the K<sub>v</sub>7 channel family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). We observed increased K<sub>v</sub>7 channel currents in SGNs in mice 28 days after recurrent fasudil administration, accompanied by deafness.</p><p>It should be noted that K<sub>v</sub>7.4 channels are also expressed in neurons of the dorsal nucleus of the cochlea and the hypothalamus nucleus in the central auditory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kharkovets et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, fasudil could influence hearing by affecting K<sub>v</sub>7.4 channels in these neurons. The amplitude and latency of ABR waves, which represent the process of neural transmission in the auditory system, were measured to elucidate further the exact site of action of systemic fasudil on hearing. Fasudil administration alters waves I and II of the ABR characteristics, indicating the involvement of HCs and SGNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). The actions of fasudil are reversible upon acute application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Under the current conditions where the drug was administered chronically, we conceive that long-term and irreversible effects may ensue.</p><p>XE991, a K<sub>v</sub>7 channel blocker, was used to demonstrate that upregulation of K<sub>v</sub>7.4 channels caused by REST defects is involved in deafness in mice. Our results indicated that at low concentrations (0.25 mg/kg), XE991 significantly rescued the hearing of <italic>Rest</italic> cKO mice, while at high concentrations (0.5 mg/kg), XE991 had a more modest effect on restoring the hearing of these mice. As a certain number of K<sub>v</sub>7.4 channels is necessary to regulate cell excitability and thus maintain hearing in mice, their up- or downregulation beyond the basal range of expression would impact hearing. Therefore, we hypothesize that 0.25 mg/kg XE991 could appropriately inhibit the overexpressed K<sub>v</sub>7.4 channels in <italic>Rest</italic> cKO mice, restoring them to a ‘safe’ range. In contrast, 0.5 mg/kg XE991 may overinhibit K<sub>v</sub>7.4 channels beyond the scope in which K<sub>v</sub>7.4 channels perform their normal function and ultimately fail to improve hearing in mice. Other on- or off-target side effects of higher doses of XE991 also cannot be excluded.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings revealed that a critical homeostatic level of functional expression of the K<sub>v</sub>7.4 channel is required to maintain proper auditory functions. REST is necessary for hearing through regulating such functional expression of K<sub>v</sub>7.4. The study contributes to an understanding of the essential functions of REST in the auditory system and provides new insight into the potential future treatments of hearing disorders associated with the K<sub>v</sub>7.4 channel.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All experimental animal protocols were performed following the Animal Care and Ethical Committee of Hebei Medical University (Shijiazhuang, China).

Briefly, mice were anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). Three electrodes were inserted subcutaneously at the vertex of the head (reference), ipsilateral mastoid (recording), and contralateral rear leg of the mice (ground). At 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, and 32 kHz, click or tone stimuli were emitted from 20 dB with an attenuation interval of 5 dB. ABRs were measured using a System III workstation (Tucker Davis Technologies, Alachua, FL) in an IAC BioSigRP Sound booth (GM Instruments, Irvine, UK). The hearing threshold was defined as the lowest sound intensity required to generate a reproducible ABR waveform. Latencies of ABR waves Ⅰ and Ⅱ were measured at 70 dB click and 70 dB, 16 kHz pure-tone stimulus, respectively. Amplitudes were calculated as the peak-to-peak amplitude from the P1 or P2 peak to the next negative trough.</p><p>The DPOAE at 2f1-f2 was elicited from test mice using BioSig-RP software and a TDT system (Tucker-Davis Technologies). Five frequency points of 4, 8, 16, 28, and 32 kHz were selected to measure the 2f1-f2(f2/f1 = 1.2) to predict the auditory thresholds. Hearing thresholds were defined as the averaged signal for each identified frequency tested and compared with the corresponding frequency in the controls.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Cell culture</title><p>SGNs were isolated from the mouse’s inner ears following a detailed procedure outlined in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lv et al., 2010</xref>). Mice at various ages were humanely sacrificed, and the temporal bones were removed. The dissecting solution contained minimum essential medium (MEM) with Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.2 g/L kynurenic acid, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS; v/v), and glucose (6 g/L). The SGN tissue was dissected and split into two segments: the apex and the base across the modiolar axis. The two-segment tissue was digested separately in an enzyme mixture containing collagenase type I (1 mg/mL) and DNase (1 mg/mL) at 37°C for 15 min.

In differentiating neurons and hair cells (HCs), REST activity is downregulated. In most neurons, transcriptional repression of Rest is the primary mechanism underlying the downregulation of REST activity. In HCs, regulated splicing of an alternative exon into the Rest mRNA is the main mechanism by which REST activity in suppressed. Based on these, one would expect to find minimal expression of Rest in SGNs; however, Zhang and colleagues show strong REST immunostaining in SGNs (Figure 1A). HCs were not tested for REST protein expression by the authors, but they used single cell RT–PCR to evaluate Rest mRNA expression, and they detected Rest in both HCs and SGNs (Figure 1B). These data should be supported by robust controls. For example, the Rest cKO mice could be used to test the specificity of REST immunostaining in SGNs. A similar experimental design is recommended for testing the expression of REST in HCs. The location of the epitope of the anti–REST antibody within the target protein is also an important (and not provided) piece of information because alternative splicing is predicted to prevent the expression of the C–terminal half of REST (encoded by exon 5) but not the N–terminal half. Notably, Rest contains 5 exons, not 4 exons; the latter number is stated erroneously in the manuscript at multiple places.</p><p>Figure 1 related: The authors' single cell RT–PCR data would be more informative if the Rest primers were designed from 2 different exons and not from the same exon (all of the Rest RT–PCR primers are designed from exon 5 in this study). If the primers were designed from different exons, amplification of the genomic DNA could be ruled out. In Figure 1B and Methods, there is no control included to test whether the RT–PCR products are amplicons of mRNA or genomic DNA. The authors' primers are also not suitable to test the splicing of Rest. Using these primers, the generated RT–PCR products will not differ in size regardless of whether the alternative exon of Rest (i.e., exon 4) is spliced into the mRNA or not. Therefore, the generated amplicons cannot indicate whether the expressed mRNA encodes a functional REST protein or a non–functional REST that is &quot;truncated&quot; by the previously described alternative splicing of exon 4 of Rest.</p><p>Related to Figure 1–9: Tg(Atoh1–Cre) expression is not completely specific to HCs within the organ of Corti. This is not a problem if the effect of Tg(Atoh1–Cre)–dependent gene deletion is robust (e.g., widespread loss of HCs). In contrast, when the HC loss is mild (like in this study), a significant concern is that Tg(Atoh1–Cre) is expressed in some % of supporting cells (see Figures 6 and 7 in PMID: 16145671). Data in this manuscript do not rule out the possibility that much of the HC loss and hearing loss of Rest cKO mice are caused by the deletion of Rest in some % of supporting cells in the organ of Corti.</p><p>Related to Figure 1–9: What % of SGNs express Tg(Atoh1–Cre)?</p><p>Related to Figure 1: The authors state that &quot;both heterozygous and homozygous Rest knockout mice showed a significant increase in the ABR threshold (as compared to WT)&quot;. The authors analyzed the hearing loss of Rest +/cKO (i.e., heterozygous) mice only at a very early time (i.e., 1–2 months). In this age range, the reported hearing loss is mild and not entirely convincing. The demonstration of hearing loss of Rest +/cKO mice would be an important piece of new information because these mice are potentially useful to model the disorders of human subjects who are heterozygous for REST–inactivating mutations. Therefore, it would be valuable to determine the hearing thresholds (click and pure tone) of Rest +/cKO mice at precise timepoints (at 3 and 4 months) when hearing loss is perhaps more robust than in the 1–2 months age range.</p><p>Related to Figure 7: The authors suggest that the Kv7.4 activator effect of fasudil is contrary to its Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitory activity: &quot;Fasudil was initially described as a Rho–associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor. However, recently Li and colleagues found that fasudil selectively increased Kv7.4 channel currents…&quot; (Discussion section). It is unclear why the authors contrast these two effects of fasudil; both effects are supported by multiple studies: fasudil inhibits ROCK and activates Kv7.4. It seems to be important to state both effects of fasudil at the first mention of this compound in the text.</p><p>Related to Figure 7: A previous study reported that the Kv7.4–activating effect of fasudil rapidly diminishes after the washout of this drug (PMID: 27677924). Therefore, it would be important that the authors clarify/discuss the mechanism by which in–vivo administered fasudil could affect K<sup>+</sup> currents in SGNs that were cultured for 24–48 h after isolation from fasudil–injected mice (Figure 7C–I).</p><p>Figure 5—figure supplement 3 shows that overexpressed REST suppresses the expression of plasmid–encoded Kcnq4 (i.e., Kv7.4) in CHO cells. The Kcnq4–encoding plasmid is not described in the manuscript, and it is unclear whether it contains REST binding sites.</p><p>Related to Figure 8 and 9: The strongest presented evidence for the hearing loss–causing effect of abnormally high Kv7.4 expression is the XE991–dependent (partial) rescue of hearing in Rest cKO mice. This is a nice experiment but it does not reveal whether XE991 acts on the cells of interest (HCs and SGNs) and on the protein of interest (i.e., Kv7.4) to achieve the improvement in hearing. Ideally, a genetic approach should be used to support the Kv7.4–related conclusion of the study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Progressive hearing loss and cellular deterioration: As indicated above, I found the argument that progressive loss and deterioration of the sort seen in 3 month REST kno as being due to loss of Kv7 to be less convincing. I would have found this second point to be more convincing if the experiments with Kv7 current enhancer fasudil had also shown cellular deterioration like that in the REST knockouts. The data presented in the supplementary figures show that this is not the case, at least not over the timeline of the present experiments. Perhaps the deterioration would take longer than the 28 days over which fasudil was administered but no data was presented to argue this point. Alternatively, knocking out REST may do more than enhance Kv7 currents. More careful handling of this issue is needed.</p><p>I also found the term 'hearing loss' in reference to the elevated ABR and DPOAE thresholds to be somewhat unsatisfying. The term does not capture the full impact of enhancing Kv7 channels. Indeed, the ABR responses in the REST knockout (1 month) or fasudil enhanced Kv7 model are robust, with large peaks and multiple waves clearly visible, albeit with elevated thresholds. I wonder, for example, if the desensitized cochlea (with elevated thresholds) has a compressed dynamic range, greater synchrony, and shorter latencies? Similarly, in the case with Kv7 channels blocked, what are the broad response features of the 'sensitized' cochlea. I found this aspect of the data to be interesting but unaddressed. I would have liked to see a more complete analysis of the ABR waves amplitude and latency as a function of stimulus intensity to determine if there is also a difference in the level dependence that would better indicate the hearing status of these mouse models.</p><p>Overall, the experiments are nicely done and the data is presented clearly. However, I found the use of extensive figure supplements with minimal description to be confusing. The going back and forth between the main and supplement figures took away from the otherwise clear presentation of data. The authors should consider integrating the necessary figure supplements into the main figures and reducing the number of supplementary figures to those that are essential.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Recommendations to be addressed:</p><p>– The whole paragraph 125–137 is very confusing in the wording between knock–out mice and conditional knock–out mice. The paragraph should clearly state that:</p><p>i) First ABRs were recorded in knock–out mice…</p><p>ii) We then recorded in ABRs in conditional knock–out mice…</p><p>For instance, the use of &quot;further&quot; in line131 is misleading because it gives the impression we are dealing with the same mice whereas it is not the case. Similarly, what are Rest–homozygous mice? I suppose they are Rest knock–out mice?</p><p>– While reading the manuscript, I thought the authors could better insist on the OHC deficits and their relationship to the hearing loss observed. The authors insist very much on the SGN excitability deficits. However, these deficits are already present in 1 month old mice with a similar severity to 3 month old mutant mice although ABR thresholds are still normal at 1 month of age. A likely explanation is rather the DPOAE deficit at three months of age that becomes very strong compared to one month. To better disentangle these phenomena, the authors should analyze the amplitude of wave–1and its timing in Rest cKO mice based on their already acquired data. If these parameters are normal at one month of age, it suggests that the most dramatic phenotype relies on OHCs. Alternatively, wave–1 amplitude could be altered (with normal auditory threshold). In that case, it would show that both the OHC and SGN deficits cumulatively contribute to the hearing impairment. In addition, Kcnq4 playing on the excitability of SGNs, one would expect the timing of wave–1 to be altered.</p><p>Depending on these analysis, the authors should better discuss the relative contribution of SGN and OHCs to the auditory phenotype.</p><p>– Line373: The statement &quot;the exact site of action of systemic fasudil on hearing requires further elucidation&quot; is not satisfactory. As mentioned earlier, by analyzing wave 1 amplitude and timing in their signal, the authors could specifically address whether fasudil affects HCs and SGNs. Expression of Kv7.4 in the dorsal cochlear nucleus is not expected to affect the ABR signal before Wave–II. Please better discuss this point after analyzing these parameters in the datasets.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Repressor element 1–silencing transcription factor deficiency yields profound hearing loss through K<sub>v</sub>7.4 channel upsurge in auditory neurons and hair cells&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Kathryn Cheah (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The reviewers agree that the manuscript has been improved and will make a valuable contribution to the field. However, there are several remaining issues that need to be addressed, concerning both presentation and interpretation of the data, as outlined below. Please address these concerns, and make sure that any figures used in the rebuttal have also been added to the manuscript, as requested by Reviewer 1. Reviewer 2 also suggests that you may wish to consider moving some of the supplementary material into the main figures. Reviewer 3 also lists a number of typos to be corrected.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors of this manuscript conclude that genetic inactivation of Rest in hair cells (HCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) cause progressive hearing loss by upregulating the expression of Kv7.4 in the two cell types (&quot;Repressor element 1–silencing transcription factor deficiency yields profound hearing loss through Kv7.4 channel upsurge in auditory neurons and hair cells&quot;). This conclusion is not fully supported by the presented data because the utilized Cre–expressing transgene and some of the key activators/inhibitors in the study are not sufficiently selective to draw a definitive conclusion: (1) The Atoh1–Cre transgene, which was used for the generation of Rest cKO mice in the study, is expressed not only in HCs and SGNs but also in many non–HCs and non–SGNs in the cochlea. This transgene is an excellent tool for many purposes but it is not ideal to determine the effects of SGN/HC specific deletion of Rest on hearing because Rest is expressed in non–HCs and non–SGNs in the hearing organ. (2) Fasudil, which was used for the activation of Kv7.4 in the study, is not a Kv7.4 specific drug; it also binds to (and inhibits) Rho–associated kinases. Thus, the hearing loss of fasudil–injected mice may not be caused by the activation of Kv7.4 but by the inhibition of Rho–associated kinases. (3) XE991 is not a specific inhibitor of Kv7.4, it also inhibits other Kv7 channels. Therefore, it is unclear whether the 10–15 dB improvement in the hearing threshold of XE991–treated Rest cKO mice is caused by the inhibition of Kv7.4 or other Kv7 channels. In summary, the authors' overall conclusion is not entirely convincing because much of their data can be interpreted differently than specified in the manuscript.</p><p>In the authors' rebuttal letter (and in the manuscript), one unvalidated data interpretation is used to support another unvalidated interpretation; e.g., in the 3rd answer to reviewer–1, the authors view upregulation of Kv7.4 as a proven cause (as opposed to a 'possible cause') of hearing impairment in Rest cKO mice and use this to state that the hearing loss–relevant deletion of Rest must have been in HCs and/or SGNs because other cochlear cells do not express Kv7.4. This kind of reasoning goes awry easily.</p><p>The authors show the ABR thresholds (click and pure tone) of 3–4 months old Rest Het mice in the rebuttal letter but not in the actual manuscript. It would be more useful to the readers if these figure panels were added to the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. One of the most interesting aspects of this data set was the patch–clamping data showing enhanced expression of Kv7 currents in Rest cKO mice and the accompanying changes in ABR thresholds at 1M of age, before the onset of obvious cell deterioration. This combined with the experiments showing partial recovery of thresholds using the Kv7 blocker xe991 was the strongest indication that modulation of this particular ion channel was shaping hearing sensitivity, even in the absence of cell death. I had urged the authors to examine the stimulus level–dependent changes in ABR amplitudes and latencies to more fully characterize the hearing status under these different manipulations, hoping that this would help disentangle the impact of cell deterioration versus enhancement of Kv7 currents on the hearing loss phenotype. The authors have partially satisfied that request by providing more ABR data in supplements. However, by providing this analysis at a fixed level and with little further discussion, the authors missed the point…which was to test if there were differences in how the amplitude and latencies grow with stimulus intensity which might have indicated interesting differences in ABR morphology that could be attributed to the increase/decrease in phasic firing in Rest KO or XE199 manipulations. As currently presented in the text, the new ABR data does little to interpret the finding further.</p><p>2. Is elevation in Kv7 currents neuroprotective or does this lead to cellular deterioration? Lines 297–306 in the discussion left me with the impression that the authors are arguing that overexpression of Kv7 currents can cause a similar degeneration in cochlear cells as previously shown due to loss of function mutations in Kv7.4. This is perhaps not what the authors intended, because they agreed in their response to my original review that knocking out REST may cause cellular deterioration from multiple pathways and that the fasudil manipulation did not show cellular deterioration. Thus, these studies cannot determine if the cellular degeneration noted in the 3–4 month Rest KO mouse is due to overexpression of Kv7…so the question of whether Kv7 may be neuroprotective cannot be addressed here. I'd recommend a careful revision of this paragraph to avoid conflating elevation in threshold that they may attribute to the enhancement of Kv7 from that which may result from overall cellular damage.</p><p>3. The reduced recovery of thresholds for the higher dose of Xe991 is counterintuitive. Why doesn't the higher concentration of XE991 restore thresholds and only at lower frequencies as did the lower concentration? Rather than addressing what seems counterintuitive to me, the authors assert that there is an improvement in threshold and gloss over what seems to be only a partial rescue at the higher dose. Some sort of discussion of this is needed…for example is there some balance between synchrony and excitability that may produce this result? It will be important to do this since the rescue with the blocker is one of the most convincing pieces of data in this study.</p><p>4. Problem with the summary figure shown in figure 9. The schematic shows an OHC providing direct input to Type I auditory neurons. Since the input from OHCs to most of the auditory nerve is indirectly coupled through fluid mechanics, this figure could be misconstrued as meaning otherwise. Please revise to avoid such confusion. Alternatively, remove the figure.</p><p>5. I still found several supplementary figures to be disruptive to the presentation of the material.

In differentiating neurons and hair cells (HCs), REST activity is downregulated. In most neurons, transcriptional repression of Rest is the primary mechanism underlying the downregulation of REST activity. In HCs, regulated splicing of an alternative exon into the Rest mRNA is the main mechanism by which REST activity in suppressed. Based on these, one would expect to find minimal expression of Rest in SGNs; however, Zhang and colleagues show strong REST immunostaining in SGNs (Figure 1A). HCs were not tested for REST protein expression by the authors, but they used single cell RT–PCR to evaluate Rest mRNA expression, and they detected Rest in both HCs and SGNs (Figure 1B). These data should be supported by robust controls. For example, the Rest cKO mice could be used to test the specificity of REST immunostaining in SGNs. A similar experimental design is recommended for testing the expression of REST in HCs. The location of the epitope of the anti–REST antibody within the target protein is also an important (and not provided) piece of information because alternative splicing is predicted to prevent the expression of the C–terminal half of REST (encoded by exon 5) but not the N–terminal half. Notably, Rest contains 5 exons, not 4 exons; the latter number is stated erroneously in the manuscript at multiple places.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion.

If the primers were designed from different exons, amplification of the genomic DNA could be ruled out. In Figure 1B and Methods, there is no control included to test whether the RT–PCR products are amplicons of mRNA or genomic DNA. The authors' primers are also not suitable to test the splicing of Rest. Using these primers, the generated RT–PCR products will not differ in size regardless of whether the alternative exon of Rest (i.e., exon 4) is spliced into the mRNA or not. Therefore, the generated amplicons cannot indicate whether the expressed mRNA encodes a functional REST protein or a non–functional REST that is &quot;truncated&quot; by the previously described alternative splicing of exon 4 of Rest.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with your comments. Our primers read from a single exon, and the amplification from the genomic DNA cannot be ruled out.

This is not a problem if the effect of Tg(Atoh1–Cre)–dependent gene deletion is robust (e.g., widespread loss of HCs). In contrast, when the HC loss is mild (like in this study), a significant concern is that Tg(Atoh1–Cre) is expressed in some % of supporting cells (see Figures 6 and 7 in PMID: 16145671).

I would have found this second point to be more convincing if the experiments with Kv7 current enhancer fasudil had also shown cellular deterioration like that in the REST knockouts. The data presented in the supplementary figures show that this is not the case, at least not over the timeline of the present experiments. Perhaps the deterioration would take longer than the 28 days over which fasudil was administered but no data was presented to argue this point. Alternatively, knocking out REST may do more than enhance Kv7 currents. More careful handling of this issue is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agreed with your comments. Since we only administered fasudil for 28 days, we could not determine if the extended administration time caused cellular deterioration.

The term does not capture the full impact of enhancing Kv7 channels. Indeed, the ABR responses in the REST knockout (1 month) or fasudil enhanced Kv7 model are robust, with large peaks and multiple waves clearly visible, albeit with elevated thresholds. I wonder, for example, if the desensitized cochlea (with elevated thresholds) has a compressed dynamic range, greater synchrony, and shorter latencies? Similarly, in the case with Kv7 channels blocked, what are the broad response features of the 'sensitized' cochlea. I found this aspect of the data to be interesting but unaddressed. I would have liked to see a more complete analysis of the ABR waves amplitude and latency as a function of stimulus intensity to determine if there is also a difference in the level dependence that would better indicate the hearing status of these mouse models.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments.

The authors insist very much on the SGN excitability deficits. However, these deficits are already present in 1 month old mice with a similar severity to 3 month old mutant mice although ABR thresholds are still normal at 1 month of age. A likely explanation is rather the DPOAE deficit at three months of age that becomes very strong compared to one month. To better disentangle these phenomena, the authors should analyze the amplitude of wave–1and its timing in Rest cKO mice based on their already acquired data. If these parameters are normal at one month of age, it suggests that the most dramatic phenotype relies on OHCs. Alternatively, wave–1 amplitude could be altered (with normal auditory threshold). In that case, it would show that both the OHC and SGN deficits cumulatively contribute to the hearing impairment. In addition, Kcnq4 playing on the excitability of SGNs, one would expect the timing of wave–1 to be altered.</p><p>Depending on these analysis, the authors should better discuss the relative contribution of SGN and OHCs to the auditory phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments.

However, there are several remaining issues that need to be addressed, concerning both presentation and interpretation of the data, as outlined below. Please address these concerns, and make sure that any figures used in the rebuttal have also been added to the manuscript, as requested by Reviewer 1. Reviewer 2 also suggests that you may wish to consider moving some of the supplementary material into the main figures. Reviewer 3 also lists a number of typos to be corrected.</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors of this manuscript conclude that genetic inactivation of Rest in hair cells (HCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) cause progressive hearing loss by upregulating the expression of Kv7.4 in the two cell types (&quot;Repressor element 1–silencing transcription factor deficiency yields profound hearing loss through Kv7.4 channel upsurge in auditory neurons and hair cells&quot;). This conclusion is not fully supported by the presented data because the utilized Cre–expressing transgene and some of the key activators/inhibitors in the study are not sufficiently selective to draw a definitive conclusion: (1) The Atoh1–Cre transgene, which was used for the generation of Rest cKO mice in the study, is expressed not only in HCs and SGNs but also in many non–HCs and non–SGNs in the cochlea. This transgene is an excellent tool for many purposes but it is not ideal to determine the effects of SGN/HC specific deletion of Rest on hearing because Rest is expressed in non–HCs and non–SGNs in the hearing organ. (2) Fasudil, which was used for the activation of Kv7.4 in the study, is not a Kv7.4 specific drug; it also binds to (and inhibits) Rho–associated kinases. Thus, the hearing loss of fasudil–injected mice may not be caused by the activation of Kv7.4 but by the inhibition of Rho–associated kinases. (3) XE991 is not a specific inhibitor of Kv7.4, it also inhibits other Kv7 channels. Therefore, it is unclear whether the 10–15 dB improvement in the hearing threshold of XE991–treated Rest cKO mice is caused by the inhibition of Kv7.4 or other Kv7 channels. In summary, the authors' overall conclusion is not entirely convincing because much of their data can be interpreted differently than specified in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's concerns and agree with most of the above arguments. In the revised manuscript, we have acknowledged these limitations of the approaches taken. Yet, we think that our conclusion that REST deficiency impairs hearing via Kv7.4 upregulation is still the most likely explanation for our results.</p><p>1) As mentioned by the reviewer, atoh1 is not only expressed in SGNs and HCs but also in some supporting cells of the organ of Corti. Therefore, to determine whether supporting cells are involved in the hearing loss caused by <italic>Rest</italic> deletion, we examined the morphology of cochlear cells in 1- and 3-month-old WT and Rest cKO mice by HE staining. We did not find morphological abnormalities in the supporting cells (Data not shown in the manuscript). Although these results cannot completely rule out the possibility that deletion of <italic>Rest</italic> in support cells may also be involved in deafness, our current data are consistent with the hypothesis that SGNs and HCs are the main cell types contributing to hearing loss in <italic>Rest</italic> cKO mice.</p><p>2) Fasudil, a compound with Kv7.4 channel activator activity, also has an inhibitory effect on Rho-associated kinases. Recently, fasudil was found to prevent neomycin-induced hair cell damage by inhibiting the Rho/Rock signaling pathway, suggesting a cell protective effect as a Rock inhibitor (PMID: 31780893). Moreover, Seiji Kakehata's group did show that ROCK inhibition attenuated cochlear synaptic damage and exerted cytoprotective effects (PMID: 34217338, PMID: 33328888). In our study, injection of fasudil induced hearing loss in mice with increased Kv7 current in SGNs and HCs. Therefore, we reasoned that it might be caused by activation of the Kv7.4 channel rather than inhibition of Rock. Yet, the effect of the Rho pathway cannot be ruled out, which is now acknowledged.</p><p>3) In the cochlea, Kv7.1 is expressed in the marginal cells of the stria vascularis, Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 channels are present in the SGNs, and Kv7.4, one of the critical ion channels that regulate auditory signal, is mainly expressed in the SGNs and HCs. Since marginal cells in the stria vascularis have not been found to express Atoh1 (PMID: 20533400), specific deletion of <italic>Rest</italic> should not affect Kv7.1. Moreover, our results show that Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 in SGNs were not upregulated in <italic>Rest</italic> cKO mice. Therefore, we reasoned that XE991 improved hearing in <italic>Rest</italic> cKO mice, likely through inhibition of Kv7.4 channels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the authors' rebuttal letter (and in the manuscript), one unvalidated data interpretation is used to support another unvalidated interpretation; e.g., in the 3rd answer to reviewer–1, the authors view upregulation of Kv7.4 as a proven cause (as opposed to a 'possible cause') of hearing impairment in Rest cKO mice and use this to state that the hearing loss–relevant deletion of Rest must have been in HCs and/or SGNs because other cochlear cells do not express Kv7.4. This kind of reasoning goes awry easily.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the poor choice of words to answer this question in the previous review comments. As mentioned by the reviewer, Atoh1 is widely expressed in cochlear; deletion of <italic>Rest</italic> is not limited to HC and SGN but also includes some supporting cells.

One of the most interesting aspects of this data set was the patch–clamping data showing enhanced expression of Kv7 currents in Rest cKO mice and the accompanying changes in ABR thresholds at 1M of age, before the onset of obvious cell deterioration. This combined with the experiments showing partial recovery of thresholds using the Kv7 blocker xe991 was the strongest indication that modulation of this particular ion channel was shaping hearing sensitivity, even in the absence of cell death. I had urged the authors to examine the stimulus level–dependent changes in ABR amplitudes and latencies to more fully characterize the hearing status under these different manipulations, hoping that this would help disentangle the impact of cell deterioration versus enhancement of Kv7 currents on the hearing loss phenotype. The authors have partially satisfied that request by providing more ABR data in supplements. However, by providing this analysis at a fixed level and with little further discussion, the authors missed the point…which was to test if there were differences in how the amplitude and latencies grow with stimulus intensity which might have indicated interesting differences in ABR morphology that could be attributed to the increase/decrease in phasic firing in Rest KO or XE199 manipulations. As currently presented in the text, the new ABR data does little to interpret the finding further.</p></disp-quote><p>We are very sorry for misinterpreting the previous review comments regarding further analysis of the ABR data. We have re-examined the stimulus level-dependent changes in ABR amplitudes and latencies in <italic>Rest</italic> cKO, XE991, and fasudil-treated mice. Our results showed that compared to WT mice, 1-month-old <italic>Rest</italic> cKO mice displayed stimulus level-dependent decreases in amplitudes and increases in latencies of ABR waves I and II, which was more pronounced in 3-month-old mice, suggesting a gradual decline in the hearing status of the <italic>Rest</italic> cKO mice (figure 1-supplementary figure 2). Fasudil treatment mice displayed shorter amplitudes and longer latencies of waves I and II, suggesting that fasudil might cause auditory nerve processing dysfunction (figure 7-supplementary figure 1). Moreover, increased amplitudes and decreased latencies of ABR waves I and II were shown in <italic>Rest</italic> cKO mice treated with 0.25 mg/kg XE991, indicating an improvement in their hearing (figure 8-supplementary figure 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Is elevation in Kv7 currents neuroprotective or does this lead to cellular deterioration? Lines 297–306 in the discussion left me with the impression that the authors are arguing that overexpression of Kv7 currents can cause a similar degeneration in cochlear cells as previously shown due to loss of function mutations in Kv7.4. This is perhaps not what the authors intended, because they agreed in their response to my original review that knocking out REST may cause cellular deterioration from multiple pathways and that the fasudil manipulation did not show cellular deterioration. Thus, these studies cannot determine if the cellular degeneration noted in the 3–4 month Rest KO mouse is due to overexpression of Kv7…so the question of whether Kv7 may be neuroprotective cannot be addressed here. I'd recommend a careful revision of this paragraph to avoid conflating elevation in threshold that they may attribute to the enhancement of Kv7 from that which may result from overall cellular damage.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion; we have now revised this discussion paragraph. We proposed that upregulation of Kv7.4 channels is an important cause of hearing loss in 1-month-old <italic>Rest</italic> cKO mice in the absence of degeneration of SGN and HC. In contrast, 3-month-old <italic>Rest</italic> cKO mice showed significant SGN and HC deficits, and whether the upregulation of Kv7.4 channels caused them requires further experimental evidence in the future (lines 328-340).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The reduced recovery of thresholds for the higher dose of Xe991 is counterintuitive. Why doesn't the higher concentration of XE991 restore thresholds and only at lower frequencies as did the lower concentration? Rather than addressing what seems counterintuitive to me, the authors assert that there is an improvement in threshold and gloss over what seems to be only a partial rescue at the higher dose. Some sort of discussion of this is needed…for example is there some balance between synchrony and excitability that may produce this result? It will be important to do this since the rescue with the blocker is one of the most convincing pieces of data in this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. Yes, our results showed that low concentrations (0.25mg/kg) of XE991 significantly rescued hearing in <italic>Rest</italic> cKO mice, while higher concentrations (0.5mg/kg) of XE991 can only partially restore hearing in these mice. To discuss this apparent inconsistency, we have added the following Discussion. &quot;XE991, a K<sub>v</sub>7 channel blocker, was used to demonstrate that upregulation of K<sub>v</sub>7.4 channels caused by REST defects is involved in deafness in mice. Our results indicated that at low concentrations (0.25 mg/kg), XE991 significantly rescued the hearing of <italic>Rest</italic> cKO mice, while at high concentrations (0.5 mg/kg) XE991 had a more modest effect on restoring the hearing of these mice. As a certain number of Kv7.4 channels is necessary to regulate cell excitability and thus maintain hearing in mice, their up or downregulation beyond the basal range of expression would impact hearing. Therefore, we hypothesize that 0.25 mg/kg XE991 could appropriately inhibit the overexpressed K<sub>v</sub>7.4 channels in <italic>Rest</italic> cKO mice, restoring them to a &quot;safe&quot; range.</p><p>In contrast, 0.5 mg/kg XE991 may over-inhibit K<sub>v</sub>7.4 channels beyond the range in which K<sub>v</sub>7.4 channels perform their normal function and fail to improve hearing in mice completely.
