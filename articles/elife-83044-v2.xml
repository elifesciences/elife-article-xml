scale. These oscillations are coupled to the phase of breathing cycles in several brain areas, possibly reflecting local computations driven by sensory inputs sampled at each breath. Here, we investigated the mechanisms and functions of gamma oscillations in the piriform (olfactory) cortex of awake mice to understand their dependence on breathing and how they relate to local spiking activity. Mechanistically, we find that respiration drives gamma oscillations in the piriform cortex, which correlate with local feedback inhibition and result from recurrent connections between local excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations. Moreover, respiration-driven gamma oscillations are triggered by the activation of mitral/tufted cells in the olfactory bulb and are abolished during ketamine/xylazine anesthesia. Functionally, we demonstrate that they locally segregate neuronal assemblies through a winner-take-all computation leading to sparse odor coding during each breathing cycle. Our results shed new light on the mechanisms of gamma oscillations, bridging computation, cognition, and physiology.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The cerebral cortex is the most recently evolved region of the mammalian brain. There, millions of neurons can synchronize their activity to create brain waves, a series of electric rhythms associated with various cognitive functions. Gamma waves, for example, are thought to be linked to brain processes which require distributed networks of neurons to communicate and integrate information.</p><p>These waves were first discovered in the 1940s by researchers investigating brain areas involved in olfaction, and they are thought to be important for detecting and recognizing smells. Yet, scientists still do not understand how these waves are generated or what role they play in sensing odors.</p><p>To investigate these questions, González et al. used a battery of computational approaches to analyze a large dataset of brain activity from awake mice. This revealed that, in the cortical region dedicated to olfaction, gamma waves arose each time the animals completed a breathing cycle – that is, after they had sampled the air by breathing in. Each breath was followed by certain neurons relaying olfactory information to the cortex to activate complex cell networks; this included circuits of cells known as feedback interneurons, which can switch off weakly activated neurons, including ones that participated in activating them in the first place. The respiration-driven gamma waves derived from this ‘feedback inhibition’ mechanism.</p><p>Further work then examined the role of the waves in olfaction. Smell identification relies on each odor activating a unique set of cortical neurons. The analyses showed that gamma waves acted to select and amplify the best set of neurons for representing the odor sensed during a sniff, and to quieten less relevant neurons.</p><p>Loss of smell is associated with many conditions which affect the brain, such as Alzheimer’s disease or COVID-19. By shedding light on the neuronal mechanisms that underpin olfaction, the work by González et al. could help to better understand how these impairments emerge, and how the brain processes other types of complex information.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neural oscillations</kwd><kwd>breathing</kwd><kwd>cell assemblies</kwd><kwd>sparse coding</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>winner-take-all</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003593</institution-id><institution>Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tort</surname><given-names>Adriano BL</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002322</institution-id><institution>Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tort</surname><given-names>Adriano BL</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006049</institution-id><institution>Comisión Sectorial de Investigación Científica</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I+D grupos 2022- group ID-883465</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gonzalez</surname><given-names>Joaquin</given-names></name><name><surname>Torterolo</surname><given-names>Pablo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Computational analyses of in-vivo cerebral activity show that gamma oscillations in the olfactory cortex originate from local feedback inhibition following each sniff and serve to segregate competing odor representations through a winner-take-all process, providing an optimal window to decode odor.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Since the pioneer works of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adrian, 1942</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bressler and Freeman, 1980</xref>, gamma oscillations have been one of the most studied brain rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bastos et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bastos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bragin et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buzsáki and Wang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Csicsvari et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Fries et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Gray et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sirota et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vinck et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Womelsdorf et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Womelsdorf et al., 2006</xref>). Gamma is believed to be critical for a variety of cognitive functions such as sensory processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Fries et al., 2001</xref>), memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fernández-Ruiz et al., 2021</xref>), navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Colgin et al., 2009</xref>), and conscious awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rodriguez et al., 1999</xref>). At the cellular scale, gamma rhythms modulate spiking activity, shaping the formation of transient neuronal partnerships, the so-called cell assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buzsáki, 2010</xref>). Computational models show that gamma depends on local inhibitory-inhibitory or excitatory-inhibitory interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tort et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang and Rinzel, 1992</xref>) and ultimately emerges from synchronous inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buzsáki and Wang, 2012</xref>). However, despite the initial evidence for their underlying principles being general, gamma oscillations are not a monolithic entity but actually encompass a diversity of rhythms observed experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lopes-Dos-Santos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Scheffer-Teixeira et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schomburg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhong et al., 2017</xref>). This warrants studying the mechanisms and functions of these oscillations in specific brain regions in vivo.</p><p>Gamma oscillations usually appear nested within slower rhythms, a phenomenon known as cross-frequency coupling, in which the amplitude of gamma waxes and wanes depending on the phase of a slow oscillation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Canolty and Knight, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lisman and Jensen, 2013</xref>). Important examples are the coupling of specific gamma sub-bands to the hippocampal theta rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cavelli et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sirota et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tort et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tort et al., 2008</xref>) or to the phase of breathing cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cavelli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ito et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhong et al., 2017</xref>). Regarding the latter, it is worth noting that respiration-entrained brain rhythms depend on nasal airflow and are not a consequence of the respiratory pattern generation in the brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lockmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Moberly et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yanovsky et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, it seems likely that respiration-entrained gamma activity arises from local computations driven by sensory inputs sampled at each breath and thus plays a major role in cognition.</p><p>A promising area to study this hypothesis is the piriform cortex (PCx), which constitutes the primary olfactory area in the rodent brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolding and Franks, 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stettler and Axel, 2009</xref>) and exhibits prominent gamma oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bressler and Freeman, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Courtiol et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Freeman, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Freeman and Skarda, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kay et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kay and Freeman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Litaudon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mori et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vanderwolf, 2000</xref>). Most of our understanding of piriform oscillations comes from the studies of Walter Freeman in the 20<sup>th</sup> century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barrie et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Eeckman and Freeman, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Freeman, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Freeman, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Freeman, 1959</xref>). Freeman characterized gamma activity in terms of its topography, frequency range, and relationship to unitary activity and behavior. These observations led him to hypothesize that these oscillations constitute a fundamental sensory processing component that emerges from an excitatory-inhibitory feedback loop. However, despite his influential insights, Freeman’s conjectures could not be conclusively tested due to the technological limitations of his time. Thus, we still lack compelling experimental demonstrations of how gamma generation depends on the interactions between the different piriform neuronal subpopulations or how gamma relates to odor representations encoded as cell assemblies. Therefore, the mechanisms of gamma oscillations in the PCx and their functional role in olfaction need to be studied under the lens of modern experimental and analytical tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Courtiol et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kay et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mori et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In this report, we study gamma oscillations in the PCx of the awake mouse. We took advantage of modern genetic tools, which accurately identify neuronal populations and precisely modify the local connectivity of the PCx, thus enabling an unprecedented study of the mechanisms and functions of its oscillatory activity. We found that respiration drives gamma oscillations in this region, which derive from feedback inhibition and depend on recurrent connections between local excitatory and feedback inhibitory populations. This loop is triggered by the projection of mitral/tufted cells in the olfactory bulb onto the principal cells of the PCx. As functional consequences, we show that respiration-driven gamma oscillations determine odor-assembly representations through a winner-take-all computation taking place within breathing cycles.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Respiration drives gamma oscillations in the piriform cortex</title><p>To understand the mechanisms and functions of gamma oscillations and their relationship with respiration in the mouse brain, we analyzed local field potentials (LFP) from the PCx recorded simultaneously with the respiration signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) during odorless cycles, hereafter referred to as ‘spontaneous’ activity.

The gamma amplitude envelope showed a peak ~200 ms following the inhalation start, coinciding with a large positive cross-correlation peak between these signals, which suggests that respiration causes gamma. Consistent with these results, time-domain Granger causality was significantly higher in the respiration→gamma direction than in the opposite one (t(12) = 9.82, p&lt;10<sup>–6</sup>). Together, these results show that respiration drives low-gamma oscillations in the PCx.</p><p>We analyzed the contribution of the different PCx neuronal populations to network low-gamma oscillations. First, we performed a current source density analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), which revealed that these oscillations are generated locally within the piriform circuit and show a phase reversal near layer 2 (where pyramidal cells are located). Next, we classified single units according to the expression of a light-sensitive channelrhodopsin coupled to the vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT). This allowed us to discriminate between VGAT- principal cells and VGAT+ inhibitory interneurons. Additionally, VGAT+ neurons were further classified into feedback inhibitory interneurons (FBI) and feedforward interneurons (FFI) according to their location relative to the principal cell layer (FFI are located at layer 1 while FBI tend to be located within the cell layer 2/3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolding and Franks, 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). Upon averaging the activity of each neuronal subpopulation, we found that the time course of FBI firing rate changes correlates with the amplitude of low-gamma oscillations in time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). In contrast, principal cells and FFI spike earlier within the respiratory cycle and return to baseline during the gamma amplitude peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Notice further that the gamma peak coincides with principal cell inhibition, as evidenced by their firing rate decrease. Moreover, by computing spike-triggered gamma envelope averages, we confirmed that gamma oscillations closely follow FBI spiking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> inset). Therefore, we conclude that respiration-driven low-gamma oscillations in the PCx arise from feedback inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Respiration-driven gamma oscillations depend on recurrent connections within the piriform cortex</title><p>We next studied the circuit mechanisms responsible for the respiration-driven gamma oscillations in the PCx.

Under this approach, TeLC expression blocks excitatory synaptic transmission without affecting cellular excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolding and Franks, 2018a</xref>), allowing us to study the local computations underlying the respiration-driven gamma. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> shows that TeLC ipsi LFPs had a large significant reduction in low-gamma oscillations with respect to either control mice (t(19) = 4.11, p&lt;0.001) or the contralateral PCx (TeLC contra, not infected; t(12) = 2.99, p=0.0055).

Nevertheless, it should be noted that the contralateral TeLC hemisphere showed lower amplitude gamma oscillations following light stimulation than control recordings, though whether this gamma difference is related to an impaired network interplay between both hemispheres or to genetic differences between mouse lines remains to be determined. In any event, these results experimentally prove two critical facts about respiration-driven piriform gamma oscillations. First, that respiration drives PCx low-gamma oscillations mediated by OB projections from mitral/tufted cells.

The unfamiliar reader is referred to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tallon-Baudry and Bertrand, 1999</xref> for a discussion about evoked vs. induced oscillations. In short, an oscillatory activity that shows up in the average filtered trace is said to be evoked since this requires phase consistency (or ‘resetting’) following each stimulus. On the other hand, oscillations that increase in amplitude following each stimulus (in our case, an inhalation), but that exhibit phase jitters from trial to trial, cannot be properly detected in the averaged trace due to peak-trough cancellations across trials. Such oscillations, referred to as ‘induced,’ can only be detected by inspecting the average across all individual trial amplitudes (or spectrogram; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tallon-Baudry and Bertrand, 1999</xref>). This is the case of piriform low-gamma oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> bottom) since they increase following each inhalation but exhibit time jitters in peak activity from cycle to cycle and no phase resetting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> top). That is, our results show that gamma oscillations are not evoked but induced at each sniff cycle, contrasting therefore, with the evoked beta oscillations.</p><p>We also investigated how beta and gamma responses depended on odor identity and concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Different odorants triggered similar beta and gamma responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> top). The amplitude of beta oscillations depended on concentration (F(3,12)=5.84, p=0.01), while gamma amplitude did not though its variability increased (F(3,12)=2.89, p=0.079; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> bottom). Importantly, when comparing TeLC-infected hemispheres with the contralateral ones during odor delivery, we found that only odor-induced gamma oscillations depended on the local piriform recurrent connections, while beta oscillations were still present in infected animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).

Our findings thus experimentally demonstrate several of Walter Freeman’s hypotheses regarding gamma generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bressler and Freeman, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Eeckman and Freeman, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Freeman, 1968</xref>), and reveal similarities with the mechanisms generating gamma in the OB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Fukunaga et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Fukunaga et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kay et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lepousez and Lledo, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mori et al., 2013</xref>). Second, we demonstrate that the PCx low-gamma oscillations are the extracellular correlates of a winner-take-all process, thus confirming previous theoretical conjectures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">de Almeida et al., 2009</xref>) and linking this brain oscillation to an algorithmic operation (an XOR logic gate). Third, the winner-take-all interpretation provides a direct relationship between gamma oscillations and cell assemblies.</p><p>Under this scenario, the low-gamma feedback inhibition is critical for segregating cell assemblies and generating a sparse, orthogonal odor representation. Concomitantly, the assembly recruitment would depend on OB projections determining which winner cells ‘escape’ gamma inhibition, highlighting the relevance of the OB-PCx interplay for olfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chae et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Otazu et al., 2015</xref>). An important feature of the respiration-driven low-gamma oscillations is that the winners triggering them change according to odor context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), a process likely dependent on odor-encoding mitral cell assemblies from the OB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chae et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, the involvement of different cells and spiking dynamics would make the recruitment of feedback inhibition a non-homogenous process across respiration cycles, leading to small time jitters in peak gamma activity.</p><p>As an empirical end result, the observed low-gamma oscillations are not phase-locked from cycle to cycle; in other words, PCx low-gamma power is induced, but not evoked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tallon-Baudry and Bertrand, 1999</xref>), at each respiratory cycle. Our results, nonetheless, do not exclude a role for OB gamma in triggering piriform oscillations, as the OB output may arise from similar gamma-dependent winner-take-all processes in that area. Nevertheless, our results make it less likely that piriform gamma is simply inherited from the OB, given that we observe (1) a local current source, (2) a tight correlation with FBI spiking, and (3) that gamma disappears when local recurrent connections are abolished, despite the OB remaining intact.</p><p>In contrast, beta oscillations were evoked by the respiratory input to the PCx, leading to a prominent phase resetting ~100 ms after the inhalation start (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Further consistent with these results, respiration-triggered beta oscillations did not disappear in the TeLC condition and were close in time to excitatory and FFI spiking (c.f. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Interestingly, a previous report showed that odors evoke PCx beta oscillations under urethane anesthesia, which, as here, occurred before global inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Poo and Isaacson, 2009</xref>). Based on this, a role for piriform beta in odor representations has been proposed; nevertheless, here we show that beta oscillations are likely inherited and do not require local computations in the PCx, i.e., they are not locally generated.</p><p>The study of the role of the PCx in olfaction has recently been boosted by selective genetic techniques, allowing researchers to examine how the individual cellular components relate to olfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Franks et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nagappan and Franks, 2021</xref>). The PCx, also known as the olfactory cortex, receives inputs from the OB and constructs a robust odor representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bolding et al., 2020</xref>). This representation can be inferred from the population activity and has two major features. On the one hand, it separates odor identity from its concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolding and Franks, 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolding and Franks, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Roland et al., 2017</xref>). This process depends on large-scale piriform inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolding and Franks, 2018a</xref>) and thus correlates with low-gamma oscillations. On the other hand, the representation groups odors into perceptual categories, not necessarily related to the physical structure of the odor molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pashkovski et al., 2020</xref>). Surprisingly, these odor assembly representations are not fixed but change with time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schoonover et al., 2021</xref>), which might be a particular property of unstructured cortices such as the piriform cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stettler and Axel, 2009</xref>). In light of this evidence, spike-field synchronization might be an essential coding strategy, as neural oscillations might provide an internal signal in which assembly representations can be organized and structured. Thus, we hypothesize that low-gamma oscillations provide a critical time window for odor assembly representations to be formed and modified through winner-take-all computations.</p><p>The role of neuronal oscillations in shaping spiking patterns has been widely discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buzsáki, 2010</xref>). Among other functions, oscillations are thought to provide syntactical blocks in which spiking activity can be parsed into meaningful words. A reader (receiver) area can then decode such neuronal representations by following these syntactic rules. In favor of this hypothesis, our decoding analysis shows that, for a reader neuron, optimal odor decoding occurs during the gamma peak within breathing cycles. A likely explanation for this scenario – based on our results – is that by suppressing the activity of competing representations, gamma oscillations increase the signal-to-background ratio and allow for optimal decoding. Under this framework, maximal decoding occurs after and not during the peak firing rate, coinciding with peak gamma activity and synchronous inhibition. Thus, the inhibited neurons, despite being the most phase-locked to gamma, would not directly encode odor information, while the neurons that escape gamma inhibition would do. Interestingly, and further consistent with our results, a recent study in humans showed that the accurate perception and identification of odors depend on piriform gamma oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, the behavioral response to odors also seems to depend on piriform gamma, and its suppression induces depressive-like behaviors in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, respiratory-triggered gamma oscillations might constitute a fundamental building block for neuronal communication in the olfactory system.</p><p>Several reports show that the PCx is the source of gamma activity for widespread brain regions, including the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carmichael et al., 2017</xref>) and the anterior limbic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carmichael et al., 2019</xref>). Although the authors largely attribute such oscillations to piriform volume conduction, recent evidence shows that olfactory gamma synchronizes distant regions as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2022</xref>). Based on our results, we postulate that genuine respiration-entrained gamma oscillations in downstream regions are triggered by the output of the winning piriform assemblies, leading to new local gamma winner-take-all processes. This provides a new look into long-range gamma synchronization, emerging naturally if winners generating gamma in one area consistently trigger winners generating gamma in a downstream area. Such a mechanism closely agrees with the theory and experiments reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schneider et al., 2021</xref>, which suggest that oscillatory power and connectivity are the main drivers underlying inter-areal coherence.</p><p>A central element to this directional view of interregional synchronization is gamma coupling to respiration, as the slow oscillation ensures a flow of information from the most primary olfactory areas (OB, PCx) to the higher limbic areas (prefrontal cortex, amygdala). In accordance, a recent report showed that respiration-related brain oscillations drive sparse assemblies in the prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Folschweiller and Sauer, 2022</xref>). Notably, these authors also found that inhibitory recruitment by assembly members was key for assembly segregation, suggesting a potential role for gamma in that area. Hence, the directional view of synchronization across regions places a major role in cross-frequency interactions driving communication, highlighting the relevance of interregional synchrony modulation by slower rhythms, for instance, theta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">González et al., 2020</xref>) or respiration itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cavelli et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">González et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>In light of our findings, we propose the following model to understand the relationship between spiking activity, neural oscillations, and odor coding in the piriform cortex: (1) Following each sniff, olfactory information is processed in the OB and is transmitted to the piriform circuit through mitral/tufted cell spiking. These synchronous postsynaptic potentials cause the field beta oscillation, whose amplitude depends on the afferent volley. (2) The principal cells that better encode the olfactory stimulus excite feedback interneurons. (3) Feedback interneurons inhibit competing principal cells, causing the field gamma oscillation. (4) This winner-take-all process segregates cell assemblies and dictates a sparse piriform odor representation. Note that because the piriform cortex normalized odorant concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolding and Franks, 2018a</xref>), the amplitude of gamma oscillations does not change. Hence, gamma oscillations provide an optimal temporal window to decode odor.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Datasets</title><p>We analyzed recordings of the PCx generously made available by Bolding and Franks through the Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience data-sharing website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://crcns.org">http://crcns.org</ext-link>, pcx-1 dataset).

The classification algorithm was a linear support vector machine with a stochastic gradient descent optimization, implemented using the <italic>sgdclassifier</italic> sklearn function. Each mouse was trained and tested separately; for each time window, the training sample consisted of 2/3 of the data, and the test sample consisted of the remaining third. The division of training/test samples was randomized in order to avoid odor bias, repeated 100 times, and the results of the repetitions averaged to obtain the final decoding value. For the statistical comparisons, we used the same 100 ms time windows employed in the population vector correlations (i.e. Pre, Gamma, and Post). To verify the robustness of the results, we also employed a linear discriminant analysis and a k-nearest neighbor classifier, which rendered similar results to the sgdclassifier algorithm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Statistics</title><p>We show data as either mean ± SEM or regular boxplots showing the median, 1st, 3rd quartiles, and the distribution range without outliers. We employed paired and unpaired t-test to compare between groups. To compare among odor concentrations, we employed repeated measures ANOVA. We set p&lt;0.05 to be considered significant (in the figure panels, *, ** and *** denote p&lt;0.05, p&lt;0.01, and p&lt;0.001, respectively). For the 1st IC weight correlations, we employed Pearson r correlation and corrected the statistical threshold through the Bonferroni method for multiple comparisons.</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>Data availability</title><p>All the data employed is freely available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.6080/K00C4SZB">http://dx.doi.org/10.6080/K00C4SZB</ext-link>.

oscillations fade under anesthesia</title><p>After unveiling the mechanisms responsible for the respiration-driven low-gamma activity in the PCx, we investigated whether these oscillations are

To that end, we analyzed PCx LFP recordings during ketamine/xylazine anesthesia. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> shows the LFP spectrogram before and after ketamine/xylazine administration. Anesthesia promoted large-amplitude, slow LFP oscillations while greatly reducing gamma power, an effect that lasted ~30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These results can also be readily seen in the average power spectra of awake vs. anesthetized animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), thus confirming that PCx low-gamma oscillations depend on the brain state. Next, we investigated if ketamine/xylazine anesthesia alters gamma coupling to respiration by analyzing respiration-LFP phase-amplitude comodulograms. We found that low-gamma oscillations are no longer coupled to respiration during general anesthesia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), despite the respiration-entrained rhythm being still present in the PCx LFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). Intriguingly, the respiration-LFP comodulogram revealed coupling to a faster gamma activity (&gt;80 Hz) under anesthesia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), which we deem likely to relate to the high-frequency oscillations evoked by sub-anesthetic doses of ketamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caixeta et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Castro-Zaballa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hunt et al., 2019</xref>), though it exhibited no power spectrum peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s9"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s9-1"><title>Ketamine/xylazine anesthesia</title><p>Ketamine/xylazine (100/10 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally in 11 of the 13 mice from the control dataset, inducing stable anesthesia during a 30–45 min time period.

Neuron classification: The authors should perhaps provide additional details on how the neuron types (FBI, FFI, pyramidal) were identified. I understand from the paper the dataset taken from that opto-tagging nicely identified the interneurons (and those could be separated based on laminar location). However, the waveforms of interneurons and pyramidal cells in the original publication look quite similar (Figure 3c of Bolding and Franks, 2018). Is it possible that interneurons could have been wrongly classified as pyramidal cells, perhaps in cases where units were further away from the optical fiber and might have not received enough light to be reliably driven? An additional analysis of waveform characteristics could increase confidence in the classification. Further, it is not entirely clear from the current manuscript whether the cell type classification was taken over from Bolding and Franks, or whether the authors ran their own classification.</p><p>2. Figure 1f: The authors should mention how many neurons of the different cell types were included in the analysis. In the original Bolding and Franks paper only 13 FFI were identified, but the figure legend states that 15 sessions were analyzed. This should be clarified.</p><p>3. Figure S3c: FFI could be mentioned in the legend as they are shown in the figure panel.</p><p>4. Figure 3A: Could the authors comment on why the induced γ response seems weaker in TeLC contra versus Thy-control? The difference is not significant (Figure 3C), but this might be an effect of the relatively low number of experiments in each group. In a purely feedback γ generation mechanism one might naively expect power to be equal in both controls.</p><p>5. Figure 5C: Principal cells seem to couple to distinct respiration phases (as mentioned also in the text). It would be informative to quantify whether individual cells maintain a similar preferred phase over time (as implied by the plot in Figure 5C), perhaps by taking tuning functions made from odd vs even breath cycles and cross-correlating them.</p><p>6. The authors argue that '[…] assembly recruitment would depend on excitatory-excitatory interactions among winner cells […]' (line 399). An alternative scenario that does not necessarily involve recurrent connections within the piriform cortex could be that OB drive activates a subset of principal cells that are most excitable (winner), which silence the less excitable population (losers) by recruiting FBIs (Pubmed ID 19515917). The authors could consider discussing along these lines in addition to what is already mentioned in the discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83044.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All points raised by the reviewers are for clarification and should be addressable either with textual adjustments or minimal additional analysis.</p><p>While I would ask you to address all comments with textual clarifications, please do in particular consider the first two points made by reviewer 1 (directly γ-cycle dependent decoding – if feasible; decoding in the TeLC recordings, as similarly raised by reviewer 2) and the first and fifth comment of reviewer 2 (different populations and the TeLC comment as for Reviewer 1).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the editors for their work and the reviewers for the constructive comments. As detailed in our answers below, we have performed several additional analyses to address the points raised. These led to the elaboration of new figure panels and associated text. In particular, we have performed a direct analysis of odor decoding within γ cycles as well as further analysis of the TeLC recordings. We have also strengthened the connection between feedback interneurons and γ oscillations by investigating the spike-triggered γ averages and performing current-source density analysis. Below we provide point-by-point answers to all points raised.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– Does the observation that winner cells fire before the peak of the γ oscillation imply that γ is unimportant for neural coding and it is the deviation from the γ cycle that matters most?</p></disp-quote><p>The point raised by the reviewer is important and provocative, as our results suggest that the neurons that better encode a given odor can “deviate” or “escape” from the ongoing γ oscillation. Crucially, we show that winner cells are likely to recruit this inhibition and thus trigger the γ oscillation. We thus agree that this provocative idea is plausible and included new text in the Discussion hypothesizing that the neurons that fire tightly locked to γ are likely not involved in representing the odor sampled (page 10).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors should be more explicit in the discussion of the initial results (Figures 1 and 2) that they are analyzing activity only during &quot;spontaneous activity&quot;, i.e., recorded in the absence of odor.

Actually, the original versions of Figures 1 and 2 were computed using the entire recordings during the awake state, which includes both the odor stimulations and the spontaneous activity. In the revised version, we have recomputed Figures 1 and 2 panels only using spontaneous activity, which rendered virtually identical γ results (as expected since spontaneous cycles greatly outnumber odor cycles), and also edited the text to explicitly inform about this approach (page 4). Note, however, that by only analyzing odorless activity, β oscillations disappeared from the spectrum, reflecting their high odor dependency. Nevertheless, we have also modified Figure 4 to better discuss the dependence of γ and β oscillations on odor vs. odorless sniffing cycles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Light-evoked γ in contralateral hemispheres is much lower than in contralateral control hemispheres but never discuss this.

In the revised version, we now mention in the manuscript the different levels of light-evoked γ responses between TeLC contralateral and Thy control data that are apparent upon visual inspection of Figure 3 results. We now discuss possible network effects for such (potential) differences in γ responses, while also not discarding possible species-specific influences (given that the animals have different genetic backgrounds; please see page 6). Of note, we have also complemented panel A of Figure 3 by including a schematic representation of the experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 125: Confusing, FFIs in L. 1 are deeper but still more superficial than FBIs.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for spotting the mistake, which has been corrected.

Would their observations hold (e.g. winner vs. loser cells) if they did not have this sorting?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point, we performed the assembly analysis considering all neurons (i.e., without separating principal cells from inhibitory interneurons). We found reasonably similar results in the distribution of assembly weights, in the winners/losers activity time course, and in the correlation of assembly weights between odors (please compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> to the corresponding ones in Figure 6).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83044-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Nevertheless, we note that the much higher number of principal cells compared to interneurons is likely to account for this similarity (858 VGAT- vs 56 VGAT+). Such observation is now mentioned in the revised manuscript (page 15).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. Neuron classification: The authors should perhaps provide additional details on how the neuron types (FBI, FFI, pyramidal) were identified. I understand from the paper the dataset taken from that opto-tagging nicely identified the interneurons (and those could be separated based on laminar location).

We apologize for not being explicit enough regarding the classification of neurons. We had to perform the classification anew based on the methodology described by Bolding and Franks since the labels employed in the original publication were unfortunately not available in the dataset. We explicitly inform in the revised version that we have run a new classification (page 14). We are now also including a supplementary figure (Figure 1-Supplement Figure 5) showing the average waveform of each neuron subtype and their position distribution in the probe. The waveforms and positions we obtained were similar to those presented in the original publication, though the exact neuronal numbers slightly differed: the original publication reported 855 VGAT-, 46 FBI, and 13 FFI. We obtained 858 VGAT-, 40 FBI, and 16 FFI (though 3 FFI were discarded due to an unusually low firing rate for an interneuron [&lt;1 Hz]). We believe this to be a good match, given that we performed an independent classification. Importantly, we also obtain similar results if we compare the spiking frequency for each neuronal subtype, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref> (ours on the left, Bolding and Franks on the right).</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83044-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Of note, in addition to the firing rates, the waveforms obtained by us (Figure 1-Supplement Figure 5) also match those obtained by Bolding and Franks (their Figure 3C).We agree with the reviewer that the waveforms are not as dissimilar as those obtained by classification methods based on the extracellular AP wave shapes. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, the opto-tagging approach would be a superior method for neuronal classification. Moreover, we further note that all opto-tagged interneurons showed higher firing rates than the principal cells, thus further confirming their putative identity. Finally, we also note that Bolding and Franks showed in their Figure S2 that there are detectable differences among the waveforms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

However, we note that – to obtain the result shown in the previous Figure 1F panel – we first computed the normalized spike rate for each session individually (and did not pool all neurons of a given subtype), that is, each sample was a session and not a neuron. In any case, in the revised version we now use each neuron as a sample and inform in the figure caption the number of analyzed neurons for each subtype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure S3c: FFI could be mentioned in the legend as they are shown in the figure panel.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for spotting this omission, which has been fixed it. We note that this figure is now Figure 1—figure supplement 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 3A: Could the authors comment on why the induced γ response seems weaker in TeLC contra versus Thy-control? The difference is not significant (Figure 3C), but this might be an effect of the relatively low number of experiments in each group. In a purely feedback γ generation mechanism one might naively expect power to be equal in both controls.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised version, we now comment on the different levels of γ responses between TeLC contralateral and Thy control data that is apparent upon visual inspection of Figure 3 results (page 6). However, as noted by the reviewer, which we agree, the sample sizes for these experiments are relatively low to allow for conclusive inferences (5 for controls and 7 for TeLC contra). In any event, we now discuss possible network effects for such (potential) differences in γ responses (page 6), while also not discarding possible species-specific influences (given that the animals have different genetic backgrounds). We have also complemented panel A of Figure 3 by including a schematic representation of the experiments to help the reader understand the experimental conditions</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure 5C: Principal cells seem to couple to distinct respiration phases (as mentioned also in the text). It would be informative to quantify whether individual cells maintain a similar preferred phase over time (as implied by the plot in Figure 5C), perhaps by taking tuning functions made from odd vs even breath cycles and cross-correlating them.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We now computed the preferred resp phase for all principal neurons during the first and last third of the recording session. We find that most neurons maintain their phase preference. This result is now part of panel C of revised Figure 5 and mentioned on page 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The authors argue that '[…] assembly recruitment would depend on excitatory-excitatory interactions among winner cells […]' (line 399). An alternative scenario that does not necessarily involve recurrent connections within the piriform cortex could be that OB drive activates a subset of principal cells that are most excitable (winner), which silence the less excitable population (losers) by recruiting FBIs (Pubmed ID 19515917). The authors could consider discussing along these lines in addition to what is already mentioned in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the thoughtful comment and excellent suggestion. After analyzing odor assemblies in TeLC recordings (please see our answers above), we found that the alternative scenario mentioned by the reviewer turns out to be more likely than our previous hypothesis. This is because we found that the TeLC infection does not alter winning neurons; instead, the TeLC lesion significantly decreases the number of losers and attenuates their inhibition during the γ window (please see our answers above). Therefore, we changed this sentence to match our new results. It now reads (page 9):</p><p>“(…) the assembly recruitment would depend on OB projections determining which winner cells “escape” γ inhibition, highlighting the relevance of the OB-PCx interplay for olfaction (Chae et al., 2022; Otazu et al., 2015).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
