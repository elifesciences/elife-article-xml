However, lab-based vocal behavior is typically studied during brief interactions between animals with no prior social relationship, and under environmental conditions with limited ethological relevance. Here, we address this gap by establishing long-term acoustic recordings from Mongolian gerbil families, a core social group that uses an array of sonic and ultrasonic vocalizations. Three separate gerbil families were transferred to an enlarged environment and continuous 20-day audio recordings were obtained. Using a variational autoencoder (VAE) to quantify 583,237 vocalizations, we show that gerbils exhibit a more elaborate vocal repertoire than has been previously reported and that vocal repertoire usage differs significantly by family. By performing gaussian mixture model clustering on the VAE latent space, we show that families preferentially use characteristic sets of vocal clusters and that these usage preferences remain stable over weeks. Furthermore, gerbils displayed family-specific transitions between vocal clusters. Since gerbils live naturally as extended families in complex underground burrows that are adjacent to other families, these results suggest the presence of a vocal dialect which could be exploited by animals to represent kinship. These findings position the Mongolian gerbil as a compelling animal model to study the neural basis of vocal communication and demonstrates the potential for using unsupervised machine learning with uninterrupted acoustic recordings to gain insights into naturalistic animal behavior.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Every time you speak, the sounds coming out of your mouth may carry more meaning that you may have intended; they may reveal, for example, which country, city or even neighborhood you may be coming from. Indeed, the vocal patterns that humans use to communicate differ from one population to the next, creating an array of languages, dialects and accents.</p><p>Such diversity has also been identified in various social species across the animal kingdom. Naked mole rats, for instance, which live underground in complex societies, exhibit different âdialectsâ depending on their group of origin. Yet studying the vocal patterns of animals has remained difficult, especially for species inhabiting burrows or other environments difficult to access.</p><p>Aiming to bypass these limitations, Peterson et al. adopted a ânaturalisticâ approach that allowed them to capture the vocal calls of three families of Mongolian gerbils living undisturbed in enclosures that mimic features of their natural environment. These animals spend their lives underground in tight-knit families, with multiple groups often being in close proximity. Researchers have speculated that individuals may rely on vocal cues to identify whether they are part of the same colony, as they are often too far from each other to rely on sight or smell.</p><p>Over half a million vocalizations obtained continuously through the course of 20 days were analyzed using an artificial intelligence technique known as unsupervised machine learning. The analyses helped add new types of calls to the gerbil vocal repertoire, but also highlighted its complexity. In particular, they revealed that the animals could combine individual vocal elements into complex sequences. More importantly, this approach showed that gerbil families have vocal dialects that are stable across weeks, with each group displaying a preference for certain call types (i.e. words) and certain sequential patterns (i.e. phrases).</p><p>These findings demonstrate the benefits of the approach developed by Peterson et al. for the study of animal vocalizations. Going forward, they also suggest that the Mongolian gerbil could be used as an animal model to study the neural basis of vocal communication.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mongolian gerbil</kwd><kwd>vocal communication</kwd><kwd>bioacoustics</kwd><kwd>ethology</kwd><kwd>social behavior</kwd><kwd>auditory neuroscience</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mongolian gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus)</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T90DA059110</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peterson</surname><given-names>Ralph E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5T32MH096331-10</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peterson</surname><given-names>Ralph E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC020279</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sanes</surname><given-names>Dan H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC018802</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schneider</surname><given-names>David M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Career Award at the Scientific Interface</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schneider</surname><given-names>David M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014185</institution-id><institution>Searle Scholars Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schneider</surname><given-names>David M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

However, natural observations are often incomplete due to limitations in physical access for experimenter observation or behavioral recording. This can be particularly severe for family behaviors which occur in protected or remote environments, such as burrows in the case of fossorial rodent species like naked mole-rats and Mongolian gerbils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brett, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Scheibler et al., 2006</xref>). Some of these limitations have been addressed with laboratory environments that partially recapitulate real-world features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shemesh and Chen, 2023</xref>). However, these studies generally focused on relatively short periods of data collection that consider single animals or dyads with no prior social relationship.</p><p>While our understanding of social aural communication is sparse, even for humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pagel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mascaro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schindler et al., 2022</xref>), we know that many vocal cues are learned through social experience, and provide pivotal information about an animalâs identity. For example, a human infantâs ability to discriminate between foreign language phonemes can be preserved by exposure to a live foreign speaker, but not an audiovisual recording (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kuhl et al., 2003</xref>). Evidence from swamp sparrows suggests the presence of culturally transmissible âdialectsâ â a term borrowed from linguistics to denote a pattern of vocal behavior that is used by members of a social group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maler and Tamura, 1964</xref>). Our study adopts this operational definition of a vocal dialect. Even some rodents, such as the naked mole rat, learn colony-specific dialects based on early social experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barker et al., 2021</xref>). The literature for social facilitation of vocal discrimination or production is particularly strong for zebra finches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eales, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">DerÃ©gnaucourt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Narula et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, our study considers the possibility that there is a diversity of vocalizations within the gerbil social group that may harbor family specific information.</p><p>We chose to focus on families, a canonical social group that has been predominantly studied during brief and experimentally restricted social encounters (e.g. mating, pup retrieval, aggression) in relatively featureless environments. Our goal was to construct a complete gerbil family social-vocal soundscape during a significant period of development under undisturbed, environmentally enriched conditions. Unlike many laboratory rodents, gerbils form pair bonds and maintain a family structure across generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ãgren, 1984a</xref>). These families are composed of a founding adult pair, and up to 15 extended family members that live cooperatively in underground burrows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ãgren et al., 1989a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ãgren et al., 1989b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Milne-Edwards, 1867</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Scheibler et al., 2004</xref>). Given the darkness and complexity of their burrow systems, gerbils are thought to rely heavily on their auditory system for social interactions. Sibling bonds established through adolescence facilitate social structure and minimize inbreeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ãgren, 1984b</xref>). Natural burrows are found in multi-family neighborhoods with strictly enforced territorial boundaries <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paperpile.com/c/en3qXx/RZSQS+oOvID+fB1qw">(</ext-link><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Scheibler et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ãgren et al., 1989a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ãgren et al., 1989b</xref>). Like prairie voles, gerbils act cooperatively to hoard food, maintain nests, defend their territory, and care for pups <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paperpile.com/c/en3qXx/HxMDE+X1jr">(</ext-link><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Elwood, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gromov, 2021</xref>). Therefore, gerbils display a range of rodent-typical behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hurtado-Parrado et al., 2017</xref>), as well as complex family behaviors. Gerbils also display significant vocal communication in both the ultrasonic and sonic ranges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">RÃ¼bsamen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kobayasi and Riquimaroux, 2012</xref>) which is likely to be integral to social behaviors. Unlike many other rodent species, gerbils are able to hear within sonic ranges at sensitivities similar to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ryan, 1976</xref>). As a result, there is a rich, contemporary literature on the auditory perceptual skills, peripheral and central physiology, central anatomy, learning, and genomics in this species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Budinger and Scheich, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buran et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Happel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Myoga et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pachitariu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sarro et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">von Trapp et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caras and Sanes, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cheng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zorio et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Amaro et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Paraouty et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yao and Sanes, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Saldeitis et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Penikis and Sanes, 2023</xref>).</p><p>Here, we made continuous 20-day audio recordings from three separate gerbil families (2 parents, 4 pups) in an enlarged home cage that was isolated from other gerbils and humans. Specifically, we recorded audio over a period beginning at postnatal day 11â13 when auditory cortex is particularly sensitive to acoustic experience, and extending to postnatal day 31â32, the time when animals are typically weaned. Our goal was to acquire a descriptive dataset of the spectrotemporal structure of vocalizations emitted throughout daily family life, and without human intervention. Using emerging methods in unsupervised vocalization analysis, we quantitatively describe the spectrotemporal structure of vocalizations over multiple timescales and demonstrate that vocal repertoire usage differs between families.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Longitudinal familial audio recording</title><p>We obtained acoustic recordings (four microphones, 125 kHz sampling rate) from three separate gerbil families, each containing two adults and four pups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Continuous recordings began at P11-13, lasted 20 days, and pups were weaned at P29 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, we extracted all sound events (yellow) using amplitude thresholding of acoustic power. To isolate vocalizations (blue) from non-vocal sounds (red), we computed the spectral flatness of each sound event and classified sounds with a threshold value of &lt;0.3 as vocalizations. A similar approach has previously been used in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Castellucci et al., 2016</xref>), and we verified that a threshold value of 0.3 minimized the number of false positives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Using this approach, 10,267,972 sound events were extracted, containing 583,237 vocalizations and 9,684,735 non-vocal sounds detected across the three families. Sound events were produced at an average rate of 6726+/-1260 times per hour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), which reveals the rate of auditory object processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Griffiths and Warren, 2004</xref>) for gerbil families in an undisturbed setting.

A deep convolutional neural network âdecoderâ then reconstructs a spectrogram (bottom) from the 32-dimensional latent representation. The encoder/decoder networks are jointly trained to minimize the discrepancy between the original and reconstructed spectrograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A, B</xref>), resulting in a low-dimensional latent representation, or âcodeâ, which depicts each vocalization. To cluster vocalizations into distinct categories, we trained a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) on VAE latent representations. Using a combination of the elbow method on held-out log likelihood and established knowledge for how many vocal types gerbils emit (see Methods, GMM clustering), we selected a model with 70 vocal clusters as a parsimonious description of the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> shows a UMAP embedding of the VAE latents (center), used for visualization purposes only, which demonstrates that the gerbil vocal repertoire is more discrete than mouse, yet less discrete than zebra finch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sainburg et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goffinet et al., 2021</xref>).

To assess the potential effect of daily variation on family specific vocal usage, we visualized density maps of vocal usage across days for each of the families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). There are two noteworthy trends: (1) the density map remains coarsely stable across days (rows) and (2) the maps look distinct across families on any given day (columns). This is a qualitative approximation for the repertoireâs stability, but does not take into account variation of call type usage (as defined by GMM clustering of the latent space). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, shows the normalized usage of each cluster type over development for each family. Cluster usages during the period of âfull family, shared recording daysâ (postnatal days beneath the purple bars) are stable across days within families â as is apparent by the horizontal striations in the plot â although each family maintains this stability through using a unique set of call types.

We then analyzed a shorter time scale, the inter-vocalization-interval. The distribution of intervals between subsequent vocalizations is broad, with some vocalizations occurring rapidly after one another (e.g. within tens to hundreds of milliseconds) and others separated by many seconds. The majority of vocalizations occurred in bouts (58.5Â±0.9%), which we extracted using two criteria: (1) vocalizations within a bout display inter-vocalization-interval of &lt;2 s, and (2) a bout contains at least 5 vocalizations (based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rose et al., 2021</xref>).

Although subtle, vertical streaks are clearly present in shuffled transition matrices that correspond to 1 gram usages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Given the shuffled data structure, we sought to determine whether the observed transition probabilities differed significantly from chance levels. We randomly shuffled label sequences 1000 times independently for each family to generate a null transition matrix distribution. Using these null distributions and the observed transition probabilities, we computed a p-value for each transition using a one-sample t-test and created a binary transition matrix indicating which transitions happen above chance levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1C</xref>, black pixels, <italic>P</italic> â¤ 0.05 after post hoc Benjamini-Hochberg multiple comparisons correction). As is made clear in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1C</xref>, most transitions for each family occur significantly above chance levels, despite the inherent 1 gram structure. Moreover, by looking at transitions from a highly usage cluster type used roughly the same proportion across families (cluster 12), we show that families arrange the same sets of vocal clusters into unique sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1D</xref>).

In principle, this requires continuous, undisturbed, and longitudinal recording that takes place in nature or a naturalistic context. This need has led to the emergence of powerful video tools for long-term monitoring and machine-learning based analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Datta et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pereira et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shemesh and Chen, 2023</xref>). In contrast, most studies of natural behavior have not acquired and analyzed acoustic information over prolonged periods, or from a socially intact cohort. Therefore, to characterize vocal communication in a canonical social group, we obtained continuous audio recordings from three separate Mongolian gerbil families over a 20-day period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). By expanding the recording duration, and permitting animals undisturbed interaction with their family unit, we sought to capture a more diverse vocal repertoire, and to determine whether vocal attributes were associated with family identity.</p><p>Capitalizing on advances in computational bioacoustics, which aid in the characterization of complex and high-dimensional vocal behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sainburg et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sainburg and Gentner, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goffinet et al., 2021</xref>), we extracted vocalization spectrograms and used a VAE to perform unsupervised analysis of a large number of familial gerbil vocalizations (n=583,237). At least one new vocal type and numerous multisyllabic vocal types were discovered using this approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Also, we provide evidence that family structure is necessary to elicit the full vocal repertoire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). These findings underscore the advantage of a longitudinal naturalistic approach, and suggest that further elaborations (e.g. providing a larger-scale naturalistic environment) could reveal new aural communication behaviors.</p><p>Social vocalizations can convey pivotal information about an animalâs identity. For example, female macaques learn to recognize the vocalizations of their own offspring during the second postnatal week, and retain this ability for at least 6 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jovanovic et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shizawa et al., 2005</xref>). Similarly, kittens learn their motherâs vocalizations, and Australian sea lions can recall their motherâs voice up to 2 years after weaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pitcher et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Szenczi et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, the meaning of vocal cues are often learned through long-term social experience. For example, when exposed to a chicken maternal call during development, socially reared mallard ducklings come to prefer it over their own speciesâ call (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gottlieb, 1993</xref>). Similarly, wood ducklings must be exposed to sibling vocalizations in order to remain selectively responsive to its motherâs assembly call (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gottlieb, 1983</xref>). Horseshoe bats, naked mole rats, and dolphins each model their calls based on early social experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jones and Ransome, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fripp et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Favaro et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barker et al., 2021</xref>). Finally, rodent vocalizations can also harbor information about the individual identity and colony membership of the vocalizer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barker et al., 2021</xref>). In fact, research on song learning in zebra finches shows that a reward learning mechanism may support the transmission of vocal repertoires: exposure to a live singing tutor, but not song playback, selectively activates dopamine neurons in the juvenile periaqueductal gray which is thought to mediate learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tanaka et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, there is a compelling rationale for exploring the diversity of vocalizations within the gerbil family social group, and to pursue the underlying neural mechanisms in the future.</p><p>To address whether gerbils also exhibit family specific vocal features, we compared GMM-labeled vocal cluster usages across the three recorded families and showed differences in vocal type usage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Although we chose 70 clusters for our analyses, the general finding was robust across a wide range of GMM clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The differences in this study align with the definition of human vocal dialect, which is a regional or social variety of language that can differ in pronunciation, grammatical, semantic and/or language use differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Henry et al., 2015</xref>). This definition of dialect is inclusive of both pronunciation differences (e.g. a Bostonianâs characteristic pronunciation of âcarâ as âcahâ) and usage differences (e.g. a Bostonianâs preferential usage of the words âGo Red Soxâ vs. a New Yorkerâs preferential usage of the words âGo Yankeesâ). In our case, vocal clusters can be rarely observed in some families yet highly overexpressed in others (e.g. analogous to language usage differences in humans), or highly expressed in both families, but contain subtle spectrotemporal variations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, Family 1 cluster 11 vs. Family 3 clusters 2, 18, 30; for example analogous to pronunciation differences in humans). Like another fossorial species, the naked mole-rat, it is possible that gerbils may also possess the ability to acquire family specific vocal behavior through experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barker et al., 2021</xref>). Unlike the naked mole-rat which showed the presence of a colony-specific vocal dialect in a single vocal type, the soft chirp, we show that fine spectrotemporal variations in multiple different gerbil vocal types could harbor dialects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p>The described family differences collapse data from multiple days into a single comparison; however, it is possible that factors such as vocal development and/or high usage of particular vocal types during specific periods of the recording could explain family differences. Therefore, we took advantage of the longitudinal nature of our dataset to assess whether repertoire differences remain stable across time. First, we visualized vocal repertoire usage across days as either UMAP probability density maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) or daily GMM cluster usages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Though qualitative, one can appreciate that family repertoire usage remains stable across days and appears to differ on a consistent daily basis across families. To formally quantify this, we first projected GMM cluster usages from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> into PC space and show that family GMM cluster usage patterns are highly separable, regardless of postnatal day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). If families had used a more overlapping set of call types, then the projections would have appeared intermixed. Next, we performed a cluster-free analysis by computing the pairwise MMD distance between VAE latent distributions of vocalizations from each family and day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This analysis shows very low MMD values across days within a family (i.e. the repertoire is highly consistent with itself), and high MMD values across families/days (greater than would be expected by chance; see shuffle control in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). The relative differences in this matrix are made clear in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, which provides additional evidence that family vocal repertoires remain stable across days and are consistently different from other families. Taken together, we believe that this is compelling evidence that differences in vocal repertoires between families are not driven by dominating call types during specific phases in the recording period; rather, families consistently emit characteristic sets of call types across days. This opens up the possibility to assess repertoire differences over much shorter time periods (e.g. 24 hr) in future studies.</p><p>Vocalization emission statistics and behavioral syllable transition patterns can signify differences between groups of animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Castellucci et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wiltschko et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Markowitz et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that vocal emission patterns or vocal cluster transition patterns may be family specific. To address this, we first compared vocalization emission rates over multiple ethologically relevant timescales, which revealed highly consistent emission patterns across families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5AâD</xref>). First, we observed that vocal emission follows a diurnal pattern, with peaks of activity in the morning and afternoon. This result complements prior work in gerbils showing diurnal activity patterns in gerbil groups for non-vocal behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pietrewicz et al., 1982</xref>), but extends our understanding to vocal behavior. Vocalizations are rarely emitted in isolation. Rather, they are emitted in sequences (âboutsâ) with a modal duration of 4 s and a duration distribution that does not vary between families. These emission statistics are somewhat consistent with the common phoneme rate in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Edwards and Chang, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ding et al., 2017</xref>). Also, the distributions of inter-vocalization interval and vocalization duration did not differ between families. Taken together, the temporal emission structure is highly consistent across families and suggests that these features are likely not exploited for kinship identification. However, this does not rule out the possibility that the sequential organization of vocalizations could vary. Vocalization bouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5EâF</xref>) show that temporal sequencing of vocalization clusters is non-random and has a compelling transition structure with potential to vary across families. To formally quantify this, we calculated vocalization transition matrices for each family, which revealed that all families strongly favor vocalization self-transitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), although hinted that non self-transitions (off-diagonal) vary by family. To visualize this, we generated bigram transition graphs of highly expressed vocalization transitions, which provides evidence that vocalization transition structure varies by family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, families arrange the same sets of vocal clusters into unique sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). There are limitations to this study that deserve consideration. First, a fully realized assessment of vocalization usage should be integrated with continuous sub-second synchronized videographic data from which one can extract animal pose estimation and behavioral categorization. For example, such data could allow us to control for the total number and type of social interactions, which may explain differences in the amount or usage of specific syllables. Second, although we used four microphones, it was not possible to localize the majority of vocalizations with sufficient spatial resolution (using Mouse Ultrasonic Source Estimation software; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Neunuebel et al., 2015</xref>). To properly address whether individual animals emit a unique vocalization repertoire, we will require significant advances in the field of computational bioacoustics. In anticipation of future research in this area, we have computed acoustic features of vocalizations in each of the GMM clusters as a reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Although we were not able to attribute vocalizations to individual family members, we did seek to determine the importance of family structure by comparing audio recordings before and after removal of the pups at P30. The results show a clear effect of family integrity, and the sudden reduction of sonic calls following pup removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>) could suggest that these vocalizations are produced selectively by pups. However, there is ample evidence that adult gerbils also produce sonic vocalizations. For example, a number of low-frequency call types are used by adults during a range of social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">RÃ¼bsamen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Furuyama et al., 2022</xref>), some of which are similar to a low-frequency call type used by pups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Silberstein et al., 2023</xref>). Vocalization patterns of developing gerbils depend on isolation or staged interactions. Thus, when gerbil pups are recorded during isolation, ultrasonic vocalization rate declines and sonic vocalizations increase for animals that are in a high arousal state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Ghett, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Silberstein et al., 2023</xref>). As gerbils progress from juvenile to adolescent development (P17-55) a significant increase in ultrasonic vocalization rate is observed during dyadic social encounters, with a distinct change in usage pattern that depends upon the sex of each animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Holman and Seale, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Holman et al., 1995</xref>). The development of vocalization types has been assessed in another member of the Gerbillinae subfamily, called fat-tailed gerbils (Pachyuromys duprasi), during isolation and handling. Here, the number of ultrasonic vocalization syllable types increase from neonatal to adult animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zaytseva et al., 2019</xref>), while some very low frequency sonic call types were rarely observed after P20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zaytseva et al., 2020</xref>). By comparison, mouse syllable usage changes during development, but pups produced 10 of the 11 syllable types produced by adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grimsley et al., 2011</xref>). In summary, our understanding of the maturation of vocalization usage remains limitted by our inability to obtain longitudinal data from individual animals within their natural social setting. For example, when recorded in their natural environment, chimpanzees display a prolonged maturation of vocalization complexity, such as the probability of a unique utterance in a sequence, with the greatest changes occuring when animals begin to experience non-kin social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bortolato et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>These results reveal that Mongolian gerbil families possess a rich repertoire of vocalizations used during day-to-day communication. Our findings indicate that long-term behavioral monitoring of a core social unit (i.e. the family) reveals richer vocal behavior than has previously been reported in the species. Leveraging unsupervised machine learning to quantify vocalizations, we reveal family-specific vocalization usage and transition structure. Taken together, these findings establish the Mongolian gerbil as a useful model organism for studying the neurobiology of vocal interactions in complex social groups.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental animals</title><p>Three gerbil families (<italic>Meriones unguiculatus</italic>, n=6 per family: 2 adults, 4 pups) were used in this study (Charles River).

The âget_onset_offsetsâ function, which performs the segmenting, requires the selection of a number of parameters which affect segmenting performance. The following values were tuned via an interactive procedure which validated that the segmenting could detect low amplitude vocalizations and capture individual vocal units apparent by eye:</p><p><code xml:space="preserve">seg_params = {

In this specific use case, th_2 (5) will always come before th_1 (2), therefore the gray dashed line will always be the offset. A subsequent onset will be marked if the sound amplitude crosses th_2 or th_3, whichever comes first. For example, the first sound event detected in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> shows the sound amplitude rising above the black dashed line (th_3) and marks an onset. Subsequently, the amplitude trace falls below the gray dashed line (th_2) and an offset is marked. Finally, the amplitude rises above th_2 without dipping below th_3 and an onset for a new sound event is marked. Had the amplitude dipped below th_3, a new sound event onset would be marked when the amplitude trace subsequently exceeded th_3 (e.g. between sound event 2 and 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The maximum and minimum syllable durations were selected based on published duration ranges of gerbil vocalizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">RÃ¼bsamen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kobayasi and Riquimaroux, 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Vocalization extraction</title><p>We computed the spectral flatness of each detected sound event using the python package librosa (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/librosa">https://github.com/librosa</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McFee et al., 2024</xref>).

Although the number of discrete call types is likely less than 70, it is plausible that variation due to vocalizer identity pushes some calls into unique clusters. This idea is supported by the fact that both naked mole rats and Mongolian gerbils have been shown to exhibit individual-specific variation in vocalizations, though only in single call types (Figure 1 from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barker et al., 2021</xref>; Table I from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nishiyama et al., 2011</xref>).

Lower values suggest distributions are more similar and higher values suggest distributions are more dissimilar. We investigated the null hypothesis that the gerbil families used the same vocal repertoireâthat is the probability distribution over VAE latent space for each family was identical, corresponding to a MMD<sup>2</sup> distance of zero. To test this null hypothesis, we computed the MMD<sup>2</sup> distance between the empirical distributions of family pairs in batches of 1000 randomly sub-sampled vocalizations. This yielded a histogram of empirically observed MMD<sup>2</sup> distance values for each family pair, which we compared a null distribution generated by randomly permuting the family label attached to each vocalization.

Next, using the VocalPy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nicholson, 2023</xref>) âsimilarity_featuresâ function (a python implementation of the Sound Analysis Pro Sound Analysis Tools library: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://soundanalysispro.com/matlab-sat">http://soundanalysispro.com/matlab-sat</ext-link>), the following acoustic features were calculated: fundamental frequency (pitch), amplitude, entropy, frequency modulation, goodness of pitch. In addition to these features, spectral flatness was computed using librosa (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://librosa.org/doc/latest/generated/librosa.feature.spectral_flatness.html">https://librosa.org/doc/latest/generated/librosa.feature.spectral_flatness.html</ext-link>), and duration was computed from the raw audio itself. Finally, start and stop frequencies were computed by taking the median fundamental frequency within the first third and last third (time) of each vocalization, respectively.</p><p>The following spectrogram parameters were used: nfft = 512, noverlap (a.k.a hop_length)=256, Fs = 125000, min_freq = 65, max_freq = 62,500. Features are computed on a spectrogram frame-by-frame basis. Single values for each vocalization were extracted by taking the median acoustic feature value across all spectrogram frames. The single exception to this was spectral flatness (to remain consistent with the spectral flatness calculation used for amplitude thresholding), which took the mean across all spectrogram frames and used the following spectrogram parameters: n_fft = 256, hop_length = 128, win_length = 256, center = False, power = 2.0.</p><p>Detailed description of the units associated with each feature are located here: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://soundanalysispro.com/manual/chapter-4-the-song-features-of-sap2">http://soundanalysispro.com/manual/chapter-4-the-song-features-of-sap2</ext-link>.

Are they attributable to &quot;dialect,&quot; call usage, or specific vocalizing individuals (e.g., adults vs. pups)? Further investigation, via a literature review or additional observation, into acoustic differences between adult and pup calls is recommended. Moreover, a consistent post-weaning decrease in the bottom-left cluster (Fig. S3) invites interpretation: could this reflect drops in pup vocalization?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing up this point of clarification. Without knowledge of individual vocalizers, we are unable to rigorously assess pronunciation differences between individuals, however we can get a clear proxy for dialect through observing usage differences between families. Weâve added the following text (blue) in the Discussion to help clarify:</p><p>âTo address whether gerbils also exhibit family specific vocal features, we compared GMM-labeled vocal cluster usages across the three recorded families and showed differences in vocal type usage (Figure 3). The differences in this study align with the definition of human vocal dialect, which is a regional or social variety of language that can differ in pronunciation, grammatical, semantic and/or language use differences (Henry et al., 2015). This definition of dialect is inclusive of both pronunciation differences (e.g. a Bostonianâs characteristic pronunciation of âcarâ as âcahâ) and usage differences (e.g. a Bostonianâs preferential usage of the words âGo Red Soxâ vs. a New Yorkerâs preferential usage of the words âGo Yankeesâ). In our case, vocal clusters can be rarely observed in some families yet highly over-expressed in others (e.g. analogous to language usage differences in humans), or highly expressed in both families, but contain subtle spectrotemporal variations (Figure 3D, Family 1 cluster 11 vs. Family 3 clusters 2, 18, 30; e.g. analogous to pronunciation differences in humans).â</p><p>Indeed, our recordings obtained after pup removal could suggest that adults may use fewer low frequency calls (bottom left cluster in UMAP). However, this dataset does not permit a proper assessment of post-weaning pup calls. In fact, our results and the literature shows that adults are likely to use low frequency calls, but only during social interactions with pups or other adults. For example, Furuyama et al. 2022 describe a number of low frequency call types used by adults in agonistic social interactions, which look similar to a low frequency call type used by pups described in Silberstein et al. 2023. Similarly, Ter-Mikaelian et al. 2012 (their Figure 6) recorded several types of sonic vocalizations during adult social interaction. To our knowledge, it has not been shown whether gerbil pups and adults produce distinct call types. It is a challenging problem to solve, as animals placed in isolation (i.e. an experimental condition for which the identity of the vocalizer is known) vocalize infrequently and of the limited number they might emit, they do not use the full range of vocalizations described in the literature (RP personal observations). To properly address this question, one would need to elicit full use of the vocal repertoire through free social interaction, then attribute calls to individual vocalizers via sound source localization and/or head-mounted microphones â we are currently pursuing both of these technical challenges, but this is outside the scope of this manuscript.</p><p>Although the literature reflects the limitations discussed above, we have added a brief paragraph to the Discussion (limitations section) that addresses the reviewerâs question about the development of vocalizations:</p><p>âAlthough we were not able to attribute vocalizations to individual family members, we did seek to determine the importance of family structure by comparing audio recordings before and after removal of the pups at P30. The results show a clear effect of family integrity, and the sudden reduction of sonic calls following pup removal (Figure S3) could suggest that these vocalizations are produced selectively by pups.</p><p>However, there is ample evidence that adult gerbils also produce sonic vocalizations. For example, a number of low frequency call types are used by adults during a range of social interactions (Ter-Mikaelian et al., 2012; Furuyama et al., 2022), some of which are similar to a low frequency call type used by pups (Silberstein et al., 2023). Vocalization patterns of developing gerbils depend on isolation or staged interactions. Thus, when gerbil pups are recorded during isolation, ultrasonic vocalization rate declines and sonic vocalizations increase for animals that are in a high arousal state (De Ghett 1974, Silberstein et al., 2023). As gerbils progress from juvenile to adolescent development (P17-55) a significant increase in ultrasonic vocalization rate is observed during dyadic social encounters, with a distinct change in usage pattern that depends upon the sex of each animal (Holman &amp; Seale 1991, Holman et al. 1995). The development of vocalization types has been assessed in another member of the Gerbillinae subfamily, called fat-tailed gerbils (Pachyuromys duprasi), during isolation and handling. Here, the number of ultrasonic vocalization syllable types increase from neonatal to adult animals (Zaytseva et al. 2019), while some very low frequency sonic call types were rarely observed after P20 (Zaytseva et al. 2020). By comparison, mouse syllable usage changes during development, but pups produced 10 of the 11 syllable types produced by adults (Grimsley et al. 2011). In summary, our understanding of the maturation of vocalization usage remains limited by our inability to obtain longitudinal data from individual animals within their natural social setting. For example, when recorded in their natural environment, chimpanzees display a prolonged maturation of vocalization complexity, such as the probability of a unique utterance in a sequence, with the greatest changes occuring when animals begin to experience non-kin social interactions (Bortolato et al. 2023).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Developmental progression, particularly during pre-weaning periods when pup vocal output remains unstable, might be another factor influencing cross-family vocal differences. Representing data from this non-stationary process as an overall density map could result in the loss of time-dependent information. For instance, were dominating call types consistently present throughout the recording period, or were they prominent only at specific times? Displaying the evolution of the density map would enhance understanding of this aspect.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great suggestion. Thank you for bringing it up. To address this, we have added an additional figure (Figure 4) to the main text (Note that the former Figure 4 is now Figure 5). New text associated with this new figure was added to the Results and Discussion sections:</p><p>Results</p><p>âVocal usage differences remain stable across days of development It is possible that the observed vocal usage differences could result from varying developmental progression of vocal behavior or overexpression of certain vocal types during specific periods within the recording. To assess the potential effect of daily variation on family specific vocal usage, we visualized density maps of vocal usage across days for each of the families (Figure 4A). There are two noteworthy trends: (1.) the density map remains coarsely stable across days (rows) and (2.) the maps look distinct across families on any given day (columns). This is a qualitative approximation for the repertoireâs stability, but does not take into account variation of call type usage (as defined by GMM clustering of the latent space). Figure 4B, shows the normalized usage of each cluster type over development for each family. Cluster usages during the period of âfull family, shared recording daysâ (postnatal days beneath the purple bars) are stable across days within families â as is apparent by the horizontal striations in the plot â though each family maintains this stability through using a unique set of call types. This is addressed empirically in Figure 4C, which shows clearly separable PCA projections of the cluster usages shown in Figure 4B (purple days). Finally, we computed the pairwise Mean Max Discrepancy (MMD) between latent distributions of vocalizations from individual recording days for each of the families (Figure 4D). This shows that across-family repertoire differences are substantially larger than within-family differences. This is visualized in a multidimensional scaling projection of the MMD matrix in Figure 4E.â</p><p>Discussion</p><p>âThe described family differences collapse data from multiple days into a single comparison, however itâs possible that factors such as vocal development and/or high usage of particular vocal types during specific periods of the recording could explain family differences. Therefore, we took advantage of the longitudinal nature of our dataset to assess whether repertoire differences remain stable across time. First, we visualized vocal repertoire usage across days as either UMAP probability density maps (Figure 4A) or daily GMM cluster usages (Figure 4B). Though qualitative, one can appreciate that family repertoire usage remains stable across days and appears to differ on a consistent daily basis across families. To formally quantify this, we first projected GMM cluster usages from Figure 4B into PC space and show that family GMM cluster usage patterns are highly separable, regardless of postnatal day (Figure 4C). If families had used a more overlapping set of call types, then the projections would have appeared intermixed. Next, we performed a cluster-free analysis by computing the pairwise MMD distance between VAE latent distributions of vocalizations from each family and day (Figure 4D). This analysis shows very low MMD values across days within a family (i.e. the repertoire is highly consistent with itself), and high MMD values across families/days (greater than would be expected by chance; see shuffle control in Figure S2D). The relative differences in this matrix are made clear in Figure 4E, which provides additional evidence that family vocal repertoires remain stable across days and are consistently different from other families. Taken together, we believe that this is compelling evidence that differences in vocal repertoires between families are not driven by dominating call types during specific phases in the recording period; rather, families consistently emit characteristic sets of call types across days. This opens up the possibility to assess repertoire differences over much shorter time periods (e.g. 24 hours) in future studies.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Family-specific vocalizations were credited to the transition structure, a finding that may seem obvious if the 1-gram (i.e., the proportion of call types) already differs. This result lacks depth unless it can be demonstrated that, firstly, the transition matrix provides a robust description of the data, and secondly, different families arrange the same set of syllables into unique sequences.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these important suggestions. We agree that it is true that the 2-gram transition structure must vary based on the 1-gram structure. To determine whether this influences the interpretation of the finding, we have added Figure S5 and the following text in the Results section:</p><p>âTo determine whether differences in 1-gram structure contribute to differences in the transition (2-gram) structure, we performed a number of controls. Although subtle, vertical streaks are clearly present in shuffled transition matrices that correspond to 1-gram usages (Figure S5A-B). Given the shuffled data structure, we sought to determine whether the observed transition probabilities differed significantly from chance levels. We randomly shuffled label sequences 1000 times independently for each family to generate a null transition matrix distribution. Using these null distributions and the observed transition probabilities, we computed a p-value for each transition using a one-sample t-test and created a binary transition matrix indicating which transitions happen above chance levels (Figure S5C, black pixels, p &lt;= 0.05 after post hoc Benjamini-Hochberg multiple comparisons correction). As is made clear in Figure S5C, most transitions for each family occur significantly above chance levels, despite the inherent 1-gram structure. Moreover, by looking at transitions from a highly usage cluster type used roughly the same proportion across families (cluster 12), we show that families arrange the same sets of vocal clusters into unique sequences (Figure S5D). We believe that this provides compelling evidence that the 1-gram structure does not change the interpretation of the main claim that transition structure varies by family. âââ</p><p>To address your second point, we inspected frequent transitions from individual syllables to all other syllables using bigram transition probability graphs. This revealed a common trend that across all families, many shared and unshared transitions existed, suggesting that families use the same sets of syllables to make unique transition patterns. Figure S5D shows a single syllable example of the phenomenon, with red lines indicating the shared transition types between families and black showing transition patterns not shared between families (i.e. unique family-specific transitions, or lack thereof).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Peterson et al., perform a series of behavioral experiments to study the repertoire and variance of Mongolian gerbil vocalizations across social groups (families).

Our thinking is that we are capturing these ~12 (plus a few more, as illustrated in Figure 2C) as well as individual or family-specific variations of some call types. Although the number of discrete call types is likely less than 70, itâs plausible that variation due to vocalizer identity pushes some calls into unique clusters. This idea is supported by the fact that both naked mole rats and Mongolian gerbils have been shown to exhibit individual-specific variation in vocalizations, though only in single call types (Barker 2021, Figure 1; Nishiyama 2011, Table I). The current study is not ideal to test this prediction, as we cannot attribute each vocalization to individual family members. Using our 4-mic array, we attempted to apply established sound source localization techniques to assign vocalizations to individuals (Neunuebel 2015), but the technique failed, presumably due to high amounts of reverberation in the arena. We are currently developing a custom deep learning based sound localization algorithm, and had hoped to extract individual animal vocalizations from our data set (part of the reason why this manuscript has taken longer than expected to return!), but the performance is not yet satisfactory for large groups of animals. We have added text to the Methods sections with the context outlined above to further justify the use of ~70 clusters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â¢ As a main conclusion of the paper rests on the different distribution of sound clusters across families, it is important to validate the robustness of these differences across different cluster parameters.

Around 70 clusters is when the likelihood begins to plateau, though itâs clear that there are a number of reasonable cluster sizes. To assess whether cluster size has an effect on interpretation of the family differences result, we added Figure S5, where we varied the number of GMM clusters used and compared cluster usage differences across families (Figure S4A). We quantified pairwise family differences in cluster usage by computing the sum of the absolute value of differential cluster usages, for each GMM cluster value (Figure S4B). We find that relative usage differences remain unchanged across the range of cluster values used, indicating that GMM cluster size does bias the finding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â¢ While VAEs are powerful tools for analyzing complex datasets in this case they are restricted to analysis of spectrogram images. Have the authors identified any acoustic differences (i.e. in pitch, frequency, and other sound components) across families?</p></disp-quote><p>Though itâs true that this VAE is limited to spectrograms, the VAE latent space has been shown to correspond to real acoustic features such as frequency and duration, and contain a higher representational capacity than traditional acoustic features (Goffinet 2021, Figure 2). Therefore, clustering of the latent space necessarily means that vocalizations with similar acoustic features are clustered together regardless of their family identity.</p><p>Despite this, your point is well taken that there could be systematic differences in certain acoustic features for specific call types. We are not able to ascertain this with the current dataset. This is addressed in Barker 2021 by recording a single call type (soft chirp) from individuals within and across families. Mongolian gerbils have been shown to exhibit individual differences in the initial, terminal, minimum, and maximum frequency of the ultrasonic up-frequency modulated call type (Figure 2, top right green; Nishiyama 2011, Figure 1A). Therefore itâs possible that family-specific differences exist for that particular call type. To assess whether other call types show family or individual differences, itâs necessary to either (1) elicit all call types from an animal in isolation or (2) determine vocalizer identity in social-vocal interactions. The problem with the former idea is that gerbils only produce up-frequency modulated USVs in isolation and there is no known way to elicit the full vocal repertoire in single animals. The latter idea would allow for full use of the vocal repertoire, but requires invasive techniques (e.g., skull-implanted microphones, or awake-behaving laryngeal nerve recordings) that permit assignment of vocalizations to individuals during a natural social interaction. We are actively exploring solutions to both problems.</p><p>Itâs likely that future studies will look deeper into acoustic differences between individuals and families. Therefore, we have added acoustic feature quantification of vocalizations in each of the GMM clusters as a reference (Figure S6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, Peterson et al. longitudinally record and document the vocal repertoires of three Mongolian gerbil families. Using unsupervised learning techniques, they map the variability across these groups, finding that while overall statistics of, e.g., vocal emission rates and bout lengths are similar, families differed markedly in their distributions of syllable types and the transitions between these types within bouts. In addition, the large and rich data are likely to be valuable to others in the field.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>- Extensive data collection across multiple days in multiple family groups.</p><p>- Thoughtful application of modern analysis techniques for analyzing vocal repertoires. - Careful examination of the statistical structure of vocal behavior, with indications that these gerbils, like naked mole rats, may differ in repertoire across families.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>- The work is largely descriptive, documenting behavior rather than testing a specific hypothesis.</p><p>- The number of families (N=3) is somewhat limited.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the number of families is relatively small. However, our new analysis of vocal repertoire by postnatal day (Figure 4) demonstrates that the finding is quite robust. A high sample-size study was outside the scope of this initial observational study given the difficulty of obtaining and processing longitudinal data of this scale. In light of new analyses in Figure 4, we are confident that future studies will not need so much data to characterize family-specific differences. A single 24-hour recording should be sufficient, making comparison of many more families relatively straightforward.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Several minor concerns:</p><p>(1) The three thresholds used for vocalization segmentation lack explanation.</p><p>Figure 1C's first vocal event appears to define the first gap via the gray threshold (th_2, as the trace does not cross the black line) and the second gap via the black threshold (th_1 or th_3). And this is not addressed in the Methods section.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We agree, this is presented in an unnecessarily complicated way. We have updated the methods section describing the thresholding procedure.</p><p>âSound onsets are detected when the amplitude exceeds 'th_3' (black dashed line, Figure 1C), and sound offset occurs when there is a subsequent local minimum e.g., amplitude less than 'th_2' (gray dashed line, Figure 1C), or 'th_1' (black dashed line, Figure 1C), whichever comes first. In this specific use case, th_2 (5) will always come before th_1 (2), therefore the gray dashed line will always be the offset. A subsequent onset will be marked if the sound amplitude crosses th_2 or th_3, whichever comes first. For example, the first sound event detected in Figure 1C shows the sound amplitude rising above the black dashed line (th_3) and marks an onset. Subsequently, the amplitude trace falls below the gray dashed line (th_2) and an offset is marked. Finally, the amplitude rises above th_2 without dipping below th_3 and an onset for a new sound event is marked. Had the amplitude dipped below th_3, a new sound event onset would be marked when the amplitude trace subsequently exceeded th_3 (e.g. between sound event 2 and 3, Figure 1C). The maximum and minimum syllable durations were selected based on published duration ranges of gerbil vocalizations (Ter-Mikaelian et al. 2012, Kobayasi &amp; Riquimaroux, 2012).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The determination of multi-syllabic calls could be explained further. In Figure 1C, for instance, do syllables separated by short gaps (e.g., the first syllable and the rest of the first group, and the third group in this example) belong to the same call or different calls?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added an operational definition of mono vs. multisyllabic calls in the Results section:</p><p>âVocalizations occur as either single syllables bounded by silence (monosyllabic) or consist of combinations of single syllables without a silent interval (multisyllabic).â</p><p>Under this definition, the examples you mentioned in Figure 1C are considered monosyllabic. One could reasonably expand the definition to include calls separated by less than X ms of silence for example, however we choose not to do that in this study. A deeper understanding of the phonation mechanisms for different gerbil vocalization types would be helpful to more rigorously determine the distinction between mono vs. multisyllabic vocalizations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Labeling the calls shown in Fig. 3D in the latent feature space would help highlight within-family diversity and between-family similarities.</p></disp-quote><p>Great suggestion. We have updated Figure 3 to include where in UMAP space each familyâs preferred clusters are.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) In the introduction, the statement, &quot;Therefore, our study considers the possibility that there is a diversity of vocalizations within the gerbil family social group&quot; doesn't naturally follow from the previous example. This could be rephrased.</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed, thank you. We revised this section of the introduction to flow better.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>While outside the scope of the current study the authors may consider the following experiments and analysis for future studies:</p><p>â¢ Do vocal repertories retain their family signatures across subsequent generations of pups? (i.e. if vocalizations are continually monitored during second or third litters of the same parents).</p><p>â¢ Do the authors observe any long-term changes in family repertoires related to the developmental trajectory of the pups? Are there changes in individual pup vocal features or sound type usage throughout development?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these great suggestions. Given that naked mole rats learn vocalizations through cultural transmission, it would be interesting to see whether other subterranean species with complex social structures (gerbils, voles, rats) have similar abilities. A straightforward way to assess this possibility could be as you suggest â are latent distributions of vocalizations from multi-generational families closer together than cross-family differences? If true, this would provide compelling evidence to investigate further.</p><p>We partially address your second suggestion in our response to Reviewer 1 and in Figure S4, which shows that the family repertoire remains stable throughout this particular period of development. This doesnât rule out the possibility that there could be other phases of development that undergo more vocal change. Your final suggestion is an area that we are actively researching and eager to know the answer to. A follow-up question: could differences in pup vocal features contribute to differential care by parents?</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>In all, I found the paper clearly written and the figures easy to follow. One small suggestion:</p><p>Figure 1: I can't see the black and gray thresholds described in the caption very well. Perhaps a zoom-in to the first 0.15s or so of the normalized amplitude plot would better display these.</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed, thank you.
