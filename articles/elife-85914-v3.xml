can lead to development of inflammatory skin lesions. We have previously shown that Langerhans cells (LCs) limit keratinocyte apoptosis and photosensitivity via a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17)-mediated release of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands and that LC ADAM17 sheddase activity is reduced in lupus. Here, we sought to understand how the lupus skin environment contributes to LC ADAM17 dysfunction and, in the process, differentiate between effects on LC ADAM17 sheddase function, LC ADAM17 expression, and LC numbers. We show through transcriptomic analysis a shared IFN-rich environment in non-lesional skin across human lupus and three murine models: MRL/lpr, B6.Sle1yaa, and imiquimod (IMQ) mice. IFN-I inhibits LC ADAM17 sheddase activity in murine and human LCs, and IFNAR blockade in lupus model mice restores LC ADAM17 sheddase activity, all without consistent effects on LC ADAM17 protein expression or LC numbers. Anti-IFNAR-mediated LC ADAM17 sheddase function restoration is associated with reduced photosensitive responses that are dependent on EGFR signaling and LC ADAM17. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a known mediator of ADAM17 activity; we show that UVR-induced LC ROS production is reduced in lupus model mice, restored by anti-IFNAR, and is cytoplasmic in origin. Our findings suggest that IFN-I promotes photosensitivity at least in part by inhibiting UVR-induced LC ADAM17 sheddase function and raise the possibility that anifrolumab ameliorates lupus skin disease in part by restoring this function. This work provides insight into IFN-I-mediated disease mechanisms, LC regulation, and a potential mechanism of action for anifrolumab in lupus.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>lupus</kwd><kwd>langerhans cells</kwd><kwd>interferons</kwd><kwd>photosensitivity</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>ADAM17</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005332</institution-id><institution>Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society Carolyn L.

manifests in part by photosensitivity, a sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) whereby even ambient sunlight can trigger the development of inflammatory skin lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Foering et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim and Chong, 2013</xref>). In patients with the systemic form of the disease (SLE), with or without diagnosed cutaneous lupus (CLE), photosensitive skin responses can also be associated with worsening systemic autoimmunity and end organ damage. Photosensitive skin inflammation, the accompanying risk of systemic disease flares, and the lifestyle modifications such as sun avoidance needed to prevent UVR-induced skin inflammation all contribute to reduced quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bachen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Foering et al., 2012</xref>). Insight into mechanisms that underlie photosensitivity remain limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Estadt et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sim et al., 2021</xref>), and better understanding of pathophysiology will help to advance therapeutic options.</p><p>To study the pathophysiology that drives photosensitivity, we have focused on studying non-lesional skin to delineate mechanisms that have already gone awry that lead to photosensitivity. We recently reported that Langerhans cells (LCs) can limit UVR-induced skin inflammation by expressing a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17), which releases membrane-bound epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands that then preserve epidermal integrity via EGFR stimulation of keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shipman et al., 2018</xref>). Two distinct photosensitive SLE mouse models showed a reduction in LC <italic>Adam17</italic> mRNA in non-lesional skin which corresponded to reduced LC ADAM17 sheddase activity, and we could reduce photosensitivity by circumventing the reduced EGFR ligand shedding with topical EGFR ligand application. Together, these data suggested that reduction of LC ADAM17-dependent EGFR-ligand sheddase activity contributes to photosensitivity. However, no murine ADAM17 antibody was available to differentiate between diminished LC ADAM17 protein level versus sheddase function. Non-lesional skin of SLE patients showed reduced epidermal EGFR phosphorylation and a subset had reduced LC numbers, suggesting that reduced LC ADAM17 sheddase function, LC ADAM17 expression and/or LC numbers could potentially contribute to pathology. Thus, our previous study put forth a new model for LC dysfunction in lupus photosensitivity but the mechanisms that lead to LC dysfunction and distinguishing among the regulation of LC ADAM17 sheddase function, protein expression, and LC numbers remained to be fully elucidated.</p><p>A prominent interferon (IFN) signature indicative of exposure to type I interferon (IFN-I) is found in tissues and circulating cells in lupus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baechler et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bennett et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Catalina et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Der et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jabbari et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kirou et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martínez et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Psarras et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Psarras et al., 2022</xref>), and the recent FDA approval of anifrolumab (anti-IFNAR1) for SLE highlights the importance of IFN-I in disease pathogenesis. Numerous studies have pointed to an IFN-I-rich environment in even non-lesional skin based on transcriptomic signatures of skin from SLE and CLE patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Billi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Der et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Der et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Psarras et al., 2020</xref>), upregulation of keratinocyte IFN-κ expression in keratinocytes of CLE, SLE, and ANA +patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Psarras et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stannard et al., 2017</xref>), and upregulation of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) such as <italic>MX1</italic> on tissue sections in SLE, incomplete SLE, and ANA +patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lambers et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Psarras et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reefman et al., 2008</xref>). Remarkably, the IFN signature in both lesional and non-lesional skin is greatly enriched compared to the signature in blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Psarras et al., 2020</xref>), further pointing to a potential pathogenic role for IFN-I in lupus skin disease, and the IFN-I-rich environment in grossly unaffected skin points to a role for IFN-I in potentially predisposing to lesion development. Functionally, the reduced skin lesions in IFNAR-deficient SLE model mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nickerson et al., 2013</xref>) is consistent with this idea, and, indeed, anifrolmab is especially efficacious for skin disease in SLE patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Furie et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Merrill et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Morand et al., 2020</xref>). Mechanisms by which IFN-I contributes to and anifrolumab exerts this ameliorative effect on lupus skin disease, however, remains to be better understood.</p><p>Here, we consider LC dysfunction in the context of the high IFN levels in lupus, and test the hypothesis that the IFN-I-rich environment present in even non-lesional lupus skin promotes LC dysfunction to contribute to photosensitivity. We extend accumulating human data showing an IFN-I signature in non-lesional CLE skin and establish that non-lesional skin from photosensitive MRL/lpr, B6.Sle1yaa, and imiquimod (IMQ) SLE models share IFN signatures with human skin. IFN-I was sufficient to inhibit LC ADAM17 sheddase activity without consistent effects on surface expression levels or altering LC numbers in healthy murine and human LCs. Conversely, anti-IFNAR treatment of SLE mouse models restored LC ADAM17 sheddase function without affecting expression levels or LC numbers. Anti-IFNAR restoration of LC ADAM17 sheddase function was associated with reduced photosensitive response, and this anti-IFNAR effect was dependent on EGFR signaling and LC ADAM17. Lastly, we show that UVR-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) known to promote ADAM17 sheddase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Singh et al., 2009</xref>), was reduced in lupus model LCs, that anti-IFNAR restored ROS expression, and that ROS was of cytoplasmic origin. Together, our results establish that multiple photosensitive murine SLE models are similar to human lupus patients in demonstrating IFN signatures in non-lesional skin and put forth a mechanism whereby IFN-I contributes to photosensitivity at least in part by inhibiting LC sheddase ADAM17 activity. These data provide insight into IFN-I-mediated contributions to photosensitivity, delineate a driver of LC dysfunction, and suggest the possibility that restoration of LC ADAM17 function is a mechanism of action for anifrolumab in lupus skin disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Non-lesional skin from human lupus and murine models share an IFN-rich environment</title><p>To understand mechanisms that lead to the LC defects seen in non-lesional skin of SLE mouse models and human SLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shipman et al., 2018</xref>), we assessed the non-lesional skin transcriptomic profiles from human lupus patients and multiple murine models. We examined a non-lesional skin microarray dataset from a CLE cohort with the discoid form of CLE (DLE) that had not been previously analyzed and was part of a cohort whose lesional skin was shown to have a Th1 signature when compared to healthy controls and psoriatic skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jabbari et al., 2014</xref>).

Reanalysis of the lesional skin here reiterated the GSVA results of multiple datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martínez et al., 2022</xref>), showing enrichment of immune cell gene sets including plasma cells, T cells, monocyte/myeloid cells, neutrophils, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) when compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).

The upregulation of IFN response genes in lesional DLE skin extended to gene signatures indicative of response to specific IFNs, including IFN-Is (IFN-α, β, κ, and ω) and type II IFNs (IFN-γ; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The IFN-γ signature is consistent with the Th1 signature identified in the original study examining these gene expression data along with cellular phenotyping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jabbari et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Non-lesional skin also showed upregulation of the IFN gene set in GSVA when compared to healthy controls, although this change was more modest than in lesional skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–G</xref>), similar to that seen in the QuSAGE analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). IFN gene set changes in non-lesional skin were driven by IFN-α, IFN-κ, and IFN-ω gene set upregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Non-lesional skin showed de-enrichment of the LC gene set and this effect was more modest than in lesional skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and G</xref>), consistent with the noticeable loss of LCs in lesional skin compared to adjacent non-lesional skin by immunostaining of tissue sections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sontheimer and Bergstresser, 1982</xref>). In contrast, non-lesional skin showed de-enrichment of the keratinocyte gene set, an effect not seen in lesional skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and G</xref>), suggesting a distinct biology in non-lesional and lesional skin. GSVA, then, showed that while lesional skin was characterized by a proinflammatory IFN-rich environment and reduction of LC signals, non-lesional skin had a less inflammatory environment but one that was notable for an IFN response and LC reduction.</p><p>We next examined non-lesional ear skin from MRL/lpr, B6.Sle1yaa, and imiquimod (IMQ) SLE mouse models by RNAseq.

Similar to human DLE, the IFN gene set upregulation in MRL/lpr non-lesional skin was broad, with significant enrichment of gene signatures induced by stimulation from multiple IFNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). B6.Sle1yaa mice showed less dramatic differences than the MRL/lpr model, but also showed upregulation of the IFN gene set without a particular contribution from any one IFN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref>). The LC gene set was de-enriched in B6.Sle1yaa mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), driven in part by the reduction in <italic>Cd207</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), potentially reflecting decreased LC numbers or altered LC phenotypes. The contralateral ‘non-lesional’ ears from IMQ-treated mice also exhibited significant upregulation of the IFN gene signature and were similar to MRL/lpr mice in showing enriched gene signatures of myeloid cells, IL21, and TNF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). T cell genes were uniquely de-enriched in IMQ skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The LC gene set was not altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), although there was de-enrichment in IMQ-painted ipsilateral skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similar to human DLE and MRL/lpr mice, the IFN signature in non-lesional IMQ skin reflected enrichment of multiple IFN-I gene sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Interestingly, the overall IFN gene set was not enriched in the IMQ-painted ipsilateral skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), although there was enrichment in two of the specific IFN signatures (IFNB1 and IFNW1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This suggested a distinct biology such as tissue damage in the skin that received repeated direct exposure to IMQ.

These results suggest that the IFN-rich environment in even non-lesional lupus skin promotes photosensitivity by at least in part by causing LC ADAM17 dysfunction and raises the possibility that the beneficial effects of anifrolumab on skin disease in SLE patients reflects the restoration of LC ADAM17 sheddase function. Our results also suggest that photosensitivity in the MRL/lpr, B6.Sle1yaa, and IMQ lupus models shares pathogenic mechanisms with human lupus, underscoring the utility of these models for the study of lupus skin pathophysiology.</p><p>Our transcriptomic data both expand on the characterization of non-lesional DLE skin and provides new characterization of non-lesional skin in MRL/lpr, B6.Sle1yaa, and IMQ lupus models. Comprehensive transcriptomic analyses of non-lesional lupus model skin has not been available previously and our data serve as a resource for understanding shared or distinct pathways between human lupus and murine models or among the distinct lupus models. Lupus patients are heterogeneous, which in part contributes to the difficulties in clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2021</xref>). Understanding how specific lupus models can be used for studying different aspects of human lupus will help to advance disease insights and precision medicine approaches, especially as we consider how different tissues communicate with and regulate one another in disease.</p><p>Our data here, and especially the experiments showing the importance of EGFR signaling and LC ADAM17 in the ameliorative effects of anti-IFNAR on photosensitive responses, suggest that LC ADAM17 sheddase inhibition is a mechanism by which the IFN-rich environment primes non-lesional skin for photosensitive responses. This mechanism does not preclude parallel mechanisms such as potentiation of IL-6 expression and apoptosis of keratinocytes and activation of multiple other cell tyoes shown in the human system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sarkar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stannard et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Billi et al., 2022</xref>). Given that LCs are positioned among the suprabasal layer of the epidermis near basal and spinous keratinocytes that demonstrate high IFN expression and signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Billi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Psarras et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sarkar et al., 2018</xref>), keratinocytes are likely to be an important source of IFN-I that causes LC ADAM17 sheddase dysfunction. This possibility coupled with our data here point to a potential pathogenic feed-forward loop between LCs and keratinocytes in lupus skin whereby keratinocyte-derived IFN-I causes LC ADAM17 sheddase dysfunction and this dysfunction contributes to greater UVR-induced keratinocyte damage, skin inflammation, and, over time, lesion formation.</p><p>Our findings suggest the possibility that IFNs have distinct functions in non-lesional and lesional skin. Physiologically, skin upregulates IFN-I with injury and infection, and the IFN is important in part for tissue repair and wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gregorio et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wolf et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). This may explain why anti-IFNAR treatment of control MRL/+mice with physiologic IFN-I levels increased UVR-induced skin inflammation and suggests that the IFN-I in non-lesional skin in mic and humans reflects a repair response to a mild insult such as immune complex deposition that forms the ‘lupus band’ found in non-lesional human lupus skin. The upregulated IFN in non-lesional skin, by causing LC ADAM17 dysfunction or heightened keratinocyte responses, serves to ‘prime’ the skin for further injury and a second insult such as UVR manifests as a photosensitive response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Billi et al., 2022</xref>). Because the repair response is compromised, IFN signaling continues to be upregulated, further inhibiting repair responses and promoting inflammation, tissue damage processes, and lesion formation. In this model, then, IFN in non-lesional skin primes for further injury, and the (higher) IFN in lesional skin reflecting frustrated tissue repair, continues to prime but also contributes to tissue damage. IFNAR blockade, then, should both prevent new lesion formation and treat existing lesions as long as physiologic IFN levels for wound healing are preserved. Understanding the regulation and sources of the excess IFN-I in non-lesional and lesion skin will help to further develop therapies that ameliorate disease.</p><p>Our results extend the understanding of ADAM17 dysregulation as a contributor to disease. Increased ADAM17 activity can promote inflammation, such as by release of TNF or EGFR ligands within inflamed joints or lupus kidneys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Issuree et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Qing et al., 2018</xref>); yet loss of ADAM17 can compromise barrier surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blaydon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Franzke et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we identify IFN-I as a negative regulator of LC ADAM17 sheddase function, and our data suggest a scenario whereby IFN-I reduces LC ROS generation to inhibit ADAM17 function. Further investigation will better delineate the importance of LC ROS generation as well as contributions of other molecules such as the inactive Rhomboids (iRhoms) that regulate ADAM17 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Geesala et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>This report importantly distinguishes among IFN-I regulation of LC ADAM17 sheddase function, LC ADAM17 surface molecule expression, and LC numbers. Our data here showing that the regulation of LC ADAM17 sheddase activity by IFN-I is uncoupled from LC ADAM17 protein expression and LC numbers (summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) supports the idea that LC ADAM17 sheddase function dysregulation is a key contributor to the propensity for photosensitivity and is thus a therapeutic target. The uncoupling of ADAM17 sheddase activity from protein expression is consistent with the known biology of ADAM17 on other cell types, where sheddase function is triggered by many stimuli on other cell types including UVR and G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and controlled by mediators such as ROS and iRhoms, as we and others have shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zunke and Rose-John, 2017</xref>). We speculate that the ability to modulate ADAM17 enzymatic function offers the ability to regulate UVR responses in a more timely manner and with a much greater and tunable dynamic range than control of <italic>Adam17</italic> transcription and translation or LC numbers. Targeting the effects of IFN-I on LC ADAM17 sheddase function, then, offers the opportunity to have a large impact in protecting the skin and systemic complications.</p><p>A future direction will be to further understand LC functional phenotypes in human lupus and murine models. Our data along with recent reports indicates that LC loss is a feature of human lupus skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Billi et al., 2022</xref>), with the effect being variable in non-lesional skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martínez et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shipman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sontheimer and Bergstresser, 1982</xref>; this report) and a greater more consistent effect in lesional skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bos et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martínez et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sontheimer and Bergstresser, 1982</xref>). On the other hand, LC numbers appeared less affected in lupus mouse models, with reduction of the LC signature in the 5-month-old B6.Sle1yaa non-lesional skin and in the IMQ painted ear of IMQ mice, but otherwise with normal LC numbers in non-lesional skin of MRL/lpr, 10-month-old B6.Sle1yaa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shipman et al., 2018</xref>) and IMQ mice (this report). Notably, the LC numbers and LC signature in non-lesional IMQ skin, despite being statistically unchanged from that of controls, is variable, suggesting LC loss in some mice and bearing similarities to the variability in human non-lesional skin. These data suggest similar trends between human and mouse models in LC loss, with mouse models perhaps being less severely affected. The extent to which LC ADAM17 sheddase dysfunction represents a milder or just a different dysfunction than loss of LCs, the regulation of LC numbers via regulation of survival, migration, replenishment, the consequences to skin and immune function, and similarities and differences between LCs in human disease and murine systems awaits further study.</p><p>High IFN-I states are also seen in viral infections, genetic interferonopathies, and other autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and dermatomyositis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Muskardin and Niewold, 2018</xref>) in which photosensitivity is found in the former and is a disease hallmark in the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Werth et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wysenbeek et al., 1989</xref>).

Scores across all samples were normalized to values between –1 (indicating no enrichment) and +1 (indicating enrichment). Gene sets used as input for GSVA are listed in<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3 supp9">Supplementary files 3 and 9</xref>. The human gene sets were previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martínez et al., 2022</xref>). The mouse plasma cell, T cell, myeloid cell, neutrophil, pDC, dendritic cell, and keratinocyte gene sets were derived from Mouse CellScan, a tool for the identification of cellular origin of mouse gene expression datasets. The mouse IFN gene sets have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kingsmore et al., 2021</xref>). The mouse cytokine signatures were generated by an iterative process involving derivation through literature mining and GO term definitions provided by the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) GO Browser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bult et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>We determined the normality of data distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk test. For normally distributed data, we used two-tailed unpaired and paired Student’s t-tests for comparisons between two conditions to evaluate p-values as indicated. For data that were not normally distributed, the Mann-Whitney test was used for unpaired and Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test for paired comparisons. Significance was defined as p&lt;0.05. GraphPad Prism software was used. For figures showing normalized values, the control sample was set to one, and the experimental samples were normalized relative to the control for that experiment. For experiments that contained more than one control sample, the mean was obtained for the control samples, and the individual control and experimental samples were calculated relative to this mean.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>is an employee of AMPEL BioSolutions, but has no financial conflicts of interest to report</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>was awarded the Lupus Therapeutics: The Clinical Trial Network Infrastructure Grant, received by The Albert Einstein College of Medicine.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Betty Diamond as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>1) The authors present the data on TNFR1 MFI change in the three different lupus-prone mice but no differences were detected in the actual ADAM17 protein expression. Quantifying changes in Adam17 activity in the photosensitive models in relation to Adam17 levels and numbers of LCs, both of which are affected by UV exposure, would better establish the proposed axis. Knock out mice for ADAM17 or a blocking antibody for Adam17 with assessment of the Langerhans cell function would be helpful to directly prove the hypothesis.</p><p>2) The authors should try to link their data to the existing literature and validate their results by using human samples, as not all murine lupus models have a strong interferon-mediated disease, as with the MRL/lpr mouse model. Also, no difference in LC numbers was reported with the B6.Sle1yaa lupus-prone model.</p><p>3) The authors suggest that LC ROS is reduced in lupus model mice and restored by anti-IFNAR treatment. Measurement of an increase in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in the cells triggered by UVR would be helpful. LCs from actual lupus patients are not used in the experiment.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>It would be helpful to discuss why there is such a focus on nonlesional skin, when lesional biopsies show an even greater decrease in LCs. They also have higher levels of IFN that in nonlesional skin. Also, lesional skin is photosensitive.</p><p>Line 195-197. It is stated that there is a loss of epidermal LC and keratinocyte function in the context of an IFN-rich pro-inflammatory environment, leading to photosensitivity in nonlesional lupus skin. The data shown in Figure 1 shows that upregulation of IFNs is significantly higher in lesional than nonlesional skin. It would be helpful to discuss the implications of the lesional data also.</p><p>It would be helpful to compare lesional and nonlesional in terms of the signatures shown in Figure 1 G and H. Is nonlesional different in terms of the IFN subtypes relative to lesional skin?</p><p>Langerhans cells were lower in lesional than nonlesional DLE, so not sure the parallel with early diseased mice B6.Sle1yaa mice and DLE is correct. Presumedly established DLE is more like the older mice who didn't show a difference in Langerhans cells once the disease was established. Would suggest revising this section a bit.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Non-lesional skin in lupus model mice share an IFN-I signature and other functional gene expression modules with human lupus skin:</p><p>1. Lesional and non-lesional single-cell RNA seq analysis was recently published by Bili et al. (https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.abn2263).</p><p>2. Important literature is missing: Keratinocytes in non-lesional lupus skin produce IFN-kappa (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41584-022-00826-z). Upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) was already described in the blood and non-lesional skin of ANA-positive individuals. This ISG upregulation was indeed lower compared to lesional skin from SLE patients (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-19918-z).</p><p>3. The MRL/lpr lupus-prone model has a less type I IFN-mediated disease, so it is not surprising that the authors found less significant changes compared to the control model.</p><p>4. The results from the B6.Sle1yaa lupus-prone model are equally less convincing. No difference in LC numbers was reported, whilst the authors only found Cd207 expression downregulation in 5-month deceased mice. These results are hard to interpret and to be associated with pathology in humans.</p><p>5. The results of ISG upregulation in the imiquimod (IMQ) model have been described in the literature many times; it is well established that imiquimod can induce an interferon response via TLR7 activation and upregulation of IRF target genes such as Irf7, Irf8 and Stat1.</p><p>6. The authors report that Isg15 was upregulated in the non-lesional ears of the IMQ mice, but the interpretation of the results needs more careful consideration. Isg15 was shown to be upregulated and secreted by plasmablasts in lupus patients inducing antibody-independent inflammation (https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1600624).</p><p>7. The authors conclude that &quot;These data are consistent with the idea that non-lesional skin is primed for photosensitive responses and that LCs sit within an IFN-rich environment in both human lupus and multiple murine models that may cause LC dysfunction&quot;. Non-lesional skin has been shown to contribute to IFN-mediated responses as cited above. However, the authors do not provide robust in vitro or in vivo confirmation about how this IFN response mediates distinct phenotypes of LCs.</p><p>IFN-I inhibits LC ADAM17 function</p><p>1. The authors assessed LC ADAM17 function by quantifying UVR-induced cell surface TNFR receptor 1 (TNFR1) shedding as &quot;previously described&quot;. They need to provide insights about their methodological approach and not just simply cite a previously published article.</p><p>2. The authors present data in Figure 4 only for the WT mice and some human LCs. LCs do not seem to be isolated from skin biopsies of lupus patients, whilst IFN-kappa is used for murine LCs but IFN-β for human LCs. Why is there a different approach to choosing other type I IFNs?</p><p>IFNAR is important for LC ADAM17 dysfunction in multiple lupus models</p><p>1. The authors present the data on TNFR1 MFI change in the three different lupus-prone mice but no differences were detected in the actual ADAM17 protein expression. These results are difficult to interpret. Have the authors considered knocking out the mice for ADAM17 and reassessing the function of LCs?</p><p>Anti-IFNAR reduces photosensitivity in an EGFR and LC ADAM17-dependent manner</p><p>1. The authors suggest that anti-IFNAR increased photosensitivity in non-lupus mice. How is this related to human data clearly showing that UVR is linked to photosensitivity by inducing IFN-kappa expression by keratinocytes both in vitro and in vivo (http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2018-213197 and https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-19918-z)?</p><p>IFN-I inhibits UVR-induced LC ROS expression</p><p>1. In figure 7, the authors suggest that LC ROS is reduced in lupus model mice and restored by anti-IFNAR treatment. They use ROS indicator but they have not tried to measure if there is an increase in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in the cells triggered by UVR. LCs from actual lupus patients are not used in the experiment.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– The analysis of the publicly available human data is extensive and largely confirms the already published findings of high IFN signatures in non-lesional and lesional DLE skin. While it is encouraging that the overall analyses of IFN-I response and immune cell signatures are consistent with already published findings, the sheer amount of data distracts from the finding most relevant to this study: decreased Langerhans Cell signature in non-lesional and lesional skin. The reviewer suggests the data in Figure 1 be summarized in 1 or 2 more comprehensive panels (e.g. a heatmap of cell signatures or cytokine signatures).</p><p>– Similar to the human data, the findings of differential gene signatures in the skin of the murine lupus models could be summarized in a more comprehensive manner. The amount of data distracts from the most significant findings, particularly in B6.Sle1yaa model: decreased DC signature and increased IFN signature. Likewise, the reader is left to wonder at the end of Figure 2 if the IMQ-induced IFN response is accompanied by a decrease in LC numbers and/or function.</p><p>– Summarizing the data as the IFN-I signature may be useful in Figure 2J to provide a better insight into the IFN-I response overall.</p><p>– Computational analyses in Figures 1 and 2 emphasize the co-occurrence of a high IFN-I signature and a low LC and/or DC signature. It is not clear if the downregulation of the DC gene set indicates diminished presence of LCs in the non-lesional skin of the lupus mouse models or &quot;reflects decreased LC function&quot; as the authors suggest.</p><p>– The significance of the Th1 signature in the CLE cohort discussed in line #149 to the interferon signature is unclear.</p><p>– Unclear what figure the findings in lines #175-178 refer to?</p><p>– Unclear what figure the findings in lines #310-315 refer to?</p><p>– The specificity of ADAM17 for TNFR1 is not explicitly stated. The previously published data using the LCad17 mouse should be emphasized and some of the supplemental data included in the main figures.</p><p>– In Figure 7 it is not clear whether and how the ROS are being specifically measured in LCs.</p><p>– Given the hypothesis that IFN-I may be the cause of a decreased DC signature in the mouse skin, it would be relevant to ask if this signature is also decreased in the IMQ model, which is a known model of IFN-induction as confirmed by the authors. Likewise, asking how anti-IFNAR treatment affects the DC signature / LC numbers would be important, in the absence and presence of UV. The authors indicate in Figure 5I that IMQ reduces LC numbers.</p><p>– Decreased inflammation in LCad17 mice in the IMQ+UV model is unexpected. Previous studies by this group showed increased UV-induced inflammation in the absence of LC-ADAM17 (Shipman et al. 2018). Is it possible that IMQ treatment prior to UV sets off a negative feedback loop that counteracts absence of Adam17? If the authors treated LCad17 mice with anti-IFNAR IgG prior to UV in the absence of IMQ, would the results defer? UV light is an inducer of IFN itself so may serve as the relevant stimulus.</p><p>– UV light is an important inducer of IFN. Authors have previously shown that UV also induces Adam17 expression. Therefore, the question remains whether a high baseline IFN signature in lupus skin suppresses UV-induced Adam17 expression?</p><p>– A direct mechanistic link between high IFN-I and loss of Adam17 activity driving photosensitive reactions could be strengthened. Would blocking Adam17 with a blocking antibody suppress photosensitive reactions in lupus mouse models? Would treating LCAd17 mice with IFN fail to enhance or diminish UV-induced inflammation?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The interferon-rich skin environment regulates Langerhans cell ADAM17 to promote photosensitivity in lupus&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Betty Diamond (Senior Editor). We apologize that the original Reviewing Editor has become unavailable.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below. Please respond to this as quickly as possible; it should not be necessary to consult reviewers again for the final revision.</p><p>Reviewer 2 remarks that IFN enrichment seems too high for all clusters. Can you please more fully explain your conclusion regarding the IFN signature?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have made a significant effort to address the comments pointed in the first review by reanalysing data, introducing new results, and updating essential literature missing.</p><p>However, I would like to express some concerns about to original validity of the data. The authors state in the revised manuscript that &quot;We had mistakenly shown lesional DLE data rather than non-lesional data for Figures 1A-D in our original submission&quot;. It would be impossible for the reviewing process to validate all data presented and a good will is expected. The authors should be accountable for presenting the right data and results in the first place.</p><p>The authors also state that &quot;they have replaced the limited qPCR data with RNAseq data (Figure 2F-I, Figure 3E-F) to gain a more complete picture of the IFN signature and gene expression in this model&quot;. From the data presenting in Figure 4, I can see how &quot;the non-lesional skin shares key pathways with non-lesional skin of human DLE and other lupus models (Figure 4B), while the IMQ-painted skin surprisingly did not yield an IFN signature (Figure 3—figure supplement 1), potentially reflecting tissue damage or some other distinct biology that reflects the prolonged direct exposure to IMQ&quot;. IFN-enrichment appears to be high in all clusters.</p><p>I would strongly recommend that the revised manuscript requires an expert bioinformatic review to analyse the computational approaches and reported results.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85914.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>1) The authors present the data on TNFR1 MFI change in the three different lupus-prone mice but no differences were detected in the actual ADAM17 protein expression.

The table shows that regulation by IFN-I of LC ADAM17 sheddase activity is uncoupled from LC ADAM17 protein expression and LC numbers, consistent with the idea that IFN (negatively) regulates LC ADAM17 sheddase function to contribute to photosensitivity. The uncoupling of ADAM17 sheddase activity from protein expression is consistent with the known biology of ADAM17, where sheddase function is triggered by a wide variety of stimuli on other cell types including ultraviolet radiation and GPCRs and controlled by mediators such as by ROS and iRHOMs, as established in part by the work of co-author Carl Blobel. We speculate that the ability to modulate ADAM17 enzymatic function offers the ability to regulate UVR responses in a more timely manner and with a much greater and tunable dynamic range than control of ADAM17 transcription and translation or LC numbers. Targeting the effects of IFN-I on LC ADAM17 sheddase function, then, offers the opportunity to have a large impact in protecting the skin and systemic complications. (Text lines 366-375, 487-501 as well as text scattered throughout (66-67, 69-72, 105-113, 323-325, 345, 354-355, 361-365)).</p><p>We also moved data from the Supplementary Materials to new Figure 5A validating the LC ADAM17 shedding assay. We had previously established a facs-based LC ADAM17-mediated shedding assay by quantifying UVR-induced cell surface TNFR receptor 1 (TNFR1) loss at 45 minutes after UVR exposure, extensively validating that this loss reflected shedding activity, paralleled shedding of EGFR ligands into the supernatant, and was dependent on LC ADAM17 (Shipman et al., SciTransMed 2018,10(454):eaap9527). As we had studied LC ADAM17 sheddase activity using isolated LCs, we confirm in Figure 5A that UVR treatment of a mixture of digested epidermal cells also induced LC cell surface TNFR1 loss. This effect was LC ADAM17-dependent, validating UVR-induced LC cell surface TNFR1 loss as a readout of LC ADAM17 activity in the context of a mixture of epidermal cells. (Text lines 298-306).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should try to link their data to the existing literature and validate their results by using human samples, as not all murine lupus models have a strong interferon-mediated disease, as with the MRL/lpr mouse model. Also, no difference in LC numbers was reported with the B6.Sle1yaa lupus-prone model.</p></disp-quote><p>In this extensively revised manuscript, we have included several additional references and expanded our description of literature documenting an IFN-rich environment in non-lesional human skin in the Introduction (lines 118-128). The consistency of this finding across SLE, CLE, and pre-clinical autoimmunity, along with the beneficial effects of anifrolumab on lupus skin, speak to the contribution of IFN-I to lupus skin disease. We show using human cells that IFN-I reduces LC ADAM17 sheddase function without affecting LC ADAM17 protein levels or LC numbers (Figure 5N-P), supporting the idea that IFN inhibits LC ADAM17 activity to contribute to photosensitivity.</p><p>We have added new RNAseq data of IMQ skin (Figure 2F-I, Figure 3E-F, Figure 2—figure supplement 1B, Figure 3—figure supplement 1) to show that all three murine SLE models examined are remarkably consistent in demonstrating upregulated IFN signatures in non-lesional skin, strengthening the idea that the models share pathogenic mechanisms with human lupus. Note that Vital and colleagues have shown that the enrichment of an IFN signature in skin is far greater than the enrichment in blood in SLE and at-risk patients (Psarras et al. 2020, Nature Comm 11:6149), indicating that skin is a specific IFN-rich niche, and the clear IFN signature in LPR skin and functional data could reflect the uniqueness of the skin. This shared IFN signature in non-lesional skin in humans and mice, the evidence in humans that IFN is a driver of photosensitivity, and our data showing that IFN-I inhibits LC ADAM17 sheddase function in both human and murine LCs, that anti-IFNAR reduces photosensitive skin responses in the lupus models and does so in an EGFR- and LC ADAM17-dependent manner together strongly support the idea that IFN-I inhibits LC ADAM17 sheddase function to contribute to photosensitivity.</p><p>We also note that in-depth transcriptomic analysis of murine model non-lesional skin has not been previously done, and that the RNAseq data in the MRL/lpr, B6.Sle1yaa, and Imiquimod models show shared and unique features with human CLE data and each other. These data should serve as a good resource for investigators interested in using these models for studying different aspect of lupus skin disease.</p><p>The reduced LC gene set in B6.Sle1yaa non-lesional skin in the 5 month old mice examined in our current report (Figure 3C) and the unchanged LC numbers in the 10 month old mice we examined in (Shipman et al., SciTransMed 2018 ,10(454):eaap9527) may reflect a loss of LCs at 5 months of age but not at 10 months of age or it may reflect normal LC numbers but an altered LC phenotype with downregulated LC expression of CD207 and other genes in the LC gene set. With regard to the possibility of different LC numbers at 5 and 10 months of age, LC numbers are known to demonstrate a physiologic reduction with age, and a potential scenario is that LCs are reduced in 5 month old B6.Sle1yaa mice (compared to controls) but the physiologic decline in the WT controls by 10 months of age equalizes LC numbers in WT and B6.Sle1yaa mice. We do now comment on LC numbers in human and mice in our Discussion (lines 502-518), but our main focus in this extensively revised manuscript is, as described in Point #1, that our data clearly establish that IFN-I consistently regulates LC ADAM17 sheddase activity (rather than LC ADAM17 expression or LC numbers). These data point to an IFN-I-mediated regulation of LC ADAM17 sheddase function that contributes to IFN-I effects in skin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors suggest that LC ROS is reduced in lupus model mice and restored by anti-IFNAR treatment. Measurement of an increase in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in the cells triggered by UVR would be helpful. LCs from actual lupus patients are not used in the experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our original intracellular ROS staining did not indicate whether the ROS is cytoplasmic or mitochondrial in origin and UVR triggering of increased OXPHOS would suggest the involvement of mitochondria ROS. We now add Figure 8B-C using mitochondrial and cytoplasmic ROS indicators. The data show that UVR stimulates an early increase in cytoplasmic but not mitochondrial ROS. This is consistent with the critical role of cytoplasmic catalase in early UVB-induced ROS generation in keratinocytes (Heck et al. JBC 2003. 278:22432).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>It would be helpful to discuss why there is such a focus on nonlesional skin, when lesional biopsies show an even greater decrease in LCs. They also have higher levels of IFN that in nonlesional skin. Also, lesional skin is photosensitive.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your thoughtful review. We have focused on non-lesional skin because we are interested in understanding the factors that contribute to the propensity to photosensitivity and are thus interested in the mechanisms that have already gone awry in even non-lesional skin. While lesional skin also provides a lot of clues about pathophysiology, it is more difficult to dissociate the initial underlying dysfunction from the effects of tissue damage and contributing effector mechanisms. In this revision, we have expanded on discussion of the lesional data of Figure 1 (lines 165-177) and added to the Discussion on potential distinct roles for IFN in non-lesional and lesional skin (lines 460-477). We also now state in the Introduction why we focus on non-lesional skin (lines 95-97).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 195-197.

The authors present data in Figure 4 only for the WT mice and some human LCs.

In our revised manuscript, we have made a point of clearly distinguishing the effects of IFN on LC numbers, LC ADAM17 protein expression, and LC ADAM17 sheddase activity and find that IFN-I only consistently reduces LC ADAM17 sheddase activity.

The authors suggest that anti-IFNAR increased photosensitivity in non-lupus mice. How is this related to human data clearly showing that UVR is linked to photosensitivity by inducing IFN-kappa expression by keratinocytes both in vitro and in vivo (http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2018-213197 and https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-19918-z)?</p></disp-quote><p>The IFN-I associated with disease is higher than normal, as demonstrated in these two references. These references also show that healthy epidermal cells do express IFN-I expression and will upregulate IFN-I upon stimulation. Normal skin upregulates IFN with injury and IFNAR has been shown to be needed for wound healing in normal mice, suggesting that IFN-I has a physiologic role in wound healing (Gregerio et al. 2010 <italic>J Exp Med</italic> 207:2921-2930)(Wolf et al. 2022 <italic>JCI Insight</italic> 7:e152765). Our interpretation of the anti-IFNAR-induced photosensitivity in non-lupus mice (Figure 7A-E) is that we disrupted the physiologic IFN needed in healthy skin. We have added a paragraph on this topic to the Discussion (lines 460-477).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>IFN-I inhibits UVR-induced LC ROS expression</p><p>12. In figure 7, the authors suggest that LC ROS is reduced in lupus model mice and restored by anti-IFNAR treatment. They use ROS indicator but they have not tried to measure if there is an increase in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in the cells triggered by UVR. LCs from actual lupus patients are not used in the experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our original Figure 7 did not differentiate between cytoplasmic vs mitochondrial sources of ROS, and increased OXPHOS would suggest increased mitochondria ROS. We now add Figure 8B-C using cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ROS indicators and show that UVR stimulates an early increase in cytoplasmic but not mitochondrial ROS. This is consistent with the critical role of cytoplasmic catalase in the early UVR-induced ROS generation found in keratinocytes (Heck et al. JBC 2003. 278:22432).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– The analysis of the publicly available human data is extensive and largely confirms the already published findings of high IFN signatures in non-lesional and lesional DLE skin. While it is encouraging that the overall analyses of IFN-I response and immune cell signatures are consistent with already published findings, the sheer amount of data distracts from the finding most relevant to this study: decreased Langerhans Cell signature in non-lesional and lesional skin. The reviewer suggests the data in Figure 1 be summarized in 1 or 2 more comprehensive panels (e.g. a heatmap of cell signatures or cytokine signatures).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your thoughtful feedback. We have summarized the GSVA findings in human DLE and murine SLE models as a heat map in Figure 4B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Similar to the human data, the findings of differential gene signatures in the skin of the murine lupus models could be summarized in a more comprehensive manner. The amount of data distracts from the most significant findings, particularly in B6.Sle1yaa model: decreased DC signature and increased IFN signature. Likewise, the reader is left to wonder at the end of Figure 2 if the IMQ-induced IFN response is accompanied by a decrease in LC numbers and/or function.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We have summarized all the non-lesional skin GSVA findings in Figure 4B. The LC signature in IMQ mice is now addressed in the new RNAseq analysis (Figure 2F-I, Figure 3E-F, Figure 2—figure supplement 1B, Figure 3—figure supplement 1). LC counts in this model and response to anti-IFNAR are shown in Figure 6I and Figure 7L.

It is not clear if the downregulation of the DC gene set indicates diminished presence of LCs in the non-lesional skin of the lupus mouse models or &quot;reflects decreased LC function&quot; as the authors suggest.</p></disp-quote><p>We now do the GSVA in Figures 1, 3,4, and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 using an LC signature rather than a more general dendritic cell signature. While the reduced LC signature in human DLE correspond to reduced LC numbers in direct tissue analysis, the reduced LC gene signature in B6.Sle1yaa non-lesional skin in the 5 month old mice examined in our current report seems at odds with the unchanged LC numbers in the 10 month old mice we examined in (Shipman et al., SciTransMed 2018 ,10(454):eaap9527). Without doing direct cellular phenotyping and further quantification, we don’t know the extent to which the reduced LC signatures reflect reduced LC numbers at 5 months of age or reduced expression of markers in the LCs. In this extensively revised manuscript, however, our data clearly establish that IFN-I consistently regulates LC ADAM17 sheddase activity rather than LC ADAM17 expression or LC numbers. These data point to an IFN-LC ADAM17 sheddase function axis in skin.

Likewise, asking how anti-IFNAR treatment affects the DC signature / LC numbers would be important, in the absence and presence of UV. The authors indicate in Figure 5I that IMQ reduces LC numbers.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed RNAseq on skin from IMQ mice and also perform GSVA with a Langerhans cell gene set rather than a more general dendritic cell gene set. There is not a relationship between the IFN signature and LC signature. IFN signature is upregulated in the “non-lesional” skin from the unpainted contralateral ear but the LC gene signature is not altered (Figure 2F-I, Figure 3E-F). In the IMQ painted ipsilateral ear , there was a reduced LC signature but no upregulation of an IFN signature (Figure 3-supplement 1). In Figure 6I, we have added more n and now no longer see any change in LC numbers in the “non-lesional” unpainted contralateral ear. We do note that both our facs data and the gene expression data shown that the “non-lesional” skin shows a high level of variability with regard to LC numbers/signatures, similar to our observations in lupus nephritis patients, where a proportion of but not all patients showed reduced LC numbers (Shipman et al., Sci Trans Med, 2018 10: eaap9527). We have added data on the effects of anti-IFNAR on IMQ LC counts both in the absence of UVR (Figure 6I) and after in vivo UVR exposure (Figure 7L); anti-IFNAR does not affect LC numbers in either condition. We have also added a paragraph addressing LC numbers humans and mouse models in the Discussion (lines 502-518). Note that in this extensively revised manuscript, we show that IFN-I consistently regulates LC ADAM17 sheddase activity rather than LC ADAM17 expression or LC numbers, thus pointing to an IFN-LC ADAM17 sheddase function axis in skin (discussed at length in response to Essential Revisions Point #1 first paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Decreased inflammation in LCad17 mice in the IMQ+UV model is unexpected. Previous studies by this group showed increased UV-induced inflammation in the absence of LC-ADAM17 (Shipman et al. 2018). Is it possible that IMQ treatment prior to UV sets off a negative feedback loop that counteracts absence of Adam17? If the authors treated LCad17 mice with anti-IFNAR IgG prior to UV in the absence of IMQ, would the results defer? UV light is an inducer of IFN itself so may serve as the relevant stimulus.</p></disp-quote><p>We had shown that IMQ-treated LCAd17 mice had the same number of monocytes in UVR-treated skin as WT IMQ mice but , in normalized data, reduced neutrophils. Our main comparison was not between WT and LCAd17 cell numbers and when we went back to the primary data; we found that while we had multiple experiments comparing WT with WT+anti-IFNAR and LCAd17 with LCAd17+anti-IFNAR, we had too few experiments that included WT and LCAd17 together to be able to compare them to make firm conclusions. Here, we have put the neutrophil data showing absolute numbers into Figure 7K to be parallel to the graph showing absolute numbers of monocytes and removed the comparison between WT and LCAd17 mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– UV light is an important inducer of IFN. Authors have previously shown that UV also induces Adam17 expression. Therefore, the question remains whether a high baseline IFN signature in lupus skin suppresses UV-induced Adam17 expression?</p></disp-quote><p>Focusing on UVR-induced LC ADAM17 sheddase activity ---yes, our data support that the high baseline IFN in lupus skin suppresses UVR-induced ADAM17 sheddase function. We show that any modest modulation of ADAM17 protein expression that we observe in our different systems do not correlate with modulation of ADAM17 activity, and that IFN only consistently inhibited LC ADAM17 sheddase activity (new Table 1). We did show that murine LCs express <italic>Adam17</italic> mRNA in (Shipman et al., Sci Trans Med, 2018 10: eaap9527) , but the trend toward an increase with UVR was not denoted as a significant effect; this lack of <italic>Adam17</italic> mRNA change is consistent with what we also see in unpublished RNAseq data. Regarding UVR-induced IFN and how that might modulate LC ADAM17 sheddase function—the enzymatic activity is induced within 45 minutes of UVR exposure, based on our LC ADAM17 sheddase assays, whereas UVR-induced IFN seems to take hours (Skopelja-Gardner et al., Sci Rep, 2020 10:7908); it would be interesting to see if that later-onset induced IFN functions in part to turn off ADAM17 sheddase activity in healthy hosts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– A direct mechanistic link between high IFN-I and loss of Adam17 activity driving photosensitive reactions could be strengthened. Would blocking Adam17 with a blocking antibody suppress photosensitive reactions in lupus mouse models? Would treating LCAd17 mice with IFN fail to enhance or diminish UV-induced inflammation?</p></disp-quote><p>We showed in (Shipman et al., Sci Trans Med, 2018 10: eaap9527) that LCAd17 mice lacking ADAM17 in LCs are photosensitive and that compensating for the loss of LC ADAM17 sheddase activity in LPR mice by topical EGFR ligand reduced photosensitivity. These data supported the idea that the reduction in LC ADAM17 sheddase activity contributed to photosensitivity in lupus model mice. In this manuscript, we address the mechanistic link between IFN and ADAM17 function in photosensitivity by showing that anti-IFNAR reduces UVR-induced skin inflammation in an EGFR-dependent manner in LPR mice (Figure 7G-I) and in an LC ADAM17-dependent manner in IMQ mice (Figure 7J-L). For (Figure 7J-L), we induced the IMQ model in WT and LCAd17 mice. While this latter experiment by itself does not differentiate between LC ADAM17 sheddase function and expression levels, we have now clarified that IFN-I regulates LC ADAM17 sheddase function, and this is uncoupled from LC ADAM17 expression (Table 1), further supporting the idea that anti-IFNAR is reducing UVR-induced skin inflammation in an LC ADAM17 function-dependent manner.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below.

In our manuscript, we had noted this lack of enrichment, and Reviewer 2 is noting that the ipsilateral/painted ear does, however, have enrichment of in two of the gene sets used to understand responses to specific IFNs -- the IFNB1 and IFNW1 gene sets. We have now amended our text to point out the enrichment of the IFNB1 and IFNW1 gene sets despite the lack of enrichment of the overall IFN gene set (lines 270-273).</p></body></sub-article></article>
