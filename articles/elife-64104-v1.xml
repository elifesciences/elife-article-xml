ends of chromosomes and are indispensable for the protection and lengthening of terminal DNA. Despite the evolutionarily conserved roles of telomeres, the telomeric double-strand DNA (dsDNA)-binding proteins have evolved rapidly. Here, we identified double-strand telomeric DNA-binding proteins (DTN-1 and DTN-2) in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> as non-canonical telomeric dsDNA-binding proteins. DTN-1 and DTN-2 are paralogous proteins that have three putative MYB-like DNA-binding domains and bind to telomeric dsDNA in a sequence-specific manner. DTN-1 and DTN-2 form complexes with the single-strand telomeric DNA-binding proteins POT-1 and POT-2 and constitutively localize to telomeres. The <italic>dtn-1</italic> and <italic>dtn-2</italic> genes function redundantly, and their simultaneous deletion results in progressive germline mortality, which accompanies telomere hyper-elongation and chromosomal bridges. Our study suggests that DTN-1 and DTN-2 are core shelterin components in <italic>C. elegans</italic> telomeres that act as negative regulators of telomere length and are essential for germline immortality.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>telomere</kwd><kwd>shelterin</kwd><kwd>POT-1</kwd><kwd>POT-2</kwd><kwd>DTN-1</kwd><kwd>dyn-2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005009</institution-id><institution>Assar Gabrielssons Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FB 17-10</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shibuya</surname><given-names>Hiroki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008444</institution-id><institution>O.

The telomere nucleoprotein complex has various pivotal functions such as protection of chromosome ends, lengthening of the terminal DNA, and promotion of meiotic homolog pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dilley and Greenberg, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shay, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shibuya et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shibuya et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Although telomeres have ancient evolutionarily conserved roles and conserved DNA sequences, the telomeric double-strand DNA (dsDNA)-binding proteins have evolved rapidly, a phenomenon referred to as the telomere paradox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Saint-Leandre and Levine, 2020</xref>). Despite their low-sequence conservation, telomeric dsDNA-binding proteins in a wide variety of species – such as the fission yeast protein Taz1, the plant protein RTBP1, the protist (<italic>Trypanosoma</italic>) protein tbTRF, and the mammalian proteins TRF1 and TRF2 – typically have a single MYB-like DNA-binding domain (MYB) at their C-termini (known as a telobox) that directly recognizes the telomeric dsDNA in a sequence-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Broccoli et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Spink et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yu et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>A deviation is found in budding yeast, where telomeric dsDNA is bound by the Rap1 protein with two tandem MYB domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Konig et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Krauskopf and Blackburn, 1996</xref>), and this deviation has been attributed to the atypical telomeric dsDNA sequence (heterogeneous and not GC-rich) in this organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Červenák et al., 2017</xref>). Another deviation is found in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, which has a typical telomeric dsDNA sequence (TTAGGC)n, but its genome does not have any TRF-like single MYB domain proteins or RAP1-like telomeric proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wicky et al., 1996</xref>). There have been several reports showing that some transcription factors and chromatin remodelers, such as CEH-37 and HMG-5, bind to telomeric dsDNA in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, but deletions of these factors did not show any chromosomal defects, thus leaving the true regulator of telomeric dsDNA unidentified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Im and Lee, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kim et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lanjuin et al., 2003</xref>). It is curious why <italic>C. elegans</italic> lost the typical telomeric dsDNA-binding proteins while retaining the typical telomeric DNA sequence and how they maintain telomeric functions without these telomeric proteins. The identification of telomeric dsDNA-binding proteins in this organism will provide information on how general telomeric function is ensured by different telomeric dsDNA-binding proteins.</p><p>The recognition of telomeric dsDNA via dsDNA-binding proteins leads to assemblies of downstream telomere-associating proteins, thus forming the shelterin complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Palm and de Lange, 2008</xref>). An evolutionarily conserved component of the shelterin complex is the protection of telomere (POT) proteins, which directly recognize the telomeric single-strand DNA (ssDNA) through their conserved OB-fold domains. POT proteins generally act as negative regulators of telomerases through competitive binding to the telomeric ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kelleher et al., 2005</xref>). Different from the dsDNA-recognition proteins, the POT proteins are well conserved, including in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and it is reported that POT-1 and POT-2 (also known as CeOB2 and CeOB1) in <italic>C. elegans</italic> function as negative regulators of telomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Raices et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shtessel et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we screened for proteins that bind to POT-1 and identified two uncharacterized proteins, double-strand telomeric DNA-binding protein 1 and 2 (DTN-1 and DTN-2), in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. DTN-1 and DTN-2 are paralogous proteins, sharing 70% amino acid identity with each other. We performed secondary structure predictions and identified three tandem MYB domains at their N-termini, and we found that they exhibited sequence-specific dsDNA-binding activity toward telomeric sequences. DTN-1 and DTN-2 localized to telomeres both in somatic cells and germ cells from embryo to adulthood suggesting that they are constitutive telomere-binding proteins in vivo. Notably, the double knockout worm showed synthetic fertility defects that were transgenerationally progressive and were accompanied by various chromosomal defects, including chromosomal non-disjunction in meiosis, chromosomal bridges, and abnormal extensions of telomeric DNAs. Our findings suggest that DTN-1 and DTN-2 are bona fide telomeric dsDNA-binding proteins in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and that they are indispensable for the maintenance of germline immortality and telomere length homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DTN-1 and DTN-2 form complexes with POT-1 and POT-2</title><p>In order to identify novel telomeric proteins in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we used a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) approach to screen for POT-1-binding proteins from the <italic>C. elegans</italic> mixed-stage cDNA library, and we identified two functionally uncharacterized proteins encoded by the <italic>R06A4.2</italic> and <italic>T12E12.3</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These proteins, hereafter referred as double-strand telomeric DNA-binding proteins 1 and 2 (DTN-1 and DTN-2), respectively, have three putative MYB domains tandemly aligned in their N-terminal regions followed by a cluster of acidic amino acids in the middle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), which is similar to the domain configuration of the canonical c-MYB transcription factor. The POT-1-binding region (PBR) identified by the Y2H screening is located at the C-termini of these proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), where the amino acid sequences are highly conserved between DTN-1 and DTN-2 (80% identity). We confirmed by the Y2H analysis that both DTN-1 and DTN-2 bind to POT-1, but not POT-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), in a manner dependent on the C-terminal PBR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In order to verify their in vivo interactions, we integrated three tandem FLAG tags followed by a GFP tag onto the endogenous <italic>dtn-1</italic> and <italic>dtn-2</italic> loci using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, and we purified the endogenous protein complex by FLAG immunoprecipitation (IP). Western blot showed the specific enrichment of the DTN-1-FLAG-GFP and DTN-2-FLAG-GFP proteins in the knock-in strain extracts, but not in wild type (N2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Western blot with polyclonal antibodies against POT-1 and POT-2 showed that both endogenous POT-1 and POT-2 proteins were co-precipitated with both DTN-1-FLAG-GFP and DTN-2-FLAG-GFP, proving that they form stable complexes in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Quantitative mass spectrometry analysis, which is an antibody-independent approach and is more comprehensive, also confirmed the presence of POT-1 and POT-2 in the FLAG immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The reciprocal IP experiments of GFP-POT-1 and POT-2-GFP from endogenously tagged strains also showed that both GFP-POT-1 and POT-2-GFP co-precipitated endogenous DTN-1 and DTN-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Together these results suggest that DTN-1 and DTN-2 are telomeric proteins in <italic>C. elegans</italic> that directly bind to POT-1 and indirectly bind to POT-2 in vivo.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>DTN-1 and DTN-2 form complexes with POT-1 and POT-2.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Genes identified in the POT-1 Y2H screening with the number of identified clones. (<bold>B</bold>) Schematic of the DTN-1 and DTN-2 protein sequences highlighting the MYB domains, acidic domains, and C-terminus POT-1-binding regions (PBR).

The average numbers of these foci per nucleus were 23 and 22 for DTN-1-FLAG-GFP and DTN-2-FLAG-GFP, respectively, which approximately corresponded to the number of telomeres in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (12 chromosomes and 24 telomeres). Further, the observation of pachytene oocytes in the knock-in worms’ germlines showed approximately half the number of foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, average of 12 foci per nucleus for both DTN-1 and DTN-2), which was likely due to the occurrence of meiotic homologous synapsis that reduces the apparent numbers of telomeres by half. The close observation of condensed bivalent chromosomes at the later diakinesis stage of meiosis showed eight distinct foci located at the ends of condensed chromosomes, corresponding to the telomeres of the individual chromatids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). To further confirm that these foci represent the telomeres, we performed immunostaining of the knock-in worms with a GFP antibody followed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with a <italic>C. elegans</italic> telomeric DNA probe (TTAGGC)<sub>3</sub>. In the embryonic nuclei, the observed GFP foci were almost completely colocalized with the telomeric FISH signals, proving that these GFP foci were bona fide telomeric signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In addition to embryos and germline cells, we also observed punctate GFP foci in all post-mitotic somatic nuclei in adult worms, including epidermal cells and intestinal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Intestinal cells in <italic>C. elegans</italic> become polyploid during post-embryonic development after undergoing several rounds of endomitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hedgecock and White, 1985</xref>), and accordingly we observed numerous GFP foci in the adult intestinal nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) consistent with their larger telomere number compared to other somatic cells.

As an alternative, we performed quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization (Q-FISH) using the telomeric probe. To eliminate artifacts caused by differences in cell cycle stage, we focused on post-mitotic somatic nuclei found in adult worms. Notably, the double KO worms had stronger telomeric FISH signals compared to wild type (N2) worms, and quantification in epidermal nuclei showed that the signal intensities in double KO worms were 5.7 times stronger than in wild type (N2) worms, suggesting that telomeric DNAs were abnormally elongated in the double KO worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).

Collectively, we conclude that DTN-1 and DTN-2 are redundantly required for germline immortality, while having distinct roles in the maintenance of telomere length, and if they are deleted simultaneously the worms exhibit mortal germlines accompanied by multiple chromosomal defects, including X chromosome non-disjunction in meiosis, chromosomal bridges, and hyper-elongation of their telomeric DNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Canonical telomeric dsDNA-binding proteins have a single MYB domain at their C-termini and are found in a number of eukaryotic species, including fission yeast, protists, plants, and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bilaud et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Broccoli et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Červenák et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Spink et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yu et al., 2000</xref>). Even with extensive efforts, corresponding telomeric dsDNA-binding proteins have not been identified in the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Conventional genetic screening for isolating mutant worms with mortal germlines successfully identified several key factors, such as MRT-2 and MRT-1 that are indispensable for telomeric DNA replication and telomerase activity respectively, but failed to identify the key telomeric dsDNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed and Hodgkin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Meier et al., 2009</xref>). Using protein-interaction screening, the present study identified two non-canonical telomeric dsDNA-binding proteins, DTN-1 and DTN-2, in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. DTN-1 and DTN-2 are paralogous proteins and have redundant roles in the maintenance of germline immortality. Notably, even a single allele of either the <italic>dtn-1</italic> or <italic>dtn-2</italic> gene is sufficient to sustain germline immortality, which is likely to be the reason why these factors have evaded identification by conventional genetic screenings.</p><p>Structural modeling of DTN-1 and DTN-2 identified three putative MYB domains at their N-terminal regions followed by an acidic domain, which is similar to the domain configuration of the c-MYB transcription factor. The MYB domains of DTN-1 and DTN-2 are highly divergent from those of other telomeric proteins, and thus they seem to have distinct evolutionary origins. It is still unclear why these distinct telomeric proteins evolved while the telomeric DNA sequence has remained rather static (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bilaud et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>For the recognition of dsDNA, two MYB domains function as a unit to hold the dsDNA. The canonical telomeric proteins, with single MYB domains, such as TRF1, TRF2, Taz1, and RTBP1, achieve this by forming a homodimer through their N-terminal domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bianchi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fairall et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Spink et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yu et al., 2000</xref>). In the case of the c-MYB transcription factor, two successive MYB domains (MYB2 and MYB3) within a single molecule are responsible for direct dsDNA recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sakura et al., 1989</xref>). In the present study, we have shown that both DTN-1 and DTN-2 have robust sequence-specific dsDNA-binding activity toward the <italic>C. elegans</italic> telomeric sequence. It will be interesting to investigate how the three tandem MYB domains in DTN-1 and DTN-2 orchestrate substrate binding by determining their crystal structure. Structural comparison with the known telomeric proteins or with the c-MYB transcription factor might also provide insight into the evolutionary origin of these non-canonical dsDNA-binding proteins.</p><p>Telomeres are characterized by the 3′ G-rich ssDNA overhang found in almost all eukaryote species, and these overhangs are bound by the POT proteins (POT1 in human) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Palm and de Lange, 2008</xref>). In humans, the telomeric dsDNA-binding proteins TRF1 and TRF2 are responsible for the telomeric localization of POT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sfeir and de Lange, 2012</xref>). TRF1 and TRF2 (as well as their accessary protein RAP1) indirectly bind to and recruit POT1 through the bridging proteins TIN2 and TPP1, and thus they form the hetero-hexameric shelterin complex TRF1-TRF2-RAP1-TIN2-TPP1-POT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Lange, 2018</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, there are both 3′ G-rich and 5′ C-rich ssDNA overhangs at terminal DNAs, which are bound by POT-2 and POT-1, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Raices et al., 2008</xref>). We found that the C-termini of DTN-1 and DTN-2 directly bind to POT-1, and thus there seem to be no bridging proteins analogous to mammalian TIN2 and TPP1 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. In this sense, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> shelterin complex seems to be a more simplified system, where the dsDNA recognition module is directly connected to the ssDNA recognition module. It is noteworthy that mammalian TPP1 is not merely the bridging protein required for the localization of POT1, and it also functions as a regulator of telomerase activity through direct binding to the telomerase catalytic subunit TERT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nandakumar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2007</xref>). DTN-1 and DTN-2 are much bigger proteins than mammalian TRF1 and TRF2, and it is possible that DTN-1 and DTN-2 have some additional functions – such as telomerase regulation – that are carried out by mammalian TPP1. Given that we could not detect any direct interaction between DTN-1/2 and POT-2, it is possible that there are uncharacterized bridging proteins linking DTN-1/2 and POT-2 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and such proteins might have an analogous function as mammalian TIN2 and TPP1. The analysis of the epistatic relationships between these proteins, as well as the screening of additional factors that bind to DTN-1 and DTN-2, should help to fully uncover the function of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> shelterin complex and show how telomerase is regulated in this organism.</p><p>The primary role of DTN-1 and DTN-2 in the maintenance of telomere homeostasis remains enigmatic. We have shown that the double KO worms showed signs of chromosomal abnormalities such as chromosomal non-disjunction in meiosis I (as indicated by a high incidence of male progeny) and chromosomal fusions in intestinal cells. Together with the progressive sterility phenotypes found in the double KO worms, it is speculated that these mutants are defective in the homeostasis of telomeric dsDNA, ssDNA, or both. Indeed, our data showed that the double KO and <italic>dtn-1</italic> single KO worms, but not <italic>dtn-2</italic> single KO worms, had extremely long telomeres compared to wild type (N2). These findings suggest that DTN-1 and DTN-2 have distinct roles in the maintenance of telomere length, and the role of DTN-1 seems similar to that of fission yeast Taz1, budding yeast Rap1, and mammalian TRF1, the deletions or mutations of which result in the hyper elongation of telomeric DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cooper et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Krauskopf and Blackburn, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">van Steensel and de Lange, 1997</xref>). Notably, the deletion of <italic>pot-1</italic>, <italic>pot-2</italic>, or both in <italic>C. elegans</italic> results in the hyper elongation of telomeres in a manner dependent on telomerase, but these worms do not exhibit chromosomal fusion or a high incidence of male progeny and are completely fertile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Raices et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shtessel et al., 2013</xref>). This suggests that the hyperelongated telomeres in the <italic>dtn-1</italic> and <italic>dtn-2</italic> double KO worm are less likely to be the primary reason for the observed chromosomal defect and their mortal germlines, and thus there must be some additional defects such as deprotection of telomeres and subsequent activation of the DNA-damage response pathway in the double KO worms. Further analyses will show how DTN-1 and DTN-2 protect telomeric DNAs and how evolutionarily conserved telomeric function is ensured by these distinct telomeric proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

The peptide samples were treated using the HiPPR detergent removal resin kit (PN 88305, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions with 25 mM TEAB solution as the equilibration buffer. Sodium deoxycholate was precipitated and removed by acidification with 10% TFA and subsequent centrifugation. The supernatants were purified using Pierce peptide desalting spin columns (PN 89851, Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified peptide samples were dried on Speedvac and reconstituted in 15 μl of 3% acetonitrile and 0.2% formic acid for the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>LC-MS</title><p>LC-MS experiments were performed on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer interfaced with an Easy-nLC1200 nanoflow liquid chromatography system (both from Thermo Fisher Scientific). A total of 8 µl out of 15 μl of each peptide sample were trapped on an Acclaim Pepmap 100 C18 trap column (100 μm × 2 cm, particle size 5 μm, Thermo Fischer Scientific) and separated on an analytical column (75 μm × 35 cm) packed in-house with Reprosil-Pur C18 material (particle size 3 μm, Dr. Maisch, Germany) using a gradient with 0.2% formic acid in water as solvent A and 80% acetonitrile with 0.2% formic acid as solvent B at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. The elution profile was as follows: 5% to 33% B in 77 min, 33% to 100% B in 3 min, and 100% B for 10 min. Precursor ion scans were performed at 120,000 target resolution with an m/z range of 375–1500 and an AGC target of 4e5. The most abundant precursors with charges 2–7 were selected for fragmentation with a maximum duty cycle of 3 s and a dynamic exclusion duration of 45 s. Precursors were isolated with a 1.0 Da window and fragmented by higher energy collision-induced dissociation at 30% collision energy with a maximum injection time of 150 ms and an AGC target 5e4, and the MS<sup>2</sup> spectra were recorded at 30,000 resolution.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>MS data analysis</title><p>Peptide and protein identification and quantification were performed using Proteome Discoverer version 2.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The LC-MS files were matched against the <italic>C. elegans</italic> reference Uniprot database (May 2020) supplemented with common proteomic contaminants (26924 proteins in total) using Mascot 2.5.1 (Matrix Science, London, United Kingdom) as a database search engine with trypsin and one allowed missed cleavage as an enzyme rule, with the precursor tolerance of 10 ppm and fragment tolerance of 0.03 Da; methionine oxidation was set as a variable modification, and methylthiolation on cysteine was set as a fixed modification. Fixed Value PSM validator was used to assess the quality of peptide matches. Precursor ion quantification was accomplished via the Minora feature detection node in Proteome Discoverer 2.4, with the maximum peak intensity values used for quantification. Transfer of identifications between the runs was disabled. Abundance values for all unique peptides were used to calculate the protein abundances, and the intensity normalization was disabled.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>The experiments were not randomized, so no statistical method was used to predetermine sample size, and the investigators were not blinded to allocation during the experiments or to outcome assessment. Each conclusion in the manuscript was based on results that were reproduced in at least three independent experiments. Sample sizes, statistical tests, and p-values are indicated in the text, figures, and figure legends.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Marc Pilon and his lab members (University of Gothenburg) for valuable discussions and generous help with daily experiments.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Matt Kaeberlein as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jan Karlseder, Salk Institute (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study provides compelling insights into the function of <italic>C. elegans</italic> Shelterin components. The consensus reached was that the study is well-executed and that isolation of nematode double stranded telomeric binding proteins carrying myb domains is a novel result. The reviewers also noted the high quality of evidence in the form of FLAG-GFP DTN-1/2 analysis in knock-in animals. The study presents convincing biochemical analysis of telomere length regulation and stability and reports evidence of redundancy of DTN-1 and DTN-2 in terms of lethality. Overall, we feel that this is an important study that should be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The reviewers made some major suggestions and comments, most of which can most likely be addressed using existing data and/or through further analysis and discussion of data already presented.</p><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>1) Please address reasons why phenotypes of <italic>dtn-1</italic> and <italic>dtn-2</italic> mutants are so different when the proteins are so similar at the amino acid level? The EMSA data in Figure 2D hints at potential differences in their behaviour. As DTN-1 concentration increases, the DTN-1-DNA complex mobility changes, suggesting that increasing copies of DTN-1 are binding to DNA. This is not the case for DTN-2 and it is curious that DTN-2 migrates aberrantly on SDS-PAGE. It would be interesting to map the DNA binding sites for both proteins and to see whether in combination, they alter DNA binding e.g. Budding yeast Rap1 (2xMyb domains) binds 13bp of DNA (3UGK) but together with Rif1/2 can selectively binds much longer fragments (Thoma lab, Cell 2013).</p><p>2) One of the interesting ideas touched upon is that <italic>C. elegans</italic> may not need a separate shelterin component (e.g. Tpp1) to bridge dsDNA and ssDNA binding proteins. However, this is not well developed and the discussion should be deepened and expanded.</p><p>3) The specificity of anti-POT-1 and anti-POT-2 antibodies should be described especially as Figure 1E shows both antibodies detecting multiple protein bands in the input lane. Also, the FLAG-IP should be repeated with DNase to see whether the POT-2 – DTN-1/2 co-IP is DNA mediated. This is essential to support their model in Figure 5H.</p><p>4) The authors could include oligos with single to double strand transitions (3' and 5' overhangs) to determine whether these are preferences. This could give information about the complex in regards to interactions with POT-1 and POT-2.</p><p>5) The numbers of telomeric dots in the double deletions could be analyzed better. Without access to the statistics, it seems that there are many more dots than in the wild type. This could indicate extrachromosomal telomeric DNA, or telomere fragility. Along these lines, is it possible to look at the chromosome number in the double deletion, to check whether there are fusions or fragments present? I understand that there are limited possibilities due to the mortality phenotype.</p><p>6) Reviewers suggested that it would be useful to carry out telomere Southern blot in <italic>dtn-1/2</italic> double KO. However, they also appreciated that collecting enough material might be difficult. They suggested Q-FISH as an alternative technology but also suggested that you might simply remove the claim that dtn-1 single mutants had similar length telomeres to <italic>dtn-1</italic>, <italic>dtn-2</italic> double mutants.</p><p>Revisions expected in follow-up work:</p><p>1) It would be better if they perform southern blots of <italic>dtn-1</italic>; <italic>dtn-2</italic> DKO mutants for their TRF changes. This would strengthen their conclusions.</p><p>2) It would be better if they show telomere lengthening/shortening by generations in single mutants DKO mutants.</p><p>3) Examination of chromosomal fusions in single mutants and DKO mutant is recommended. It would be easier to observe chromosomes in arrested oocytes than in intestines.</p><p>4) As raised above, it would be better to discuss how lengthened telomeres and chromosome bridges (probably due to fusions?) are correlated in the double mutants. This is important because it is well known that telomere shortening, rather than lengthening, causes telomere deprotection, DNA damage responses, and fusion via NHEJ.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64104.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>1) Please address reasons why phenotypes of dtn-1 and dtn-2 mutants are so different when the proteins are so similar at the amino acid level?

We have repeated the experiment and confirmed the reproducibility (please find the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> with two additional replicates). We speculate that DTN-1 but not DTN-2 undergoes some conformational changes or has a tendency to homodimerize in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that DTN-1 might have some unique biochemical characteristics, at least in vitro. However, this is still speculative and we want to be cautious before making any interpretations regarding this observation. We are currently working on the crystal structural analyses of DTN-1 and DTN-2 in complex with DNA substrates, and this should provide an unambiguous answer to the above issue in the future.</p><p>As we wrote in the Discussion section, we totally agree with the idea that the identification of DNA binding sites will be a critical experiment for understanding the biochemistry and biology of these MYB proteins. Making random point mutants and examining their DNA binding activities in EMSA would be an experiment we could perform at this point. However, these kinds of experiments can be highly misleading and not very conclusive because we cannot distinguish whether the mutants specifically affect DNA-binding activity or the overall conformation of the protein. To avoid misinterpretations and to unambiguously identify the DNA binding sites it is essential to get structural insights, and as noted above we are currently attempting to crystallize DTN-1 and DTN-2 in complex with DNA substrates.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-64104-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We agree that the absence of bridging proteins (between DTN-1/2 and POT-1) is an interesting feature of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> shelterin complex.

Thus we have now extended the previous discussion by adding the following text.</p><p>“Given that we could not detect any direct interaction between DTN-1/2 and POT-2, it is possible that there are uncharacterized bridging proteins linking DTN-1/2 and POT-2 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and such proteins might have an analogous function as mammalian TIN2 and TPP1. The analysis of the epistatic relationships between these proteins, as well as the screening of additional factors that bind to DTN-1 and DTN-2, should help to fully uncover the function of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> shelterin complex and show how telomerase is regulated in this organism.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The specificity of anti-POT-1 and anti-POT-2 antibodies should be described especially as Figure 1E shows both antibodies detecting multiple protein bands in the input lane.</p></disp-quote><p>Our POT-1 and POT-2 antibodies are polyclonal antibodies.

However, we could not detect any specific GFP-FLAG-POT-1 bands in the corresponding INPUT lane. This is in contrast to the POT-2 case, where the POT-2-GFP band was visible in the corresponding INPUT lane. These results suggest that the amount of POT-1 protein, as well as its endogenously tagged GFP-FLAG-POT-1 protein, are low, making it difficult to detect it in whole worm extracts.However, our antibody specifically detected POT-1 when POT-1 was enriched by IP. As can be seen in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>, we performed GFP IP using a highly specific GFP monoclonal antibody (Roche) from N2, <italic>gfp</italic>::<italic>flag</italic>::<italic>pot-1</italic>, and <italic>pot-2</italic>::<italic>gfp</italic> extracts. In this experiment, our POT-1 antibodies specifically recognized GFP-FLAG-POT-1, but not POT-2-GFP, after IP, thus proving the specificity of the antibody.</p><fig id="respfig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-64104-resp-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><p>To further strengthen our results, we performed co-IP experiments using these newly generated strains. The GFP IPs showed that both endogenous DTN-1 and DTN-2 were co-precipitated with GFP-FLAG-POT-1 and POT-2-GFP, further strengthening our conclusion that DTN1/2, POT-1, and POT-2 form a complex in vivo. We have added these results in Figure 1—figure supplement 3B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, the FLAG-IP should be repeated with DNase to see whether the POT-2 – DTN-1/2 co-IP is DNA mediated.

In Figure 5H, we did not specify which model is true. We would like to avoid making premature conclusions and be open to both possibilities at this point. We are currently trying to identify the putative bridging proteins by POT-2 IP followed by mass spectrometry as well as by the POT-2 yeast two-hybrid screening. We hope to be able to settle this argument in future studies. To make this point clear, we have added a description to the figure legend of Figure 5H as follows.</p><p>“Schematic summary of <italic>C. elegans</italic> telomere structures.

This could give information about the complex in regards to interactions with POT-1 and POT-2.</p></disp-quote><p>We have tried EMSA with various DNA substrates, including double-stranded DNA, 3’ G-overhang DNA, and 5’ C-overhang DNA. As can be seen in the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4</xref>, we could detect binding to all of the DNA substrates, and the quantification showed that there was no preferential binding to single-to-double-strand transitions. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that more sensitive and quantitative assays might detect subtle differences that we could not detect by EMSA. Furthermore, it is possible that the addition of POT-1 or POT-2 in the reaction could change the substrate preference. We will attempt these advanced analyses in follow-up studies. We do not wish to include these in our current manuscript in order to avoid premature conclusions at this point.</p><fig id="respfig4"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>(A) EMSA with increasing amounts of MBP-DTN-1 (twofold steps up to 8.8 μM) and MBP-DTN-2 (twofold steps up to 3.2 μM).</title><p>The labeled DNA probes are 0.2 nM of ligated oligonucleotides containing random dsDNA sequences (5’-GCTGTACTGGTA-3’) followed by four telomere repeat dsDNA (ds), four telomere repeat dsDNA with two telomere repeat 3’ ssDNA overhang (3’ G-overhang), and four telomere repeat dsDNA with two telomere repeat 5’ssDNA overhang (5’ C-overhang).

Without access to the statistics, it seems that there are many more dots than in the wild type. This could indicate extrachromosomal telomeric DNA, or telomere fragility. Along these lines, is it possible to look at the chromosome number in the double deletion, to check whether there are fusions or fragments present? I understand that there are limited possibilities due to the mortality phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>We totally agree with your point. The signal intensity of each telomeric FISH focus will be stronger if there is a telomere fusion. To exclude this possibility, we have quantified the foci number of telomeric FISH signals in the epidermal cells (the same cells that we used for the quantification of the signal intensities in Figure 5E). This quantification showed that there was no significant difference in the telomeric foci number between N2 wild type and double KO worms. With these results, it is now more convincing that each telomere becomes longer in the double KO worms compared to the N2 wild type worms. We have added these results as Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</p><p>Furthermore, we have added the following sentence in the Results section.</p><p>“We confirmed that the number of telomeric FISH foci in each epidermal nucleus was comparable between wild type (N2) and double KO worms, suggesting that the stronger telomere FISH signal in the double KO worms was not due to telomere fusion (Figure 5—figure supplement 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Reviewers suggested that it would be useful to carry out telomere Southern blot in dtn-1/2 double KO. However, they also appreciated that collecting enough material might be difficult.

This would strengthen their conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We strongly agree with your point, but we have described the technical barrier in the Results section as below.</p><p>“Because of the severe fertility defects, we could not collect large amounts of DNA samples from the double KO worms, and thus the biochemical characterization of their telomeric DNA was experimentally unfeasible. As an alternative, we performed quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization (Q-FISH) using the telomeric probe.”</p><p>I would like to describe this in more detail here. For the Southern blot shown in Figure 5F, we have extracted genomic DNA from four of the 10 cm dishes (which corresponds to roughly 160,000 worms). For collecting the double mutant worms, we need to collect GFP-negative worms one by one from progenies derived from the balancer strain (nT1/<italic>dtn-2</italic>; <italic>dtn-1/dtn1</italic>). It is technically not feasible to select 160,000 individual worms and thus we did not show the Southern blot of the double mutant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It would be better if they show telomere lengthening/shortening by generations in single mutants DKO mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>We strongly agree with your point. Considering the progressive fertility defects observed in the double KO worms (Figure 4E), it is likely that telomere abnormalities might also be progressive. We will use the single telomere length analysis (STELA) method to investigate this possibility in the follow-up studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Examination of chromosomal fusions in single mutants and DKO mutant is recommended. It would be easier to observe chromosomes in arrested oocytes than in intestines.</p></disp-quote><p>We have quantified the foci number of telomeric FISH signals in the epidermal cells (postmitotic cells). This quantification showed that there was no significant difference in the telomeric foci number between N2 wild type and double KO worms. We have added this result as Figure 5—figure supplement 1. These results suggest that there is no significant level of chromosome fusion (end-to-end fusion), at least in epidermal cells. However, we have detected chromosomal bridges in intestinal cells (Figure 5B, C, and D) and X chromosome non-disjunction in meiosis (Figure 5A), suggesting that there must be at least some chromosomal fusion in these cells and that this might be cell-type specific. We will deepen this point by determining the telomere and chromosome number in various cell types, including oocytes, in the follow-up studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) As raised above, it would be better to discuss how lengthened telomeres and chromosome bridges (probably due to fusions?) are correlated in the double mutants. This is important because it is well known that telomere shortening, rather than lengthening, causes telomere deprotection, DNA damage responses, and fusion via NHEJ.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with your point. The hyper-elongated telomeres in the double mutant might not be the cause of the telomere bridges (fusions), rather the telomere elongation and deprotection might be distinct phenotypes caused by distinct mechanisms. This is supported by our findings that <italic>dtn-1</italic> single mutant worms, with hyper-elongated telomeres, did not show any telomere bridges (fusions). Further, previous studies also support this notion by showing that <italic>pot-1</italic> and <italic>pot-2</italic> mutant worms, which have similarly elongated telomeres, do not have any telomere deprotection phenotypes. We are sure that this is an interesting point for future study to investigate the telomere protection/deprotection states in the double mutant and to clarify the underlying mechanisms behind how <italic>dtn-1</italic> and <italic>dtn-2</italic> double KO leads to the telomere bridges (fusions) and deprotection. We have discussed this point extensively in the last part of the Discussion as follows.</p><p>“Notably, the deletion of <italic>pot-1</italic>, <italic>pot-2</italic>, or both in <italic>C. elegans</italic> results in the hyper elongation of telomeres in a manner dependent on telomerase, but these worms do not exhibit chromosomal fusion or a high incidence of male progeny and are completely fertile (Raices et al., 2008; Shtessel et al., 2013). […] Further analyses will show how DTN-1 and DTN-2 protect telomeric DNAs and how evolutionarily conserved telomeric function is ensured by these distinct telomeric proteins.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
