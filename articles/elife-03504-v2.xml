Here we identify an asymmetry in pH between mother and daughter cells that underlies aging and rejuvenation. Cytosolic pH increases in aging mother cells, but is more acidic in daughter cells. This is due to the asymmetric distribution of the major regulator of cytosolic pH, the plasma membrane proton ATPase (Pma1). Pma1 accumulates in aging mother cells, but is largely absent from nascent daughter cells. We previously found that acidity of the vacuole declines in aging mother cells and limits lifespan, but that daughter cell vacuoles re-acidify. We find that Pma1 activity antagonizes mother cell vacuole acidity by reducing cytosolic protons. However, the inherent asymmetry of Pma1 increases cytosolic proton availability in daughter cells and facilitates vacuole re-acidification and rejuvenation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03504.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03504.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03504.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Aging is a part of life—but its biological basis and, in particular, how aged cells give rise to young offspring (or progeny) has not been clearly established for any organism.</p><p>Budding yeast is a microorganism that is a valuable model to understand aging in more complex organisms like humans. Budding yeast cells undergo a process called ‘replicative aging’, meaning that each yeast mother cell produces a set number of daughter cells in her lifetime. However, when daughter cells arise from an aging mother cell, the daughter's age is ‘reset to zero’. How mother cells age, and how their daughters are rejuvenated, are questions that have been studied for decades.</p><p>Previously, researchers discovered that a mother cell's vacuole (an acidic compartment that stores important molecules that can become toxic) becomes less acidic as the mother cell ages. Daughter cells, on the other hand, have very acidic vacuoles, which was linked to their renewed lifespans. However, the mechanism behind this difference in the acidity of the vacuole between mother and daughter cells was unknown.</p><p>Now, Henderson et al. have found that a protein (called Pma1), which is found at the cell surface and pumps protons out of the cell, is present in mother cells but not in their newly-formed daughter cells. Furthermore, the Pma1 protein also accumulates as mother cells age. By pumping protons out of the cell, Pma1 effectively reduces the number of protons available to acidify the vacuole in the mother cell. However, because at first the daughter does not have Pma1, there are still plenty of protons inside the cell to acidify the vacuole.</p><p>When Henderson et al. reduced the activity of Pma1 in mother cells, the entire cell became more acidic, and so did their vacuoles. Conversely daughter cells engineered to have more Pma1 were less acidic and had less acidic vacuoles than normal.</p><p>Henderson et al. next asked whether reducing Pma1 activity to create a more acidic cell, could extend the lifespan of cells, and found that indeed cells with less Pma1 activity lived longer. As such, these findings indicate that an asymmetry in the acidity of the cell—caused by unequal levels of the Pma1 protein—contributes to reducing the lifespan of the mother cell and to rejuvenating the daughter cell. Thus Henderson et al. have identified one of the earliest events in the cellular aging process in budding yeast. Their findings suggest that an imbalance in an activity that is normally essential for cell survival (in this case, the activity of Pma1) can have long-term consequences for the cell that lead to aging.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03504.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03504.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>asymmetry</kwd><kwd>pH</kwd><kwd>rejuvenation</kwd><kwd>H+-ATPase</kwd><kwd>vacuole</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG023779</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gottschling</surname><given-names>Daniel E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001642</institution-id><institution>Glenn Foundation for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gottschling</surname><given-names>Daniel E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005237</institution-id><institution>Helen Hay Whitney Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hughes</surname><given-names>Adam L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005189</institution-id><institution>Leukemia and Lymphoma Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Henderson</surname><given-names>Kiersten A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AC965722</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Henderson</surname><given-names>Kiersten A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG000057</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hughes</surname><given-names>Adam L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG043095</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hughes</surname><given-names>Adam L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Protons are pumped out of mother cells by a protein that accumulates over time and this leads to cellular aging, but this protein is largely absent from daughter cells, which mediates rejuvenation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Main text</title><p>During replicative aging in budding yeast, mother cells produce a finite number of daughter cells before arresting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mortimer and Johnston, 1959</xref>).

To identify what reduces vacuole acidity and how vacuole acidity is regenerated in daughter cells, we further characterized vacuole pH asymmetry. Cells were aged using a genetic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lindstrom and Gottschling, 2009</xref>) and vacuole acidity was monitored by staining cells with quinacrine, a fluorescent dye that accumulates in the acidic vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Weisman et al., 1987</xref>). We observed bright vacuolar quinacrine staining indicative of acidic pH in a high percentage of buds (nascent daughter cells) regardless of mother cell age, whereas staining was diminished or undetectable in mother cell vacuoles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hughes and Gottschling, 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Vacuole acidity was asymmetric in cells treated with nocodazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting that the bud vacuole re-acidifies prior to cytokinesis. We confirmed that re-acidification occurred before cytokinesis by examining cells containing the septin marker Cdc10-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). A single septin ring at the bud neck transitions to two rings during cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lippincott et al., 2001</xref>). We observed high vacuole acidity in buds when there was a single septin ring, further supporting that vacuole acidity regenerates prior to cytokinesis. Thus, throughout their lifespan, mother cells produce daughter cells that regenerate vacuole acidity prior to cytokinesis, when mother and daughter cells share a common cytosol. Thus, whatever causes the asymmetry of vacuole pH must also be asymmetric between mother and daughter cells prior to cytokinesis.</p><p>One of the major points of regulation of vacuole acidity is assembly of the vacuolar proton ATPase (V-ATPase), a multi-subunit complex that pumps protons from the cytosol into the vacuole. The V-ATPase consists of the integral membrane V<sub>0</sub> complex and the V<sub>1</sub> complex that associates with the V<sub>0</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li and Kane, 2009</xref>). We examined whether there was a difference in vacuole-associated V<sub>1</sub> or V<sub>0</sub> between mother and daughter cells by visualizing green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagged subunits of each domain and found no evidence of asymmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, no obvious difference in V-ATPase assembly can account for vacuole pH asymmetry between mother and bud.</p><p>In a screen to identify proteins asymmetrically retained in mother cells throughout aging, we identified the plasma membrane proton ATPase, Pma1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Thayer et al., 2014</xref>). Pma1 is the major regulator of cytosolic pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferreira et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Serrano et al., 1986</xref>), and has similar activity to the V-ATPase, in that they both translocate cytosolic protons across membranes. Pma1 pumps protons from the cytosol out of the cell, whereas the V-ATPase pumps cytosolic protons into the vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Orij et al., 2011</xref>). Because Pma1 regulates cytosolic pH, we hypothesized that it could antagonize vacuole acidity during aging and underlie vacuole pH asymmetry.</p><p>As a first step in testing our hypothesis, we analyzed Pma1 protein localization. There are conflicting reports on Pma1 asymmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Smardon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Khmelinskii et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Malínská et al., 2003</xref>), however we found that Pma1 was asymmetric between mother and daughter cells. Pma1 levels at the plasma membrane were higher in mother cells than daughter cells as indicated by indirect immunofluorescence with antibody to Pma1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Similarly, Pma1 was more abundant in mother cells than buds when visualized with either Pma1-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) or Pma1-mCherry fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We also detected mCherry and GFP fluorescence in the vacuole, which likely represents misfolded protein directed to the vacuole for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang and Fink, 1995</xref>). Importantly, we found that asymmetry of Pma1 at the plasma membrane was maintained through at least 18 mother cell divisions and that Pma1 was asymmetric prior to cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), paralleling the asymmetry of vacuole pH.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03504.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Plasma membrane Pma1 levels are asymmetric between mother cells and buds, accumulate with age, and are inversely correlated with vacuole acidity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Top panel: Indirect immunofluorescence imaging of Pma1 with anti-Pma1 antibody in untagged young cell.

Pma1 levels were very low in newborn daughter cells, increased as daughter cells became mothers, and continued to increase over the first three mother cell divisions. This pattern of Pma1 abundance in daughters and aging mother cells inversely correlated with vacuole acidity. When Pma1 was very low in buds and newborn cells, the vacuole was acidic. In contrast, vacuole acidity was reduced in mother cells that have high Pma1 levels.</p><p>The inverse correlation between Pma1 levels and vacuole acidity suggested that Pma1 could cause vacuole pH asymmetry by antagonizing V-ATPase activity in mother cells. We first tested whether high levels of Pma1 could reduce vacuole acidity by overexpressing an extra copy of <italic>PMA1</italic> in newborn daughter cells from an inducible promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao and Pinkham, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Veatch et al., 2009</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>PMA1-mCherry</italic> increased Pma1 at the plasma membrane of newborn cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Without excess Pma1, 87% of newborn cells had highly acidic vacuoles, whereas vacuole acidity was only high in 13% of cells upon <italic>PMA1</italic> overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To further test whether Pma1 antagonized vacuole acidity, we reduced Pma1 activity and examined vacuole acidity in aging mother cells. <italic>PMA1</italic> is an essential gene and cannot be deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Serrano et al., 1986</xref>), so we reduced its activity by 65% using the <italic>pma1-105</italic> allele that has a mutation in the catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McCusker et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Perlin et al., 1989</xref>).

Indeed, the <italic>pma1-105</italic> allele increased median replicative lifespan by ∼30% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), comparable to well-characterized lifespan-extending mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Delaney et al., 2011</xref>). The slope of the <italic>pma1-105</italic> lifespan curve is similar to the slope of the wild-type curve. This suggests that instead of influencing the rate of aging throughout lifespan, the <italic>pma1-105</italic> allele delays the onset of the normal aging process. To ascertain whether lifespan extension by the <italic>pma1-105</italic> allele occurred entirely via increased vacuolar acidity, we examined the lifespan of <italic>pma1-105</italic> cells that lacked V-ATPase function. Cells lacking the V-ATPase subunit Vma2 had a short median lifespan of 2 divisions, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hughes and Gottschling, 2012</xref>). The lifespan of cells that had reduced Pma1 activity and that were devoid of V-ATPase function (<italic>vma2</italic>Δ, <italic>pma1-105</italic>) was much shorter than wild-type lifespan (median 7 divisions), and more similar to cells lacking V-ATPase function. This suggests that most of the lifespan extension imparted by the <italic>pma1-105</italic> allele requires V-ATPase function, but that the mechanism of lifespan extension is not limited to increased vacuolar acidification. Taken together these results support the idea that high Pma1 levels on mother cells impair vacuole acidification and limit lifespan.</p><p>In addition to Pma1 antagonizing mother cell vacuole acidity with age, we also hypothesized that the inherent asymmetry of Pma1, and thus low levels on buds, allows for re-acidification of the vacuole in buds. To test this idea, we asked whether expressing Pma1 in buds reduced vacuole acidity. We induced overexpression of <italic>PMA1-mCherry</italic> in cells arrested prior to cytokinesis with nocodazole and in untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In untreated cells, overexpression increased mother cell Pma1 levels but maintained mother-bud asymmetry. However, in nocodazole-arrested cells, <italic>PMA1-mCherry</italic> became equivalently high in mother cells and buds. At least 80% of buds had acidic vacuoles without <italic>PMA1</italic> induction or when <italic>PMA1</italic> was induced in the absence of nocodazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In contrast, only 13% of buds had acidic vacuoles when Pma1 levels were high in buds. Because increased Pma1 levels in buds impaired re-acidification of the vacuole, we conclude that the inherent asymmetry of Pma1 is required for regeneration of vacuole acidity prior to cytokinesis. We speculate that regeneration of vacuole acidity is required for daughter cell rejuvenation and that if high levels of Pma1 were induced in the buds of aging mother cells, daughter cells would not rejuvenate.</p><p>We wondered how Pma1 antagonizes vacuole acidity and how low Pma1 levels in buds permit vacuole reacidification. Given that Pma1 pumps protons out of the cell, we hypothesized that increased Pma1 activity antagonizes vacuole acidity by reducing cytosolic protons available to the V-ATPase. A prediction of this hypothesis is that cytosolic pH may become more basic with age, and may differ between mother and daughter cells. To test this hypothesis, we examined cytosolic pH with ratiometric pHluorin (a pH-sensitive GFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miesenbock et al., 1998</xref>) fused to a plasma membrane targeting sequence (residues 1–28 of the Psr1 protein) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Siniossoglou et al., 2000</xref>). With this reagent, cytosolic pH at the cell cortex was visualized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and quantified in mother cells of varying ages and in their buds. Newborn daughter cells or mother cells that had undergone 1 or 2 divisions had a mean cytosolic pH of ∼7.1, similar to previous measurements of bulk log phase cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Orij et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). However, as mother cells aged, cortical cytosolic pH increased as much as ∼0.5 pH units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Moreover, when we examined mother cells (on average 3 or 18 divisions old) and their attached buds, cortical pH was ∼0.2 or ∼0.1 pH units lower in buds than mother cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). All together, these results indicate that cortical cytosolic pH increases during replicative aging and is asymmetric between mother and daughter cells. Mother-daughter asymmetry of cytosolic pH might be surprising given the rapid diffusion of protons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wraight, 2006</xref>). However, local cytosolic pH differences have been observed in tumor cell invadopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Magalhaes et al., 2011</xref>) and cytosolic pH gradients can form during polarized growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feijo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gibbon and Kropf, 1994</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03504.008</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Cortex-proximal cytosolic pH increases with age and is asymmetric between mother cells and buds.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Visualization of cortical pH of newborn and aged mother cells and their buds as indicated with a plasma membrane-anchored ratiometric pHluorin using its bimodal excitation spectrum.

Taken together our results suggest that the inherent asymmetry of Pma1 creates mother-daughter cytosolic pH asymmetry prior to cytokinesis.</p><p>Our findings support the idea that Pma1 activity antagonizes vacuole acidification via a competition with the V-ATPase for limited cytosolic protons (at pH 7 there are ∼3000 free protons per yeast cell, ∼10<sup>6</sup> Pma1 molecules and ∼10<sup>5</sup> V-ATPase V<sub>0</sub> subunits) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Orij et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huh et al., 2003</xref>). While other modes of regulation may also be involved, our results can be explained by high Pma1 activity in aged mother cells translocating a sufficient number of protons out of the cytosol to restrict proton availability for the V-ATPase and reduce vacuole acidity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Conversely, lower Pma1 activity in buds leads to more cytosolic protons and higher vacuole acidification.</p><p>Our findings identify increased cytosolic pH as an early contributing step to the aging process in budding yeast and suggest that cytosolic pH asymmetry facilitates daughter cell rejuvenation.

Therefore we captured a single set of images per cell and never exposed cells to excitation wavelengths prior to pHluorin imaging.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank M Patel, J Roberts, and members of the Gottschling laboratory for reviewing the manuscript; A Merz for insightful discussions; G Smits, and R Orij for technical advice; G Miesenbock, J McCusker, and W Shou for reagents; and J Hsu, Z Tan, N Thayer, A Waite, and N Yazvenko for technical assistance.</p></ack><sec sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf1"><p>The authors declare that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>KAH, Conception and design, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>ALH, Drafting or revising the article, Contributed unpublished essential data or reagents</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>DEG, Conception and design, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="SD1-data"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03504.010</object-id><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Yeast Strains.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Karsten Weis, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this manuscript, Henderson, Hughes, and Gottschling report on the asymmetric localization of the plasma membrane ATPase Pma1, the major proton pump in the plasma membrane of budding yeast. They show that Pma1 plays a role in establishing the asymmetry in vacuolar pH between yeast mother and daughter cells that was previously identified by the authors. They demonstrate that Pma1 is enriched at the plasma membrane of mother cells and absent from buds. This correlates with an increase in the cortical pH in the mother cell compared to the daughter, and a less acidic vacuole in the mother than in the bud. Upon over-expression of Pma1 in cells arrested in mitosis, the asymmetry of Pma1 localization is lost, and the pH asymmetry between mother and bud are reduced or lost both at the cortex and in the vacuole. Likewise, reducing the activity of Pma1 restores the lower pH in the vacuole of mother cells and extends their lifespan. Thus, the authors conclude that asymmetric distribution of Pma1 contributes to the ageing of mother cells and the formation of young daughter cells.</p><p>The referees agreed that the data are interesting and overall of good technical quality. However, there was also a consensus that some additional experiments are needed to solidify the results and the conclusion of the authors:</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) There was a concern about the low number of cells that were used in the ageing experiments (both wt and pma1-1) and the experiments seem to have been done only once. Higher numbers will be needed to evaluate the mortality of the cells as a function of age (see also point 3).</p><p>2) PMA1 mutants are long-lived and the model indicates that this is because the pH balance is altered as fewer protons are being competed for with V-ATPase to acidify the vacuole. If so, does loss of V-ATPase suppress the long lifespan of pma1 mutant yeast? Does overexpression of V-ATPase result in a long lifespan?</p><p>3) Another issue that was discussed by the reviewers concerns the interpretation of the results. Does the higher pH of the mother cell's vacuole contribute directly to ageing, or does it simply create a burden to the cell that impacts longevity? By definition ageing causes mortality (frequency of death at a certain time point) to increase with age. Thus, when the log of mortality is plotted as a function of age, the curve should have a positive linear slope. Furthermore, a process contributing to ageing should increase the slope of the curve. A rapid evaluation of the curves presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> suggests that in the pma1 mutant the curve is only shifted relative to the wild type and that the slope is not affected. Thus, it appears as if the pH of the vacuole modulates the time at which ageing “starts” without affecting that process itself. Furthermore, if low pH resets age in the bud, mutants with high Pma1 activity in the bud should show a shorter lifespan that decreases proportionally to the age of their mothers at the time of cytokinesis (i.e. they inherit age and cannot reset it). Alternatively, the cells might not show any difference to their mothers (everybody restarts with the same slight deficit due to the fact that ageing starts earlier for all).

Higher numbers will be needed to evaluate the mortality of the cells as a function of age (see also point 3)</italic>.</p><p>In response to reviewers’ suggestion, we tripled the number of wild-type and <italic>pma1-105</italic> cells whose lifespan we analyzed (now 114 and 119 cells, respectively). The additional data support our previous conclusion and are included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) PMA1 mutants are long-lived and the model indicates that this is because the pH balance is altered as fewer protons are being competed for with V-ATPase to acidify the vacuole. If so, does loss of V-ATPase suppress the long lifespan of pma1 mutant yeast?</italic></p><p>To address the reviewers’ suggestion, we have added lifespan analysis of strains lacking V-ATPase activity (via deletion of <italic>vma2</italic>) in the wild-type <italic>PMA1</italic> or <italic>pma1-105</italic> background and these data are now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>. The median lifespan of the <italic>vma2Δ, pma1-105</italic> strain (7 divisions) is much shorter than wild-type (38 divisions) and more similar to the <italic>vma2Δ</italic> lifespan (2 divisions). Thus, the <italic>pma1-105</italic> allele no longer extends lifespan in the absence of V-ATPase activity, suggesting that the ability to acidify the vacuole is required for the majority of the effect of the <italic>pma1-105</italic> allele on lifespan. However, the <italic>vma2Δ, pma1-105</italic> lifespan is extended (7 divisions) compared to <italic>vma2Δ</italic> lifespan (2 divisions), suggesting that the <italic>pma1-105</italic> allele contributes additional benefits besides increased vacuole acidity. We have also added a discussion of these results to the text.</p><p><italic>Does overexpression of V-ATPase result in a long lifespan?</italic></p><p>We previously found the overexpression of <italic>VMA1</italic> (a component of the V-ATPase) extends median lifespan by 40% (Hughes and Gottschling, Nature, 2012) and refer to this in the text.</p><p><italic>3) Another issue that was discussed by the reviewers concerns the interpretation of the results. Does the higher pH of the mother cell's vacuole contribute directly to ageing, or does it simply create a burden to the cell that impacts longevity? By definition ageing causes mortality (frequency of death at a certain time point) to increase with age. Thus, when the log of mortality is plotted as a function of age, the curve should have a positive linear slope. Furthermore, a process contributing to ageing should increase the slope of the curve. A rapid evaluation of the curves presented in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref> <italic>suggests that in the pma1 mutant the curve is only shifted relative to the wild type and that the slope is not affected. Thus, it appears as if the pH of the vacuole modulates the time at which ageing “starts” without affecting that process itself</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers’ comment that while the median lifespan of the <italic>pma1-105</italic> strain is extended by 30%, the slope of the <italic>pma1-105</italic> lifespan curve is similar to the wild-type curve and instead appears shifted compared to wild-type. We have increased the number of cells evaluated as suggested, and the slope of the wild-type and <italic>pma1-105</italic> lifespan curves remain similar. We agree with the reviewers’ interpretation of the data that the <italic>pma1-105</italic> allele likely delays the initiation of the events that normally occur during aging (when aging starts), rather than directly affecting the later events of aging.</p><p>We previously published that when vacuole acidity is increased during aging by <italic>VMA1</italic> overexpression, median lifespan increases by 40% and the slope of the lifespan curve is visibly decreased compared to wild-type (Hughes and Gottschling, 2012). These findings suggest that reduced vacuole acidity contributes to aging throughout lifespan, and that increasing vacuole acidity does not simply delay the onset of the normal events of aging. The work we present here suggests that Pma1 activity influences lifespan by antagonizing vacuole acidity during aging. We therefore suspect that the <italic>pma1-105</italic> allele simply delays the division at which vacuole acidity is reduced and that once vacuole acidity is reduced, the normal events of aging that follow occur at the normal rate. The shape of the <italic>pma1-105</italic> lifespan curve is thus consistent with our conclusion that Pma1 activity initiates aging by reducing vacuole acidity and we have added a discussion of this idea.</p><p><italic>Furthermore, if low pH resets age in the bud, mutants with high Pma1 activity in the bud should show a shorter lifespan that decreases proportionally to the age of their mothers at the time of cytokinesis (i.e. they inherit age and cannot reset it). Alternatively, the cells might not show any difference to their mothers (everybody restarts with the same slight deficit due to the fact that ageing starts earlier for all). While the reviewers agreed that experiments addressing some of these points are laborious (but doable) these issues need to be at least discussed. Furthermore, an increase in the number of cells evaluated (see point 1) will help to get a better picture of how mortality changes with age</italic>.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we have added a discussion of the expectation that increasing Pma1 activity in buds should decrease rejuvenation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
