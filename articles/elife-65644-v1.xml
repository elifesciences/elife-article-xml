Here, we identify a neuronal circuit that non-autonomously suppresses germline differentiation and show that it communicates with the gonad via the neurotransmitter serotonin to limit somatic differentiation of the tumorous germline. ER stress controls this circuit through regulated inositol requiring enzyme-1 (IRE-1)-dependent mRNA decay of transcripts encoding the neuropeptide FLP-6. Depletion of FLP-6 disrupts the circuit’s integrity and hence its ability to prevent somatic-fate acquisition by germline tumor cells. Our findings reveal mechanistically how ER stress enhances ectopic germline differentiation and demonstrate that regulated Ire1-dependent decay can affect animal physiology by controlling a specific neuronal circuit.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ER stress</kwd><kwd>pluripotency</kwd><kwd>RIDD</kwd><kwd>teratoma</kwd><kwd>germline</kwd><kwd>neuronal circuit</kwd><kwd>IRE1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1571/15</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Henis-Korenblit</surname><given-names>Sivan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neuronal circuits can be disrupted by ire-1-dependent mRNA decay to affect germline tumor cell identity by regulating cross-tissue communication in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pluripotency is the developmental potential of a stem cell to give rise to cells of the three embryonic germ layers. Pluripotent stem cells maintain a proliferative, undifferentiated state as long as they reside within a ‘niche’ that provides continuous pro-mitotic, anti-differentiation cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ohlstein et al., 2004</xref>). Exit from this niche is associated with a tightly regulated switch from self-renewal to differentiation, demonstrating that the immediate microenvironment plays a central role in regulating cell pluripotency. Ultimately, the progressive restriction of cell fate is driven cell autonomously by cell-intrinsic mechanisms that regulate the expression of differentiation promoting genes, including pluripotency-regulatory transcription factors and chromatin remodeling factors, as well as translational control of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schlesinger and Meshorer, 2019</xref>).</p><p>The germline stem cells are the ultimate pluripotent cells because they hold the potential to differentiate into all the cell types that comprise the embryo and the adult. Germ cells initially give rise to differentiating gametes, whose somatic fate must be repressed until fertilization. Nevertheless, at a low frequency, germ cells and gametes can generate rare germline tumors containing differentiated somatic cells that are not native to the location in which it occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ciosk et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wright and Ciosk, 2013</xref>). These somatic germline tumors are called teratomas. In humans, the most common form of teratoma originates from oocytes that have entered, but not properly completed, meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ulbright, 2005</xref>). The mere existence of ovarian teratomas suggests that oocyte pluripotency is normally restrained to prevent uncontrolled precocious differentiation into somatic cells.</p><p>The <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> gonad provides a well-defined model for studying how germline cells maintain pluripotency in their natural micro- and macroenvironments, that is, in the somatic gonad and in the whole organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Seydoux and Braun, 2006</xref>). The <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline stem cells are located in the distal end of the gonad, near the mesenchymal distal tip cell, which interacts with the germ cells and promotes germline stemness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Byrd and Kimble, 2009</xref>). As in humans, germ cell differentiation is initially limited to meiotic progression and gametogenesis, until the removal of somatic differentiation constraints occurs upon fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kuwabara, 2003</xref>). Nevertheless, at a low frequency (enhanced by certain genetic backgrounds), germ cells can abnormally differentiate into many kinds of somatic cells in the absence of fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ciosk et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biedermann et al., 2009</xref>). We refer to these germline cells, which lose their pluripotency and acquire a differentiated somatic cell fate prior to fertilization, as germline ectopic differentiation (GED). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, GED can occur by direct conversions of germline cells to somatic cells. Such conversions have been observed upon ectopic expression of a differentiation-promoting transcription factor in the germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tursun et al., 2011</xref>) and upon depletion of the germline-specific translation repressor <italic>gld-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ciosk et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biedermann et al., 2009</xref>). In the absence of <italic>gld-1</italic>, female germline stem cells initiate meiosis, but then exit pachytene and return to the mitotic cycle, yielding a tumorous germline phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gumienny et al., 1999</xref>). A fraction of the mitotic germ cells forms a teratoma, which expresses somatic markers and is characterized by aberrantly large, misformed nuclei, readily detectable by DAPI staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ciosk et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biedermann et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) mediates correct folding of secretory proteins. ER stress increases the load of misfolded proteins in the ER. In turn, the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER activates an ER-adaptive unfolded protein response (UPR). The ER-UPR consists of signaling pathways that help to restore ER homeostasis by reducing the load on the ER and degrading misfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>). Previously we have shown that activation of the conserved UPR sensor inositol requiring enzyme-1 (IRE-1) enhances ectopic differentiation of the tumorous germline in <italic>gld-1</italic>-deficient <italic>C. elegans</italic>, which limits the progression of the lethal germline tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levi-Ferber et al., 2015</xref>). Although the major signaling mode of action of IRE-1 is to generate an active form of the ER stress-related transcription factor <italic>xbp-1</italic> (X-box binding protein-1), ER stress-induced GED requires the <italic>ire-1</italic> gene, but not its downstream target <italic>xbp-1.</italic> The nature of this <italic>ire-1-</italic>dependent <italic>xbp-1</italic>-independent signal remains a mystery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levi-Ferber et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>xbp-1</italic>-independent outputs of <italic>ire-1</italic> include activation of signaling cascades by virtue of IRE-1 oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Urano et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yoneda et al., 2001</xref>), and degradation of ER-localized mRNAs by virtue of IRE-1 ribonuclease activity—a process called regulated Ire1-dependent decay (RIDD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hollien and Weissman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hollien et al., 2009</xref>). During RIDD, select mRNAs and microRNAs are nicked by IRE1, rendering them vulnerable to rapid degradation by cytoplasmic exoribonucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hollien and Weissman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kimmig et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guydosh et al., 2017</xref>). Thus far, RIDD has been implicated in a variety of biological processes, including regulation of programmed cell death, cellular differentiation, and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coelho and Domingos, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maurel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In this work, we set out to explore how ER stress modulates the germ cell pluripotency/differentiation switch in the tumorous germline of <italic>gld-1</italic>-deficient animals. We discovered that the differentiation of the germline in response to ER stress is regulated at the organismal level and is based on neuronal signaling. We identified a novel ER stress-sensitive neuronal circuit, which communicates with the gonad through the conserved neurotransmitter serotonin to actively repress ectopic germline differentiation. Surprisingly, it is not the stress per se that regulates germ cell fate, but rather the activation of the ER stress response sensor IRE-1 that destabilizes through RIDD the transcripts of a critical neuropeptide implicated in the GED regulatory neuronal circuit. To our knowledge, this is the first example of neuronal circuit inhibition by RIDD.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Neuronal IRE-1 regulates ER stress-induced GED</title><p>The tumorous germline of <italic>gld-1(-</italic>) animals is prone to undergo ectopic differentiation into somatic cells, which are cleared away from the gonad by programmed cell death followed by corpse absorbance by the surrounding tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ciosk et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levi-Ferber et al., 2015</xref>). These abnormal, ectopically differentiated cells can be identified based on the expression of somatic markers and based on their relatively enlarged and irregularly shaped nuclei, which are distinct from the typical nuclei of the germline cells. The expression of somatic markers by this subgroup of cells with aberrant nuclei within the gonad of ER-stressed <italic>gld-1(-</italic>) animals has been previously demonstrated, confirming their somatic state (see Figure 3—figure supplement 1 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levi-Ferber et al., 2015</xref>). Blocking the ability of the ectopic somatic cells to execute apoptosis increases their half-life in the gonad, facilitating their detection in nearly all of the animals, where they occupy up to 10% of the gonad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levi-Ferber et al., 2015</xref>). Previously we have shown that upon exposure to ER stress the population of ectopically differentiated germ cells expands and occupies up to 40% of the gonad of <italic>gld-1(-</italic>) animals, indicating that ER stress promotes the induction of a somatic differentiated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levi-Ferber et al., 2015</xref>). Given the central role of the ER in secretory-protein biosynthesis, including the processing of a variety of hormones and neuropeptides, we wondered whether ER stress-induced GED is a consequence of stress within the germline itself or the perturbation of non-autonomous signals emanating from outside the germline.</p><p>We first examined the possibility that ER stress within the germ cells controls GED. To induce ER stress primarily in the germ cells, we used mutants in the <italic>rrf-1</italic> gene, whose RNAi activity is compromised in most somatic tissues but whose germline RNAi activity is intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kumsta and Hansen, 2012</xref>). Specifically, <italic>rrf-1</italic> mutants were treated with a mixture of <italic>gld-1, tfg-1,</italic> and <italic>ced-3</italic> RNAi. <italic>gld-1</italic> RNAi induces a germline tumor and sensitizes the germline for GED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ciosk et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>tfg-1</italic> RNAi induces ER stress by abrogating protein export from the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Levi-Ferber et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Witte et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>ced-3</italic> RNAi blocks apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ellis and Horvitz, 1986</xref>) and extends the half-life of the ectopic somatic cells in the gonad, facilitating their detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levi-Ferber et al., 2015</xref>). The efficacy of each of the RNAi treatments was individually confirmed as described in the Materials and methods section. As a proxy for GED, the animals were stained with DAPI, and the presence of ectopically large somatic-like nuclei with irregular shape within the gonad was scored. Strikingly, even though <italic>rrf-1</italic> is not required for RNA interference in the germline, hardly any increase in the amount of ectopic somatic cells in the gonad was apparent upon treatment of <italic>rrf-1</italic> mutants with the <italic>gld-1/tfg-1/ced-3</italic> RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This was in contrast to wild-type animals with intact RNAi machinery, in which approximately 25% of each gonad was occupied by cells with large soma-like nuclei upon exposure to ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This data suggests that ER stress in the soma, rather than only in the germline, drives the induction of aberrant cells within the gonad.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the soma regulates germline ectopic differentiation (GED).</title><p>Percent of gonad area occupied by aberrant somatic-like cells determined by DAPI staining of day 4 <italic>gld-1(RNAi); ced-3(RNAi</italic>) animals.

To this end, we used <italic>ire-1(-</italic>) mutants, whose germline does not undergo GED in response to ER stress induced by <italic>tfg-1</italic> RNAi treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levi-Ferber et al., 2015</xref>), and restored IRE-1 expression in its somatic tissues. To restore IRE-1 expression in the entire soma but not the germline, we generated <italic>ire-1(-</italic>) animals expressing an extrachromosomal somatic <italic>ire-1</italic> transgene under its own promoter (note that extrachromosomal arrays are actively silenced in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline, but are expressed in the soma; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kelly et al., 1997</xref>). This line of experiments was carried out in animals treated with <italic>gld-1</italic> and <italic>ced-3</italic> RNAi to facilitate GED detection. As a proxy for GED, the animals were stained with DAPI, and the presence of abnormal nuclei within the gonad was scored. We found that expression of the somatic IRE-1 transgene was sufficient to fully restore the induction of aberrant cells within the gonad upon ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>Next, we examined which somatic tissues mediate ER stress-induced GED. To this end, we restored IRE-1 expression in specific somatic tissues of <italic>ire-1(-</italic>) mutants by driving expression of the rescuing transgene with tissue-specific promoters. We found that expression of <italic>ire-1</italic> under the <italic>rgef-1</italic> pan-neuronal promoter was sufficient to permit ER stress-induced abnormal somatic-like nuclei within the gonad of <italic>ire-1(-</italic>) animals. In contrast, expression of <italic>ire-1</italic> under the <italic>myo-3</italic> muscle promoter or under the <italic>ges-1</italic> intestine promoter did not increase the level of abnormal nuclei in the gonads of ER-stressed animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>While IRE-1 is normally activated under ER stress conditions, some activation of IRE-1 can be achieved merely by its overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kimata et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Salzberg et al., 2017</xref>). Hence, we asked whether increasing IRE-1 expression is sufficient for inducing GED even in the absence of direct ER stress. To this end, we overexpressed <italic>ire-1</italic> transgenes in various tissues of <italic>ire-1(+); gld-1(RNAi); ced-3(RNAi</italic>) animals and followed GED induction in the absence of an ER stress trigger using DAPI staining as a proxy. Overexpression of IRE-1, either in the muscles or in the intestine, did not lead to the detection of ectopic cells within the gonad of the animals in the absence of ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, overexpression of IRE-1 in wild-type animals, either in the soma or in the neurons, gave rise to high amount of ectopic somatic-like nuclei even in the absence of ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Furthermore, it is known that sensory information indicating favorable environmental conditions is relayed to the distal tip cell through altered TGFβ production by the ASI neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dalfó et al., 2012</xref>). ASI is included in the group of sensory neurons covered by the <italic>che-12</italic> promoter. However, it does not communicate with glutamate.

One possibility is that ER stress in the relevant sensory neurons activates a signaling cascade that promotes GED in the gonad. If so, inactivation of the critical signaling molecules/cells of such a germline pluripotency inhibitory/GED-promoting signal should prevent ER stress-induced GED. Alternatively, since ER stress conditions are incompatible with efficient signaling due to secretory defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Safra et al., 2013</xref>), ER stress conditions that promote GED formation may do so by interfering with an existing germline pluripotency-promoting signal rather than generating a novel GED-promoting signal. In this case, inactivation of the critical signaling molecules/cells of such a germline pluripotency-promoting pathway should lead to the generation of GED even in the absence of ER stress. To distinguish between these possibilities, we examined whether a deficiency in any of the potential neurotransmitters and neuropeptides, expressed in the 10 glutamatergic sensory neurons, is sufficient to prevent ER stress-induced GED in ER-stressed animals or sufficient to induce GED in non-stressed <italic>gld-1(RNAi); ced-3(RNAi</italic>) animals.</p><p>Since the main neurotransmitter synthesized in the 10 candidate sensory neurons is glutamate, we examined whether glutamate serves as a signaling molecule for GED. To this end, we assessed the level of ectopic nuclei in two different glutamate transport-deficient <italic>eat-4(-</italic>) mutants. Upon treatment with <italic>ced-3</italic> and <italic>gld-1</italic> RNAi, <italic>eat-4(-</italic>) mutants exhibited low levels of abnormal nuclei under non-stress conditions and high levels of abnormal nuclei under ER stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), similarly to wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Thus, the interference with glutamate transport does not preclude the induction of GED under ER stress conditions, nor is it sufficient for induction of GED.</p><p>We next searched for candidate neuropeptides that may be involved in GED induction. To this end, we analyzed the nuclei pattern in mutants that lack each one of the neuropeptides known to be expressed by the 10 suspected glutamatergic sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Upon treatment with <italic>ced-3</italic> and <italic>gld-1</italic> RNAi, all of the mutants had high levels of abnormal nuclei in their gonads under ER stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, gray bars). Strikingly, one neuropeptide mutant—<italic>flp-6(ok3056</italic>)—exhibited high levels of abnormal nuclei under non-stress conditions as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, white bars). Similarly high levels of abnormal nuclei under non-stress conditions were obtained by treatment with <italic>flp-6</italic> RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

To examine whether the ER stress-related changes in <italic>flp-6</italic> transcript levels are due to transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation, we first analyzed the expression of a <italic>Pflp-6::gfp</italic> transcriptional reporter. No significant change was observed in the levels of the <italic>flp-6P</italic> transcriptional reporter upon ER stress (i.e., <italic>tfg-1</italic> RNAi treatment) or upon <italic>ire-1</italic> depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

Notably, the reduction in levels of the FLP-6::GFP protein reporter in ER-stressed wild-type animals was not due to a decrease in activity of the driving promoter, which was unaltered by the ER stress treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D,E</xref>). This data indicates that <italic>ire-1</italic> decreases FLP-6 levels post-transcriptionally, consistent with the hypothesis that <italic>flp-6</italic> transcript is a RIDD substrate.</p><p>RIDD substrates typically harbor an <italic>xbp-1</italic>-like stem-loop structure comprising a seven nucleotide loop (-C-X-G-C-X-X-X-) with three conserved residues and a stem of at least four base pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moore and Hollien, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hooks and Griffiths-Jones, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Peschek et al., 2015</xref>). Within the spliced <italic>flp-6</italic> sequence, we identified one potential <italic>xbp-1</italic>-like stem-loop structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Although the identified structure contains only six (rather than the typical seven) nucleotides in the loop, it has all the conserved residues (-C-x-G-C-X-X-) followed by a relatively strong putative stem structure. To test whether this RNA molecule could indeed be cleaved directly by the IRE-1 endoribonuclease, we incubated a 513 bp RNA segment harboring this stem loop with a phosphorylated form of purified human IRE-1 kinase-RNase domain (IRE-1 KR-3P) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, incubation of the <italic>flp-6</italic> stem-loop RNA fragment with recombinant IRE-1 KR-3P generated detectable cleavage products of the expected sizes <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>. Furthermore, the cleavage was blocked by the IRE-1-specific RNAse inhibitor 4μ8c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cross et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) and did not occur upon disruption of the RNA stem-loop structure by nucleotide scrambling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>). These data indicate that the <italic>flp-6</italic> RNA can be directly cleaved within its stem-loop structure by IRE-1 RNAse in vitro, thus supporting the possibility that <italic>flp-6</italic> is a direct RIDD substrate.</p><p>Next, we used a CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering protocol to generate <italic>flp-6(biu100)</italic> mutants in which the typical <italic>xbp-1</italic>-like stem-loop structure was destroyed using a set of silent mutations that preserved the coding sequence of the FLP-6 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). We found that unlike the control wild-type animals, the transcript levels of <italic>flp-6</italic> were not decreased by <italic>tfg-1</italic> RNAi-induced ER stress once the stem-loop structure of the transcript was disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Furthermore, we examined how the stem-loop-disrupting mutation affected GED levels in the animals. We found that similarly to wild-type animals with wild-type <italic>flp-6</italic> transcript, treatment with a <italic>gld-1, ced-3,</italic> control RNAi mix did not increase the levels of ectopically large nuclei in the gonads of <italic>flp-6(biu100)</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C</xref>). This attests to the integrity of the FLP-6 product, whose deficiency results in GED induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Strikingly, unlike animals with wild-type <italic>flp-6</italic> transcript, treatment with a <italic>gld-1, ced-3, tfg-1</italic> RNAi mix did not induce ectopic large nuclei in the gonads of <italic>flp-6(biu100)</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C</xref>). This indicates that the stem-loop motif in the <italic>flp-6</italic> transcript is critical for ER stress-induced GED induction.</p><p>Finally, given that it is ASE-produced FLP-6 that is critical for GED prevention, if <italic>flp-6</italic> levels are downregulated by IRE-1’s RIDD activity, then the ribonuclease activity of IRE-1 should be essential for ER stress-induced GED. Furthermore, IRE-1 expression specifically in the ASE sensory neuron should be sufficient for restoration of ER stress-induced GED in otherwise <italic>ire-1</italic>-deficient mutants. Indeed, analysis of a kinase-dead <italic>(wy782)</italic> and a ribonuclease-dead <italic>(wy762) ire-1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wei et al., 2015</xref>) indicated that both the kinase and ribonuclease activities of IRE-1 were required for ER-stress induction of GED (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Note that the kinase activity is required for the ribonuclease activity, which directly executes RIDD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harnoss et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, we individually restored <italic>ire-1</italic> expression in ASE or ASG (two FLP-6-producing glutamatergic sensory neurons).

Previously we have shown that ER stress also results in the accumulation of cells with abnormal nuclei in the tumorous gonad of <italic>gld-1</italic>-deficient animals, and that these cells are ectopically differentiated somatic cells that arise from the tumorous germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levi-Ferber et al., 2015</xref>). Our new findings suggest that ER stress affects the differentiation state of the tumorous germline by compromising the pluripotency-protective ASE-AIY-HSN-germline circuit. Thus, the abnormal nuclei that arise and accumulate in the tumorous gonads upon perturbations within the ASE-AIY-HSN-germline circuit are likely to be the nuclei of differentiated somatic cells as well. To test this directly, we made use of a <italic>Punc-119::gfp</italic> pan-neuronal reporter, introduced into ASE-deficient <italic>che-1</italic> mutants, HSN-deficient <italic>sem-4</italic> mutants, or <italic>flp-6/cha-1/tph-1</italic> mutants with defective <italic>flp-6/</italic>acetyl-choline/serotonin signaling, all of which have been implicated in the circuit identified herein. The <italic>Punc-119::gfp</italic> marker is normally expressed in the nerve cells of animals and is apparent from embryo to adult. However, upon GED in tumorous gonads, this marker is also observed in germ cells that acquired neuronal fate within the gonad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levi-Ferber et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with the phenomenon of GED, we found expression of the neuronal reporter within the tumorous gonads of animals with a perturbed ASE-AIY-HSN-germline but not in animals with an intact circuit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Here, we demonstrate that cell differentiation decisions in the tumorous germline of animals deficient in the germline-specific translation repressor <italic>gld-1</italic> can be regulated by neuronal cues that are sensitive to ER stress. Interestingly, we demonstrate that the propensity of the tumorous germline to differentiate into somatic cells rather than to maintain pluripotency is actively counteracted by neuronal cues of a newly identified germline differentiation-inhibitory signaling circuit.</p><p>The germline differentiation-inhibitory neuronal circuit identified in this study includes the sensory neuron ASE, the interneuron AIY, and the motor neuron HSN, which synapses at the vulva. Furthermore, we identified the central signaling molecules required for the active suppression of GED by this neuronal circuit. While ASE communicates via the neuropeptide FLP-6, AIY communicates via the neurotransmitter Ach and HSN communicates via serotonin. Deficiency in any of these neurons or signaling molecules comprising the germline differentiation-antagonizing circuit resulted in extreme ectopic differentiation of the germline in animals with a germline tumor (see model, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Interestingly, additional reproduction-related decisions are determined non-autonomously by neuronal signals. For example, the ASI sensory neuron regulates germline apoptosis, germline mitosis, and sperm activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Levi-Ferber et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dalfó et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McKnight et al., 2014</xref>). Nevertheless, in tumorous <italic>gld-1</italic> animals, shifting germline fate from a pluripotent state to an ectopically differentiated somatic state is regulated by a distinct neuronal circuit, governed by the ASE sensory neuron. This implies that separate sets of neurons can provoke divergent responses in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline. ASE is a gustatory neuron, known mainly to mediate chemotaxis toward water-soluble cues, including salt ions such as Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>−</sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bargmann and Horvitz, 1991</xref>). While it may be puzzling why a salt-sensing neuron would control germline fate, previous studies demonstrated that the sensing of salt may be coupled to the presence of food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tomioka et al., 2006</xref>). In turn, food availability is an important determinant of reproductive physiology.</p><p>The most downstream signaling molecule identified in the neuronal circuit that controls germline pluripotency in the tumorous germline is the conserved neurotransmitter serotonin. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, serotonin causes dramatic behavioral effects including inhibition of locomotion, stimulation of egg laying, and pharyngeal pumping and food-related behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Weinshenker et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Horvitz et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ségalat et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sawin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rogers et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Niacaris and Avery, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Waggoner et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mendel et al., 1995</xref>). While all these effects are modulated by the same molecule, they lead to different independent outcomes. Interestingly, none of the four dedicated <italic>C. elegans</italic> serotonin receptors is required for GED prevention. This may be due to redundancy or due to involvement of other, less specific, serotonin receptors in this circuit. Another layer of specificity may be encoded in the local levels and production site of serotonin. In support of this, serotonin production specifically by the HSN neuron is exclusively critical for preventing GED. Furthermore, migration-defective HSN does not effectively prevent GED, highlighting the importance for the correct location of the synapse of HSN near the vulva. Altogether, this suggests that the site and local concentrations of serotonin release play a key role in GED prevention, which differentiates this function from those of other serotonin signaling events. Furthermore, given the tumor-suppressive effects of GED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levi-Ferber et al., 2015</xref>) and consistent with studies that suggest that serotonin levels can play a crucial role in human cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sarrouilhe and Mesnil, 2019</xref>), this work supports a role for the serotoninergic system in tumor progression, rendering it a potential chemotherapeutic target.</p><p>Similarly to GED induction by perturbations in any of the components of the germline differentiation-antagonizing neuronal circuit, ER stress also induces GED within the tumorous gonads, leading to suppression of the germline tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levi-Ferber et al., 2015</xref>). Our present findings provide mechanistic insights into the underlying mechanism of ER stress-induced GED. Specifically, we show that ER stress-induced GED is not the consequence of ER stress per se within the germ cells, but rather the indirect result of activation of the IRE-1 endoribonuclease in the ASE neuron. We further show that the <italic>flp-6</italic> transcript has the structural requirements for RIDD, undergoes direct 4μ8c-inhibitable and stem-loop sequence-dependent cleavage by purified recombinant IRE1 in vitro, and is destabilized in an <italic>ire-1</italic>-dependent manner in vivo, indicating that the <italic>flp-6</italic> transcript is a target of RIDD. Furthermore, RIDD-mediated destabilization of the <italic>flp-6</italic> transcript is essential for ER stress-induced GED as it cannot be induced in <italic>flp-6</italic> stem-loop mutants, whose <italic>flp-6</italic> transcripts are RIDD-resistant. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a RIDD substrate in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Furthermore, since the <italic>flp-6</italic> transcript encodes the ASE-produced neuropeptide that controls the GED regulatory circuit, this disrupts the germline differentiation-antagonizing neuronal circuit, which can no longer prevent the acquisition of somatic fate by the germline tumor cells. This model is consistent with our previous findings that it is not the stress itself that regulates germ cell fate, but rather the activation of the ER stress sensor IRE-1, which in turn transduces an <italic>xbp-1</italic>-independent signal to promote GED and limit the progression of the germline tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levi-Ferber et al., 2015</xref>). Whereas our findings clearly implicate RIDD in ER stress-induced GED, this study has not explored the conceivable implication of additional <italic>xbp-1</italic>-independent signaling pathways regulated by IRE-1 such as the JNK/TRAF2 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Urano et al., 2000</xref>). Altogether, this is the first evidence that neuronal circuits can be disrupted by RIDD to affect tumor progression by regulating cross-tissue communication.</p><p>What could be the benefit in a germline differentiation-inhibitory neuronal circuit? We speculate that under physiological conditions, in a non-tumorous background, such a circuit may be beneficial for preventing precocious differentiation of germline cells prior to fertilization. In the context of animals with a tumorous germline, we have previously demonstrated that acquisition of somatic fate by the tumorous germ cells limits the progression of the tumor by reducing its mitotic capacity and restoring the ability of the cells to execute apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levi-Ferber et al., 2015</xref>). The current identification of an ER stress-regulated neuronal circuit that controls this transition in a distal tumorous tissue suggests that targeting such neuronal circuits and targeting the RNase activity of IRE1 may be useful as therapeutic interventions for tumor suppression. These findings may be relevant to human tumors as well since many human tumors, originating from a variety of major organs, are innervated, and this innervation is thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hutchings et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boilly et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>A list of strains and reagents used in this study is provided Appendix 1—key resources table.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>RNA interference</title><p>Bacteria expressing dsRNA were cultured overnight in LB containing tetracycline and ampicillin.

Surprisingly, Ire1 regulates ectopic differentiation of germline cells through the degradation of an mRNA substrate in the nervous system. The authors describe both the regulation of this novel substrate of Ire1 and the neural circuit that links Ire1 activity to gonad pluripotency.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Neuronal regulated Ire1-dependent mRNA decay controls germline differentiation in <italic>C. elegans</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen David Ron as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1. As pointed out by reviewer 3 below, is unclear whether all of the effects resulting in abnormal nuclei (as visualized by DAPI staining) are a result of ectopic differentiation. The authors should repeat the key experiments underlying the main findings regarding neuronal control of GED, and examine differentiation markers in the gonad.</p><p>2. The reviewers agreed that more evidence is needed to demonstrate that flp6 is a target of RIDD. The suggestions for experiments to support this conclusion are as follows: (a) measure flp6 RNA levels upon inducing ER stress, and when Ire1 is expressed in ASE, with the prediction that flp6 RNA levels should decrease; (b) if possible (given potential difficulties with the Xbp1 mutants), demonstrate that flp6 RNA degradation is independent of Xbp; (c) indicate whether the in vitro cleavage assay results in cleavage at the putative cleavage site described by the authors, and test whether mutation of this site prevents degradation of the flip6 RNA in vitro and in vivo.</p><p>3. The authors should test the specificity of serotonin for the ASE-AIY-HSN-germline circuit. Can the effects of tgf-1 RNAi on GED also be blocked by serotonin? Does serotonin interfere with the mex-3 RNAi GED phenotype?</p><p>4. Given the potential therapeutic aspect of this work and the previous findings that Ire1 activation allows animals with tumors to live longer, the authors should test how the flp6 mutant affects survival and/or paralysis in gld-1-RNAi treated animals.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>My main suggestion for an aspect of this paper that could be strengthened is included in my public review. To address this, I would suggest that the authors determine whether flp6 degraded when Ire1 is specifically expressed in the ASE as in figure 3H.</p><p>A second suggestion is about the in vitro assay. The authors also show an experiment where Ire1 appears to cleave the FLP6 RNA in Figure 3D. To further support that this is a specific cleavage event, it would be nice to know if the sizes of the cleavage products in Figure 3D are consistent with cleavage at the stem loop structure described by the authors. Even more conclusive would be if the authors showed that mutating the critical nucleotide(s) in the cleavage sites prevented cleavage, or that a second RNA without such a site is not cleaved in this assay.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. A central point of the article is to show for the first time a RIDD target in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Although their findings are consistent with this conclusion, more evidence is required to firmly establish flp-6 as a RIDD target. Measuring the levels of flp-6 in other ER stress conditions, such as tunicamycin treatment, would help to build a convincing case that flp-6 is a genuine RIDD target. The authors establish that flp-6 can act as a direct target of the IRE-1 endoribonuclease in vitro, but not that it is actually a direct target in vivo; mutating the predicted stem loop structure and demonstrating an inhibition of flp-6 loss and downstream effects on GED would solidify the authors argument. It is also important to exclude any potential role of the XBP-1-mediated UPR in flp-6 loss, by measuring flp-6 levels in xbp-1(-) mutants – although this might be a difficult result to interpret as previous author data indicates that xbp-1(-) mutants already display a basal increase in the ER stress levels (Safra M et al., 2013; Levi-Ferber M et al., 2015). Also, in addition to RIDD and xbp-1 splicing, IRE-1 has other functions in the cell, such as regulating <italic>JNK</italic>/<italic>TRAF2</italic> signaling. Authors should exclude (or at least discuss) any potential role of <italic>JNK</italic>/<italic>TRAF2</italic> in the regulation of GED by IRE-1.</p><p>2. The authors did a fantastic job in mapping the neuronal circuits controlling GED. Testing whether the effects of tgf-1 RNAi on GED can also be blocked by serotonin would help to support the model proposed in Figure 6. In addition, checking whether serotonin interferes with the mex-3 RNAi GED phenotype would help demonstrate serotonin specificity for the ASE-AIY-HSN-germline circuit.</p><p>3. The authors emphasize in the discussion the potential therapeutic aspect of the work. In their previous paper, they were able to show that IRE-1 activation allows animals with tumors to live longer (Levi-Ferber et al., 2015). To further support the therapeutic aspect of this work, I suggest that the authors test the effects of flp-6 mutant in survival and/or paralysis in gld-1-RNAi treated animals.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Figure 1: The rrf-1(pk1417) I used, according to the publications cited by the authors, can undergo at least partial RNAi mediated knockdown in the intestine, and show elevated expression of, at least some, transgenic arrays. In addition, other artifacts of triple RNAi have not been excluded in the studies shown here.</p><p>The images are low resolution, and the germline looks largely disturbed and DAPI is used as a proxy for GED. While it is possible some of the cells are differentiating ectopically (vis-a-vie the authors' previous publication), that needs to be shown.</p><p>Authors should not use 'abnormal nuclei' interchangeably with GED (eg. nuclei in tph-1 mutants in Figure 5)</p><p>IRE-1 is supposed to be required for GED. However, Figure 1B, tgf-1 (RNAi); ire-1 (-) animals appear to have GED.</p><p>The effects of IRE-1 manipulation on ER stress needs to be carefully assayed using qRT-PCR, XBP-1 splicing etc., before one can conclude, as the authors do that &quot; active IRE-1 signaling rather than ER stress&quot; modulates GED. In this regard, it would be important for the authors to spell out what they mean by ER stress. Where? Which sensors etc.</p><p>Controls for o/e of ire-1 in each of the tissues alone should be shown.</p><p>Figure 2: Previous studies by other groups have shown that overexpressing spliced XBP-1 in neurons of <italic>C. elegans</italic> induced ER stress in other tissues (shown in intestine) through neurotransmitter release (unc-13 mechanism). Even though the authors believe that the phenomenon they are studying is XBP-1 independent, and dependent on IRE-1 RIDD activity, the use a mutant IRE-1 unable to splice XBP-1 would be the conclusive way to demonstrate this. In its absence, the observations could be due to IRE-1 induced XBP-1 splicing.</p><p>Figure 3: It is unclear why the ire-1(-) animals not show the same phenotype as flp-6 (-) animals? Without flp-6, GED is constitutive (in a gld-1, ced-3 background). Without ire-1 GED is inhibited (in same background). Yet in a flp-6; ire-1(-) strain GED is activated similar to flp-6 null-the reason for this is not clear.</p><p>How do authors reconcile ire-1 independence of GED in flp-6 mutants with an ire-1 dependent hsp-4::GFP is a transgene that is expressed mainly in intestine, and as such is an incomplete readout of ER stress. Therefore, its sole use to establish that flp-6(-) animals do not activate ER stress is not supported.</p><p>Neuronal expression of the Zcls4s has not been previously established. Images of expression that was quantified in ASE should therefore be shown.</p><p>Is the FLP-6 translational reporter expression levels restored in the wy762 mutant?</p><p>IRE-1 RIDD activity has not been demonstrated in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and if FLP-6 is indeed an IRE-1 RIDD target, this would be exciting new advance in the field. Therefore these data while provocative, should be validated in independent ways. A convincing method to show IRE-1 RIDD activity would be to re-express an IRE-1 kinase domain only (or mutant without nuclease activity) to see if does not decrease expression of the flp-6 translational reporter. For instance, does is flp-6 lacking the stem loop also a RIDD substrate in the in vitro assays? What is the efficacy of flp-6 processing the RIDD reaction ? How well would known RIDD substrates be cleaved in this assay? If ER-UPR is activated in the FLP-6 translational reporter could be downregulated and explain the results.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65644.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1.

Without flp-6, GED is constitutive (in a gld-1, ced-3 background). Without ire-1 GED is inhibited (in same background). Yet in a flp-6; ire-1(-) strain GED is activated similar to flp-6 null-the reason for this is not clear.</p></disp-quote><p>Our suggested model is that <italic>ire-1</italic> promotes ER-stress induced GED by destabilizing the <italic>flp-6</italic> transcript, which encodes a protein (FLP-6) that prevents GED. Thus, the consequence of ER stress is <italic>ire-1</italic> activation and consequently <italic>flp-6</italic> depletion (or at least reduction in <italic>flp-6</italic> levels). In the absence of <italic>ire-1, flp-6</italic> transcript levels remain high in spite of the ER stress (as there is no IRE-1 to perform RIDD) and therefore GED is inhibited.

I agree that it is predominantly observed in the intestine and the spermatheca, however, we now specifically analyzed its expression is ASE (where it is expressed, although not the main site of expression).

That is why we also asked if the observed GED in <italic>flp-6(-)</italic> animals is <italic>ire-1</italic> dependent. The idea was that if <italic>flp-6</italic> deficiency induces ER stress which then leads to GED, then GED induction should be <italic>ire-1</italic> dependent (as ER stress-induced GED is <italic>ire-1</italic> dependent). However, we found that <italic>ire-1</italic> is not required for GED induction upon <italic>flp-6</italic> deficiency.

Therefore these data while provocative, should be validated in independent ways. A convincing method to show IRE-1 RIDD activity would be to re-express an IRE-1 kinase domain only (or mutant without nuclease activity) to see if does not decrease expression of the flp-6 translational reporter. For instance, does is flp-6 lacking the stem loop also a RIDD substrate in the in vitro assays? What is the efficacy of flp-6 processing the RIDD reaction ? How well would known RIDD substrates be cleaved in this assay?
