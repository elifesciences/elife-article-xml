memory. It is unknown, however, whether basal forebrain cholinergic neurons are directly involved in conditioned behavior, independent of secondary roles in the processing of external stimuli. Using fluorescent imaging, we found that cholinergic neurons are active during behavioral responding for a reward â€“ even prior to reward delivery and in the absence of discrete stimuli. Photostimulation of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, or their terminals in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), selectively promoted conditioned responding (licking), but not unconditioned behavior nor innate motor outputs. In vivo electrophysiological recordings during cholinergic photostimulation revealed reward-contingency-dependent suppression of BLA neural activity, but not prefrontal cortex. Finally, ex vivo experiments demonstrated that photostimulation of cholinergic terminals suppressed BLA projection neuron activity via monosynaptic muscarinic receptor signaling, while also facilitating firing in BLA GABAergic interneurons. Taken together, we show that the neural and behavioral effects of basal forebrain cholinergic activation are modulated by reward contingency in a target-specific manner.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acetylcholine (ACh) is a powerful neuromodulator thought to influence how the brain processes and learns about external stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ballinger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Higley and Picciotto, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Likhtik and Johansen, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Newman et al., 2012</xref>). The basal forebrain is a prominent source of cholinergic innervation of the entire cortical mantle, as well as related telencephalic structures such as the amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gielow and Zaborszky, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Most work on basal forebrain cholinergic circuits to date has focused on how ACh modifies the processing of other stimuli, either by increasing attention to conditioned stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bakin and Weinberger, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Baxter and Chiba, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gritton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Pinto et al., 2013</xref>) or by enhancing associations between conditioned stimuli and unconditioned stimuli/reinforcers in learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ballinger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Crouse et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Letzkus et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sturgill et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, less work has been done to explore the behavioral effects of basal forebrain cholinergic neuron activation in the absence of external stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aitta-Aho et al., 2018</xref>). As a result, in most models of cholinergic function, the behavioral relevance of basal forebrain cholinergic neuron activity in the absence of discrete external stimuli is comparatively less specified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hasselmo and Sarter, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Thiele and Bellgrove, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Basal forebrain cholinergic projections have considerable physiological effects on postsynaptic neurons ex vivo, where sensory stimuli cannot be presented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kalmbach et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Venkatesan et al., 2020</xref>). Basal forebrain cholinergic projections have prominent direct effects on limbic circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Venkatesan et al., 2020</xref>), including the basolateral amygdala (BLA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">McDonald and Mascagni, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">McDonald and Mascagni, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Unal et al., 2015</xref>). Ex vivo optogenetic activation of the cholinergic projection to the BLA affects postsynaptic activity differentially, suppressing neural activity at low firing rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Unal et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, however, in vivo cholinergic activation may increase spontaneous BLA neural firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that the postsynaptic effects of basal forebrain cholinergic projections may be depend upon as yet unidentified influences. We therefore sought to understand how basal forebrain cholinergic neuron activation, in the absence of discrete, environmental stimuli, may affect both behavior and downstream neural activity. To do this, we developed a new behavioral paradigm allowing us to study the short-time scale effects of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons on behavior in the absence of other discrete external cues. We sought to identify features that may regulate the effects of acetylcholine on behavior and downstream neural circuit activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Establishing conditioned behavior in the absence of discrete cues</title><p>To study whether basal forebrain cholinergic neurons affect conditioned behavior in the absence of discrete cues, we developed a new behavioral paradigm, which we refer to as the Windows of Opportunity Task (WoOT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). During WoOT, mice were head-fixed mice in front of a spout, with a goal of establishing a steady level of behavioral engagement, as measured by licking. WoOT sessions were divided into â€˜trialsâ€™ of 3 s <italic>Windows of Opportunity</italic>, with intervening variable intertrial intervals (ITIs). Rewards were only delivered if mice licked the spout during an unsignaled <italic>Window of Opportunity</italic>.

Given that there was no discrete external cue for these windows, we had initially hypothesized that cholinergic basal forebrain photostimulation would not impact licking behavior. However, in these Photostim-Reinforced sessions, photostimulation increased licking in mice expressing ChR2, but not eYFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). In contrast, during windows with no photostimulation, licking remained similar between ChR2 and eYFP mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Transient photostimulation of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons became capable of promoting an operant conditioned response, increasing the likelihood and decreasing the latency of licking, but only after being paired with the opportunity to collect rewards.</p><p>While we initially used photostimulation parameters similar to prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Herman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>), we also examined whether even briefer photostimulation of cholinergic basal forebrain neurons was sufficient to affect conditioned responding. In a separate session, we randomly delivered photostimulation on <italic>Windows of Opportunity</italic> using either 0, 1, 2, or 10 pulses at 20 Hz, corresponding to 5â€“500 ms of photostimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Jâ€“K</xref>).

A subset of mice was trained while on a treadmill in order to measure spontaneous, unconditioned locomotion. There was no difference in locomotion around the time of photostimulation between ChR2 and eYFP mice during either Photostim-Unreinforced or Photostim-Reinforced sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1â€”figure supplement 4G</xref>).

During Photostim-Unreinforced sessions, photostimulation of cholinergic neurons caused a modest increase in pupil dilation in ChR2 mice compared to eYFP mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1â€”figure supplement 4I</xref>, left; rank-sum between groups, p&lt;0.05). The first significant difference in pupil size between ChR2 and eYFP mice began 1.2 s after laser onset. During Photostim-Reinforced sessions, photostimulation also caused an increase in pupil dilation in ChR2 mice compared to eYFP mice, now beginning 0.7 s after laser onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1â€”figure supplement 4I</xref>, right; rank-sum between groups, p&lt;0.05). Pupil changes were larger during Photostim-Reinforced than Photostim-Unreinforced sessions for ChR2 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1â€”figure supplement 4J</xref>).

During both sessions, pupils dilated similarly in ChR2 and eYFP mice following reward delivery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1â€”figure supplement 4L</xref>).

We postulated that either (1) reinforcement potentiates the amount of ACh released with photostimulation (a â€˜presynapticâ€™ explanation) or (2) the amount of ACh released by photostimulation does not change, but the effects on downstream neurons are modified by reinforcement (a â€˜postsynapticâ€™ explanation). In order to determine whether the amount of ACh released by photostimulation changes as a result of pairing with reinforcement, we measured local ACh in the BLA while concurrently photostimulating basal forebrain cholinergic terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). We placed an optic fiber over the BLA in order to use orange light (589 nm) to transiently photostimulate basal forebrain cholinergic terminals using a Cre-dependent, red-shifted optogenetic protein (ChrimsonR) expressed in the basal forebrain of ChAT::Cre mice. We concurrently shined blue light (470 nm) through the same optic fiber to measure local ACh levels using a genetically encoded ACh sensor in BLA neurons. Sample recordings demonstrated that ACh sensor fluorescence increased during photostimulation only in mice expressing ChrimsonR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), but not in those expressing a control fluorophore (tdTomato, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).</p><p>We compared, in the same mice, BLA levels of ACh fluorescence during photostimulation during Photostim-Unreinforced and Photostim-Reinforced sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Gâ€“I</xref>).

The amount of measured fluorescence did not depend upon whether photostimulation was provided in Photostim-Unreinforced or Photostim-Reinforced sessions. Taken together with our previous finding that photostimulation of cholinergic terminals in the BLA selectively elevated licking during Photostim-Reinforced sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), our observation that BLA ACh levels did not change with reward suggests that reward associations may gate postsynaptic responses to photostimulation, rather than presynaptically changing ACh release.</p><p>Lastly in these experiments, given that even briefer photostimulation had been capable of promoting conditioned responding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J and K</xref>), we additionally performed recordings during a Photostim-Reinforced session, in which photostimulation was provided at various numbers of laser pulses at the same duty cycle. The amount of ACh sensor fluorescence evoked by 1â€“2 laser pulses, which had been sufficient to promote conditioned responding when photostimulation was targeted to the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), was similar to levels of ACh at the time of reward delivery in the absence of any photostimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5â€”figure supplement 1</xref>).

Our results demonstrate that at least some part of the previously described reward associations may be due to reward collection behavior such as licking, rather than only reward per se. Previous work has also suggested that ACh may amplify the effects of reinforcers during learning and strengthen plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>). In the current study, reward availability modified the behavioral and neural effects of basal forebrain cholinergic neuron photostimulation itself.

If photostimulation induced a different amount of ACh release during Photostim-Reinforced sessions, this may have explained the change in conditioned behavior. However, photostimulation of cholinergic terminals in the BLA evoked similar levels of ACh in Photostim-Unreinforced and Photostim-Reinforced sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This suggests that the similar levels of ACh instead may have been gated or differentially interpreted by downstream, postsynaptic neurons, depending on reward availability. The postulation of such gating merits future investigation, but may be mediated by coincident signals of reinforcement to the BLA, such as dopaminergic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lutas et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lutas et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tye et al., 2010</xref>), given that dopaminergic receptors are expressed by BLA neurons that also express cholinergic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">RÃ³wniak et al., 2017</xref>).

The lack of response to photostimulation during Photostim-Unreinforced sessions provides important constraints on possible interpretations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Mice were in a familiar context wherein the only meaningful behavioral response was to lick for unpredictable rewards. However, photostimulation of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons during Photostim-Unreinforced sessions did not promote conditioned responding in these sessions, as might be predicted by a number of alternative interpretations, such as nonspecific increases in movement, arousal, or contextual awareness.</p><p>Our findings suggest that photostimulated release of ACh can have a similar function as conditioned stimuli or cues, able to trigger conditioned responses. Recent work has shown that basal forebrain cholinergic neurons are active following presentation of conditioned stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Crouse et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sturgill et al., 2020</xref>).

We also demonstrated, however, that cholinergic neurons were consistently active at the times of conditioned responding, even in the absence of cues and rewards. This suggests that cholinergic transients are poised to play a role in conditioned responding and serve to signal more than just a salient event promoting a response. Indeed, blocking cholinergic muscarinic receptors impaired the ability of mice to respond even to conditioned tones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This is consistent with other studies in which inhibition of cholinergic terminals in the BLA prevented mice from expressing freezing behavior at the time of fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Our observation on the impact of ACh on conditioned behavior also provides new context for interpreting several prior results that have examined the role of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in attention to external stimuli.

Additionally, in sustained attention tasks to report the presence of stimuli to collect rewards, photostimulation of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons promotes conditioned responding as if cues are present, even in their absence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gritton et al., 2016</xref>), and immunotoxic lesions of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons lead to omissions of any response at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">McGaughy et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>The responses of cholinergic basal forebrain neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and ACh release within the BLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) indicate that conditioned responses of licking are represented by cholinergic signaling even in the absence of conditioned stimuli or reward delivery, reminiscent of signals seen in lateral hypothalamic (LH) neurons projecting to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Nieh et al., 2015</xref>).

We did not observe an effect on locomotion, in both an unrewarded and a rewarded context, despite the physiological correlation of cholinergic neuron activity with locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Harrison et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, while other work has suggested that photostimulation of basal forebrain cholinergic axonal terminals in the BLA can be rewarding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aitta-Aho et al., 2018</xref>), we did not observe a reinforcing effect of somatic basal forebrain cholinergic photostimulation. In addition to differences in the site of photostimulation, we transfected a more posterior and lateral portion of the basal forebrain (+0.05 mm AP in Aitta-Aho et al. vs â€“0.4 mm AP here, and Â± 1.15 mm ML in Aitta-Aho et al. vs Â± 1.80 mm here). This more anterior portion of the basal forebrain, closer to the horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca (HDB), is more responsive to reward omission, more accurately classifies behavioral outcomes, and more closely tracks fluctuations in pupil-indexed global brain state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Robert et al., 2021</xref>). In contrast, cholinergic neurons in the more posterior portions of the basal forebrain are more responsive to unconditioned auditory stimuli, orofacial movements, aversive reinforcement, and showed robust associative plasticity for punishment-predicting cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Robert et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>While it is possible that some of the effects of photostimulation of cholinergic terminals within the BLA were mediated by backfiring of cholinergic axons, several lines of evidence suggest that basal forebrain-BLA cholinergic projection is a relatively distinct population from basal forebrain cholinergic neurons projecting more widely to cortex: (1) basal forebrain cholinergic neurons that project to the BLA develop earlier embryologically than those that project to cortex and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Allaway et al., 2020</xref>). (2) Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons that project to the BLA rarely have collaterals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carlsen et al., 1985</xref>). (3) Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons that project to the BLA are sensitive to different immunotoxins and neurotoxins than cholinergic neurons that project to cortex and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Beninger et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boegman et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Heckers et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hecker and Mesulam, 1994</xref>). This suggests that backfiring from cholinergic axons in the BLA to the soma and then to cortex is likely to be limited.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Cell type-specific responses to ACh</title><p>We noted heterogeneous responses among BLA neurons in vivo to photostimulation of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Heterogeneous responses have also been previously noted ex vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Unal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Washburn and Moises, 1992</xref>). Through a double transgenic approach, we determined that these heterogeneous responses could be explained on a cellular level, with projecting, putative glutamatergic neurons suppressed, and GABAergic, putative local interneurons neurons facilitated by cholinergic inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The BLA GABAergic neuron population is thought to represent local interneurons that inhibit projection neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Washburn and Moises, 1992</xref>). Although both excitation of GABAergic neurons and inhibition of mPFC projection neurons were monosynaptic, these cholinergic effects could in concert function to suppress BLA output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lee and Kim, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Pidoplichko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zhu et al., 2005</xref>), which may decouple regions downstream from the BLA, such as the dmPFC, and allow them to function independently with regard to cholinergic input or other inputs.</p><p>This cellular specificity was mediated by different receptors, with short-latency facilitation in GABAergic neurons mediated by nicotinic receptors and longer-latency suppression in projection neurons mediated by muscarinic receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Prior histological work had suggested that M1 muscarinic receptors are predominantly expressed by pyramidal neurons in the BLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">McDonald and Mascagni, 2010</xref>), and interneurons express nicotinic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Pidoplichko et al., 2013</xref>). Functional differences similar to those we have observed between excitatory and inhibitory neurons have been seen in somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dasgupta et al., 2018</xref>). Strikingly, the behavioral response to even brief photostimulation of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons occurred by approximately 0.5 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Surprisingly, this sub-second response appeared primarily mediated by slower muscarinic receptors rather than faster nicotinic receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). It is possible that these mechanisms might differ based on additional cholinergic factors, such as local interneurons in sensory cortex as well as behavioral context such as reward vs. shock conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Letzkus et al., 2011</xref>). Our pharmacology experiments suggest that the effects of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons on nicotinic receptors are insufficient to trigger conditioned responding, although it is possible that we did not block all types of nicotinic receptors. Projection neurons, which receive a preponderance of cholinergic input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">McDonald et al., 2011</xref>), may serve as a critical point of convergence for ACh influence over BLA networks.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>The effects of augmenting ACh levels may depend on context</title><p>Multiple mental health disorders involve cholinergic deficiency, including delirium, schizophrenia, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Higley and Picciotto, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hshieh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Potter et al., 2014</xref>). Each of these disorders is associated with severe cognitive and functional impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">American Psychiatric Association, 2013</xref>), symptoms that impact not only patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Morandi et al., 2015a</xref>), but also their families and caregivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Morandi et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Oâ€™Malley et al., 2008</xref>). Disappointingly, current strategies to augment cholinergic function, such as cholinesterase inhibitors, have not had a strong clinical impact on several neuropsychiatric illnesses such as dementia, delirium, schizophrenia, and ADHD because of both insufficient benefit and significant side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Biederman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cubo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Siddiqi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Singh et al., 2012</xref>). While there are many reasons that cholinergic augmentation is unlikely to treat any of these complex diseases completely, our translationally motivated concern is that augmenting cholinergic levels, even with temporal and spatial specificity here through optogenetics, may have unpredictable effects depending upon the reward context surrounding this augmentation. Additionally, it is possible that extrinsic augmentation of cholinergic tone may be processed differently than intrinsic fluctuations in cholinergic tone. It is possible that coupling cholinergic augmentation with other therapies, such as cognitive or behavioral therapies, that can explicitly incorporate rewards or proxies for reinforcers, may provide a new opportunity for more sustained and predictable benefits to patients.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

Mice were head-fixed on either a 3D-printed rectangular platform or a custom 3D-printed linear-belt treadmill, in front of a blunt 18G needle spout (75165A754, McMaster Carr). For electrophysiology experiments, licks were registered using an infrared beam passing in front of the spout tip (emitter 935 nm, OP165A, TT Electronics/Optek Technology; phototransistor SFH 309 FA-4/5, OSRAM Opto Semiconductors). For other experiments, licks were registered using a capacitive contact circuit (MPR121, Adafruit) that was interpreted by a microcontroller (Arduino Uno SMD R3 ATMEGA328, Arduino).

Fluid delivery was controlled by opening a solenoid valve (003-0860-900, Parker, NH) and delivered to the spout by gravity flow via plastic acrylic tubing (McMaster-Carr, IL).

During early training, 90% of the 3 s windows were designated as <italic>Windows of Opportunity</italic>. If mice licked during the <italic>Windows of Opportunity</italic>, they received a 4 ÂµL fluid reward after a brief delay (0.1 s). Since rewarded windows were not cued, mice did not know when they initiated a lick whether it would be rewarded, making the rewards unpredictable. Only the first lick within a window resulted in reward delivery. The ITIs between <italic>Windows of Opportunity</italic> were randomly selected from an exponential distribution between 3 and 6 s (mean 4 s). The remaining 10% of 3 s windows were designated as matched <italic>Unrewarded Windows</italic>.

For optogenetic photostimulation, a 473 nm diode laser (MBL-III-473/1â€“100 mW, OptoEngine LLC) was used as a light source. Photostimulation was delivered at 4 mW (measured at the fiber tip) using 5 ms pulses delivered at 20 Hz. Lasers were continuously on to minimize power fluctuations, but photostimulation was gated at the source prior to entering a collimator (HPUC-23AF-473-S-11AS-LBH-BL-SP, OZ Optics) through a laser shutter head (SR475, Stanford Research Systems), controlled by a four-channel laser shutter driver (SR474, Stanford Research Systems). Laser light was then routed from the collimator through patch cords (Doric, QuÃ©bec, Canada) and split for bilateral photostimulation using a rotary joint (1 Ã— 2 Fiber-optic Rotary Joints â€“ Intensity Division; Doric, QuÃ©bec, Canada), with a subsequent patch cord terminating on the implanted ferrule.

Random effects were modeled using random intercepts for each subject. Post hoc tests for all linear mixed effects models were performed using the emmeans package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wieduwilt et al., 2020</xref>), with the Kenwardâ€“Roger method for degrees of freedom, and the Sidak method for p-value adjustment for multiple comparisons.</p><p>During a subsequent session, we varied photostimulation parameters to assess how little or brief the stimulation needed to be to produce conditioned responding. We randomly delivered photostimulation on <italic>Windows of Opportunity</italic> using either 1, 2, or 10 pulses of light at 20 Hz, corresponding to up to 0.5 s of photostimulation. These continued to be delivered at the onset of 3 s <italic>Windows of Opportunity</italic>. Fixed effects for linear mixed effects model analysis included Virus (ChR2 vs. eYFP), photostimulation pulses (0, 1, 2, 10), and their interaction.

Locomotion data was collected using a rotary encoder (US Digital E2-200-250-NE-D-D-B), digitized using a NI-USB-6211 at 1 kHz, and analyzed using MATLAB. There was no behavioral consequence of running. Behavioral event timings, including trial onset, photostimulation, licking, and reward delivery, were synchronized by sending TTLs from the Arduino microcontroller into an R-2R resistor ladder to multiplex the events into a single analog input channel on the NI-USB-6211.</p><p>Treadmill locomotion was analyzed around photostimulation, starting 2 s before photostimulation onset until 4 s after. Photostimulation duration was 2 s. Data was binned in 0.1 s bins for peri-event time histograms. Each bin was compared between ChR2 and eYFP mice for each session type (Photostim-Unreinforced or Photostim-Reinforced). Statistical significance of each bin was tested between groups using rank-sum tests, p&lt;0.01. To compare photostimulation-evoked locomotion between sessions for the same mice and between groups, we used linear mixed effects models to analyze the mean locomotion during photostimulation (0â€“2 s).

Random effects were modeled using random intercepts for each subject.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Pupillometry</title><p>In order to assess changes in arousal, we recorded pupil diameter during behavioral sessions. An infrared USB camera (ELP-USBFHD01M-RL36, ELP) was placed 15 cm from the mouseâ€™s eye. The infrared LED/emitter panel was unscrewed and pointed away from the mouse to decrease eye secretions. Ambient light was adjusted to keep the pupil size at an intermediate level, which allowed the pupil to fluctuate over a dynamic range. Recordings were started and stopped at the same time as behavior using Processing 2.2.1 running on a Windows desktop computer (Hewlett-Packard), which also initiated the Arduino microcontroller running behavior. Files were saved at 30 Hz as 640 Ã— 480 pixel ogg vorbis video files. Behavioral event timings were identified for subsequent synchronization using 940 nm infrared LEDs (IR204, Everlight Electronics, Digi-Key) to signal behavioral events, including trial onset, photostimulation, licking, and reward delivery.</p><p>For pupil and body part tracking we used DeepLabCut (version 2.0.8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mathis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Nath et al., 2019</xref>).

This network was then used to analyze videos from similar experimental settings. Relative pupil diameters were determined by calculating the distance for each major axis (North-South, East-West, NorthWest-SouthEast, NorthEast-SouthWest), and then taking the mean of these four measurements.</p><p>Pupil diameter was normalized to the diameter prior to photostimulation (âˆ’2 to â€“1 s relative to photostimulation onset), and the pupil diameter from each frame for each trial was expressed as the percent difference from baseline.

Fixed effects included Virus (ChR2 vs. eYFP), Reinforcement Session type (Photostim-Reinforced vs. Photostim-Unreinforced), as well as their interaction. Random effects were modeled using random intercepts for each subject.

Tone and photostimulation trials were equally likely, and were separated by ITIs with a mean of 12 sec (range 7â€“22 s, exponential distribution).

The chamber was illuminated with 30 lux ambient light. Mice were allowed to freely move between compartments for 45 min during which entry into one of the two sides resulted in continuous photostimulation (473 nm light, 4 mW, 5 ms pulses at 20 Hz).

The setup allowed for excitation of the sample at two wavelengths (405 and 470 nm) and collection of fluorescence emission at 525 nm. The excitation path consisted of a 405 nm and a 470 nm LED (Thorlabs M405FP1 and M470F3) which were collimated (Thorlabs F671SMA-405) and coupled to 400 nm and 469 nm excitation filters (Thorlabs FB400-10 and MF469-35), respectively. Compared to 470 nm excitation, 405 nm excitation of GCaMP is closer to the isobestic wavelength for calcium-dependent and calcium-independent GCaMP fluorescence, and thus was used to assess movement- and autofluorescence-related noise. Light from these two excitations sources was combined into one path via dichroic mirrors and filled the back aperture of a Ã—20 air objective (Nikon CFI Plan Apo Lambda). A fiber optic patch cord (Doric) containing optic fibers bundled into a single ferrule (400 Î¼M diameter, 0.48 NA for each fiber) was positioned at the working distance of the objective. The end of the patch cable was connected to implanted ferrules on the animalsâ€™ head. Emission resulting from the 405 or 470 nm excitation was split by a dichroic mirror, passed through a 525 nm emission filter (Thorlabs MF525- 39), and focused through a tube lens (Thorlabs AC254-100-A-ML) onto the face of CMOS camera (Hamamatsu ORCA-Flash V2). Frames were captured at 40 Hz and each LED was modulated at 20 Hz in an alternating fashion, resulting in a 20 Hz sample rate in the reference (405 nm excitation) and signal (470 nm excitation) channels.

Optrodes were chronically implanted in either hemisphere in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the prelimbic (PL) subregion of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). The stereotaxic coordinates to target the BLA were â€“1.50 mm anteriorâ€“posterior (AP), Â± 3.15 mm medialâ€“lateral (ML), and â€“5.00 mm dorsalâ€“ventral (DV). The stereotaxic coordinates to target PL were +1.80 AP, Â± 0.35 mm ML, and â€“2.00 mm DV. In addition to these optrodes, optical fibers were implanted bilaterally in the basal forebrain (BF) to photostimulate ChR2-expressing ChAT neurons while recording neural activity from the BLA and dmPFC. The stereotaxic coordinates for the BF fibers were â€“0.40 mm AP, Â± 1.80 mm ML, and â€“4.50 mm DV. All stereotaxic coordinates were calculated relative to Bregma. Finally, an aluminum bar was horizontally positioned behind lambda to provide anchoring points during head-fixed recordings. All these implants were secured to the skull using stainless steel self-drilling screws (Small Parts), adhesive cement (C&amp;B Metabond, Parkell), and dental acrylic (Ortho-Jet, Lang Dental). At the end of the surgeries, incisions were sutured and postoperative analgesia and fluids were provided as needed. Mice were allowed to recover from surgery for at least 1 wk.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21-2"><title>In vivo electrophysiology recordings</title><p>Extracellular recordings were performed using in-house-built multichannel electrodes, each containing a 16-channel Omnetics connector, an optical fiber attached to the connector, and a low-resistance silver wire to provide ground. The microwire used for the electrodes was a 22.9 Âµm HML-insulated nichrome wire (Stablohm 675, California Fine Wire). Microwires were secured to the connector pins using a silver print coating (GC Electronics). All connections were then secured using dental acrylic. Serrated fine scissors were used to cut the tip of the microwires to a length of 500â€“1000 Âµm from the tip of the optical fiber. The microwire tips were then gold-plated to reduce impedance and improve signal-to-noise ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ferguson et al., 2009</xref>). Gold plating was achieved by submerging the electrode tips in a solution containing equal parts of a non-cyanide gold solution (SIFCO Selective Plating) and a 1 mg/mL polyethylene glycol solution. A cathodal current of 1 ÂµA was applied to individual channels to reduce impedances to a range of 200â€“300 kâ„¦.</p><p>Multichannel extracellular recording setups (Open Ephys) were used to monitor neural activity while mice performed behavioral tasks. Extracellular signals were recorded at 30 kHz with band-pass filters set at 0.2 and 7600 Hz. These raw signals were then processed offline to extract single-unit activity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21-3"><title>In vivo electrophysiology spike extraction</title><p>A common reference was calculated for each 16 channel array by calculating the median trace across all channels. This trace was then subtracted from each channel on that array. Data was then filtered from 300 to 7000 Hz using a fourth-degree Butterworth filter applied using the filtfilt function in MATLAB. Spikes were identified by negative deviations greater than 7.4 times the median absolute deviation. Spikes were aligned to their minima and waveforms from 375 Âµs before the trough and 1000 Âµs after the trough were extracted for spike sorting. Single-unit waveforms were then sorted using commercial software (Offline Sorter, Plexon Inc) by combining principal component and peak-trough voltage features in three-dimensional space. Neural firing properties were visually inspected, including autocorrelations and cross-correlations, in order to exclude multiunit activity or repeated recordings of the same unit across multiple wires in a bundle. Neurons were additionally inspected to ensure they did not represent behaviorally locked artifacts. Only neurons that fired at least 0.01 Hz across the whole session were included in analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21-4"><title>In vivo electrophysiology analysis</title><p>Peri-event time histograms were constructed by extracting spiking activity around photostimulation in 10 ms bins from 8 s before to 16 s after photostimulation onset. Baseline activity was defined as the activity from 4 s before up to the onset of photostimulation. Activity for each trial was transformed using the mean and standard deviation of baseline activity across trials. Data was smoothed with a 50 ms Gaussian kernel. Activity within each area for each bin was compared using rank-sum tests to compare Photostim-Unreinforced and Photostim-Reinforced sessions, separately for ChR2 and eYFP mice.</p><p>Modulation around the time of photostimulation was calculated by comparing firing rates before photostimulation onset (âˆ’1 to 0 s) with firing rates shortly after photostimulation onset (0â€“0.5 s). Facilitation was classified as neurons with statistically significant increases in firing rates after photostimulation onset, and suppression was defined as neurons with statistically significant decreases in firing rates after photostimulation onset (sign-rank test, p&lt;0.01). Proportions were compared using two-sided chi-square proportion tests, with p-values corrected for multiple comparisons using Holmâ€™s procedure.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21-5"><title>In vivo electrophysiology histology</title><p>Mice were anesthetized using isoflurane to mark the position of electrode tips by producing microlesions (anodal current, 25â€“40 ÂµA for at least 20 s). Mice were then euthanized with sodium pentobarbital (150 mg/kg), and transcardially perfused with saline solution and 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, pH 7.3). Brains were extracted and fixed in 4% PFA for at least 24 hr and then equilibrated in a 30% sucrose solution for 48 hr. Coronal sections were cut at 40 Âµm using a microtome (HM430, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Brain sections containing the BLA, dmPFC, and BF were mounted on microscope slides, and stained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Images of the BLA, dmPFC, and BF were acquired using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Olympus FV1000). Expression of eYFP and/or ChR2 was examined from the BF sections, whereas the location of microlesions was examined from the BLA and dmPFC sections to determine the neural recording sites. These were reconstructed onto coronal drawings adapted from a mouse brain atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Franklin, 2008</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>Ex vivo electrophysiology</title><sec id="s4-22-1"><title>Ex vivo electrophysiology surgery</title><p>We generated double transgenic mice by crossing homozygous ChAT::Cre mice with hemizygous VGAT::flpo mice. Double hemizygous offspring (ChAT::Cre Ã— VGAT::flpo mice), confirmed by genotyping (Transnetyx) were used for these experiments. In a first surgery, for optogenetic photostimulation of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, we injected 500 nL of an adeno-associated virus encoding channelrhodopsin (AAV5/EF1a-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-mCherry; UNC, 3.5 Ã— 10<sup>12</sup>) bilaterally into basal forebrain of each hemisphere at AP â€“0.4, ML Â± 1.8, DV â€“5. For fluorescent labeling of BLA GABAergic neurons, we injected 400 nL of an adeno-associated virus encoding the fluorophore eYFP (AAV5/EF1a-fDIO-eYFP-WPRE; UNC, 3.8 Ã— 10<sup>12</sup>) bilaterally into the BLA at AP â€“1.6, ML Â± 3.3, DV â€“5.1. After at least 6 wk, we performed a second surgery to label BLA neurons projecting to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) through injection of a retrograde tracer (200 nL cholera toxin b subunit fused to Alexa-647, CTB-647) in the mPFC (AP 1.8, ML Â± 0.35, DV â€“2).</p></sec><sec id="s4-22-2"><title>Ex vivo electrophysiology recordings</title><p>One week after the CTB-647 surgery, mice were deeply anaesthetized via I.P. injection of sodium pentobarbital (200 mg/kg) prior to transcardial perfusion with 20 mL ice-cold modified artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF; composition in mM: 75 sucrose, 87 NaCl, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2.5 KCl, 1.3 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> * H<sub>2</sub>O, 7 MgCl<sub>2</sub> * 6H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub> * 2H<sub>2</sub>O, 5 ascorbic acid, in ddH<sub>2</sub>O; osmolarity 324â€“328 mOsm, pH 7.3â€“7.4) saturated with carbogen gas (95% oxygen, 5% carbon dioxide). The brain was quickly dissected out of the cranial cavity and a semiautomatic vibrating blade microtome (VT1200; Leica, IL) was then used to prepare 300-Âµm-thick coronal slices containing the BLA. Brain slices encompassing the basal forebrain and mPFC were also collected for verification of ChR2-mCherry and CTB-647 expression, respectively. Slices were then transferred to ACSF (composition in mM: 126 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> * H<sub>2</sub>O, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub> * 6H<sub>2</sub>O, 2.4 CaCl<sub>2</sub> * 2H<sub>2</sub>O, and 10 glucose, in ddH<sub>2</sub>O; osmolarity 299â€“301 mOsm; pH 7.30â€“7.40) saturated with carbogen gas (95% oxygen, 5% carbon dioxide) in a water bath kept at 30â€“32Â°C. They were allowed to recover for at least 1 hr before transfer to the recording chamber for electrophysiological recordings.</p><p>In the recording chamber, BLA slices were continually perfused with carbogen-saturated ACSF, at a temperature of 31 Â± 1 Â°C, via a peristaltic pump (Minipuls3; Gilson, WI). BLA neurons were visualized through an upright microscope (Scientifica, UK) using infrared differential interference contrast (IR-DIC) optics and a Q-imaging Retiga Exi camera (Q Imaging, Canada). Identification of eYFP+ GABAergic neurons and CTB-647-expressing mPFC-projector neurons was achieved through a 40Ã— water-immersion objective using brief fluorescence illumination from a 470 nm LED light source (pE-100; CoolLED, NY) or a metal halide lamp (Lumen 200, Prior Scientific Inc, MA), respectively, through appropriate excitation/emission filters (Olympus, PA). Thin-walled borosilicate glass capillary tubing was shaped into microelectrodes for recording using a horizontal puller (P-97, Sutter Instruments, CA) and had resistance values of 3â€“6 Mâ„¦ when filled with internal solution (composition in mM: 125 potassium gluconate, 20 HEPES, 10 NaCl, 3 MgATP, and 0.1% neurobiotin; pH 7.30â€“7.33; 286â€“287 mOsm). Recorded signals were amplified with a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, CA), low-pass filtered at 3 kHz, digitized at 10 kHz using a Digidata 1550, and recorded using pClamp 10.4 software (Molecular Devices). Series resistance, input resistance, and holding current were monitored throughout experiments via a 5 mV, 0.1 s step. Any significant changes were interpreted as signs of cell deterioration and recordings were terminated. To assess the response of BLA neurons to cholinergic input, ChR2-expressing cholinergic terminals were activated by trains of 5 ms pulses of 470 nm light (pE-100; CoolLED) delivered through the 40Ã— objective every 30 s, while recording in current-clamp mode. To isolate monosynaptic currents tetrodotoxin (TTX; 1 ÂµM; Tocris, MN) and 4-aminopyridine (4AP; 1 mM, Sigma, MO) were included in the ACSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Petreanu et al., 2007</xref>). Scopolamine (10 ÂµM; Sigma) was used to block muscarinic ACh receptors, and a cocktail of nicotinic antagonists dihydro-ÃŸ-erythroidine (10 ÂµM, Tocris), methyllycaconitine (0.1 ÂµM; Sigma), and mecamylamine (10 ÂµM; Sigma) was used to block nicotinic ACh receptors. Offline analysis of peak current amplitude was performed in Clampfit 10.4 (Molecular Devices). Capacitance and membrane resistance (Rm) were calculated from a 5 mV, 0.1 s hyperpolarizing step in voltage clamp using custom MATLAB software written by Praneeth Namburi based on MATLAB implementation of the Q-method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">NovÃ¡k and ZahradnÃ­k, 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-22-3"><title>Ex vivo electrophysiology histology</title><p>Following recording, slices were fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4Â°C then washed in PBS (4 Ã— 10 min). To reveal neurobiotin-labeled cells, recorded slices were blocked in PBS containing 0.3% Triton (PBS-T 0.3%) and 3% normal donkey serum (NDS; Jackson ImmunoResearch, USA) at room temperature for 60 min before incubation in PBS-T 0.3% with 3% NDS and CF405-conjugated streptavidin (1:1000; Biotium, CA). After 90 min, slices were washed in PBS (4Ã— 10 min) then mounted onto glass slides and coverslipped using polyvinyl alcohol mounting medium with DABCO (Sigma). Images of the BLA were captured using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus FV1000), with FluoView software (Olympus). Neurobiotin-filled recorded neurons were imaged at high magnification through a 40Ã—/1.3 NA oil-immersion objective using serial z-stacks with an optical slice thickness of 3 Î¼m.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-23"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>After behavioral experiments, mice were anaesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (200 mg/kg) and transcardially perfused with ice-cold Ringerâ€™s solution followed by ice-cold 4% PFA in PBS (pH 7.3).

Sections were then incubated in secondary antibody donkey-anti-goat 647 (1:500) in blocking solution at room temperature for 2 hr. Finally, sections were washed six times for 5 min in 1Ã— PBS and mounted on microscope slides using a Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI.

The authors hypothesize that, &quot;this could suggest that reward associations may gate post-synaptic responses to photostimulation.&quot; The electrophysiological data showing that overall firing of BLA neurons during licking was higher as a result of photostimulation during unreinforced, and lower as a result of photostimulation during reinforced, sessions is intriguing in this context, as is the contrast with the overall ACh-mediated stimulation of firing in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. The ex-vivo data presented showing that ACh depresses BLA neuron activity via muscarinic ACh receptors on glutamate neurons and nicotinic ACh receptors on GABA neurons, along with previous data in the field suggesting that ACh has divergent effects on neuronal firing rate depending on whether baseline firing is low (tonic) or high (phasic), provides intriguing hints as to the role of ACh in state-dependent modulation of BLA activity.</p><p>One of the primary questions that came up while reading this manuscript was what behavioral domains were being measured with the &quot;windows of opportunity&quot; task. As noted by the authors, the cholinergic system has been implicated in arousal, reward thresholds, motivation and many other behaviors that might alter performance in this task, complicating interpretation of the data presented. In addition, some additional details of the task are needed for the field to be able to replicate these experiments.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89093.2.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Kimchi et al. examined the role of cholinergic inputs to the amygdala in regulating reward-seeking behavior. To investigate this, the authors developed a head-fixed behavioral task where animals were trained to lick at random intervals, with some of these responses being reinforced (&quot;windows of opportunity&quot;) as opposed to control epochs when no reward was delivered.</p><p>The authors conducted in vivo optogenetic stimulation of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons and discovered that a 2-second optical stimulation of these neurons encouraged licking behavior when followed by reward delivery. This was in comparison to time epochs where no reward was delivered or compared to control mice only expressing EYFP. However, it remained unclear how many trials were required for this effect to manifest.</p><p>Furthermore, they demonstrated that the stimulation of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons did not induce real-time place preference or affect locomotion. The reward-driven licking behavior was also mitigated by systemic cholinergic receptor antagonists.</p><p>Next, the authors observed the bulk calcium dynamics from these neurons in a version of the task where an auditory cue predicted reward availability. They found strong calcium signals when mice were licking and when the tone was present, but also reported signals when mice were spontaneously licking.</p><p>By injecting a genetically encoded Acetylcholine (Ach) sensor directly into the Basolateral Amygdala (BLA), they showed that Ach signals were present when mice were engaged in licking, both during reward availability and for non-rewarded licks. Photostimulation of Ach terminals directly in the BLA increased licking behavior when a reward was available.</p><p>Finally, using in vivo and ex vivo physiology, they demonstrated that Ach signaling influences the electrophysiological dynamics in the BLA. This may help clarify some of the postsynaptic responses triggered by this neuromodulator.</p><p>Strengths of the paper:</p><p>1.

Licking is found to increase only during windows when licking is rewarded, and similar behaviour is observed when terminals are stimulated in basolateral amygdala, then several more experiments are conducted to determine the behavioural and anatomical specificity of the effect. The findings are solid, particularly those relating to the recordings, although the interpretation of the behavioural findings is still somewhat unclear.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>â€¢ The manuscript is beautifully written and structured. I found it really easy to follow and felt that the authors did an exceptional job of walking me through each experiment that they completed, the rationale for it, and what they found.</p><p>â€¢ The question of the function of basal forebrain cholinergics is an interesting one and a somewhat understudied question, so the study is timely and on an interesting topic.</p><p>â€¢ The experiments are well-designed and the findings are novel. There are a number of important control experiments performed to determine that the observed effects were not due to locomotor activity and that stimulating basal forebrain ACh neurons is not inherently reinforcing.</p><p>â€¢ The discussion is really nice - covering important topics such as potential interactions with dopamine, the potential anatomical specificity of the effects observed, and the possibility that projections other than those studied here might mediate effects, among other things.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>â€¢ Although very clearly written and set out, I found myself confused by the behavioural findings and their interpretation. Mainly this was because photostimulation only increased licking during the window of opportunity, which is not signalled by any discrete stimulus, which means that the only signal that the animal receives to determine that they are within the reward window is them receiving the reward. Therefore, the only time within this window that licking could be increased is post-reward (otherwise the reward window is identical to a non-rewarded window) and it is not clear to me what this increase in post-award licking might mean? In fact, this time post-award is actually the time the animal is most certain to not receive another reward for a few seconds, meaning that licking at this time is not a useful behaviour and therefore it is difficult to interpret what it means to artificially increase licking at this time. I think it would probably have been less confusing for the authors to study a paradigm in which animals develop a conditioned response that is unsignaled by discrete stimuli and then to inhibit basal forebrain ACh prior to that response.</p><p>â€¢ I should also note that the authors state (Lines 249-251) that stimulation increases responding prior to reinforcer delivery, but I couldn't find evidence for this, and it seems counterintuitive to me that it would do so because then how would the animals discriminate the window of opportunity from a non-rewarded window? Perhaps I misunderstood something, but I found this confusing.</p><p>â€¢ I do not think the behaviour in this task can be classed as operant - it is still a good task and still fine for detecting conditioned responding, but it cannot determine whether the responding is governed by a response-outcome association in the absence of a stimulus-outcome association (with stimuli being the licking spout, other facets of the behavioural context etc) through bidirectionality or omission, as would be required to demonstrate its operant nature.</p><p>â€¢ I was confused by the pupil dilation data in Figure S4 as the authors seem to want to argue that this effect, although specific to the rewarded window as licking is, is independent of the licking behaviour as it develops more slowly than the behaviour (Lines 201-202). I was curious as to how the authors interpret these data then? Does it indicate that stimulating basal forebrain ACh interneurons does both things (i.e. increases arousal AND conditioned responding in the absence of discrete stimuli) but that the two things are independent of each other?</p><p>â€¢ The authors refer to the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex in mice, which from the methods appears to be the prelimbic region. My understanding is that dmPFC has fallen out of favour for use in mice as it is not homologous to the same region in primates and can be confusing for this reason.</p></body></sub-article></article>
