Despite being a type of professional phagocyte, neutrophils are thought to be excluded from apoptotic sites to avoid tissue inflammation. Here, we report a fundamental and unexpected role of neutrophils as the predominant phagocyte responsible for the clearance of apoptotic hepatic cells in the steady state. In contrast to the engulfment of dead cells by macrophages, neutrophils burrowed directly into apoptotic hepatocytes, a process we term <italic>perforocytosis</italic>, and ingested the effete cells from the inside. The depletion of neutrophils caused defective removal of apoptotic bodies, induced tissue injury in the mouse liver, and led to the generation of autoantibodies. Human autoimmune liver disease showed similar defects in the neutrophil-mediated clearance of apoptotic hepatic cells. Hence, neutrophils possess a specialized immunologically silent mechanism for the clearance of apoptotic hepatocytes through perforocytosis, and defects in this key housekeeping function of neutrophils contribute to the genesis of autoimmune liver disease.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Every day, the immune cells clears the remains of billions of old and damaged cells that have undergone a controlled form of death. Removing them quickly helps to prevent inflammation or the development of autoimmune diseases.</p><p>While immune cells called neutrophils are generally tasked with removing invading bacteria, macrophages are thought to be responsible for clearing dead cells. However, in healthy tissue, the process occurs so efficiently that it can be difficult to confirm which cells are responsible.</p><p>To take a closer look, Cao et al. focused on the liver by staining human samples to identify both immune and dead cells. Unexpectedly, there were large numbers of neutrophils visible inside dead liver cells. Further experiments in mice revealed that after entering the dead cells, neutrophils engulfed the contents and digested the dead cell from the inside out. This was a surprising finding because not only are neutrophils not usually associated with dead cells, but immune cells usually engulf cells and bacteria from the outside rather than burrowing inside them.</p><p>The importance of this neutrophil behaviour was shown when Cao et al. studied samples from patients with an autoimmune disease where immune cells attack the liver. In this case, very few dead liver cells contained neutrophils, and the neutrophils themselves did not seem capable of removing the dead cells, leading to inflammation. This suggests that defective neutrophil function could be a key contributor to this autoimmune disease.</p><p>The findings identify a new role for neutrophils in maintaining healthy functioning of the liver and reveal a new target in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. In the future, Cao et al. plan to explore whether compounds that enhance clearance of dead cells by neutrophils can be used to treat autoimmune liver disease in mouse models of the disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neutrophils</kwd><kwd>apoptotic clearance</kwd><kwd>autoimmune diseases</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32170750</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Jingsong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>SSTP</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19YYJC2572</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Jingsong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neutrophils are the predominant phagocytes that clear dead liver cells under normal physiological conditions.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Apoptosis is a process of programmed cell death that clears aged or damaged cells to maintain internal tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hochreiter-Hufford and Ravichandran, 2013</xref>). An estimated hundred billion cells undergo apoptosis daily in a human adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fond and Ravichandran, 2016</xref>). These apoptotic cells must be disposed of promptly and efficiently without littering cytoplasm or causing inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Franz et al., 2006</xref>). Defects in the clearance of apoptotic bodies are often linked to various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nagata et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Poon et al., 2014</xref>). It is widely believed that apoptotic bodies are cleared by professional phagocytes, such as macrophages and immature dendritic cells, or by local nonprofessional phagocytes, such as epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lauber et al., 2004</xref>). Although the morphology of apoptotic cells is easily distinguished in histological sections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kerr et al., 1972</xref>), these cells are infrequently observed in normal human samples due to efficient removal by phagocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lauber et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Poon et al., 2014</xref>). Hence, the phagocytes responsible for the removal of apoptotic cells in the homeostatic state remain uncertain and it is unknown whether they are tissue specific.</p><p>Neutrophils, a type of terminally differentiated and short-living phagocytic cell, represent 50–70% of the total white blood cell population in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amulic et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kolaczkowska and Kubes, 2013</xref>). However, neutrophils are not considered key players in apoptotic cell clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nagata et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Poon et al., 2014</xref>). They instead function as inflammatory cells responsible for killing bacteria and fighting infection. Blood neutrophils often swarm to the site of infection, where they release toxic mediators (e.g. reactive oxygen species and proteases) that not only kill microorganisms but also can damage tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amulic et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kolaczkowska and Kubes, 2013</xref>). To prevent inflammation, apoptotic cells have been shown to release ‘keep-out’ signals, such as lactoferrin, that prevent the recruitment of neutrophils to the apoptotic site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bournazou et al., 2009</xref>). Nevertheless, neutrophils are related to multiple autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amulic et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kolaczkowska and Kubes, 2013</xref>). For example, mild neutropenia was observed to precede and accompany the onset of type 1 diabetes, a typical autoimmune disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harsunen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Valle et al., 2013</xref>). The role of neutrophils in the clearance of apoptotic bodies and contribute to autoimmunity remain to be solved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jorch and Kubes, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report an unexpected role of neutrophils in clearing apoptotic hepatocytes under physiological conditions. We found that neutrophils, not macrophages or other cells, are responsible for apoptotic hepatocyte clearance in an immunologically silent manner. We noted that neutrophils penetrate apoptotic hepatocytes and clear them from the inside, thereby avoiding spillage of cytoplasmic content; this mechanism differs sharply from the classical engulfment of dead cells by macrophages. Defects in neutrophil-mediated apoptotic clearance have been observed in human autoimmune liver (AIL) disease. Hence, in addition to their well-known role in combating infection, neutrophils can function as housekeepers for apoptotic clearance and thus maintain tissue homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Neutrophils burrow into apoptotic hepatocytes in human livers</title><p>We observed a large number of neutrophils in hepatocytes in human noncancerous liver tissue obtained from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) or from patients with hepatic hemangioma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We discovered that the hepatocytes occupied by neutrophils were apoptotic, as evidenced by the condensed chromatin signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, panels i–vi, black arrowheads indicate condensed chromatin, white arrowheads point to neutrophils with a characteristic multilobed nucleus). Importantly, apoptotic hepatocytes are rarely observed in the human liver, possibly due to the rapid removal of apoptotic cells by phagocytes. In a total of 281 apoptotic hepatocytes from 32 livers, we observed that each apoptotic hepatocyte was engorged by up to 22 neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). We also confirmed apoptotic hepatocytes by TUNEL staining or Caspase-3 immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Neutrophils burrowed inside apoptotic hepatocytes were either stained with an antibody against neutrophil elastase (NE), myeloperoxidase, or recognized by their multilobed nucleus signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Stage 1 (i–iii), initial invading stage: two neutrophils start to invade an apoptotic hepatocyte with apparent condensed chromatin (outlined by the black rectangle); three other neutrophils are already inside the cytoplasm (<bold>i</bold>); at this stage, the apoptotic hepatocytes are still attached to neighboring hepatocytes and occupied by 2–16 neutrophils (ii–iii, 37 out of 241 apoptotic hepatocytes observed are at stage 1). Stage 2, phagocytosis and shrinking stage: The apoptotic hepatocytes are being phagocytosed by invading neutrophils and are partially detached from neighboring hepatocytes (iv–vi, 130 out of 241 apoptotic cells are at stage 2). Stage 3, complete digestion stage: apoptotic hepatocytes are completely detached and largely cleared, and only neutrophils remain in the cleared region (vii–ix, 74 out of 241 apoptotic cells are at stage 3).

apoptotic hepatocytes, we hypothesized that the neutrophil-mediated clearance of apoptotic cells consists of the following three sequential steps. In the initial invading or burrowing stage, activated neutrophils identified and targeted the apoptotic hepatocytes (cells with condensed chromatin, indicated by black arrowheads) and attached to their cell membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, panel i, outlined by black rectangle). Then, the neutrophils invaded apoptotic hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, panels ii and iii). We observed an average of seven neutrophils entering each apoptotic hepatocyte, and we termed this process perforocytosis (from Latin <italic>perfero</italic> to bore) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, white arrowheads point to neutrophils). The second step consisted of phagocytosis and detachment. The neutrophils within hepatocytes appeared to clear apoptotic bodies from the inside without destroying the cellular membrane or extruding the cytoplasm (two burrowed neutrophils phagocytosed apoptotic debris as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Following digestion by neutrophils, the apoptotic hepatocytes decreased in size, and detached from nearby hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, panels iv–vi). The third step involved the complete digestion of apoptotic hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, panels vii–ix). After the clearance of apoptotic hepatocytes, neutrophils seemed to migrate away from the cleared space, possibly to make room for new hepatocytes generated by rapid division. This ‘eating inside’ phagocytosis process differed sharply from the well-known engulfment of apoptotic cells or fragmented apoptotic bodies by other phagocytic cells, such as macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Poon et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Visualization of neutrophil perforocytosis in mouse livers</title><p>Neutrophils within apoptotic hepatocytes were confirmed in mouse livers by intravital microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>) and electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

In general, professional phagocytes have much higher phagocytic efficiency and capacity than nonprofessional phagocytes, but they are greatly outnumbered by other cell types in tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Elliott and Ravichandran, 2016</xref>). Therefore, whether there are unidentified scavengers and/or mechanisms for the prompt removal of dead cells in distinct organs remains unclear. Compared to macrophages or their precursors, monocytes, which make up less than 10% of the total white blood cell population, neutrophils are the most abundant white blood cells (up to 70%) in humans, and thus ideally suited for the swift clearance of apoptotic hepatic cells. As macrophages were induced to phagocytose apoptotic hepatocytes following the depletion of circulating neutrophils, our data show compensatory activation of other phagocytes under these conditions. The basis for this switch, however, is not clear.</p><p>Another important question is whether other tissues utilize a similar mechanism. As neutrophils do not phagocytose apoptotic epithelial and endothelial cells, it is possible that distinct signals are specifically released by different types of apoptotic cells. It remains largely unknown whether one or more signals are dominant in each specific tissue and how these signals are orchestrated into a complicated network to swiftly clear dying cells while avoiding tissue inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Neutrophil influx without causing tissue damage</title><p>Although apoptotic clearance has been considered an immunologically silent process that does not lead to the influx of inflammatory cells or exposure of self-antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Poon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Savill et al., 2002</xref>), it has also been suggested that this process is not completely immunologically silent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Green et al., 2009</xref>). Because neutrophils are proinflammatory cells, they have long been thought to be excluded from apoptotic sites. We observed neutrophil influx into apoptotic hepatic cells (up to 22 neutrophils in one apoptotic hepatocyte), and there was little detectable tissue injury or other inflammatory cells. One reason could be that the neutrophil attraction signals released by apoptotic hepatocytes (e.g. IL-1β and IL-8) are sufficient for attracting neutrophils toward apoptotic cells and inducing subsequent perforocytosis, but do not elicit neutrophil inflammatory functions such as oxidative burst. Therefore, neutrophil recruitment into tissues does not always induce inflammation or tissue damage. In consistent with our observations, neutrophils can express both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gideon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mortaz et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, neutrophil depletion caused defective removal of apoptotic bodies and induced autoantibody generation; thus neutrophils play a vital role in the genesis of AIL disease. Considering that billions of neutrophils patrol tissues under physiological circumstances without causing inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nicolás-Ávila et al., 2017</xref>), we concluded that these cells not only provide immune surveillance against infection but also contribute to internal tissue homeostasis, as we report in this study.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Neutrophil burrowing to maintain tissue integrity</title><p>One intriguing question regarding apoptotic clearance is how the tissue maintains integrity while dead cells are being continually removed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Poon et al., 2014</xref>). Apoptotic cell detachment from the extracellular matrix by caspase-mediated cleavage or extrusion into the organ lumen has been proposed as the mechanism for maintaining the epithelial barrier during the clearance of dying epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brancolini et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rosenblatt et al., 2001</xref>). Our finding that burrowed neutrophils phagocytose apoptotic hepatocytes from the intracellular space provides a novel mechanism for maintaining liver integrity. The neutrophils that phagocytose cells from the inside are efficient at disposing of apoptotic bodies without extruding the cytoplasm and may help to prevent the leakage of toxic bile acids or the release of danger signals that cause tissue damage.</p><p>Neutrophil burrowing into other types of cells has also been reported previously in processes not related to apoptotic clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Overholtzer and Brugge, 2008</xref>). For example, neutrophils can bore into endothelial cells or megakaryocytes to temporarily form so-called cell-in-cell (or emperipolesis, entosis) structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Overholtzer and Brugge, 2008</xref>). The apparent difference is that both the endothelial cells and megakaryocytes entered by neutrophils are viable and nonapoptotic. The purpose of forming cell-in-cell structures with neutrophils and endothelial cells or megakaryocytes is to obtain a passage out of blood vessels or bone marrow, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Overholtzer and Brugge, 2008</xref>). It will be interesting to examine whether neutrophils utilize similar invasion mechanisms during these processes.</p><p>The important apoptotic clearance function of neutrophils described in this study adds to the repertoire of other known functions of neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amulic et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kolaczkowska and Kubes, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Since the failure to clear dead cells is linked to inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, the critical role of neutrophil-mediated apoptotic clearance may have implications for the pathogenesis and treatment of these diseases.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture, transfection, and isolation of human and mouse neutrophils</title><p>NCTC (authenticated by STR profiling <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cellosaurus.org/CVCL_3066">https://www.cellosaurus.org/CVCL_3066</ext-link>), U937 (authenticated by STR profiling <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cellosaurus.org/CVCL_0007">https://www.cellosaurus.org/CVCL_0007</ext-link>) cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and HL60 (authenticated by STR profiling <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cellosaurus.org/CVCL_0002">https://www.cellosaurus.org/CVCL_0002</ext-link>) cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum.

Cells were then centrifuged and resuspended in HBSS. After being filtered through a 40 μm strainer, cells in 3 mL of HBSS were loaded onto a pre-prepared gradient solution (3 mL of NycoPrep on top and 3 mL of 72% Percoll on bottom). The samples were centrifuged at 2400 rpm at room temperature for 20 min with the brake off. The middle layer was collected and washed once in HBSS. Sterilized distilled water (9 mL) was added for 22 s and thereafter 1 mL of 10× PBS was added to remove red blood cells. Finally, the cells were collected and resuspended in HBSS or medium (neutrophil purity &gt;90%).

Neutrophils were isolated from the resulting cell suspension using discontinuous Percoll gradient centrifugation. This procedure yielded &gt;95% neutrophil purity and &gt;95% viability as assessed by flow cytometry.</p><p>For the isolation of human primary hepatocytes, liver tissues from a fresh liver hemangioma surgery were suspended in DPBS and washed for 5–10 times. Surrounding connective tissues and adipose tissues were removed with a surgery knife and remaining liver tissues were further sliced into small fragments (around 1 mm<sup>2</sup>), then washed with DPBS for three times, and centrifuged at 800 rpm for 3 min. Tissue samples were resuspended in five times volume of collagenase IV medium and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. After collagenase digestion, samples were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min, and resuspended in RPMI 1640 with antibiotics to precipitate cells, then centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min. Isolated cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with insulin (1: 1000), glucagon (1:1000), glucocorticoid (1:1000), HGF (10 ng/mL), EGF (10 ng/mL).

After anesthesia, mice were attached to a surgical stage and subjected to midline laparotomy, and all vessels in the skin were cauterized. The falciform ligament between the liver and diaphragm was subsequently cut by holding the xiphoid with a knot made of suture thread. Mice were then moved to the imaging stage, and the right lobe was exposed. The ventral side of the mouse was placed on a Plexiglas stage attached to the microscope stage of a single photon microscope (NiKON A1RMP) or Cellvizio System for the imaging of apoptotic cells (labeled with Annexin V), Kupffer cells (anti-F4/80), and neutrophils (anti-Ly-6G 1A8). Microscope acquisition settings were as follows: 405 nm laser power, 15.4%, PMT high voltage (HV), 115; 488 nm laser power, 27.9%, PMT HV, 76; 543 nm laser power, 41.4%, PMT HV, 108; pinhole size, 40 μm; 20× objective.</p><p>Neutrophils burrowing inside apoptotic hepatocytes were analyzed by IMARIS software (adopted from the analysis of vesicles in cells).

Next, the sections were washed three times in PBS, incubated for 1 hr in the appropriate secondary antibody solution containing DAPI for 2 hr at 4°C, and then washed three times in PBS. The immunostained sections were mounted onto slides with an aqueous mounting medium. All tissue sections were scanned by a Zeiss 710 confocal microscope. The Z-stack scanned images were edited by Zen 2009 software.</p><p>To observe the liver ultrastructure with TEM, mouse livers were removed, fixed (2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4), and cut into multiple 1 mm × 1 mm strips in fluid; several strips were simultaneously cut into 1 mm × 1 mm × 1 mm blocks for TEM. Blocks were transferred to wash buffer (0.1 M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4) to remove glutaraldehyde and postfixed for 1 hr in 1% osmium tetroxide. The specimens were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol (75%, 85%, 95%, and 100%) and embedded in Epon812. Ultrathin sections were obtained and then observed with a HITACHI H600 TEM. Apoptotic liver cells were determined based on changes in nuclear morphology (chromatin condensation and fragmentation).

For antibody-based depletion, WT mice were injected i.p. with anti-mouse Ly6G clone 1A8 (Bio X Cell) supernatant containing 0.5 mg protein every 48 hr for 1 month. Control animals were injected with isotype-matched normal control antibody. For genetic neutrophil ablation, diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR)-expressing Rosa26iDTR mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buch et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Saito et al., 2001</xref>) (The Jackson Laboratory) were bred onto the <italic>Mrp8</italic>-Cre genetic background (The Jackson Laboratory). Cre expression in MRP-expressing cells, mainly granulocytes, will activate DTR expression in only MRP-expressing cells. At the age of 3 months, the Rosa26iDTR/Mrp8-Cre mice and WT control littermates (Rosa26iDTR) were treated with diphtheria toxin (DT, 20 ng/g BW, i.p., daily for 3 days) to induce Mrp8<sup>+</sup> cell depletion.</p><p>Clodronate-liposome (YEASEN, 40337ES05) was used to deplete mouse macrophage.

The cells were then washed with HBSS and analyzed by flow cytometry. The forward scatter reflects cell size, whereas the sideward scatter reveals the degree of granularity of the cell. Apoptotic NCTC cells with burrowed neutrophils increased in cell size and granularity, causing increased diffraction of the laser beam, revealed by spreading of the dots to the upper right corner.

The authors applied intravital microscopy, Immunostaining and electron microscopy to visualize perforocytosis of neutrophil in hepatocytes. They also found that neutrophil depletion impairs the clearance of apoptotic hepatocytes causing impaired liver function and generation of autoantibodies, implying a role of defective neutrophil- mediated clearance of apoptotic cells in Autoimmune Liver disease. The experiments were well designed and conducted, the results were reasonably interpreted, and the manuscript was clearly written with logical inputs.</p><p>Further studies to explore the signals/mechanisms that determine why neutrophil specifically target apoptotic hepatocytes in liver would be of great clinical significance.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86591.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Neutrophils are not known to be the cells responsible for removal of apoptotic cells through efferocytosis. This report provides strong evidence that neutrophils can remove apoptotic hepatocytes in vivo and in vitro. In addition, neutrophils, which are much smaller in size than hepatocytes, can burrow into apoptotic hepatocytes.</p><p>Neutrophils are the most abundant circulating leukocytes in human. They play important roles in innate immune responses to infections and tissue injuries. Although they are dept in phagocytosis of microbes, neutrophils are not known to normally conduct efferocytosis or phagocytose host cells including apoptotic cells and play a significant role in apoptotic cell removal. In this report the authors provide evidence to suggest that neutrophils are involved in removal of apoptotic hepatocytes with certain specificity (i.e., they do not remove HEK293 or HUVEC endothelial cells). Moreover, the authors also show that neutrophils can burrow into the target cells and possibly ingest the target cells from the inside. The authors thus term this neutrophil-mediated efferocytosis process as &quot;perforocytosis&quot;. Furthermore, evidence is provided to suggest that this neutrophil-mediated efferocytosis process keeps the number of apoptotic cells low in the livers and that defects in the processes may associate with autoimmune liver (AIL) disease phenotypes. Therefore, many of these findings are novel and the study is of important implications in our understanding of the role of neutrophils in autoimmune disease. Overall speaking, as the first report describing this novel finding, the authors have provided reasonably strong evidence for the conclusion that neutrophils burrow into apoptotic hepatocytes to perform &quot;perforocytosis&quot; to eliminate apoptotic hepatocytes. The importance, particularly in vivo significance, of this phenomenon needs to be further substantiated in future studies.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86591.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response:</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Luyang</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Lixiang</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Juan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xiangyu</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Fang</surname><given-names>Xinzou</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Qi</surname><given-names>Yawen</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tang</surname><given-names>Yingkui</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Jieya</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Peng</surname><given-names>Shengxian</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Liangxue</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Xiaobo</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ji</surname><given-names>Yuan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hou</surname><given-names>Yingyong</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Yi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Xianming</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Youyang</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Yong</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wei</surname><given-names>Yuquan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Malik</surname><given-names>Asrar</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Saiyin</surname><given-names>Hexige</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Jingsong</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors' response to the original reviews.</p><p>Thank you for considering our manuscript “An Unexpected Role of Neutrophils in Clearing Apoptotic Hepatocytes In Vivo&quot;.

The authors applied intravital microscopy, Immunostaining and electron microscopy to visualize perforocytosis of neutrophil in hepatocytes. They also found that neutrophil depletion impairs the clearance of apoptotic hepatocytes causing impaired liver function and generation of autoantibodies, implying a role of defective neutrophil- mediated clearance of apoptotic cells in Autoimmune Liver disease. The experiments were well designed and conducted, the results were reasonably interpreted, and the manuscript was clearly written with logical inputs.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One weak point is that the signals/mechanisms that determine why neutrophil specifically target apoptotic hepatocytes in liver and no other organs or cells is not clearly understood.</p></disp-quote><p>We are still studying why neutrophils selectively phagocytose hepatocytes but not HUVEC or 293 cells. We have some intriguing preliminary data so far showing that apoptotic 293 cells have no significant increase of IL-1β production as compared with their nonapoptotic controls; both apoptotic 293 cells and HUVECs do not have increased surface selectin proteins (new Fig. S3C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>[…] By examination of HE-stained, noncancerous liver tissue sections from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatic hemangioma, the authors observed that cells with neutrophil nuclear morphology were inside apoptotic hepatocytes. The authors also further characterized this observation by staining the sections with neutrophil and apoptosis markers. In addition, the authors observed the same phenomena in mouse livers using intravital microscopy, which also recorded the time course of the disappearance of a neutrophil-associated apoptotic cell. The author went on further characterization of neutrophil-mediated efferocytosis of cultured hepatic cells in vitro and demonstrated the process was specific for apoptotic hepatic cells, but not HEK293 or endothelial cells. The in vitro system was then used to characterize the molecular bases for neutrophil-mediated efferocytosis of apoptotic hepatic cells. The evidence was provided to suggest that IL1b and IL-8 released from and selectins upregulated in apoptotic hepatic cells were important. Importantly, the authors used two methods to deplete the neutrophils and showed that the neutrophil depletion increased apoptotic cells in livers. Finally, the authors showed that neutrophil depletion caused defects in liver function parameters. At the end, the authors presented evidence to suggest that AIL disease may be due to defective neutrophils that fail to perform &quot;perforocytosis.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point #1. Although the evidence in its totality indicates that neutrophils burrow into apoptotic hepatocytes, the significance of this &quot;perforocytosis&quot; phenomenon and the circumstances under which it may occur remain to be better defined. In both neutrophil depletion models, the TNUEL-positive cells were not definitively identified rather than assuming they were hepatocytes.</p></disp-quote><p>Anatomically, the apoptotic hepatocytes are randomly distributed in the hepatic plate from the central vein to the portal region (please refer to the image below: hematoxylin staining of liver tissues, black arrowhead indicates perforocytosis sites).</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-86591-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Histologically, the structure of liver/hepatic lobe are well defined, and the cell types in the livers are easy to histologically identify based on their location, morphology and the relationship to hepatic plate and sinusoid. In addition, the hepatocytes are well known for its rich cytoplasmic components, cellular connection and prominent large round nucleus. Thus, hepatocytes are very easy to identify even without using specific molecular markers such as E-cadherin or albumin. Based on these characteristics, the TUNEL positive cells that we displayed in Fig. 5A are apoptotic hepatocytes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point #2. In addition, there are discrepancies in the number of neutrophils and apoptotic cells in mouse liver studies; Fig. 2a WT (many neutrophils; locations unclear) vs Fig. 5A Ctr (a few neutrophils that appear in or near a vessel), and Fig. 2a DTR (a few apoptotic cells) vs Fig. 5A Depletion (many apoptotic cells).</p></disp-quote><p>In response, Fig. 2A demonstrates a larger area of the mouse liver (bar, 100 µm), while Fig. 5A exhibits a relatively small area of the liver sample (bars, 20 µm for Ctrl and 15 µm for DTR). Similarly, apoptotic cells in Fig. 2A DTR need to zoom in to quantify. We apologize for the confusion, and we did quantify the apoptotic cells in Fig.2A WT vs DTR (see the bar graph next to the images in Fig. 2A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point #3. Importantly, Fig 5a Ctrl, which is presumably a section from a mouse without any surgical treatment or without inflammation, the sole TUNNEL signal does not appear to be associated with neutrophils. Does this mean that &quot;perforocytosis&quot; primarily occurs in inflamed livers (Of note, human liver samples in Fig 1 are from patient with tumors. There should be inflammation in the livers of these patients).</p></disp-quote><p>In Fig 5A Ctrl, the TUNEL signal indicates apoptotic hepatocytes. The neutrophils (stained with anti-NE antibody, red) are associated with the apoptotic hepatocyte (Fig. 5A). We observed that perforocytosis primarily occurs in normal noninflamed livers.</p><p>Human liver samples in Fig 1 are from patient with tumors, hence it is possible that neutrophil burrowing is somehow associated with cancerous/inflammatory livers as the reviewer pointed out. This possibility was ruled out based on our method of sample preparation and experimental results themselves.</p><p>1. Both noncancerous and cancerous liver samples were sliced based on the anatomical appearance of normal and cancer tissues (differences were rather easy to identify, and these samples were prepared by highly experienced pathologists from the Liver Cancer Center of Zhongshan Hospital, Shanghai). Furthermore, the results were confirmed by determining whether the surrounding tissue contained microlesions characteristic of metastatic tumors. We only counted apoptotic hepatocytes in noncancerous regions having normal liver lobes and morphologically normal hepatocytes, plates, sinusoid and Kupffer cells. We also excluded hepatoma, chronic inflammatory regions, and necrotic regions.</p><p>2. We did not observe recruitment of neutrophils into apoptotic HCC cells, indicating that the clearance of apoptotic cancer cells was not mediated by neutrophils (unpublished observations).</p><p>3. It is hard for us to obtain normal human liver samples; however, we did study samples from patients with liver hemangioma characterized by aberrant vasculature in livers but with normal liver functions and the structure of hemangioma livers that we analyzed are nearly identical to a healthy liver in histology (these liver samples contained no cancerous regions and there was no apparent cirrhosis or inflammation). And here we obtained similar results (these are shown in Fig. 1B; a total of 40 apoptotic hepatocytes were examined).</p><p>4. Our data from normal mouse livers, isolated primary cells (hepatocytes and neutrophils) and cell lines (NCTC and HL60) all confirmed the central findings in this paper (Fig. 2, 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point #4. The data on human AIL patient neutrophils raises more questions: how many AIL patients have been examined? Do these AIL neutrophils lack IL1, IL8 receptors, and/or selectin ligands? Are there increases in apoptotic hepatocytes in AIL patients?</p></disp-quote><p>In response, we have analyzed 16 AIL patient samples (see table below).</p><table-wrap id="sa3table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>No.total apototic cells</th><th>phagocytlized by PMNS</th><th>phagocytlized by Monoctye</th><th/><th/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">normal liver</td><td align="left" valign="top">32</td><td align="left" valign="top">227</td><td align="left" valign="top">227</td><td align="left" valign="top">0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">AIL</td><td align="left" valign="top">16</td><td align="left" valign="top">110</td><td align="left" valign="top">8</td><td align="left" valign="top">40</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>We performed microarray assay to screen the differential gene expression of neutrophils from normal and liver autoimmune patients.
