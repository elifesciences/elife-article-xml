The proteases that mediate entry differ between cell lines, and it is currently unclear which proteases are relevant in vivo. A remarkable feature of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike is the presence of a multibasic cleavage site (MBCS), which is absent in the SARS-CoV spike. Here, we report that the SARS-CoV-2 spike MBCS increases infectivity on human airway organoids (hAOs). Compared with SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 entered faster into Calu-3 cells and, more frequently, formed syncytia in hAOs. Moreover, the MBCS increased entry speed and plasma membrane serine protease usage relative to cathepsin-mediated endosomal entry. Blocking serine proteases, but not cathepsins, effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication in hAOs. Our findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 enters relevant airway cells using serine proteases, and suggest that the MBCS is an adaptation to this viral entry strategy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV</kwd><kwd>multibasic cleavage site</kwd><kwd>serine proteases</kwd><kwd>airway organoids</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>0.22.005.032</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Haagmans</surname><given-names>Bart L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001826</institution-id><institution>ZonMw</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>10150062010008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Haagmans</surname><given-names>Bart L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Health Holland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LSHM19136</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Haagmans</surname><given-names>Bart L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Whereas SARS-CoV-2 utilizes cathepsins to enter most cell lines, human airway organoids revealed that entry into relevant cells is dependent on serine proteases, which can be targeted for treatment.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which emerged in central China late 2019 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>). Within months, this virus spread globally, and as of October 15, 2020, over 38 million cases have been reported, including over 1 million deaths. Halting SARS-CoV-2 spread has shown to be highly complex, putting great strain on health systems globally. SARS-CoV-2 is the third zoonotic coronavirus to emerge from animal reservoirs within the past two decades, after SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), in 2002 and 2012, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Drosten et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kuiken et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Peiris et al., 2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zaki et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not attained sustained human-to-human transmission. These coronaviruses belong to the Betacoronavirus genus (family Coronaviridae, subfamily Orthocoronavirinae), which is thought to ultimately originate from bats, but can spread to humans via intermediate hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lau et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Currently, it is largely unknown what factors determine coronavirus transmission to and between humans, but one important determinant may be the coronavirus spike (S) protein, which is the main glycoprotein incorporated into the viral envelope. Enveloped viruses, including coronaviruses, deposit their genomes into host cells by coalescing their membranes with the cell. This function is executed by S protein trimers, which fuse viral and cellular membranes after binding to the entry receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hulswit et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, coronaviruses can spread from cell to cell when coronavirus S proteins traffic to the plasma membrane of infected cells and fuse with neighboring cells, generating multinucleated giant cells (syncytia). Coronavirus S proteins are synthesized in infected cells in a stable and fusion-incompetent form and are activated through cleavage by host proteases. Proteolysis controls the timely release of the S protein’s stored energy required to fuse membranes, which allows virions to be stable in the environment yet fusogenic after contacting entry receptors on host cell membranes.</p><p>Cleavage is essential for coronavirus infectivity and can occur in the secretory pathway of infected cells or during viral entry into target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hulswit et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Millet and Whittaker, 2015</xref>). Several groups of host proteases, including type II transmembrane serine proteases (hereafter referred to as serine proteases), proprotein convertases, and cathepsins, can cleave the S protein. Specific sites in the S protein regulate protease usage and therefore play an important role in determining cell tropism. Similarly, tropism can be determined by the availability of proteases that can activate the S protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Belouzard et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Menachery et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Millet and Whittaker, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). The S protein consists of two domains, the receptor binding (S1) domain and the fusion (S2) domain. These domains are separated by the S1/S2 cleavage site, which in some coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, forms an exposed loop that harbors multiple arginine residues and is therefore referred to as a multibasic cleavage site (MBCS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Walls et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wrapp et al., 2020</xref>). Cleavage of this site can occur in secretory systems of infected cells by proprotein convertases, including furin. S1/S2 cleavage does not directly trigger fusion but may facilitate or regulate further cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Park et al., 2016</xref>). A second proteolysis step takes place at a more C-terminal site within the S2 domain, notably the S2′ site. S2′ cleavage is thought to occur after the virus has been released from producing cells and is bound to host cell receptors on receiving cells. The S2′ site is processed by serine proteases on the plasma membrane or by cathepsins in the endosome. Whereas S2′ cleavage appears to be crucial for coronavirus infectivity, not all coronaviruses contain a multibasic S1/S2 site and little is known of its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hulswit et al., 2016</xref>). Until recently, all viruses within the clade of SARS-related viruses, including SARS-CoV, were found to lack a multibasic S1/S2 cleavage site. However, SARS-CoV-2 contains a proline-arginine-arginine-alanine (PRRA) insertion into the S protein, precisely N-terminally from a conserved arginine, creating a multibasic RRAR cleavage motif. Exchanging the SARS-CoV-2 S MBCS for the SARS-CoV monobasic site was recently shown to decrease fusogenicity on a monkey kidney cell line (VeroE6) and infectivity in a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line (Calu-3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hoffmann et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shang et al., 2020</xref>). However, cancer cells often poorly represent untransformed cells and thus the question remains whether the MBCS would affect infectivity on relevant airway cells. Another study showed that entry of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoparticles (PP) into Calu-3 cells could be blocked using a clinically approved serine protease inhibitor (camostat mesylate) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hoffmann et al., 2020b</xref>). In contrast, in most other cell lines (including the lung cell line A549), recent CRISPR-Cas9 screens have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 entry in cell lines appears to be mediated by endosomal cathepsins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Daniloski et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wei et al., 2020a</xref>). These discrepancies between human lung cell lines underscore the importance of using relevant cells, such as human airway organoids (hAOs), to study SARS-CoV-2 entry. Here, we investigated if the SARS-CoV-2 MBCS affects entry into relevant human airway cells (1), if the MBCS can alter protease usage during entry (2), and which entry pathway is taken by SARS-CoV-2 in hAOs (3).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Entry into lung adenocarcinoma cells and hAOs is facilitated by the SARS-CoV-2 S MBCS</title><p>Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hoffmann et al., 2020a</xref> showed that the SARS-CoV-2 multibasic cleavage motif increases entry into Calu-3 cells by exchanging this motif and several N-terminally flanking amino acids with the monobasic S1/S2 site found in SARS-CoV or in a related bat virus RaTG13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hoffmann et al., 2020a</xref>). Building on these observations, we generated several SARS-CoV-2 S protein mutants and used these to generate vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based PP stocks expressing a green fluorescent protein (GFP). Instead of exchanging cleavage sites, we mutated the minimal RXXR multibasic cleavage motif by deleting the PRRA insertion (Del-PRRA), changing the last arginine to an alanine (R685A) or to a histidine (R685H) in order to preserve the positive charge at this site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Immunoblotting revealed that wild-type and mutant PPs were produced at similar levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). S1/S2 cleavage was observed for the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 PPs and abrogated by the PRRA deletion and the R685A and R685H substitutions, which is in agreement with studies showing that the SARS-CoV-2 S is cleaved by proprotein convertases, possibly furin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hoffmann et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shang et al., 2020</xref>). Next, we assessed the infectivity of these viruses and found that the SARS-2-Del-PRRA and SARS-2-R685A mutants were 5- to 10-fold more infectious on VeroE6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, on the lung adenocarcinoma cell line Calu-3, the SARS-2-Del-PRRA, SARS-2-R685A, and SARS-2-R685H PPs were approximately 5- to 10-fold less infectious compared with the wild-type PPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These data show that the PRRA deletion and single point mutations could functionally destroy the MBCS and suggest that this site enhances airway cell entry. Next, we assessed the effect of the MBCS in a relevant cell culture system. A 3D airway organoid model that allows efficient SARS-CoV-2 replication where infectious virus titers increase over time has not yet been established, but we previously reported that 2D airway organoid-derived air–liquid interface differentiated cultures allow efficient SARS-CoV-2 replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lamers et al., 2020</xref>). In this model, hAOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sachs et al., 2019</xref>) are dissociated, seeded onto collagen-coated Transwell inserts, and differentiated at air–liquid interface in Pneumacult ALI medium (Stemcell). After differentiation, cultures contain ciliated cells, club cells, and goblet cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, they express the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), a serine protease previously shown to mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry when overexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hoffmann et al., 2020b</xref>). To set up a 3D model, we dissociated these 2D air–liquid differentiated cultures into small clumps, infected these in suspension, and then re-plated the clumps into basement membrane extract (BME), in which they formed spheroids. SARS-CoV-2 PPs successfully infected these hAOs, as observed by fluorescent microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 PPs were approximately two times more infectious on these cells compared with the SARS-2-Del-PRRA and SARS-2-R685A mutants, and eight times more infectious than the SARS-2-R685H mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), demonstrating that the SARS-CoV-2 MBCS facilitates entry into human airway cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The SARS-CoV-2 S multibasic cleavage site mediates entry into human airway organoids.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic overview of SARS-CoV-2 S protein mutants.

Likewise, inserting the PRRA motif into SARS-CoV S and thereby generating an MBCS did not increase PP infectivity on Calu-3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). To investigate this further, we compared the entry route taken by these viruses in Calu-3 cells. For this purpose, we used inhibitors of two major coronavirus entry pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hulswit et al., 2016</xref>). Serine proteases are known to mediate early coronavirus entry on the plasma membrane or in the early endosome, whereas cathepsins facilitate entry in late, acidified endosomes. Concentration ranges of either a serine protease inhibitor (camostat mesylate; hereafter referred to as camostat) or a cathepsin inhibitor (E64D) were used to assess the entry route into Calu-3 cells. Entry of SARS-CoV-2 PPs was not inhibited by E64D, but could be inhibited by camostat, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 exclusively uses serine proteases for entry into these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). For SARS-CoV PPs, entry was inhibited slightly by E64D (~10%), but camostat had a far stronger effect (~90%), indicating that SARS-CoV mainly uses serine proteases to enter Calu-3 cells but that a small fraction of virions enter via cathepsins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). Previously, Calu-3 cells have been suggested to have low levels of cathepsin activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Park et al., 2016</xref>). The observation that some SARS-CoV PPs use cathepsins suggests that this virus less efficiently uses the surface serine proteases encountered early during entry, resulting in particles accumulating in the endosome, where they are cleaved by cathepsins. To test this, we measured the serine protease-mediated entry rate of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV by blocking entry on Calu-3 cells at different time points postinfection using camostat. Cells were pretreated with E64D to prevent any cathepsin-mediated entry. Using both PPs and authentic virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>), we observed that SARS-CoV-2 entered faster than SARS-CoV via serine proteases. Next, we assessed whether the presence of an MBCS could increase the serine protease-mediated entry rate into Calu-3 cells. For this purpose, we used SARS-CoV S PPs containing the PRRA insertion (SARS-PRRA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Immunoblotting revealed that, in contrast to SARS-CoV PPs, SARS-PRRA PPs were partially cleaved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Whereas wild-type SARS-CoV PPs used cathepsins, SARS-PRRA PPs did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,I</xref>). The serine protease-mediated entry rate of SARS-PRRA PPs on Calu-3 cells was higher compared with SARS-CoV PPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>), and it was lower for SARS-2-Del-PRRA PPs compared with SARS-CoV-2 PPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>).

To investigate this, cells that contain both serine and cathepsin protease-mediated entry should be used. Therefore, we focused on VeroE6 cells, which have an active cathepsin-mediated cell entry pathway, as on these cells both SARS-CoV-2 PP and SARS-CoV PP entry was inhibited by E64D, and not by camostat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). To generate a cell line in which both entry pathways are active, we stably expressed TMPRSS2 in VeroE6 cells. In these cells, SARS-CoV-2 PP entry was inhibited ~95% by camostat, whereas SARS-CoV PPs were only inhibited ~35% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). In accordance, E64D did not block SARS-CoV-2 PP entry, while it decreased SARS-CoV PP entry ~30%. These findings indicate that despite a functional serine protease-mediated entry pathway, a significant part of SARS-CoV PPs still retained cathepsin-mediated entry, whereas SARS-CoV-2 PPs only used serine proteases for entry. This phenotype was found to be linked to the MBCS as SARS-CoV-2 PPs containing mutations in this site entered less through serine proteases and more through cathepsins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>).

Hence, serine protease inhibition could be an attractive therapeutic option. Therefore, we assessed whether camostat could block SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication using hAOs. In these differentiated organoids the apical side of the cells was facing outwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>), facilitating virus excretion into the culture medium. These cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a high multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 2, but pretreatment with camostat efficiently blocked virus infection as evidenced by confocal microscopy on hAOs fixed at 16 hr postinfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Cathepsin inhibition did not affect entry. At 24 hr postinfection, SARS-CoV-2 infection spread in hAOs treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or E64D, but only rare single cells were observed after camostat treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Next, we tested whether virus replication was affected by camostat pretreatment of the hAOs. After infection at an MOI of 2, replication was assessed at 2, 24, and 48 hr postinfection by RT-qPCR and live virus titration. In the control hAOs, SARS-CoV-2 replicated to high titers, while camostat reduced replication by approximately 90% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–E</xref>). We also tested the effect of camostat in 2D differentiated hAOs at air–liquid interface using a low MOI of 0.1. Here, viral titers in apical washes did not increase after camostat pretreatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), whereas replication to moderate titers was observed in the control wells.

Recent findings show that replacing this site with the SARS-CoV monobasic cleavage site decreases PP infectivity on the adenocarcinoma cell line Calu-3, suggesting that this motif is a human airway adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hoffmann et al., 2020a</xref>). This raised the question whether similar findings would be obtained in relevant lung cells. In this study, we found that the SARS-CoV-2 MBCS alters tropism by increasing infectivity on hAOs. Furthermore, we report that the MBCS increases S protein fusogenicity, entry rate, and serine protease usage. Blocking serine proteases, but not cathepsins, in hAOs effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication, suggesting that serine protease-mediated entry is the main entry route in vivo.</p><p>In contrast to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV does not contain an MBCS, yet infects Calu-3 cells with similar efficiency. Introducing an MBCS to SARS-CoV S did not increase infectivity, indicating that the SARS-CoV S has other adaptations to enter airway cells. These data are in agreement with a study that observed no benefit of furin cleavage on SARS-CoV infectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Follis et al., 2006</xref>). Whereas SARS-CoV-2 appears to have adapted to increase fusogenicity and serine protease-mediated S activation for rapid plasma membrane entry, SARS-CoV may have specific adaptations to enter these cells more slowly. Slower viral dissemination may explain why most SARS-CoV patients entered the infectious phase of the disease after symptom onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cheng et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Peiris et al., 2003a</xref>). This could have played a role in the 2003 SARS-CoV epidemic, allowing strict public health interventions including quarantining of symptomatic people and contact tracing to halt viral spread. For SARS-CoV-2, however, several studies have reported that individuals can transmit the virus to others before they become symptomatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kimball et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wei et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wiersinga et al., 2020</xref>). Whether differences in entry rate allow SARS-CoV-2 to spread more efficiently in the human airway compared with SARS-CoV remains to be investigated. It will be interesting to assess this using authentic SARS-CoV-2 containing MBCS mutations, which requires a reverse genetic system, not available to this study at present. Whether cell–cell fusion also plays a role in virus dissemination needs to be determined. In a cell–cell fusion assay and in hAOs cultured at air–liquid interface, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is more fusogenic than SARS-CoV and that fusogenicity is increased by the SARS-CoV-2 S MBCS. The role of cell–cell fusion in coronavirus transmission and pathogenesis has not been investigated in detail, but it could be a strategy to avoid extracellular immune surveillance and may increase the viral dissemination rate in the airways in vivo. Whether the MBCS also affects entry into cells of other organs needs to be investigated further. Although SARS-CoV-2 symptoms are mainly respiratory, recent reports indicate frequent extrapulmonary manifestations, including but not limited to thrombotic complications, acute kidney injury, gastrointestinal symptoms, dermatologic complications, and anosmia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gupta et al., 2020</xref>). Of note, acute kidney injury was uncommon during the SARS-CoV epidemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chu et al., 2005</xref>). It is unclear at this moment whether these manifestations are the result of extrapulmonary viral replication.</p><p>Using VeroE6-TMPRSS2 cells that have both active serine protease- and cathepsin-mediated entry pathways, we show that the MBCS increases serine protease-mediated S activation, while decreasing cathepsin-mediated S activation. This indicates that the MBCS could be an adaptation to serine protease-mediated entry. Whether this site improves S activation by any protease or by serine proteases specifically remains to be tested. Encountering serine proteases first may result in more plasma membrane entry over endosomal entry. More efficient fusion of multibasic motif containing S proteins may be caused by increased S2’ cleavage due to higher accessibility of a S1/S2 cleaved S compared with an uncleaved S. S1/S2 cleavage was recently shown to increase the binding of S to ACE2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wrobel et al., 2020</xref>). Recent reports indicate that neuropilins (NRP) may be an additional entry factor for SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cantuti-Castelvetri et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Daly et al., 2020</xref>). This is an interesting hypothesis as ACE2 expression (mRNA and protein) is relatively low in the lungs, whereas NRP expression appears to be abundant. NRP1 binds peptides with an exposed C-terminal arginine, such as furin-cleaved proteins, and a SARS-CoV-2 mutant with an altered MBCS did not depend on NRP1 for infectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cantuti-Castelvetri et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, it was concluded that NRP1 may promote the interaction of the S1/S2-cleaved virus with ACE2. However, Daly and colleagues observed that NRP1 knockdown did not affect cellular attachment, but did enhance entry and syncytium formation. Therefore, we suggest that NRP1 may facilitate S2’ cleavage by exposing this site or S1 dissociation after S2’ cleavage for timely exposure of the fusion peptide and subsequent fusion. Structural changes caused by S1/S2 cleavage may affect protease accessibility or protein interactions at the cell membrane as well as increase subsequent S2’ cleavage.</p><p>While mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 MBCS decreased airway cell infectivity, they increased infectivity on VeroE6 cells. Several groups have reported mutations or deletions in or around the SARS-CoV-2 MBCS that arise in cell culture on VeroE6 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Klimstra et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lau et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ogando et al., 2020</xref>), indicating that the lack of an MBCS creates a selective advantage in cell culture on VeroE6 cells. The mechanism behind this remains unknown. The increased infectivity of MBCS mutants was not observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hoffmann et al., 2020a</xref>, but in that study, complete cleavage motifs including four amino acids N-terminally from the minimal RXXR cleavage site were exchanged between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hoffmann et al., 2020a</xref>). In contrast, we mutated single sites or removed/inserted only the PRRA motif. Importantly, a cell culture-adapted virus containing a complete deletion of the MBCS was recently shown to be attenuated in hamsters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lau et al., 2020</xref>). These studies support our findings that the SARS-CoV-2 MBCS affects tropism, facilitates airway cell entry, and show that proper characterization of virus stocks is essential.</p><p>Entry inhibition has been proposed as an effective treatment option for SARS-CoV-2. Chloroquine can block SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 entry in vitro into VeroE6 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Vincent et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2020</xref>), but does not block entry into cells expressing serine proteases (Calu-3 and Vero-TMPRSS2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hoffmann et al., 2020c</xref>). This is expected, as chloroquine acts in the endosome, while the endosomal entry pathway is not utilized in serine protease expressing cells. As lung cells express serine proteases, inhibitors that block endosomal entry are likely to be ineffective in vivo. These findings highlight that drug screens should be performed directly in relevant cells to prevent wasting resources. Our study shows that SARS-CoV-2 replication in hAOs infected with a high MOI is inhibited ~90% by camostat, suggesting that this drug may be effective in vivo. Future studies assessing the efficacy and safety of camostat in animal models should be conducted. For SARS-CoV, camostat improved survival to 60% in a lethal mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). In the same study, inhibition of cathepsins using a cysteine protease inhibitor was ineffective, supporting a critical role for serine proteases in viral spread and pathogenesis in vivo. In Japan, camostat has been clinically approved to treat chronic pancreatitis and thus represents a potential therapy for respiratory coronavirus infections.</p><p>We demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 enters hAOs using serine proteases, but not using cathepsins, clarifying existing discrepancies between human cell lines and suggesting that serine-protease-mediated entry is the main entry route in vivo. In addition, our findings indicate that the multibasic cleavage motif in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is an adaptation to this viral entry strategy, and can guide the design of entry inhibitors to combat COVID-19.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

Beta-actin was tagged with 7xGFP11 expressed in tandem and blue fluorescent protein (BFP). The two genes were separated by a P2A self-cleaving peptide. Two variants of this construct were used. One variant contained a GSG linker located N-terminally from the P2A site to improve self-cleavage and this construct was used in qualitative confocal microscopy experiments. A variant lacking the GSG linker was less efficiently cleaved as indicated by both cytoplasmic and nuclear localized GFP, but this generated an equal distribution of GFP throughout the cell and therefore it was used for all fusion assays in which the sum of all GFP+ pixels was calculated. Transfected HEK-293T cells were incubated overnight at 37°C 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. GFP1-10 expressing cells were seeded in a 12-well plate to achieve 90–100% confluency after overnight incubation at 37°C 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and medium was refreshed with Opti-MEM I (1×) + GlutaMAX. HEK-293T cells were resuspended in PBS by pipetting to generate a single-cell suspension and added to GFP1-10 expressing cells in a ratio of 1:80 (HEK-293T cells: GFP1-10 expressing cells). Fusion events were quantified by detecting GFP+ pixels after 18 hr incubation at 37°C 5% CO<sub>2</sub> using Amersham Typhoon Biomolecular Imager (channel Cy2; resolution 10 µm; GE Healthcare). Data was analyzed using the ImageQuant TL 8.2 image analysis software (GE Healthcare) by calculating the sum of all GFP+ pixels per well.

After 1 hr, PPs were added per well to achieve 1000 infected cells in the control well. At the same time as addition of PPs, 10 µM camostat was added into the first set of wells (t = 0). DMSO was added to controls. The same inhibitor was added in the next sets of wells in triplicate 2, 4, and 6 hr postinfection. Plates were incubated overnight at 37°C 5% CO<sub>2</sub> before scanning for GFP signal as described above.</p><p>Authentic virus entry speed was performed in the same manner, by infecting Calu-3 cells with 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> TCID50 SARS-CoV-2 and 5 × 10<sup>4</sup> TCID50 SARS-CoV. After 12 hr, plates were fixed and blocked as above for transwell inserts. Cells were incubated with mouse-anti-double stranded RNA (Clone J2, 1:500, Scicons) in blocking buffer for 2 hr at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. Cells were washed twice with PBS and stained with Alexa488 conjugated secondary antibody (1:500, Invitrogen) in blocking buffer for an hour at room temperature. Finally, cells were washed twice with PBS and scanned in PBS on the Amersham Typhoon as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Coronavirus S pseudotyped particle concentration</title><p>PPs were concentrated on a 10% sucrose cushion (10% sucrose, 15 mM Tris–HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA) at 20,000 × g for 1.5 hr at 4°C. Supernatant was decanted, and pellet was resuspended overnight at 4°C in Opti-MEM I (1×) + GlutaMAX to achieve 100-fold concentration. PPs were titrated and aliquots were lysed in 1× Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad) containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol for western blot analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>PP infection of primary airway cells</title><p>To determine the effect of MBCS mutations on SARS-CoV-2 entry, we obtained airway culture fragments from 2D differentiated bronchiolar cultures as described above. Next, fragments were infected with 40 µL of concentrated wild-type and MBCS mutant PPs for 2 hr at 37°C 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Subsequently, the supernatant was replaced with 30 μL BME and plated in a 48-well plate. Approximately 200,000 cells were plated per well. After solidification of the BME, 200 μL PC was added per well and plates were incubated at 37°C 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. After overnight incubation, the amount of infected cells and organoids per five fields were counted and images taken using a Carl ZEISS Vert.A1 microscope paired with an AxioCam ICm1 camera and Colibri seven laser (469/38 nm for GFP) using ZEN analysis software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Spike protein western blot</title><p>Concentrated PPs diluted in 4× Laemmli loading buffer were boiled for 30 min at 95°C. S transfected HEK-293T cells were lysed using IP Lysis Buffer (Pierce). Cell lysate was rotated for 30 min and centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 × g. Supernatant was used for subsequent protein expression analysis. Lysates were diluted in 4× Laemmli loading buffer containing 20% 2-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 30 min at 95°C. PPs and cell lysates were used for sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis using precast 10% TGX gels (Bio-Rad). Gels were run in Tris–glycine–SDS buffer at 50 V for 30 min and subsequently at 120 V for 90 min. Transfer was performed at 300 mA for 55 min onto 0.45μm Immobilon-FL PVDF membranes in Tris–glycine buffer containing 20% methanol. Spike was stained using polyclonal rabbit-anti-SARS-CoV S1 (1:1000, Sino Biological) followed by infrared-labeled secondary antibodies (1:20,000, Licor). All cell lysate western blots are stained for GAPDH using a monoclonal mouse-anti-GAPDH antibody (sc-32233, 1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by infrared-labeled secondary antibodies. Western blots were scanned on an Odyssey CLx and analyzed using Image Studio Lite Ver 5.2 software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Silver staining</title><p>All PP western blots had corresponding silver stains performed to assess the quality of the PP preps and for the detection of VSV-N. Samples boiled in Laemmli buffer for western blot analysis were also ran on a 10% w/v gel at 50 V for 30 min followed by 120 V for 90 min before transferring gel into ultrapure water. Silver stains were performed per manufacturer’s instructions using the Silver Stain for Mass Spectrometry Kit (Pierce).

This paper describes a three-dimensional human airway organoid (huAO) system to study SARS-CoV-2 cellular infection. The authors demonstrate that efficient entry involves cleavage of the viral spike (S) protein by host serine proteinases and that the multibasic cleavage site (MBCS) in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein increases the efficiency of entry of this virus compared to viruses lacking a MBCS. The study provides important insights into the mechanism of virus entry in a relevant cell system.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;SARS-CoV-2 entry into human airway organoids is serine protease-mediated and facilitated by the multibasic cleavage site&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Miles Davenport as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Coronavirus entry into cells requires membrane fusion that is triggered by proteolytic cleavage of the viral spike (S) protein.

The fusion activity of coronaviruses is activated by proteolytic cleavage of the viral S protein at a site designated S2'. Interestingly, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 contains a small insertion that creates a multibasic cleavage site (MBCS) i.e., a second cleavage site (designated S1/S2) that is a target for cellular furin-like proteases. Published experiments in CaLu (human lung cancer derived) and Vero (African green monkey kidney) cells have suggested the MBCS increases the efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 fusion and entry, though a mechanism has not been established. The work described in this paper attempts to determine whether S1/S2 cleavage influences the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect more relevant cell cultures established from primary human respiratory tissue.</p><p>To this end, the authors generate SARS-CoV S protein mutants in which the MBCS is inactivated by removal of four amino acids, or mutation of key residues in the MBCS. The ability of pseudotyped viruses carrying the various S proteins, as well as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, is then tested in CaLu, Vero and primary human airway cultures. The data support published work indicating that the SARS-CoV-2 MBCS facilitates efficient cellular entry and, in relevant cell systems i.e., CaLu and primary cell cultures, efficient infection appears to rely on S protein activation by cell surface serine proteases. The study emphasises the importance of using appropriate tissue models for understanding the details of viral replication. However, I have some reservations about the work and its presentation that warrant attention.</p><p>The authors show some characterisation of their primary cell culture system in Figure 1—figure supplement 1. Here the cells are grown at an air liquid interface and appear well differentiated with multiple cell types present. They examine the distribution of two key cellular factors for SARS-CoV-2 entry using antibody labelling. Firstly, they have used HRP detection to locate the proteins. In my view this is less sensitive than immunofluorescence and I wonder why they have used the HRP technique. Secondly, the labelling indicates the two proteins have different locations: ACE2 at the surface of the tissue and TMPRSS2 deeper within the tissue. The authors do not comment on this or its implications for virus entry. For infection, these differentiated tissues are disrupted, the separated cells incubated with virus and the cells then allowed to form organoids (HAO). These organoids are not well characterised; it is not at all clear what cell types are infected, or why it is necessary to use this approach rather than test infection on the differentiated tissue (as in Figure 1—figure supplement 1), which appears to have an architecture similar to that of normal respiratory epithelial tissue.</p><p>The authors frequently state that the MBCS increases the rate of fusion or fusogenicity. Although fusion is key for virus entry, the event that is indirectly analysed is S protein S2' cleavage. It would be more accurate to indicate this than “rate of fusion”. The authors discuss the notion that the MBCS alters the accessibility of the S2' cleavage site, which may indeed be the case. Another contributing factor may be the ability of the S1/S2 cleaved SARS-CoV-2 S1 to bind neuropilin 1/2 through a C-end rule motif generated by cleavage of the MBCS, as suggested by two recent papers in Science. The authors should at least comment on this and whether the cell lines and primary cells used in this study express neuropilins 1/2.</p><p>In Figures 4A/B the authors show that both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 PPS infect Vero cells by the cathepsin pathway and entry is not reduced by Camostat. By contrast, in Vero cells expressing TMPRSS2 (Figure 4C/D), infection by SARS-CoV-2 PPs is significantly inhibited by Camostat and not by E64D. Why is this? The endosomal pathway should still be active in these cells.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript describes a series of experiments in cell lines and primary airway cells showing that the presence of a multibasic cleavage site (MBCS) in SARS-CoV2 spike protein, which is absent in the SARS-CoV spike, was responsible for increased infectivity in human airway organoids and human cell line (Calu3), but not VeroE6 cells. The authors demonstrate that infectivity of these cells could be inhibited by serine protease inhibitors (camostat).</p><p>The manuscript is well written and reads easily. The premise of the study – that the MBCS site is key to the differences in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 infectivity is novel and would be an addition to the field, warranting publication. This reviewer particularly liked how the authors speculated as to this maybe why chloroquine, which acts in the endosome, maybe ineffective at blocking infection in serine protease expressing cells. As lung cells express serine proteases, inhibitors that block endosomal entry are likely to be ineffective in vivo. This builds nicely on the argument that we should be using more relevant human models if we want to develop effective therapeutics.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors investigate if the SARS-CoV-2 Spike MBCS (multibasic cleavage site) affects viral entry and its dependence on host proteases TMPRSS2 and Cathepsin L. SARS-CoV-1 Spike does not have a MBCS. They show that the MBCS promotes virus infection into Calu3 cells whereas viruses lacking it prefers VeroE6 cells. Using transduction, infection, physiological airway cell cultures and quantitative syncytia assays etc. they show that the MBCS leads to faster cell entry in a TMPRSS2-dependent fashion. This can be inhibited by the clinically approved inhibitor camostat mesylate. It is a focused and informative study that extends the observations of Hoffmann et al., 2020a and others.</p><p>1) The authors emphasise that the MBCS is a viral tactic for improved entry into airway human cells. Other human cells were not tested, so I think this is a leap in logic, and others have clearly shown that MBCS-dependence is not limited to human airway cells.</p><p>Examples are; wt SARS-CoV-2 S compared to the MBCS-deficient S infected intestinal HEK and Caco-2 cells better than VeroE6. Infectivity of wt virus increased under expression of TMPRSS2 and neuropilin-1 (Cantuti-Castelvetri et al., 2020, Figure 1E and Figure 3—figure supplement 1). Furthermore, neuropilin-1 binding the S1 C-end rule motif (liberated by MBCS cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 S) enhances infectivity and spread of authentic virus in Caco-2 cells (Daly et al., 2020). These points should be discussed in context of the authors' findings.</p><p>2) Along the same lines as 1), could the authors test Caco-2 cells?</p><p>3) What are the protein (or mRNA) expression levels of TMPRSS2 and CathepsinL in the Vero, Vero-TMPRSS2, Calu3 (and Caco2) cells?</p><p>4) Figure 3 and Figure 3 —figure supplement 1B-D. It would be useful to see quantification of the enhanced syncytia in VeroE6-TMPRSS2 cells compared to VeroE6.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64508.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Coronavirus entry into cells requires membrane fusion that is triggered by proteolytic cleavage of the viral spike (S) protein.

[…] To setup a 3D model, we dissociated these 2D air-liquid differentiated cultures into small clumps, infected these in suspension and then re-plated the clumps into basement membrane extract (BME), in which they formed spheroids.

This was investigated in Figure 5B, where we performed co-stains of AcTUB and viral nucleoprotein. In these pictures the majority of infected cells appear ciliated.

Although our stainings indicate that TMPRSS2 may be more localized to cytoplasmic secretory vesicles, this does not exclude that there is TMPRSS2 as well on the apical surface (as has been shown by others). In addition, early TMPRSS2-mediated entry may not be limited to the apical plasma membrane, but could also occur in vesicles that have just been endocytosed, but have not yet become acidified endosomes. This would also be regarded as “early” entry.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For infection, these differentiated tissues are disrupted, the separated cells incubated with virus and the cells then allowed to form organoids (HAO).

However, the cultures are not separated completely into single cells. Instead, they are disrupted into small clumps which form organoids within minutes at 37 degrees celsius in culture medium. As explained above, we have chosen this approach as there is currently no established 3D differentiation protocol for airway organoids to study SARS-CoV-2 replication. For certain purposes 3D airway models may be preferred over 2D models, which is why we used both in Figure 5. In addition, a single ALI 2D organoid culture well (12 well format) can be used to plate approximately 10 3D organoid wells, as the cells grow at a high density at ALI, allowing us to perform more experiments with limited material.</p><p>In the 2D ALI cultures, we mostly see infection of ciliated cells, but club cells are occasionally infected as well (Lamers et al., 2020 Science; Lamers et al., 2020 EMBO J). Although changes in the tropism of SARS-CoV-2 are not expected when these cultures are plated in 3D, we did perform co-stainings of AcTub and viral nucleoprotein to show that ciliated cells are infected in this model as well (Figure 5B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors frequently state that the MBCS increases the rate of fusion or fusogenicity.
