and yield; identifying new methods to protect crops against insects therefore has important agricultural applications. Our analysis of transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> plants showed that overexpression of <italic>pentacyclic triterpene synthase 1</italic>, encoding the key biosynthetic enzyme for the natural plant product (3E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene (DMNT), led to a significant resistance against a major insect pest, <italic>Plutella xylostella</italic>. DMNT treatment severely damaged the peritrophic matrix (PM), a physical barrier isolating food and pathogens from the midgut wall cells. DMNT repressed the expression of <italic>PxMucin</italic> in midgut cells, and knocking down <italic>PxMucin</italic> resulted in PM rupture and <italic>P. xylostella</italic> death. A 16S RNA survey revealed that DMNT significantly disrupted midgut microbiota populations and that midgut microbes were essential for DMNT-induced killing. Therefore, we propose that the midgut microbiota assists DMNT in killing <italic>P. xylostella</italic>. These findings may provide a novel approach for plant protection against <italic>P. xylostella</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>homoterpene DMNT</kwd><kwd>Plutella xylostella</kwd><kwd>peritrophic matrix</kwd><kwd>insect midgut</kwd><kwd>microbiota</kwd><kwd>PEN1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017YFD0301301</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Peijin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016YFD0101803</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Peijin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31670264</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Peijin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The natural volatile component DMNT protects plants from insect attacks by damaging peritropic matrix barriers in insect midguts, paving a promising way for the molecular breeding of plant protection.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Insect pests are one of the major factors affecting plant development and seed production, and cause tremendous global economic losses. Mitigating the detrimental effects of insect pests constitutes a long-term goal for researchers, breeders, and farmers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Johnson and Züst, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tay and Gordon, 2019</xref>). The diamondback moth <italic>Plutella xylostella</italic> (Lepidoptera: <italic>Plutellidae</italic>) has been ranked as one of the most difficult pests to control due to its short life cycle, high migration rate, strong tolerance to environmental stresses, and rising resistance to available insecticides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shakeel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vaschetto and Beccacece, 2019</xref>). An estimated 4–5 billion dollars are devoted each year to control of this pest worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zalucki et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Plants have evolved various defense mechanisms to protect themselves from insect pests. As part of their defenses, plants can kill or repel insects indirectly; for example, attacked plants emit volatile pheromones that attract insect predators to come and kill the initial pests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pichersky et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Unsicker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gols, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). This strategy has been successfully adopted for plant protection in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Turlings and Ton, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clavijo McCormick et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2018</xref>). However, pest management by genetic manipulation of volatiles in the plant is not always successful in the field due to its complex context-dependency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bruce et al., 2015</xref>). In another line of defense, plants communicate danger signals to other plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Karban et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Karban et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kalske et al., 2019</xref>). For example, the volatile homoterpene compound (3E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene (DMNT) mediates plant–plant communication in sweet potato (<italic>Ipomoea batatas</italic>) and triggers systemic and jasmonic acid (JA)-independent anti-herbivore defenses in neighboring plants. These plants are induced to synthesize the protease inhibitor and storage protein sporamin, which is toxic to chewing pests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meents et al., 2019</xref>). Similar results were also obtained in tea plants (<italic>Camellia sinensis</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jing et al., 2020</xref>). Gasmi and colleagues reported that exposure of <italic>Spodoptera exigua</italic> larva to herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) such as indole increased its susceptibility to <italic>nucleopolyhedrovirus</italic> and <italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</italic>, and additionally they found that the microbiota population in larval midgut was significantly affected, but the mechanism remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gasmi et al., 2019</xref>). Another major line of plant defense relies on the ability to kill pests directly via the secretion of natural products that are harmful to insects. For instance, various HIPVs including indole have been reported to show direct toxicity to beet armyworm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maurya et al., 2020</xref>). Some maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic> L.) ecotypes produce a 33 kDa cysteine protease in response to caterpillar feeding that damages the insect intestine, leading to death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pechan et al., 2002</xref>). Several members of the Rubiaceae and Violaceae families produce cyclotides or macrocyclic peptides of 28–37 amino acids that disrupt epithelial cells in the midgut of cotton bollworm (<italic>Helicoverpa armigera</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barbeta et al., 2008</xref>). Another effective defense compound is the secondary metabolite benzoxazinoids, which are produced in crops, provide resistance against a broad spectrum of pests, and are used as a resistance marker in crops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Robert et al., 2017</xref>). Although utilization of toxin variants or combinations of different toxins currently offer some protection against insects, the frequent emergence of insect resistance to many insecticides diminishes the effectiveness of these methods in the ongoing long-term battle to control insect pests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stokstad, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tay et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Herrero et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Naik et al., 2018</xref>). Currently, reducing pest resistance has become a major issue in plant protection, and the identification of novel approaches is critical.</p><p>Mounting evidence shows that the insect midgut and the peritrophic matrix (PM) structure are the main targets of insecticides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kuraishi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Song et al., 2018</xref>). The PM consists of a mixture of chitin and glycoproteins secreted by intestinal cells that serves as a first and essential barrier to isolate food and intestinal microbes from the intestinal cells of invertebrates such as <italic>Bombyx mori</italic>, <italic>H. armigera</italic>, <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>, and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hegedus et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). The PM therefore prevents tissue infections in the midgut of insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dinglasan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Erlandson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hegedus et al., 2019</xref>). In fruit fly (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>), the protein drosocrystallin is a central component of the PM whose loss of function results in a reduction of PM width and an increase in its permeability, leading to higher sensitivity to bacterial infection from intestinal contents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kuraishi et al., 2011</xref>). The mucin-like protein Mucin was reported to locate to the PM and plays important roles as a saliva component involved in the virulence, host adaptation, and immunity response of the brown planthopper (<italic>Nilaparvata lugens</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shangguan et al., 2018</xref>). In maize, some cultivars develop a sharp epidermis on their leaf surface that can cause the PM of the fall armyworm (<italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic>) to rupture; this was proposed to be one of the mechanisms leading to pest death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mason et al., 2019</xref>). In mosquito <italic>Anopheles coluzzii</italic>, the formation or maintenance of the PM depends on the midgut microbiota, and the PM ruptured when antibiotics were added to the blood meal and killed the microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rodgers et al., 2017</xref>). In agreement, several studies showed that mosquitoes became more susceptible to infections from the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasite or dengue viruses when their midgut microbiota was cleared, even though the exact causal mechanism remains elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wei et al., 2017</xref>). Whether the intestinal microbiota has a direct role on PM formation in Lepidoptera has not been addressed.</p><p>While characterizing the function of pentacyclic triterpene synthase 1 (PEN1), an important enzyme catalyzing the production of the volatile metabolite DMNT in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, we demonstrate that PEN1 and its derived product DMNT play significant roles in pest control. Our data show that DMNT repels <italic>P. xylostella</italic>, eventually killing larvae by disrupting their PM. We establish that the midgut microbiota is required for this process, and that DMNT damages the PM by repressing the expression of <italic>PxMucin</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DMNT repels and kills <italic>P. xylostella</italic> larvae</title><p>While investigating the function of the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> gene <italic>PEN1</italic> (at4g15340), we noticed that <italic>PEN1</italic>-overexpressing transgenic plants exhibited strong resistance to <italic>P. xylostella</italic> infestation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>), and the <italic>P. xylostella</italic> larvae fed on <italic>35Spro:PEN1</italic> transgenic plants showed significantly lower survival rate than those on the non-transgenic control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). PEN1 has been reported to be a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of the volatile homoterpene DMNT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sohrabi et al., 2015</xref>), which was confirmed by our gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis on <italic>35Spro:PEN1</italic> transgenic plants. DMNT was enriched and could be highly induced by <italic>P. xylostella</italic> infestation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>), suggesting that DMNT might play a role in plant resistance against this chewing insect. To validate this hypothesis, we synthesized DMNT and sprayed the chemical on <italic>Brassica napus</italic> leaves before feeding of <italic>P. xylostella</italic> larvae; this bioassay demonstrated that much less of the DMNT-treated leaves was eaten compared to the control leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To determine if <italic>P. xylostella</italic> larvae sensed DMNT and avoided the volatile chemical, we set up an insect preference test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We placed forage containing DMNT or paraffin oil as control at either end of a glass test tube and positioned fourth-instar <italic>P. xylostella</italic> larvae in the center of the tube. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, significantly more larvae moved away from the DMNT side after 10–120 min, indicating that <italic>P. xylostella</italic> larvae perceived and avoided the DMNT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>(3E)-4,8-Dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene (DMNT) repels and kills <italic>P. xylostella</italic> larvae.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Pentacyclic triterpene synthase 1 (<italic>PEN1</italic>) overexpression in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> results in high resistance to <italic>P. xylostella</italic> infestation. <italic>PEN1</italic> encodes the key enzyme responsible for DMNT biosynthesis in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants.

To prepare second-instar ‘antibiotics-treated’ <italic>P. xylostella</italic> larvae, we inoculated larval eggs on plastic paper and put it close to forage containing antibiotics to ensure the larvae could eat antibiotics immediately after hatching; we found that when the larvae grew to second instar stage, the microbiota in gut were nearly killed by the antibiotic cocktail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Without DMNT, gut microbe feeding significantly decreased the survival or pupation rates of the larvae compared with the antibiotics-treated controls, and strikingly the addition of gut microbes alongside DMNT strongly enhanced the effects of DMNT treatment, all larvae died at 120 hr, and no larvae pupated in the end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C, D</xref>). In addition, we detected the gene expression level of an immune factor lysozyme. RT-PCR results showed that the <italic>lysozyme</italic> expression of larvae gut was significantly downregulated from 48 to 72 hr after DMNT treatment, suggesting that DMNT-treated larvae had a weakened ability to resist pathogen invasions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The insect <italic>P. xylostella</italic> is a devastating agricultural pest that causes tremendous economic loss globally and drives an excessive use of chemical insecticides; moreover, it is increasingly exhibiting resistance to these insecticides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tay and Gordon, 2019</xref>). Thus, the identification of natural insecticides is very important for sustainable agriculture. In this study, we present strong evidence that the natural plant compound DMNT can serve as an effective bioinsecticide against <italic>P. xylostella</italic>. DMNT exposure damages the PM structure in a microbiota-assisted manner, partially by repressing the expression of <italic>PxMucin</italic>.</p><p>Increasing studies showed that plant volatiles can enhance the resistance of adjacent plants. For instance, tomatoes release green leaf alcohol (Z)-3-hexenol after insect infestation, which are converted into glycosides after being absorbed by neighboring plants, and cause direct damages to insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sugimoto et al., 2014</xref>). Another plant volatile indole was reported to show direct toxicity to insects, and it can regulate the balance between insects, their natural enemies, and host plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Veyrat et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ye et al., 2018</xref>). DMNT exists in various plant species, and different aspects of this compound have been studied, such as DMNT biosynthesis in plants, as well as that DMNT plays a role in signal transmission to neighbor plants after being attacked by insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sohrabi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Richter et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2018</xref>), but these studies largely focused on its indirect role in plant protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mumm et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meents et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jing et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, whether (and how) DMNT plays a direct role in killing pests has remained unknown until now. Our data demonstrate that DMNT affects <italic>P. xylostella</italic> pests both in indirect and direct ways. The preference test indicated that DMNT is a volatile that can be sensed by <italic>P. xylostella</italic> larvae and repels these larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This characteristic is critical and suggests that DMNT can be used as an insect repellent, driving pests away from plants following application.</p><p>In addition to repelling <italic>P. xylostella</italic>, DMNT treatment also significantly negatively affected <italic>P. xylostella</italic> growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5E</xref>) and eventually led to lower survival and pupation rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), suggesting that this compound has both short- and long-term effects on pest development and reproduction. Meents and colleagues reported that the growth of <italic>Spodoptera litura</italic> showed no significant change after feeding with DMNT (20 μL, 1 mg/mL) for 10 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meents et al., 2019</xref>). In our study, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>, the older instar larvae with larger body weight showed relatively higher tolerance to DMNT treatment. We hypothesize that probably <italic>S. litura</italic> is more tolerant to DMNT because it has quite a large body size, thus no clear effect was observed in Meents’ study. In mosquitoes, PM integrity appears to require an intact midgut microbiota; this can be compromised by antibiotic treatment, leading to PM damage and higher susceptibility to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rodgers et al., 2017</xref>). Our data show that the midgut microbiota is essential for DMNT function as its complete removal with antibiotics eliminates DMNT-induced larval death. However, in contrast to mosquitoes, the microbiota itself does not influence the PM structure or <italic>P. xylostella</italic> development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D, E, G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rodgers et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that the midgut microbiota may play an assistant, but nevertheless essential, role in helping DMNT kill <italic>P. xylostella</italic>, similar to studies of the insecticide peptides from <italic>B. thuringiensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Caccia et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We propose the following model: upon damage incurred by the PM in response to DMNT exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), pathogens residing in the midgut pass through the PM lesions and invade midgut epithelial cells, leading to infection and tissue inflammation. In support of this hypothesis, we detected more pathogens in the midgut cells of larvae treated with DMNT in transverse sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I, J</xref>), and the lipase activity in DMNT-treated larvae was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Furthermore, the analysis of microbiota populations showed that DMNT treatment severely affected the midgut environment, causing a reduction in the dominant bacterial populations seen in controls, whereas <italic>Enterococcus</italic> populations substantially increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Several terpenoid compounds have recently been reported to selectively modulate the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> root microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 2019</xref>). It suggests that plants may regulate microbial communities by releasing volatile compounds. Consistently, in the present study, we also found that DMNT has a significant influence on gut microbiota populations in <italic>P. xylostella</italic> system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), but the mechanism needs to be studied in the future.</p><p>Disruption of the PM component drosocrystallin led to PM damage and larval death in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kuraishi et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we determined that DMNT repressed the expression of <italic>PxMucin</italic>, which encodes a component of <italic>P. xylostella</italic> PM structure. RNAi-based knockdown of this gene led to a defect in the PM structure, lower pupation rate, and larval death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), suggesting that DMNT may damage the PM and affect pest growth by regulating several signaling pathways related to PM formation rather than through a simple physical interaction with the PM. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that DMNT may limit <italic>P. xylostella</italic> development in multiple ways, for instance, by affecting the expression of genes involved in larval development or immunity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), which will be an important research direction in the future to elucidate the biological function of DMNT.</p><p>In conclusion, we described the interplay between the natural metabolite DMNT, midgut microbiota, and insect host death. The ability of DMNT to affect the PM structure and kill insect pests requires the assistance of the microbiota from the insect midgut and may represent a general phenomenon in other organisms that explains how the intestinal microbiota is prevented from infecting their hosts.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td><italic>PEN1</italic></td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sohrabi et al., 2015</xref></td><td>At4g15340 (Tair)</td><td><italic>35Spro:PEN1-Nos</italic> construction</td></tr><tr><td><italic>Gene</italic> (<italic>Plutella xylostella</italic>)</td><td><italic>PxMucin</italic></td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sarauer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Israni and Rajam, 2017</xref></td><td>LOC105381635(NCBI)</td><td>qRT-PCR assay</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Enterococcus</italic> sp.)</td><td><italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> (<italic>E. f</italic>)</td><td>This paper</td><td>ATCC29212 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bncc.org.cn/">http://www.bncc.org.cn/</ext-link>)</td><td>Gram staining</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>T7 RiboMAX express RNAi synthesis kit</td><td>This paper</td><td>Promega, catalog number P1700</td><td>Double-stranded RNA synthesis</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Lipase activity</td><td>This paper</td><td>Jiancheng Company (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.njjcbio.com">http://www.njjcbio.com</ext-link>, catalog: A054-1-1)</td><td>Lipase enzyme activity assay</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Dye erioglaucine disodium salt</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amcheslavsky et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rera et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">He et al., 2017</xref></td><td>Sigma-Aldrich, cas: 3844-45-9, molecular weight: 792.85, color index number 42090</td><td>‘Smurf’ treatment</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Antibiotic cocktail</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rodgers et al., 2017</xref></td><td>Solarbio, P1410</td><td>Killing gut microbes</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>DMNT</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huang and Yang, 2007</xref></td><td/><td>Chemical synthesis of DMNT</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>SPSS</td><td valign="top">SPSS</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002865">SCR_002865</ext-link></td><td>statistical analyses</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Polydimethylsiloxane solid phase micro-extraction (SPME) fibers</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sohrabi et al., 2015</xref></td><td>100 μm, DVB/CAR/PDMS, Supelco, Inc, Bellefonte, PA</td><td>Collection of volatile compounds</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p><italic>A. thaliana</italic> Col-0 seeds were ordered from Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://arabidopsis.info">http://arabidopsis.info</ext-link>), and <italic>B. napus</italic> seeds were ordered from Wuhan Weimi Company.

Briefly, third-instar <italic>P. xylostella</italic> larvae were fed with forage containing DMNT for 48 hr. Forage was then replaced with fresh forage containing 0.3125 mg/mL dye, and larvae were allowed to feed for 1 hr before being given fresh forage with no added DMNT or dye. After 6 hr, the larvae were photographed under a stereomicroscope. Six biological replicates were prepared for the treatment and control, with 15 larvae per replicate. When the midguts are intact, the dye will pass through together with feces; if the midguts are damaged, the dye will penetrate into larval tissues and remain inside the body, thus turning larvae blue (hence the name of the assay).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Effects of intestinal microbiota on the PM of <italic>P. xylostella</italic> larvae</title><p>To prepare the gut microbes, we dissected the midgut from 45 <italic>P. xylostella</italic> larvae and transferred the tissues into 200 mL medium incubation at 37°C.

Eight independent biological replicates were performed, each comprising 15 <italic>P. xylostella</italic> larvae. Gut microbe DNA was extracted with E.Z.N.Z Stool DNA Kit (D4015, Omega, lnc.). The conserved regions of 16S ribosomal DNA were amplified by PCR, separated in 2% agarose gels, purified with AMPure XT beads (Beckman Coulter Genomics, Danvers, MA), and quantified by Qubit (Invitrogen). The amplicon pools were prepared for sequencing and the size and quantity of the amplicon library were assessed on Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent) and with the Library Quantification Kit for Illumina (Kapa Biosciences, Woburn, MA), respectively. The libraries were sequenced on NovaSeq PE250 platform.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Samples were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq platform according to the manufacturer's recommendations, provided by LC-Bio. Paired-end reads were assigned to samples based on their unique barcode and truncated by cutting off the barcode and primer sequence. Paired-end reads were merged using FLASH. Quality filtering on the raw reads was performed under specific filtering conditions to obtain the high-quality clean tags according to the fqtrim (v0.94). Chimeric sequences were filtered using Vsearch software (v2.3.4). After dereplication using DADA2, we obtained the feature table and feature sequence. Alpha diversity and beta diversity were calculated by normalizing to the same sequences randomly. Then according to SILVA (release 132) classifier, feature abundance was normalized using relative abundance of each sample. Alpha diversity is applied in analyzing the complexity of species diversity for a sample through five indices, including Chao1, Observed species, Goods coverage, Shannon, and Simpson, and all these indices in our samples were calculated with QIIME2. Beta diversity was calculated by QIIME2, and the graphs were drawn by R package. Blast was used for sequence alignment, and the feature sequences were annotated with SILVA database for each representative sequence. Other diagrams were implemented using the R package (v3.5.2).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Youngsung Joo as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Meredith Schuman as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper is of potential interest to broad audience of plant science and pest management. It provides evidence for a new role of plant volatile compounds which directly damages the insect gut system, dependent on the microbiome. All three reviewers agreed that this manuscript has the potential for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, but four major issues need to be solved before acceptance.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There are concerns about the ecological relevance of DMNT treatment:</p><p>a) Why did the authors use 7 μm DMNT throughout the experiment? The authors found little difference in effects across 3 orders of magnitude (0.7, 7, 70 uM, Figure 1—figure supplement 3). How does this dose compare to the estimated dose which larvae receive when feeding on plant tissue?</p><p>b) The authors already confirmed that the role of DMNT depends on native gut microbiota in Figure 5, so why have <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> has been selected to test the DMNT role in the gut microbiome? Why didn’t the authors use cultured bacteria from the insect gut? These issues should be addressed in the manuscript.</p><p>2) There is a significant concern on whether the gut bacteria in the caterpillars are required for the negative effects of DMNT as plant resistance. Particularly, reviewer #3 is concerned that bacteria-free (axenic) caterpillar cannot be replaced by antibiotic treatment. I have discussed with the reviewer and I think that antibiotic treatment is still sufficient to support the gut microbiota (antibiotics-sensitive)-dependent effects of DMNT. However, the external pathogen inoculation experiment in Figure 6 should be done using &quot;antibiotics-treated&quot; caterpillars to demonstrate that gut bacteria are required for DMNT-mediated negative effects on the larvae.</p><p>3) Besides, the effects of DMNT between Figure 5 and 6 significantly differ. It seems that DMNT effects are significantly dampened in Figure 6. This, even there is no difference in the survival of larvae between control and DMNT treatment at 60h and 84h. Is there any reason causing this difference? Maybe it is also caused by the batch effects among experiments. All X-axis of larval survival graph in Figure 5A, C and Figure 6C, E are different. It is necessary to address why the effects of DMNT largely differed throughout the manuscript (despite a consistent dose).</p><p>4) Lastly, the authors need to introduce and discuss their findings with other relevant literature.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>The defensive role of plant volatile has not been studied, so this is one of the main novelties of this study. So, it is necessary emphasize this point in the Introduction by citing previous studies like Maurya et al., 2020, Gasmi et al., 2019, etc. Also, it would be better to change the title to &quot;Volatile DMNT directly protects plants against <italic>Plutella xylostella</italic> by disrupting the peritrophic matrix barrier in insect midgut&quot;.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>The findings need to be discussed with other relevant literature. Several studies showed that plant volatiles are directly toxic to caterpillars or change caterpillar physiology. Here are some examples:</p><p>– Sugimoto et al., 2014;</p><p>– Veyrat et al., 2016;</p><p>– Ye et al., 2018.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63938.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There are concerns about the ecological relevance of DMNT treatment:</p><p>a) Why did the authors use 7 μm DMNT throughout the experiment?

We set up 3 dosages to test the influence of DMNT on the development of second instar <italic>P. xylostella</italic> larvae, 0.7 μM (65 ng/g), 7 μM (650 ng/g) and 70 μM (6.5 μg/g) respectively, which showed similar effect on larvar survival and pupation (Figure 1—figure supplement 3). Although the dosage 65 ng/g is close to the DMNT content in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> tissues, we selected a higher dosage for bioassays, as we thought that alive plants could continuously produce DMNT and the abundance in plants will be upregulated and accumulated upon larva attacks; but in contrast in bioassays, the DMNT injected in forage will become less and less because of volatilizing and being eaten by <italic>P. xylostella</italic> along with the process of experiments. Indeed, consistent with this prediction, when <italic>35Spro:PEN1</italic> transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> plants were infested by <italic>P. xylostella</italic> for 3 to 21 hours, DMNT content could rise from 10 to 68 ng/g. We have added the additional data in the Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, D. Please refer to the Results and Discussion sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The authors already confirmed that the role of DMNT depends on native gut microbiota in Figure 5, so why have Enterococcus faecalis and E. coli has been selected to test the DMNT role in the gut microbiome? Why didn’t the authors use cultured bacteria from the insect gut? These issues should be addressed in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for these comments to use the cultured bacteria from insect gut instead of <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> or <italic>E. coli</italic>, which will mimic the reality of gut environment much better. Using the method described by Wang et al. (Plant Pathogens, 2020, C-type lectin-mediated microbial homeostasis is critical for <italic>Helicoverpa armigera</italic> larval growth and development), we isolated and cultured the native microbes from gut for the treatment on <italic>P. xylostella</italic>, the results showed that the native microbes presented much stronger effect than <italic>E. coli</italic> or <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> alone, all larvae died at 120 h and no larvae pupated in the end. These new results have been added to the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There is a significant concern on whether the gut bacteria in the caterpillars are required for the negative effects of DMNT as plant resistance. Particularly, reviewer #3 is concerned that bacteria-free (axenic) caterpillar cannot be replaced by antibiotic treatment. I have discussed with the reviewer and I think that antibiotic treatment is still sufficient to support the gut microbiota (antibiotics-sensitive)-dependent effects of DMNT. However, the external pathogen inoculation experiment in Figure 6 should be done using &quot;antibiotics-treated&quot; caterpillars to demonstrate that gut bacteria are required for DMNT-mediated negative effects on the larvae.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with these comments and have performed new bioassays as suggested. Thank you very much.</p><p>To prepare second instar “antibiotics-treated” <italic>P. xylostella</italic> larvae, we firstly inoculated larval eggs on plastic paper and put it close to forage containing antibiotics to ensure the larvae could eat antibiotics immediately after hatching. As shown in the new figure 6—figure supplement 3, the gut microbiota from antibiotics-treated <italic>P. xylostella</italic> larvae at second instar stage was nearly killed by antibiotics.</p><p>We got consistent results as those using the <italic>P. xylostella</italic> larvae that had not been pre-treated with antibiotics shown in the last version. When using “antibiotics-treated” <italic>P. xylostella</italic> larvae for bioassays, addition of gut microbiota in forage showed slightly but significantly restraint on larva growth as expected, and DMNT+antibiotics treatment showed very little effect; whereas in contrast, the treatment of DMNT+gut microbes showed very strong influence, all the larvae died 120 hours after treatment, and no larvae pupated, suggesting gut microbiota is essential for the killing function of DMNT (Figure 6C, D).</p><p>The new bioassay method for the preparation of “antibiotics-treated larvae” has been added to the Materials and methods section and these new results have been added in the Results section. Please refer to the new Figure 6C, D, Figure 6—figure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Besides, the effects of DMNT between Figures 5 and 6 significantly differ. It seems that DMNT effects are significantly dampened in Figure 6. This, even there is no difference in the survival of larvae between control and DMNT treatment at 60h and 84h. Is there any reason causing this difference? Maybe it is also caused by the batch effects among experiments. All X-axis of larval survival graph in Figure 5A, C and Figure 6C, E are different. It is necessary to address why the effects of DMNT largely differed throughout the manuscript (despite a consistent dose).</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry we did not explain the bioassay method clearly. For Figure 5, DMNT was added to forage from the start to the end of the bioassays, whereas for Figure 6, to reveal the effect of bacterial on the larvae with damaged gut by DMNT, we used the forage containing DMNT to feed <italic>P. xylostella</italic> for only 48 h, then the forage was replaced with the forage with <italic>E. coli</italic> or <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, but without DMNT, so the overall treatment effect in Figure 6 is relatively less pronounced than that in Figure 5.</p><p>According to the reviewers’ comments, we have performed new experiments using the native bacterial from larval gut in Figure 6C, D. Please refer to the new Figure 6C, D and the Results section. Additionally, we corrected and used consistent time points, to ensure the X-axis between Figures 5 and 6 are the same. Please refer to the new Figures 5 and 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Lastly, the authors need to introduce and discuss their findings with other relevant literature.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much. We agree and have added more introduction and discussion as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Introduction</p><p>The defensive role of plant volatile has not been studied, so this is one of the main novelties of this study. So, it is necessary emphasize this point in the Introduction by citing previous studies like Maurya et al., 2020, Gasmi et al., 2019, etc. Also, it would be better to change the title to &quot;Volatile DMNT directly protects plants against Plutella xylostella by disrupting the peritrophic matrix barrier in insect midgut&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We agree and have added more content in the Introduction section to describe the function of plant volatile as direct toxins by describing and citing the researches from Maurya, Gasmi et al.</p><p>We appreciate and agree to use the new title as the reviewers recommended, which could summarize our findings better.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion</p><p>The findings need to be discussed with other relevant literature. Several studies showed that plant volatiles are directly toxic to caterpillars or change caterpillar physiology. Here are some examples:</p><p>– Sugimoto et al.. 2014;</p><p>– Veyrat et al., 2016;</p><p>– Ye et al., 2018.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for these valuable comments.
