from gametes are largely erased following fertilisation, prior to construction of the embryonic methylome. Exploiting a natural experiment of seasonal variation including changes in diet and nutritional status in rural Gambia, we analysed three datasets covering two independent child cohorts and identified 259 CpGs showing consistent associations between season of conception (SoC) and DNA methylation. SoC effects were most apparent in early infancy, with evidence of attenuation by mid-childhood. SoC-associated CpGs were enriched for metastable epialleles, parent-of-origin-specific methylation and germline differentially methylated regions, supporting a periconceptional environmental influence. Many SoC-associated CpGs overlapped enhancers or sites of active transcription in H1 embryonic stem cells and fetal tissues. Half were influenced but not determined by measured genetic variants that were independent of SoC. Environmental ‘hotspots’ providing a record of environmental influence at periconception constitute a valuable resource for investigating epigenetic mechanisms linking early exposures to lifelong health and disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>early embryo</kwd><kwd>conception</kwd><kwd>metastable epiallele</kwd><kwd>nutrition</kwd><kwd>parent-of-origin effects</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC-A760-5QX00</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Silver</surname><given-names>Matt J</given-names></name><name><surname>Prentice</surname><given-names>Andrew M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000865</institution-id><institution>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OPP1 066947</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moore</surname><given-names>Sophie E</given-names></name><name><surname>Routledge</surname><given-names>Michael N</given-names></name><name><surname>Herceg</surname><given-names>Zdenko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/N006208/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Silver</surname><given-names>Matt J</given-names></name><name><surname>Fall</surname><given-names>Caroline HD</given-names></name><name><surname>Prentice</surname><given-names>Andrew M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BT/IN/DBT-MRC/DFID/24/GRC/2015-16</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chandak</surname><given-names>Gririraj R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/M01424X/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Silver</surname><given-names>Matt J</given-names></name><name><surname>Saffari</surname><given-names>Ayden</given-names></name><name><surname>Kessler</surname><given-names>Noah J</given-names></name><name><surname>Prentice</surname><given-names>Andrew M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>259 CpGs associated with season of conception in rural Gambians constitute a valuable resource for investigating epigenetic mechanisms linking early exposures to lifelong health and disease.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>DNA methylation (DNAm) plays an important role in a diverse range of epigenetically regulated processes in mammals including cell differentiation, X-chromosome inactivation, genomic imprinting, and the silencing of transposable elements (TEs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Smith and Meissner, 2013</xref>). DNAm can influence gene expression and can in turn be influenced by molecular processes including differential action of methyltransferases and transcription factor (TF) binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jeltsch, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Feldmann et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The human methylome is extensively remodelled in the very early embryo when parental gametic methylation marks are largely erased before acquisition of lineage and tissue-specific marks at implantation, gastrulation, and beyond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Guo et al., 2014</xref>). The days following conception may therefore offer a window of heightened sensitivity to external environmental influences, potentially stretching back to the period before conception coinciding with late maturation of oocytes and spermatozoa at loci that (partially) evade early embryonic reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fleming et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The effects of early exposures on the mammalian methylome have been widely studied in animal models and periconceptional and early gestational factors including maternal folate and exposure to famine have been associated with DNAm changes in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gonseth et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tobi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Finer et al., 2016</xref>). However, causal pathways are difficult to elucidate in human observational studies, and even randomised experimental designs are prone to confounding due to reverse causation from exposure-related effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Birney et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Here, we address these limitations by exploiting a natural experiment in rural Gambia where conceptions occur against a background of repeating annual patterns of dry (‘harvest’) and rainy (‘hungry’) seasons with accompanying significant changes in energy balance, diet composition, nutrient status, and rates of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moore et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dominguez-Salas et al., 2013</xref>). We assess the influence of seasonality on DNAm in two Gambian child cohorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Moore et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chandak et al., 2017</xref>), one with longitudinal data, enabling robust identification of loci showing consistent effects at the ages of 2 years and in mid-childhood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Through prospective study designs we capture conceptions throughout the year and, in contrast to previous analyses in this population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Waterland et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dominguez-Salas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Silver et al., 2015</xref>), we use statistical models that make no prior assumptions about specific seasonal windows driving DNAm changes in offspring.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Study design.</title><p>DNAm: DNA methylation; EPIC: Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip; Epig.

These loci bear the hallmarks of metastable epialleles (MEs), loci with methylation states that vary between individuals that were first identified in isogenic mice. MEs exhibit stable patterns of SIV indicating stochastic establishment of methylation marks prior to gastrulation when tissue differentiation begins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rakyan et al., 2002</xref>), and several MEs have been shown to be sensitive to periconceptional nutrition in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 2012</xref>). These loci thus serve as useful tools for studying the effects of early environment on DNAm by enabling the use of accessible tissues (such as blood) that can serve as a proxy for systemic (cross-tissue) methylation, and by pinpointing the window of exposure to the periconceptional period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gunasekara and Waterland, 2019</xref>). We also investigate links with TEs and TFs associated with the establishment of methylation states in the early embryo, and assess the influence of genetic variation and gene-environment interactions. Finally, by comparing our results with public DNAm data obtained from sperm, oocytes, and multi-stage human embryos, we investigate links between SoC-associated loci, histone marks, gametic, and parent-of-origin-specific methylation (PofOm), and the establishment of DNAm states in early embryonic development.</p><p>Our identification of hotspots in the postnatal methylome that retain a record of environmental conditions during gametic maturation and/or in the very early embryo provides a valuable resource for the investigation of epigenetic mechanisms linking early-life nutritional and other exposures to lifelong health and disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of Gambian SoC-associated CpGs</title><p>Key characteristics of DNAm datasets from the two Gambian cohorts analysed in this study are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.

To account for the potential influence of season of collection effects, we therefore compared year-round DNAm signatures across ENID (2 yr) and EMPHASIS datasets by focussing on 391,814 autosomal CpGs (‘array background’) intersecting the Illumina HM450 and EPIC arrays used to measure DNAm in each dataset (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).

We next analysed SoC-CpGs and MEs and again found evidence for strong enrichment of oocyte, but not sperm gDMRs at these loci (6.2-fold oo-gDMR enrichment, p = 2.3 × 10<sup>–16</sup> at SoC-CpGs; 2.9-fold, p = 1.2 × 10<sup>–24</sup> at MEs), including after adjustment for CpG clustering (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1h</xref>). Of note, 14% (36/259) of SoC-CpGs overlapped oo-gDMRs, in strong contrast to matched and random controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). These clustered into 19 distinct oo-gDMR regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1i</xref>) – more than six times the number identified as exhibiting PofOm by Zink et al.

Based upon the EMPHASIS cohort PCA and our knowledge of village population structures, we reasoned that village of origin is a useful proxy for genetic ancestry in the ENID cohort and performed a sensitivity analysis with an additional covariate dichotomised according to whether an individual came from the predominantly Fula village.

Many cited studies including the majority of previous work in The Gambia used pyrosequencing and other methylation platforms targeting loci not covered by Illumina arrays.

Noteworthy amongst the most frequently reported associations with SoC-CpGs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1m</xref>) in the context of our study were those with sex, gestational age, maternal smoking in pregnancy, maternal plasma folate levels, and adult body mass index (BMI) with 109, 45, 16, 6, and 1 associated SoC-CpG(s), respectively.</p><p>We investigated some of these links using data from the 2 yr ENID cohort considered in our main analysis and confirmed multiple significant associations with infant sex but not gestational age or maternal folate at conception (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1n</xref>). Links with adult BMI and maternal smoking were not considered as adult BMI was not available and the incidence of smoking is extremely low in our study population.</p><p>All Fourier regression models in our main SoC analysis included sex as an adjustment covariate. The finding that multiple SoC-CpGs were associated with sex in the EWAS Catalog, with replication of this association in the ENID cohort, was therefore surprising. This prompted us to check for a residual confounding effect due to sex by repeating our analysis with methylation values pre-adjusted for sex using a regression model with sex as the only adjustment covariate, prior to running the full regression models. This produced near identical results to the main analysis without pre-adjustment. This, combined with our observation that sex is not associated with any tested batch or biological covariates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1p-r</xref>), strongly suggests that the observed SoC associations were not driven by confounding due to sex.</p><p>Finally we searched for SoC-CpGs within 1 kbp of SNP associations (p &lt; 1 × 10<sup>–5</sup>) in the GWAS Catalog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buniello et al., 2019</xref>), since DNAm could mediate GWAS signals in genomic regions where functional effects are difficult to elucidate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Do et al., 2017</xref>).

We analysed methylation data from two independent, different-aged cohorts and identified 259 ‘SoC-CpGs’ with evidence of sensitivity to SoC in infancy. We found evidence of SoC effect attenuation with age, but SoC-related temporal patterns were nonetheless strikingly similar, suggestive of a common effect of periconceptional environment. Importantly, the analysed datasets have contrasting confounding structures, notably with regard to the timing of sample collection, the latter eliminating potential confounding due to seasonal differences in leukocyte composition. These results, derived from analysis of Illumina array data with limited coverage, suggest there may be many more hotspots sensitive to the periconceptional environment across the human methylome.</p><p>This analysis builds on previous epigenetic studies in this setting that have focussed on single cohorts and analysed methylation differences between individuals conceived at the peaks of the Gambian dry and rainy seasons only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Waterland et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dominguez-Salas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Silver et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Van Baak et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kühnen et al., 2016</xref>). Increased methylation in offspring conceived at the peak of the Gambian rainy season is consistent with previous findings and this observation is now greatly strengthened by the application of Fourier regression to model year-round conceptions, an approach that makes no prior assumption of when methylation peaks and nadirs may occur. The number of identified SoC-CpGs is also substantially increased in this study. Comparisons with array background and control CpGs matching SoC-CpG methylation distributions increase confidence that these findings are not statistical artefacts.</p><p>Triangulation with other public data provides multiple lines of evidence supporting the notion that methylation states at these loci are established in the periconceptional period. First, they are highly enriched for putative MEs and related loci identified in other studies with characteristic methylation signatures suggestive of establishment early in embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kessler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Van Baak et al., 2018</xref>). Second, like MEs, season-associated loci exhibit unusual methylation dynamics in early stage embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kessler et al., 2018</xref>). Third, they have distinctive gametic methylation patterns, notably hypomethylation in sperm (in common with putative MEs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kessler et al., 2018</xref>), and differential gametic and PofOm in a subset. Increased incidence of hypomethylated states in sperm at SoC-CpGs may reflect their enrichment at CpG islands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Molaro et al., 2011</xref>), sequence features that are largely refractory to protamine exchange, with the possibility for retaining epigenetic function associated with histone modifications into the early embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hammoud et al., 2009</xref>). Fourth, many overlap H3K4me1 and H3K27me3 marks which coordinate transient gene expression and early lineage commitment in human ESCs, in part through demarking poised enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rada-Iglesias et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>A large majority of SoC-CpGs have not previously been identified as MEs, but given the supporting evidence described above, we speculate that many are likely to be so. Indeed, evidence of attenuation of SoC effects with age suggests that, to the extent that interindividual variation is driven by periconceptional environmental factors, screens for putative MEs (including ESS and SIV) in adult tissues used as a reference in this analysis may be missing metastable regions which are more pronounced earlier in the life course. Evidence of much larger SoC effect sizes at known MEs in both Gambian cohorts supports this. Furthermore, identification of putative human SIV-MEs requires analysis of datasets with tissues derived from different germ layers for each individual. Such datasets are expensive to acquire and rare, meaning that the few published ME screens are likely to be underpowered due to small sample sizes.</p><p>The observed attenuation of SoC effects with age has implications for detecting the effect of periconceptional exposures on DNAm in samples collected beyond the neonatal and early childhood periods, an important consideration for epigenetic epidemiological studies since non-persisting methylation differences could still have a significant impact on early developmental trajectories with lifelong consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vukic et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Simpkin et al., 2015</xref>). The methylome changes with age, a phenomenon sometimes referred to as ‘epigenetic drift’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Teschendorff et al., 2013</xref>). Attenuation of SoC effects could be a consequence of localised or global epigenetic drift or other processes such as clonal selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Teschendorff and Relton, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, more SoC-CpGs replicated in the smaller ENID (5–7 yr) dataset than in the older EMPHASIS (7–9 yr) cohort (n = 157 vs. 61, respectively). This could be due to age or other cohort-specific differences, or it might reflect differences in seasonality such as secular changes in the intensity and duration of the rainy season.</p><p>Intra-individual methylation states at SoC-associated loci are highly correlated across loci despite being distributed throughout the genome, suggesting that a common mechanism is at play. MEs located within intracisternal A particle (IAP) TEs have been the focus of many studies of SIV in mice, the <italic>Agouti</italic> viable yellow locus being a paradigm example. While one study found that methylation does not covary across different murine IAP MEs in the absence of environmental perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kazachenka et al., 2018</xref>), another recent study identified several IAP MEs located on different chromosomes which are modified by the same cluster of KRAB zinc finger proteins (KZFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertozzi et al., 2020</xref>), demonstrating that genetic mechanisms for the simultaneous epigenetic regulation of multiple loci do exist.</p><p>Potential insights into mechanisms linking periconceptional environment to DNAm changes in postnatal tissues come from our investigations of the methylation status and genomic context of SoC-CpGs.</p><p>First, we observed strong enrichment for gDMRs, with 14% of SoC-CpGs overlapping 19 gDMRs hypomethylated in sperm and hypermethylated in oocytes. A minority of these show evidence of PofOm persisting in postnatal tissues. This observation aligns with a growing body of evidence linking early environment, notably nutritional factors involved in one-carbon (C1) metabolism, with methylation at imprinted regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Monk et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">James et al., 2018b</xref>). Indeed we have previously noted an association between SoC and several C1 metabolites at a maternally imprinted region at the small non-coding RNA <italic>VTRNA2-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Silver et al., 2015</xref>), consistent with evidence of ‘polymorphic imprinting’ linked to prenatal environment at this locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zink et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carpenter et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, we previously found strong enrichment for proximal binding sites of several TFs associated with the maintenance of PofOm in the early embryo at MEs detected in a WGBS screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kessler et al., 2018</xref>). We were only able to replicate enrichment for one of these, ZFP57, at SoC-CpGs in this study. This may reflect the relatively small proportion of PofOm loci in the set of SoC-CpGs, or factors related to the limited methylome coverage of Illumina arrays. More targeted experimental work is required to determine the extent of SoC effects at imprinted loci, especially given our observation that SoC-CpGs are often proximal to ERV TEs that have recently been shown to drive the establishment of germline-derived maternal PofOm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bogutz et al., 2019</xref>). Hotspots with evidence of PofOm could be driven by an environmentally sensitive gain of methylation on the paternal allele that is propagated through development, incomplete reprogramming on the maternal allele leaving residual traces of methylated cytosines, or modest de novo methylation at some later point. A deeper understanding of mechanisms will require further investigation in cell and animal models.</p><p>Second, our observation of enrichment for proximity to ERV1 TEs at SoC-CpGs aligns with our previous finding at MEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Silver et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kessler et al., 2018</xref>), and is notable since most environment-sensitive mouse MEs are associated with IAPs (which are rodent-specific ERVs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kazachenka et al., 2018</xref>). KZFP-mediated repression of TEs including ERVs has also been proposed as a driver of the rapid evolution of gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cavalli and Heard, 2019</xref>). The KZFP ZFP57 is particularly interesting in this respect since its binding to DNA is linked both to repression of TEs and to the maintenance of genomic imprints in the pre-implantation embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Imbeault et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shi et al., 2019</xref>). We previously identified a putative SoC-associated DMR in the <italic>ZFP57</italic> promoter in blood from younger Gambian infants (mean age 3.6 months) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Silver et al., 2015</xref>). It is possible that non-replication of the SoC association at <italic>ZFP57</italic> in the older Gambian cohort (and of the <italic>VTRNA2-1</italic> SoC-DMR mentioned above which was also identified in younger infants) reflects the more general attenuation of SoC effects described above. Interestingly there is some evidence that the <italic>ZFP57</italic> DMR, which lies 3 kb upstream of the transcription start site, is established in the early embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Van Baak et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Monteagudo-Sánchez et al., 2020</xref>), and that DNAm at this locus measured in neonatal blood is associated with maternal folate levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gonseth et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amarasekera et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Irwin et al., 2019</xref>). Given the important function of ZFP57 in pre-implantation methylation dynamics, its potential role as an environmentally sensitive regulator of multi-locus DNAm effects remains an open question.</p><p>Third, DNAm at SoC-CpGs is enriched for intermediate methylation states. Intermediate methylation has also been observed at MEs in Gambians and in non-Africans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Finer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Waterland et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dominguez-Salas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kühnen et al., 2016</xref>), and this coincides with a similar observation at MEs in post-gastrulation embryonic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kessler et al., 2018</xref>). Intermediate methylation appears to be predominantly driven by variegated (intercellular) differences in methylation status within a sampled tissue, rather than by allele-specific methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Elliott et al., 2015</xref>). Observed differences in aggregate methylation at SoC-CpGs could thus reflect a direct influence of periconceptional environment on the establishment and maintenance of DNAm states in the early embryo at the cellular level, or ‘epigenetic selection’ whereby epigenetically distinct cells form a substrate for clonal selection during development, for example, as a potential adaptation to differential metabolic exposures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tobi et al., 2018</xref>). Stronger enrichment for putative MEs exhibiting SIV compared to those identified through ESS supports establishment in the post-implantation embryo, since methylation differences at ESS loci are presumed to originate in the pre-implantation embryo prior to embryo cleavage in MZ twins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Van Baak et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The largest SoC-CpG cluster with 7 CpGs is on chromosome 15 and falls within the second intron of <italic>IGF1R</italic>. This bears the hallmarks of being a promoter or active/poised enhancer in multiple cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig14">Appendix 1—figure 14</xref>). Six CpGs in the <italic>IGF1R</italic> cluster have evidence of PofOm and show a relatively large SoC effect size (median SoC methylation amplitude) of 6.1%. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zink et al., 2018</xref>, were unable to demonstrate PofO allele-specific expression in this region although others have found evidence of maternal imprinting of an intronic lncRNA at this gene in cancerous cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sun et al., 2014</xref>). Loss of IGF1 receptors gives rise to a major decrease in expression at multiple imprinted genes in mice, suggesting a pathway by which <italic>IGF1R</italic> might regulate growth and metabolism during early development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boucher et al., 2014</xref>).

Another SoC-CpG with evidence of PofOm, also on chromosome 15, falls within the known Prader-Willi syndrome-associated paternally expressed imprinted region.</p><p>Our observation that 109 out of 259 SoC-CpGs have been associated with sex in previous studies is intriguing. Given the relatively small number (compared to array size) of autosomal sex-linked loci identified in large studies on the Illumina 450k array (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Singmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shah et al., 2014</xref>), this represents a very strong enrichment. We replicated a significant sex association at these loci in the ENID cohort analysed in this study. Our regression analyses were adjusted for sex, and additional sensitivity analyses with DNAm pre-adjusted for sex strongly suggest that our main findings are not confounded by sex. Interestingly, sex-associated loci are enriched at imprinted regions and sex discordance at autosomal CpGs has been linked to androgen exposures in utero (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Singmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Suderman et al., 2017</xref>). There is also evidence of sex differences in methylation at <italic>DNMT3A/B</italic> and <italic>TET1</italic> genes involved in de novo methylation and de-methylation pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Singmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Suderman et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting a possible interaction between sex-linked epigenetic changes and periconceptional environment during reprogramming in the early embryo. A deeper understanding of potential mechanisms underpinning the observed enrichment of sex effects at loci associated with periconceptional environment requires further functional analysis in cell and/or animal models.</p><p>DNAm is influenced by genotype and the latter is therefore a potential confounder when studying the effects of environmental exposures in human populations. A strength of our quasi-randomised Gambian seasonal model is that it minimises the potential for genetic confounding of modelled seasonal DNAm patterns, on the assumption that the timing of conceptions is not linked to genetic variants influencing DNAm. However, it is still possible that such variants might confound our observations, for example, if they promote embryo survival under conditions of environmental stress. We tested this possibility using genetic data available for the EMPHASIS cohort and found no evidence of SoC-associated genetic variants driving interindividual methylation differences at SoC-associated loci in <italic>cis</italic> or <italic>trans</italic>.</p><p>However, we did find that half of SoC-CpGs had at least one associated mQTL, indicating the presence of independent additive effects of environment and genetics at these loci, as has been suggested previously at other loci sensitive to pre/periconceptional nutritional exposures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tobi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Saffari et al., 2020</xref>). We have previously argued that the definition of MEs should be extended to include genomic regions whose DNAm state is under partial but non-deterministic genetic influence in genetically heterogeneous human populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kessler et al., 2018</xref>), and we would argue that the above observations at SoC-CpGs that exhibit many of the characteristics of MEs support this. Further analysis in larger datasets with genome sequencing data combined with functional analysis using cell models will be required to fully understand the relative contributions of environment and genetics to DNAm variation at regions of the type highlighted in this study.</p><p>Further work is required to investigate the functional relevance of DNAm changes at SoC-CpGs, some of which are relatively small (around 4% SoC amplitude). However, we can speculate that observed methylation changes, which may reflect changes in the chromatin landscape, have the potential to influence gene expression and early development, since our chromatin state analysis predicts that many overlap regions with functional significance in H1 ESCs and fetal tissues. A similarly modest DNAm change at a locus in the <italic>POMC</italic> gene that is associated with SoC in blood has been linked to obesity risk in German children and adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kühnen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kuehnen et al., 2012</xref>), and to differential TF binding and differences in <italic>POMC</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kuehnen et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, blood DNAm at a putative ME within the <italic>PAX8</italic> gene has been linked to SoC in Gambian infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dominguez-Salas et al., 2014</xref>) and is associated with thyroid volume and function in Gambian children, and with certain maternal nutrition biomarkers at conception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Candler et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>PAX8</italic> DNAm is also associated with expression of the anti-sense gene <italic>PAX8-AS1</italic> (alternatively known as <italic>LOC654433</italic>) in thyroid tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Candler et al., 2021</xref>). No loci from either study overlap array background in this study. More generally, DNAm at SIV loci associated with periconceptional environment has been associated with a number of diseases including Alzheimer’s, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gunasekara and Waterland, 2019</xref>).</p><p>We have previously shown that several metabolites involved in C1 methylation pathways show significant seasonal variation in maternal blood plasma in this population which is largely dependent on subsistence farming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dominguez-Salas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dominguez-Salas et al., 2014</xref>). While we suspect that seasonal differences in nutrition are likely drivers of the effects that we have observed, analysis of the links between maternal nutritional biomarkers and DNAm is challenging due to the complex interdependence of C1 metabolites acting as substrates and cofactors within C1 pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">James et al., 2018a</xref>). Furthermore, it is possible that DNAm differences are linked to other aspects of Gambian seasonality, such as variation in pesticide use or infectious disease burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moore et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hernandez-Vargas et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Measured DNAm values at SoC-CpGs and matched controls have previously been reported to be reliable, in strong contrast to the majority of probes overlapping the 450k and EPIC arrays that have been found to have low test-retest reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sugden et al., 2020</xref>). This likely reflects increased interindividual variability and/or intermediate DNAm at SoC-CpGs and controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Logue et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Xu and Taylor, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Limitations of this analysis include a lack of genetic data for the ENID cohort, so that our genetic analyses are restricted to the older EMPHASIS cohort where SoC effects are smaller. Furthermore, comparator data on MEs and gamete, embryo and PofO methylation are derived from non-African individuals so we cannot assess the influence of ethnicity on these analyses. We also note that there is some inter-relatedness in this study population which practices polygamy. However, of the 199 individuals with available data on paternal identity in the ENID cohort, 2% have a shared father suggesting that this is unlikely to influence the main findings.</p><p>There is increasing interest in the phenomenon of methylation variability as a marker of disease and of prenatal adversity, and in genetic variation as a potential driver of methylation variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ek et al., 2018</xref>). This raises the possibility that certain genetic variants could have been selected through their ability to enable graded, environmentally responsive methylation patterns at MEs and SoC-associated loci that are able to sense the periconceptional environment, record the information, and adapt the phenotype accordingly. Our gene-environment interaction analysis likely lacked power to detect gene-environment (SoC) interactions, so that it was not possible to investigate the relative contributions of stochastic, environmental, and genetically mediated variance effects on the establishment of periconceptional SoC-associated methylation states in this study. Nonetheless, the proposition that environmentally sensitive epigenetic signals are selected through their ability to direct phenotypic development to better fit the anticipated future environment, leading to maladaptation and future disease if the environment changes, is intriguing and worthy of further investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fleming et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Gambian cohorts and sample processing</title><p>Detailed descriptions of the Gambian cohorts analysed in this study are published elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Moore et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chandak et al., 2017</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Toby Mansell (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Below are first the most important points coming from the discussion between the reviewers, followed by additional points coming from the individual review reports.</p><p>1) The reviewers are worried that there is residual confounding impacting the analyses and that the authors only observe increases in DNA methylation. Regressing out sex is not sufficient to show there is no bias in the analyses. We therefore request a correlation matrix (containing rho's, not p-values) containing all batch effects, arrray covariates (e.g. sentrix row and column), biological covariates (e.g. sex), PCAs before and after functional normalisation, and study covariates (e.g. village, month of collection, month of birth, month of conception). This matrix should show if there is residual confounding remaining that should be taken into account in the analyses.</p><p>2) The authors should make clear why some decisions were made regarding certain methods (i.e. adjustment using PCA instead of Houseman estimates) and thresholds (i.e. SoC-associated CpGs with difference &lt;4%). More on this in point 14 and 15.</p><p>3) The Discussion section should be rewritten to better reflect the relevance of the findings and the limitations of the study. For example, the actual number of unique seasonal MEs is modest and the discussion should reflect this. Moreover, the findings should be compared with previously published studies on, e.g., folic acid supplementation and famine (this last point also applies to the Introduction). More on this in point 12 and 13.</p><p>Additional points from individual review reports:</p><p>Results section:</p><p>4) Page 3, line 94: Have the authors access to longitudinal intra-individual methylation scores during different seasonal windows?</p><p>5) Page 4, line 141: Did the authors re-evaluate SoC CpG positions with alternative methods (e.g. pyrosequencing) to analyse larger groups/ cluster of CpG positions and to control the reliability of array data?</p><p>6) Line 238 onward: from 257 Soc-CpGs to the &quot;full&quot; set of 768 SoC-CpGs for enrichment tests out of &quot;power&quot; reasons ◊ not consistent and confusing. I would stick with your choice for the 257.</p><p>7) Page 7, line 301: The authors mentioned overlaps with previous studies. It would be helpful, if overlapping or related findings could be summarized (and maybe visualized) in more detail. This would facilitate the comparison of the current data set with previous publications.</p><p>8) I would strongly recommend reporting the relationship between methylation of these SoC sites and measures of growth or development in these two cohorts – it's not clear to me why this has not been done so, assuming such data is available under approved ethics. In the field there is an ever-growing body of papers linking various early development exposures to differences in methylation in childhood, but there is a dearth of reproduceable evidence for exposures associating with methylation differences that in turn associate with tangible differences in child health/development. Particularly since the manuscript already mentions things like the relationship between methylation and BMI – while adult BMI is different to child measures of body composition, any evidence for a relationship (or a lack of a relationship) with available phenotypes in these two child cohorts would be a logical conclusion that section of analysis and would provide much greater clarity for the relevant Discussion section.</p><p>9) Relatedly, if consistent with approved ethics, this paper would benefit from a table summarising the cohort characteristics for each cohort. If appropriate, stratifying the cohorts summaries by season of conception would also be of interest.</p><p>10) Rationale for not doing a meta-analysis for power reasons should be explained.</p><p>11) The Results section switches from past to present tense and back again. Please keep it to past tense.</p><p>Discussion section</p><p>12) From my point of view, the observation of an attenuation of DNA methylation levels until mid-childhood is of interest. It would be helpful, if the authors could discuss this point in more detail within the Discussion section. What is known about methylation changes during aging (epigenetic drift etc.) and are these observations relevant for SoC associated CpGs?</p><p>13) The authors might discuss in more detail, why these observations of SoC associated loci are disease relevant.</p><p>Methods section</p><p>14) As mentioned in the public review, I think there needs to be more clarity about why you do and do not use the SoC-associated CpGs with difference &lt;4% – in the results it is stated that the full list is being used to 'maximise power', but it is unclear why maximising power is necessary/better for that analysis compared to the other analyses where only CpGs with difference &gt;4% are used? A little more detail on why it is important/fine to use there would be helpful.</p><p>15) Another point that would benefit from additional clarity would be adjusting for cell composition differences in your models – it appears that you have adjusted for these by including the top 6 PCs, but you also have cell count estimates from the Houseman method. Was there are a particular reason for using the PCs when the Houseman estimates were available?</p><p>16) Methods does not read as one coherent story, but fragmented and will require some shuffling to make it easier to read.</p><p>17) Outlier removal is with 25th and 75th percentile very aggressive compared to what is standard in the field.</p><p>18) You can Check SNPs in 450k dataset for possibility to adjust for genetic background in the discovery cohort and 850k cohort to exclude sample swaps/mixtures etc.</p><p>19) Reading the methods you are worried by genome-wide effects on DNAm.

Your revised article has been evaluated by Jessica Tyler (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below. Two of the three original reviewers were happy with the way you addressed their comments, but since the other reviewer was no longer available, I have asked an additional reviewer to specifically take a look at the applied adjustment for batch effects (which was one of the main points brought up by this original reviewer). As you can see below, the new reviewer was in general happy with the rebuttal, but brought up some additional points that need to be addressed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Thank you for the opportunity to review the rebuttal to the article titled &quot;Environmentally sensitive hotspots in the methylome of the early human embryo&quot;. I would like to say that reading through the rebuttal it appears the authors have been reactive and enthusiastic in their responses to the reviewers. Overall, it appears the changes introduced have help interpretation of the findings as far as I can tell.</p><p>In terms of the concerns reviewers have regarding batch effects, on the whole it appears that these have been these addressed as far as is possible within the confines of this particular experiment. The sensitivity analyses reported in table 1s suggest that controlling for the suspected technical confounders (e.g plate, slide, cell proportion estimates) does not significantly attenuate the association between SoC-CpG and doc. As noted, there does appear to be non-randomization with respect to Plate (and by extension, Slide) in the youngest ENID sample, which I suspect is due to assignment of samples to plates as they were collected (i.e in chronological order). What I cannot tell is whether the methylation arrays are also processed as samples are received (i.e. once a plate is filled), or all together at the end of the collection phase. If it is the former, that is a likely source of some variation between plates. Given the use of this cohort as the discovery sample, it would be useful if the authors could declare whether or not this is the case in the methods.</p><p>I am however suspicious that there is an alternative confounding factor that could have implications for the interpretation of the results within the paper, and that is the notion of DNA methylation data reliability (or lack of). Multiple studies (e.g. Logue et al. (2017); Epigenomics 9(11):1363-1371; Sugden et al. Patterns 1(2): 100014) have demonstrated that a large proportion of the CpG sites shared between the 450K and EPIC array (as used in this paper) are unreliable, so that it is unlikely they yield the same value when the same sample is measured twice. This of course has implications for determining 'significant associations', for assessing DNA methylation changes over time, and for replication. Because of what we know about reliability and how it manifests, the authors should address reliability in the context of these findings.</p><p>Reassuringly for this paper, the SoC-CpGs appear to be pretty robust – cross-referencing the subset of 259 CpGs against the list of reliabilities from Sugden et al., shows the mean ICC is over.7 (close to 'excellent') – this is not the case for the 509 CpGs not taken forward, who have a mean reliability of less than 0.3 ('poor'). The list of CpGs selected as matched and array background controls does not appear available, but I strongly suspect the array background CpGs (at the very least) will have a much lower reliability than the SoC-CpGs (just due to random chance). This clouds the interpretation of any tests that compare these sets of CpGs and should be taken into consideration.</p><p>Further, differential reliability should be considered as an alternative explanation for the reduction in mean SoC amplitudes over time – could it be that measurements made using 450K arrays (ENID 2yr) are different to those using EPIC arrays for reasons beyond age-specific effects (i.e. measurement error)?</p><p>Finally, the description of the properties of SoC-CpGs (lines 173 onwards) notes that they are more likely to be intermediately methylated – this is again a property of reliable CpGs since arrays do not have the resolution to measure hyper- and hypo- methylated sites very well, leading to unreliable measurements. In all, these points suggest that reliability of DNA methylation is important for interpretation of these results, and, given the high reliability of the SoC-CpGs, is actually a positive feature.</p><p>The reviewers were concerned that a large proportion of the discussion was dedicated to MEs and how these findings are related. I believe the authors frame this appropriately, and do not find the references to them excessive. MEs are of great interest, and using cheaper and easier methods to uncover them (such as here) will be beneficial.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72031.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Below are first the most important points coming from the discussion between the reviewers, followed by additional points coming from the individual review reports.</p><p>(1) The reviewers are worried that there is residual confounding impacting the analyses and that the authors only observe increases in DNA methylation.

This matrix should show if there is residual confounding remaining that should be taken into account in the analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>We have carried out additional analyses to check for potential residual confounding (see new Supplementary Tables ST1p-1r), including an additional longitudinal analysis with recently acquired methylation data measured on the EPIC array on a subset of individuals from the ENID cohort at age 5-7yr.</p><p>Please note that the majority of batch and biological covariates are categorical so that it was not possible to report correlation rho’s. We have instead reported p-values for corresponding association tests – see Supplementary Tables for further details of tests that were carried out. Also note that for simplicity season of conception is modelled as a binary variable (Dry: Jan-Jun; Rainy: July-Dec). We consider this to be a valid approximation to the main cosinor (Fourier) regression analysis since this showed a clear relationship between DNAm and dichotomised (Dry/Rainy) season of conception (Figures2D and 4A). Note that we have not included month of collection as this completely confounds season of conception in the main ENID (2yr) analysis and cannot confound the EMPHASIS (7-9yr) analysis, as discussed in the manuscript (lines 88-91, Figure 2A). This is a key reason why we compared SoC effects across these two cohorts. Note that the month of collection also cannot confound the ENID 5-7yr (longitudinal) analysis as all samples are collected in the rainy season (additional Supp. Figure 2).</p><p>The covariate correlation analysis confirms:</p><p>– No correlation between SoC and all considered batch and biological covariates including principal components across all three analysed datasets (Supp Table, ST1p-1r).</p><p>– No correlation between sex and all considered batch and biological covariates; weak correlations with PC4 and PC3 in EMPHASIS and ENID 5-7yr datasets respectively (ST1q,1r). Please also note also that the sex sensitivity analysis previously reported in the manuscript used methylation values that were <italic>pre-adjusted</italic> for sex using a regression model that included sex as the only adjustment covariate, alleviating concerns that there may be residual confounding due to strong correlations between technical/biological/sampling covariates and sex. We have added some additional comments on this to Results (lines 335-341).</p><p>– Expected strong correlations between SoC, month of conception and month of birth in all datasets (ST1p-1r).</p><p>– Functional Normalisation (FN) removed most but not all of the effects of technical batch effects (sample plate, slide etc) from the DNAm array data used in the main ENID analysis (ST1p and Supp Table for Reviewers STR1).</p><p>– Samples are not perfectly randomised across 450k sample plate (month of birth [mob] and conception [moc]) and slide (mob and village) for the ENID 2yr cohort (ST1p).</p><p>The last point raises the possibility of potential residual confounding due to array batch effects in the ENID analysis. We checked for this in two ways. First, we performed sensitivity analyses with batch and village ID variables included directly in the linear regression models, in addition to the PCs that served as proxies for batch variables in our original analysis. This suggested no residual confounding due to array batch or village ID effects (ST1s: ‘batch adjusted model’ and ‘village adjusted model’). Second, we confirmed that neither mob, moc nor village ID were associated with batch or any other covariates in the EMPHASIS or new ENID 5-7yr analyses (ST1q, ST1r). The tight correspondence of date of methylation maximum across all three datasets (cross-cohort and longitudinal analyses) (Figures 2C, 3A and 4A) with different confounding structures (ST1p-1r) strongly suggests that the reported SoC associations are not driven by residual confounding.</p><p>In summary, this analysis provides strong reassurance that our main analysis is not confounded by residual associations with technical and/or biological covariates considered in this analysis, and that the observed enrichment for previously identified sex-associations amongst SoC-CpGs is not driven by residual confounding due to sex.</p><p>We have made multiple amendments to the manuscript to incorporate the longitudinal analysis; in the Introduction (lines 58-9); in the first section of Results (lines 87-156); and we have made particular reference to the alignment of SoC effects across 3 datasets with different confounding structures in lines 152-156. We have also amended several figure captions to distinguish the ENID 2yr and 5-7yr datasets and added the longitudinal dataset to Methods (lines 558-560) and to the study design schematic (revised Figure 1), and visualised key results from this additional analysis in Figures 3 and 4A. Finally we have added additional text on the sensitivity analyses in the main text (lines 131-133) and in Methods (lines 629-635).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors should make clear why some decision were made regarding certain methods (i.e. adjustment using PCA instead of Houseman estimates) and thresholds (i.e. SoC-associated CpGs with difference &lt;4%).

As outlined in our response to the previous comment we have added a brief note on this and the other sensitivity analyses (batch, cell composition and village effects) in Results to the manuscript (lines 131-133), with more details in Methods (lines 629-635).</p><p>Regarding our use of different SoC amplitude thresholds for one analysis, our original motivation for analysing all 768 ‘SoC-associated CpGs’ with FDR&lt;5% in the ENID 2yr analysis, including those with amplitude &lt; 4%, was to explore the degree to which the strength / amplitude of SoC effects could be explained by proximity to ERV1 over the wider range of amplitudes represented by the larger set of loci. However we agree that this approach is open to question and have removed this analysis (previous Figure 6B and Supp. Figure 11, and text in section headed ‘Enrichment of transposable elements and transcription factors associated with genomic imprinting’). We have also removed the definition of ‘SoC-associated CpGs’ (which included CpGs with SoC amplitude &lt; 4%) from Table 2 and Methods to aid clarity and avoid confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The Discussion section should be rewritten to better reflect the relevance of the findings and the limitations of the study. For example, the actual number of unique seasonal MEs is modest and the discussion should reflect this.</p></disp-quote><p>This reviewer (see additional comments in the public evaluation summary) acknowledges that the fold-enrichment for previously identified MEs is large, but they are concerned that MEs are the main focus of the Results and Discussion and are left wondering what could have been found in the large majority (approx. 90%) of SoC-CpGs that do not overlap known MEs.</p><p>Our strategy throughout the Results and Discussion was to focus on characteristics including metastability, parent of origin-specific methylation, histone modifications and gametic and early embryo methylation patterns that suggest a link to establishment of methylation states in the early embryo at SoC-CpGs. For these analyses <italic>all</italic> SoC-CpGs were considered at every stage and metastability was not the primary focus. However, we do repeatedly point out that many of the contextual genomic features associated with SoC-CpGs have also been associated with metastability which we consider to be worthy of note, in part because it suggests that many SoC-CpGs may in fact be MEs, despite not having been previously identified as such. We have further cause to believe this could be the case because of (i) the typically small sample size of multi-germ layer/multi-tissue datasets used in previous screens for MEs, meaning that published screens for human MEs are underpowered and will hence fail to capture most MEs; and (ii) the evidence that we present suggesting that environmentally-driven inter-individual variation at loci exhibiting ME-like properties may diminish with age, again suggesting that ME screens, which tend to analyse adult tissues, will miss metastable loci present in infancy and early childhood.</p><p>We had already made the point (ii) above in the Discussion (lines 383-389. However, given the reviewer’s concerns we have added an additional comment on point (i)) (lines 389-392).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, the findings should be compared with previously published studies on, e.g., folic acid supplementation and famine (this last point also applies to the Introduction).

For ease of reference we have included an additional table summarising overlaps with loci highlighted in the James et al. review (ST1k). We have also added an explicit reference to the fact that folate supplementation was considered in this comparison to the main text (line 310) and have also cited existing evidence on links to periconceptional folate and famine in the Introduction (lines 50-51).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional points from individual review reports:</p><p>Results section:</p><p>(4) Page 3, line 94: Have the authors access to longitudinal intra-individual methylation scores during different seasonal windows?</p></disp-quote><p>As outlined above, we are pleased to report that we have now generated additional EPIC array data covering a subset of n=138 individuals from the ENID cohort included in the main analysis.

In the field there is an ever-growing body of papers linking various early development exposures to differences in methylation in childhood, but there is a dearth of reproduceable evidence for exposures associating with methylation differences that in turn associate with tangible differences in child health/development. Particularly since the manuscript already mentions things like the relationship between methylation and BMI – while adult BMI is different to child measures of body composition, any evidence for a relationship (or a lack of a relationship) with available phenotypes in these two child cohorts would be a logical conclusion that section of analysis and would provide much greater clarity for the relevant Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>We are currently researching links between several SoC-CpGs and health-related outcomes including measures of growth, and we have prepared/submitted other papers with different groups of authors (e.g. the EMPHASIS team) relating to other phenotypes. We consider a detailed analysis of links between SoC-CpGs and diverse outcome measures in Gambian children to be beyond the scope of the current study and would argue that such an analysis would dilute the central focus of this paper that is already long and complex. In the current paper we do already refer to two existing studies linking Gambian SoC or nutrition-associated CpGs to health outcomes in non-Gambians (child and adult obesity/POMC, Kuhnen et al. Cell Metab 2016; cancer/VTRNA2-1, Silver et al., Gen Biol 2015) in the current manuscript (lines 513-515 and 419-422). The VTRNA2-1 locus does not overlap any SoC-CpGs and we already speculate that this may be due to SoC effect attenuation, since the previous association was observed in younger (3-9mth) infants (lines 443-445). We have additionally referenced a recently published paper linking another SoC-associated locus to thyroid volume and function in Gambian children (Candler et al. Sci Adv 2021; lines 515-522) and highlighted that neither this nor the <italic>POMC</italic> locus overlap the array background analysed in this study. Finally we have already included an analysis of overlaps between SoC-CpGs and traits in published EWAS and GWAS catalogues (lines 320-347).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Relatedly, if consistent with approved ethics, this paper would benefit from a table summarising the cohort characteristics for each cohort.

However we believe such an analysis is highly unlikely to alter the main findings. In particular we note (a) the strong evidence that major genetic PCA clusters are driven by ethnicity (Mandinka vs Fula; Supp. Figure 12), with village serving as a strong proxy for this; and (b) the strong concordance of SoC effects between ENID 2yr and EMPHASIS 7-9yr cohorts in the sensitivity analysis where we adjust for genetic background in the EMPHASIS cohort, and for village as a proxy for ethnicity in the ENID 2yr cohort (main text lines 293-307; Methods lines 782-789; Supp. Figure 13; sensitivity analysis described in ST1s). Finally, again given the strong concordance of SoC effects between the two cohorts described above, we think it highly improbable that sample swaps or mixtures revealed by an analysis of methylation-imputed genotypes in the EMPHASIS cohort would materially alter our main findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(19) Reading the methods you are worried by genome-wide effects on DNAm.

We have now analysed potential SoC effects on global methylation at LINE1 and Alu elements using the suggested method published by Zheng et al. This confirmed a small but significant effect of increased methylation in rainy vs dry conceptions at both LINE1 and Alu elements (0.02% and 0.01% respectively, both Wilcoxon p&lt;2.2x10<sup>-16</sup>) suggesting a SoC effect on global methylation levels. This contrasts with a significant but extremely small effect in the opposite direction across array background (-5x10<sup>-4</sup>%; p&lt;2.2x10<sup>-16</sup>). This supports evidence of a similar effect of peri/pre-conceptional folate (a one-carbon metabolite that varies significantly by season in our population; Dominguez-Salas et al.

Regarding family relationships, there is indeed a relatively high frequency of half-sibs in our study population. We were unable to test this directly in the discovery (ENID 2yr) cohort as genetic data were not available. However, of the 199 ENID children with paternal ID data we identified 2 pairs of half-sibs each with a common father, corresponding to 2% of participants. This number is too small to influence our findings. We have added a note on this in the Discussion (lines 534-537).</p><p>Finally, please note that the age range of the EMPHASIS cohort was previously incorrectly written as 8-9yrs throughout the manuscript.

I would like to say that reading through the rebuttal it appears the authors have been reactive and enthusiastic in their responses to the reviewers. Overall, it appears the changes introduced have help interpretation of the findings as far as I can tell.</p><p>In terms of the concerns reviewers have regarding batch effects, on the whole it appears that these have been these addressed as far as is possible within the confines of this particular experiment. The sensitivity analyses reported in table 1s suggest that controlling for the suspected technical confounders (e.g plate, slide, cell proportion estimates) does not significantly attenuate the association between SoC-CpG and doc.</p><p>As noted, there does appear to be non-randomization with respect to Plate (and by extension, Slide) in the youngest ENID sample, which I suspect is due to assignment of samples to plates as they were collected (i.e in chronological order). What I cannot tell is whether the methylation arrays are also processed as samples are received (i.e. once a plate is filled), or all together at the end of the collection phase. If it is the former, that is a likely source of some variation between plates. Given the use of this cohort as the discovery sample, it would be useful if the authors could declare whether or not this is the case in the methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We can confirm that the samples were processed in two batches. Samples were not processed sequentially by date of collection and each processing batch covered conception dates throughout the year. We have added this information to Methods (lines 578-80):</p><p>“Samples from the ENID 2yr dataset were processed in two batches with each batch covering conception dates throughout the year. Samples from the ENID (5-7yr) and EMHASIS (7-9yr) datasets were processed in single batches.”</p><p>As the reviewer notes we previously took additional steps to check for the possibility of residual confounding due to batch/technical effects including carrying out sensitivity analyses with batch effects included directly in the model. We have additionally checked and confirmed that adding processing batch to these models had no significant effect on estimated Fourier regression coefficients in the main SoC association analysis.</p><p>Importantly, as previously noted we also observed a tight correspondence of date of methylation maximum across all three datasets considered (Figures 2C, 3A and 4A). Two of these datasets (longitudinal ENID dataset with DNAm measured at 5-7yrs and EMPHASIS dataset measured at 7-9yrs) had very different confounding structures with no associations between date of conception / birth / collection and batch/technical variables.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I am however suspicious that there is an alternative confounding factor that could have implications for the interpretation of the results within the paper, and that is the notion of DNA methylation data reliability (or lack of). Multiple studies (e.g. Logue et al. (2017); Epigenomics 9(11):1363-1371; Sugden et al. Patterns 1(2): 100014) have demonstrated that a large proportion of the CpG sites shared between the 450K and EPIC array (as used in this paper) are unreliable, so that it is unlikely they yield the same value when the same sample is measured twice. This of course has implications for determining 'significant associations', for assessing DNA methylation changes over time, and for replication. Because of what we know about reliability and how it manifests, the authors should address reliability in the context of these findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that probe reliability is an important consideration, although we note that this is likely to increase the number of false negatives, since low reliability probes would be unlikely to be picked up in our discovery analysis, and methylation maxima would be unlikely to align across datasets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reassuringly for this paper, the SoC-CpGs appear to be pretty robust – cross-referencing the subset of 259 CpGs against the list of reliabilities from Sugden et al., shows the mean ICC is over.7 (close to 'excellent') – this is not the case for the 509 CpGs not taken forward, who have a mean reliability of less than 0.3 ('poor'). The list of CpGs selected as matched and array background controls does not appear available, but I strongly suspect the array background CpGs (at the very least) will have a much lower reliability than the SoC-CpGs (just due to random chance). This clouds the interpretation of any tests that compare these sets of CpGs and should be taken into consideration.</p></disp-quote><p>We confirm that the probe reliability as measured by Sugden et al. is ‘excellent’ for SoC-CpGs (median ICC = 0.76). The same measure for distribution-matched control CpGs is 0.68 (‘good’), providing reassurance that analysed DNAm values for both sets of probes are reliable. This aligns with observations by Xu and Taylor (Epigenetics, 2021 May;16(5):495-502) that low ICC scores are associated with sites with low variability.</p><p>We agree that array background and random control probes will have much lower reliability, as assessed by Sugden et al. In almost all cases for the present study, analyses that include random controls or array background also included a comparison with matched controls. In these cases we think it is still useful to include random controls and/or array background as it gives the reader useful information on how our analyses relate to properties of the 450k array. To take two examples, it is instructive to see 450k DNAm distributions in the embryonic inner cell mass and embryonic liver (Figure 4A); and also to see how 450k probes are distributed with respect to ERVs and ZFP57 binding sites (Figure 6A). There is one example where SoC-CpGs are compared with array background only (Figure 4D). Again we think the comparison is justified as it highlights array-wide associations between sperm and oocyte hypo/hyper methylation and hypo/hyper methylation in blood, rather than making any detailed quantitative comparisons.</p><p>We have added the following to Results (lines 184-186):</p><p>“SoC-CpG reliability is classified as ‘excellent’ (median ICC=0.76) using probe reliability estimates from a recent repeated measures study<sup>23</sup>. Reliability of matched control CpGs is classified as ‘good’ (median ICC=0.68) using the same method.”</p><p>We have also added a comment on the issue of general unreliability of probes overlapping the 450k and EPIC arrays to the Discussion, including the additional point on intermediate methylation and probe reliability raised by the reviewer below (lines 535-538):</p><p>“Measured DNAm values at SoC-CpGs and matched controls have previously been reported to be reliable, in strong contrast to the majority of probes overlapping the 450k and EPIC arrays that have been found to have low test-retest reliability<sup>23</sup>. This likely reflects increased inter-individual variability and/or intermediate DNAm at SoC-CpGs and controls<sup>75,76</sup>.”</p><p>23: Sugden et al. Patterns (2020); 75: Logue et al. Epigenomics (2017); 76: Xu and Taylor Epigenetics (2021).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further, differential reliability should be considered as an alternative explanation for the reduction in mean SoC amplitudes over time – could it be that measurements made using 450K arrays (ENID 2yr) are different to those using EPIC arrays for reasons beyond age-specific effects (i.e. measurement error)?</p></disp-quote><p>We think this is unlikely given the high reliability of these probes discussed above, and given the strong concordance between DNAm maxima further suggesting consistency between arrays.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the description of the properties of SoC-CpGs (lines 173 onwards) notes that they are more likely to be intermediately methylated – this is again a property of reliable CpGs since arrays do not have the resolution to measure hyper- and hypo- methylated sites very well, leading to unreliable measurements. In all, these points suggest that reliability of DNA methylation is important for interpretation of these results, and, given the high reliability of the SoC-CpGs, is actually a positive feature.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We agree that increased reliability of intermediately methylated probes is reassuring. We have added the point about increased reliability of intermediately methylated probes – see added text above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers were concerned that a large proportion of the discussion was dedicated to MEs and how these findings are related.
