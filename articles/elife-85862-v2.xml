survival rate stands at only 12%. Triptolides have potent anti-tumor activity against different types of cancers, including pancreatic cancer, however poor solubility and toxicity limit their translation into clinical use. We synthesized a novel pro-drug of triptolide, (<italic>E</italic>)–19-[(1’-benzoyloxy-1’-phenyl)-methylidene]-Triptolide (CK21), which was formulated into an emulsion for in vitro and in vivo testing in rats and mice, and used human pancreatic cancer cell lines and patient-derived pancreatic tumor organoids. A time-course transcriptomic profiling of tumor organoids treated with CK21 in vitro was conducted to define its mechanism of action, as well as transcriptomic profiling at a single time point post-CK21 administration in vivo. Intravenous administration of emulsified CK21 resulted in the stable release of triptolide, and potent anti-proliferative effects on human pancreatic cancer cell lines and patient-derived pancreatic tumor organoids in vitro, and with minimal toxicity in vivo. Time course transcriptomic profiling of tumor organoids treated with CK21 in vitro revealed &lt;10 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at 3 hr and ~8,000 DEGs at 12 hr. Overall inhibition of general RNA transcription was observed, and Ingenuity pathway analysis together with functional cellular assays confirmed inhibition of the NF-κB pathway, increased oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial dysfunction, leading ultimately to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, reduced B-cell-lymphoma protein 2 (BCL2) expression, and mitochondrial-mediated tumor cell apoptosis. Thus, CK21 is a novel pro-drug of triptolide that exerts potent anti-proliferative effects on human pancreatic tumors by inhibiting the NF-κB pathway, leading ultimately to mitochondrial-mediated tumor cell apoptosis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Pancreatic cancer is a major cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with only 12% of patients surviving for five years after diagnosis. Individuals generally experience few symptoms of the disease in the early stages and are often diagnosed once the cancer has already spread to other parts of the body. By this point, options for treatment are limited.</p><p>A molecule known as triptolide has been shown to kill breast, lung, pancreatic and other types of cancer cells. However, triptolide is toxic to humans and other animals, making it unsuitable for use in patients. One way to make drugs safer without compromising their beneficial effects is to modify their molecular structure. By formulating triptolide into an emulsion – a mixture of liquids allowing it to dissolve – Tian, Zhang et al. synthesized a new analogue called CK21.</p><p>Experiments showed that CK21 inhibited the growth of human pancreatic cancer cells grown in a laboratory including cells grown in artificial organs similar to the pancreas, known as pancreatic tumor organoids. Furthermore, CK21 killed large tumors in mice pancreases with very few side effects, suggesting the structural modification of triptolide increased safety of the drug.</p><p>To better understand how CK21 works, Tian, Zhang et al. examined the genes that were induced in the pancreatic tumor organoids at various time points after treatment with the drug. This revealed that CK21 switched off genes involved in the NF-κB cell signaling pathway, which regulates how cells grow and respond to stress. In turn, it triggered programmed cell death, killing the tumor cells in a controlled manner.</p><p>The findings suggest that CK21 could be a promising candidate for treating pancreatic cancer. In the future, clinical trials will be required to establish whether CK21 is a safe and effective therapy for humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>triptolide</kwd><kwd>pancreatic cancer</kwd><kwd>drug development</kwd><kwd>apotosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Cinkate Pharmaceutical Corp</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chong</surname><given-names>Anita S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>CK21 emerges as a compelling candidate for pancreatic cancer treatment, and its capacity to target the NF-κB pathway, induce mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis, and do so with minimal toxicity is a significant stride in the quest for improved therapies.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pancreatic cancer is the seventh leading cause of cancer -related deaths globally and the third leading in the United States, and has the lowest 5 -year survival rate among all the cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">DeSantis et al., 2019</xref>). Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma accounts for &gt;90% of all pancreatic cancer cases, and poor outcomes have been attributed to late diagnoses when the cancer is at advance stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kamisawa et al., 2016</xref>), where the majority of cases are accompanied with distant metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yachida et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sohn et al., 2000</xref>) and when most patients are not eligible for resection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bilimoria et al., 2007</xref>).

Multiple mechanisms have been proposed for triptolide-induced antitumor activity, including inhibition of NF-κB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2002</xref>), and HSP70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Phillips et al., 2007</xref>). Notably, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Titov et al., 2011</xref> reported that triptolide binds covalently to human XPB (ERCC3) and inhibits its DNA-dependent ATPase activity, leading to the inhibition of RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription and nucleotide excision repair. However, it is unclear how this non-specific inhibition of an essential transcription factor could exert selectivity against tumors.</p><p>While triptolide is a promising anti-cancer drug, poor solubility and toxicity have limited its clinical development, and a number of analogs of triptolide have been developed for improved clinical performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Noel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tong et al., 2021</xref>). In Phase I clinical studies, a soluble analog PG490-88/F60008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kitzen et al., 2009</xref>) resulted in significant toxicity and had high interindividual variability in pharmacokinetic studies, thus stopping further development. Minnelide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Greeno et al., 2015</xref>) is another analog with superior solubility and potent anti-tumor 1activity in multiple preclinical cancer models. Phase I clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03129139) showed significant activity in highly refractory metastatic pancreatic cancer, and it is currently in a Phase II open label trial (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT03117920).</p><p>In this study, we synthesized a novel pro-drug of triptolide, CK21, by decorating the C-19 with a C-C double bond to generate (<italic>E</italic>)–19-[(1’-benzoyloxy-1’-phenyl)-methylidene]-Triptolide, formulated it into an emulsion, and investigated its efficacy and mode of action. We report that CK21 inhibited the in vitro proliferation of multiple pancreatic cancer cell lines, was effective at eliminating large pancreatic tumors in heterotopic and orthotopic xenograft animal models with minimal toxicity, and confirmed the efficacy of CK21 against multiple patient-derived pancreatic tumor organoids in vitro and in vivo. We performed transcriptome analysis on the pancreatic organoid response to CK21 in vitro, and on the in vivo response of pancreatic tumors to CK21. We identified that CK21 reducing overall transcription, inhibited the NF-κB pathway, induced mitochondria dysfunction, and ultimately, mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis was identified as the likely mechanism for the anti-tumor activity of CK21.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Novel modified triptolide, CK21, show improved pharmacokinetics</title><p>We designed a new modification strategy to triptolide to generate CK21, by decorating the C-19 with a C-C double bond to generate (<italic>E</italic>)–19-[(1’-benzoyloxy-1’-phenyl)-methylidene]-Triptolide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Briefly, a mixture of triptolide (1.8 g, 5 mmol) with anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (250 mL) was kept at –25 °C~–20 °C under nitrogen protection. Benzoyl chloride (1.05 mL, 7.5 mmol) and Lithium 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine in tetrahydrofuran/toluene (7.5 mL, 2.0 M, 15 mmol) were then added dropwise to produce an intermediate compound, IM464. After 1 hr, addition of benzoyl chloride and lithium 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine was repeated, and the reaction was quenched by adding aqueous sodium carbonate (6%). Following concentration under reduced pressure, the crude product was separated and purified by silica gel chromatography, and the target product collected and further recrystallized in methylene chloride/hexane to obtain CK21 that was used in the in vitro studies.

We hypothesized that these early time points might reveal the initiating mechanism of action that result ultimately in the control of tumor growth; indeed, the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) significantly increased with prolonged CK21 treatment, from less than 10 DEGs at 3 hr up to 8,000 DEGs at 12 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We also performed transcriptome analysis on the AsPC-1 tumor, orthotopically implanted in the pancreas for 7 days and then treated by CK21 for three days.

At the protein level, we also observed a significant decrease of DDIT4 expression after CK21 treatment of 24 hoursr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Interestingly, DDIT4 has been identified as a prognosis marker and highly expressed in pancreatic tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pinto et al., 2017</xref>), thus prompting the investigation into whether DDIT4 inhibition might be the triggering mechanism of action and thus serve as a predictive biomarker for CK21 sensitivity. However, knock-down of DDIT4 in Panc-1 only induced very modest in vitro susceptibility to CK21, and the overexpression of DDIT4 in AsPC-1 didn’t result a difference to CK21 response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Furthermore, in two mouse pancreatic tumor cell lines derived from genetically modified KC or KPC mice that were only modestly sensitive to CK21 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>), DDIT4 as well as other early responder genes showed strong alterations in expression profiles comparable to tumors that were more sensitive to CK21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>).

These observations raise the possibility that increased ROS production may trigger mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and release of pro-apoptotic mitochondrial proteins into the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Márquez-Jurado et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The B-cell-lymphoma protein 2 (BCL2) family of proteins also play critical roles in regulating the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis, and BCL2 functions as a critical anti-apoptotic survival protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Redza-Dutordoir and Averill-Bates, 2016</xref>). To test whether BCL2 protein is reduced in CK21-treated cells, we quantified BCL2 protein expression by Western blotting. We observed that BCL2 was significant decreased in both AsPC-1 and Panc-1 cell lines, and in U049MAI, after 24 hours of CK21 culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6h</xref>).</p><p>Because most apoptotic pathways lead to the activation of cysteine-dependent aspartate-specific proteases, and ultimately to cleaved effector caspases such as caspases-3,–6 and –7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Redza-Dutordoir and Averill-Bates, 2016</xref>, we probed for cleaved caspase-3 in pancreatic tumors incubated with CK21. For Panc-1 and both pancreatic tumor organoids, cleaved caspase-3 was detected after 24 hours of culture with CK21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6i</xref>) by Western blotting. We also confirmed increased caspase-3/7 in Panc-1 by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interesting, cleaved caspase-3/7 was not detected in AsPC-1 after CK21 treatment, suggesting that apoptosis of these tumor cells may be explained by the involvement of other effector caspases or proteases. Collectively, these data point to CK21 downregulating the NF-kB pathway, promoting ROS production and mitochondrial-mediated tumor cell apoptosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>CK21 showed minimal immunosuppression in a spontaneous tumor rejection model</title><p>A number of studies have reported on the immunosuppressive activity of triptolide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen, 2001</xref>), thus raising the potential concern that CK21 may also inhibit the development of anti-tumor immune responses and prevent long-term tumor control. Indeed, although the analyses were conducted on CK21 treated tumor cells, IPA analysis indicated that CK21 inhibited lymphopoiesis, leukopoiesis and T cell development, consistent with potential immunosuppressive activity. To address this concern, we utilized a mouse KPC-960 pancreatic ductal-like tumor model derived from pancreatic tumors that spontaneously arose in KPC (<italic>Kras</italic><sup>G12D/+</sup><italic>Trp53</italic><sup>R172H/+</sup><italic>Pdx1-Cre</italic>) B6.129 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Torres et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). Upon subcutaneous implantation into B6.129 immunocompetent hosts, KPC-960 grew to a maximum tumor size by day 7 and then approximately 70% KPC-960 tumors were spontaneously rejected by day 14–17 post-implantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). This contrasted with tumor formation in similar B6.129 host in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Torres et al., 2013</xref>; we speculate that rejection of the KPC-960 tumor may be driven increased number of passages that resulted in the accumulation of mutations resulting in antigenic drift. To test whether CK21 could prevent the spontaneous regression of KPC-960, CK21 (3 mg/kg daily) therapy was initiated on day 5 or 7 post-implantation. We observed no statistically significant inhibition of tumor regression when CK21 treatment was started on day 5 or 7 post-implantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c, d</xref>) suggesting that the immunosuppressive activity of CK21 on established primary immune responses is minimal. We also implanted KPC-960 subcutaneously into nude mice but observed limited efficacy by CK21 when provided at 3 mg/kg/day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). These observations suggest that host immunity is primary responsible for the rejection of KPC-960 tumors. The reason for KPC-960 resistance to CK21 is not known and is the subject of future investigations.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>CK21 does not exhibit significant immunosuppression in a spontaneous tumor rejection model.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Scheme of a subcutaneous model of mouse pancreatic tumor, KPC-960, with CK21 treatment.

Splenocytes from mice treated with CK21 exhibited comparable killing of KPC-960 as splenocytes from untreated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7i</xref>).

Hepatotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, and nephrotoxicity have been identified as the major side effects for triptolide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2014a</xref>). In addition, sex differences have been observed, where the female rats showed more toxicity under the same dosage of triptolide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). Cytochrome P450s (CYP) is essential for the metabolism of triptolide and CYP3A2, a male-predominant form in rats, may contribute to the sex-related differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xue et al., 2011</xref>). Similar sex differences were also observed for CK21, where half the dose of CK21 in female rats had a similar triptolide exposure in plasma as male rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>), and the maximum tolerated dose of CK21 was 3 mg/kg/dose for female rats and 6 mg/kg/dose for male rats (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Consistent with the MTD of CK21 being different for male/female rats, we observed comparable efficacy of CK21 at 3 mg/kg in female mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), and at 1.5 mg/kg in male mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Whether these sex difference in triptolide metabolism will affect dosing in the clinic will have to be investigated in Phase I clinical trials. Nevertheless, despite sex difference, stable exposure of triptolide upon conversion from CK21 resulted in significantly mitigated toxicity, ompared to other analogs such as F60008 that showed a steep release of triptolide which, we speculate, would lead to triptolide overexposure and severe toxicity observed in Phase 1 trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kitzen et al., 2009</xref>). Another triptolide analog, MRx102 had a MTD of 3 mg/kg/dose for the female rats and 4.5 mg/kg/dose for the male rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fidler et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, under the pharmacokinetic profile of CK21, we were able to dose the female athymic nude mice up to 5 mg/kg/day for 28 days with tolerable weight loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>), and at 3 mg/kg/day, where CK21 showed potent efficacy and no obvious toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c–e</xref>).</p><p>We used rigorous time-course transcriptomic profiling of pancreatic tumors response to CK21 to identify its mechanism of action on patient-derived pancreatic tumor organoids. Overall, the effect of CK21 corresponded to the major reported anti-tumor functions of triptolide, namely transcription inhibition and apoptosis induction. Triptolide was reported by Tivov et al. to covalently bind to XPB, a subunit of the transcription factor TFIIH, resulting in the inhibition of its DNA-dependent ATPase activity, RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-mediated transcription and likely nucleotide excision repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Titov et al., 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2015</xref> further confirmed that triptolide functioned as a XPB/TFIIH inhibitor to limit promoter-proximal Pol II transcription initiation, resulting in decreased Pol II levels as early as 2 hours of treatment. Likewise, our transcriptome analyses revealed broad downregulation of transcription and transactivation of RNA after 12 hr CK21 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). Furthermore, as early as 6 hr of treatment, we observed a significant downregulation of critical transcription factors, including XBP1 and ZNF628 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>), which may mediate the broad inhibition of RNA and DNA transcription, as well as of RNA transactivation and expression, observed at 12 hr post-CK21 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). Inhibition of RNA transcription and blockade of RNA synthesis can potentially lead to programmed cell death. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Santo et al., 2010</xref>used a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor to inhibit Pol II phosphorylation and observed induction of apoptosis in myeloma cells. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cai et al., 2020</xref> also suggested inhibition of Pol II expression and phosphorylation resulted reduced expression of Mcl-1 and X-linked inhibitors of apoptosis (XIAP; ). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carter et al., 2006</xref> reported that tumor cell apoptosis induced by triptolide was accompanied by decrease of XIAP levels. We also observed a significant decrease of XIAP expression after CK21 treatment of two human pancreatic organoids in vitro, and of orthotopically transplanted AsPC-1 tumors in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d, f and g</xref>).</p><p>Our analysis of enriched signaling/metabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d, e</xref>) predicted the downstream effects of CK21 inhibition of general transcription might lead to tumor cell apoptosis. As a potential consequence of transcription inhibition, genes for the key regulators of NF-κB pathway, such as CHUK, IKBKB and RELA, were significantly downregulated in both organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). We also observed decreased p65 expression at a protein level and reduced translocation of the NF-κB complex to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b–e</xref>). Therefore, activation of the NF-κB pathway was significantly inhibited after treatment with CK21. In addition to promoting cell proliferation and immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Park and Hong, 2016</xref>), NF-κB also plays a role in controlling mitochondrial dynamics and cell apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albensi, 2019</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pazarentzos et al., 2014</xref> demonstrated the localization of IκBα on the outer membrane of mitochondrial functions to inhibit apoptosis, especially in the tumor cells. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2004</xref> indicated the inhibition of NF-κB alone can induce the release of cytochrome C from mitochondria (). In our study, we observed a significant downregulation of NFKBIA, which encodes IκBα, in both organoids after CK21 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, we also observed that the expression of genes encoding five mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes was significantly increased in pancreatic tumor organoids treated with CK21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>). Collectively these data suggest a downstream effect of CK21 inhibition of NF-κB is the promotion of dysregulated mitochondrial function and subsequently, increased susceptibility to mitochondrial-mediated intrinsic apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Márquez-Jurado et al., 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that the changes in gene expression could reflect different stability of mRNA, and are not directly related to CK21 modifying general transcription.</p><p>As upstream regulators, BCL2 family proteins that reside or congregate on the surface of mitochondria govern cell-intrinsic apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Cory, 2001</xref>). BCL2 family proteins have opposing functions in regulating the equilibrium of mitochondrial membrane potential: BCL2 is anti-apoptotic and promotes cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vaux et al., 1988</xref>), whereas BAX is pro-apoptotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wolter et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ly et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gross et al., 1999</xref>). Under CK21 treatment, BCL2 expression in pancreatic cancer cells was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6h</xref>). Similar observations were reported in leukemic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carter et al., 2006</xref>) and melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tao et al., 2012</xref>) treated with triptolide. Thus CK21 may tip such equilibrium towards permeabilization and release of apoptogenic molecules into cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gross et al., 1999</xref>). Eventually, effector caspases, such as caspase 3, 6, and 7, are cleaved and activated to induce apoptosis. In our study, we observed a significant increase of cleaved caspase 3 for Panc-1 and both pancreatic tumor organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6i</xref>). Finally, we noted subtle differences in the extent to which Bcl2 is inhibited and Caspase 3 is activated following CK21 treatment of the two pancreatic tumor cell lines and two patient-derived organoids; these observations underscore the notion that broad inhibition of RNA transcription allows CK21 to leverage distinct vulnerabilities and pathways to achieve apoptosis in different tumor cells.</p><p>Taken together, our study describes the development of a novel modified triptolide, CK21, with improved pharmacokinetics, and efficacy for pancreatic tumor cell lines and patient-derived pancreatic tumor organoids. Transcriptomic profiling of the organoids and verification of protein expression collectively point to the induction of tumor cell apoptosis by CK21 is mediated by the inhibition of general transcription, leading to downstream effects involving NF-κB inhibition and mitochondria dysfunction.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

We tested the efficacy of CK21 in vitro using cell proliferation assays and multiple pancreatic cancer cell lines, and in vivo in heterotopic and orthotopic xenograft mouse models. We also tested the efficacy of CK21 against multiple patient-derived pancreatic tumor organoids in vitro and in vivo. We performed transcriptome analysis on the pancreatic organoid response to CK21 in vitro, and on the in vivo response of pancreatic tumors to CK21. This analysis identified the ability of CK21 to reduce overall transcription, inhibit the NF-κB pathway, induce mitochondria dysfunction, and ultimately, mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. We confirmed inhibition of NF-κB expression and translocation in pancreatic cell lines using imaging flow cytometry, Western blotting and RT-PCR.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Reagents</title><p>Human pancreatic tumor cell lines were obtained from commercial sources. Human tumor organoids were obtained from patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, confirmed to be tumor based on pathologic assessment, and developed into organoid culture according to established protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Romero-Calvo et al., 2019</xref>).

CK21 was synthesized as described below. All other reagents listed in the Key Resources Table were validated by the manufacturer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Synthesis and formulation of CK21</title><p>Under nitrogen protection, a mixture of triptolide (1.8 g, 5 mmol) and anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (250 mL) was cooled to –20 °C, and lithium 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine in tetrahydrofuran/toluene (7.5 mL, 2.0 M, 15 mmol) was added dropwise. After stirring for 30 min, benzoyl chloride (1.05 mL, 7.5 mmol) was added dropwise and reacted for 1 hr, followed again with benzoyl chloride (7.5 mmol) and reacted for another 2 hr. The reaction was quenched by adding aqueous sodium carbonate (10%), and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (250 mL ×3). The organic phases were combined, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude product was separated and purified by silica gel chromatography (dichloromethane: ethyl acetate = 2:1), and the target product (white solid, 2.55 g, yield 90%) was collected and further recrystallized in a mixed organic solvent (dichloromethane/hexane) to obtain a final product (2.13 g, yield 85%, purity &gt;99% by UPLC).</p><p>CK21 was dissolved in medium chain triglycerides (MCT) at 90 °C under nitrogen. PC-98T, DSPE-MPEG2000 and glycerol were dissolved in water to form the water phase. The oil phase was dispersed at room temperature in the water phase with high-speed shear mixing (FAS90-22, FLUKO) at 2,800 rpm for 30 min. The pH was adjusted to 4–7, and volume was made up to 100% with water. The final emulsion was obtained by high-pressure homogenization using microfluidizer (M-7125–20 K, MFIC) at 10,000 psi for one cycle and at 18,000 psi for two cycles. Finally, the emulsion was sealed in vials (5 mL: 1.5 mg) after flushing with nitrogen gas and autoclaved at 121 °C for 15 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Characterization of CK21 compound</title><p>1 H NMR (Bruker, 400MHz, CDCl3): δ 8.25 (dd, J=1.6 Hz, 8.0 Hz, 2 H), 7.76 (dd, J=1.6 Hz, 8.4 Hz, 2 H), 7.67 (m, 1 H), 7.58 (t, J=7.2 Hz, 2 H), 7.43~7.38 (m, 3 H), 3.80 (d, J=3.2 Hz, 1 H), 3.39 (d, J=2.8 Hz, 1 H), 2.98 (d, J=10 Hz, 1 H), 2.75~2.69 (m, 1 H), 2.63~2.58 (m, 1 H), 2.56 (d, J=6.4 Hz, 1 H), 2.53 (d, J=10 Hz, 1 H), 2.40~2.32 (m, 2 H), 2.21~2.14 (m, 1 H), 1.88 (dd, J=14.0 Hz, 13.2 Hz, 1 H), 1.55~1.52 (m, 1 H), 1.18~1.11 (m, 1 H), 1.15 (s, 3 H), 0.92 (d, J=7.2 Hz, 3 H), 0.82 (d, J=6.8 Hz, 3 H); 13 C NMR (Bruker, 100 MHz, CDCl3): δ168.1, 164.5, 150.3, 142.2, 134.4, 133.5, 131.9, 130.5, 129.9,129.2, 128.9, 128.6, 128.1, 128.0, 72.8, 65.8, 65.3, 60.7, 60.0, 56.5, 53.7, 40.7, 36.7, 29.3, 27.9, 24.6, 17.8, 17.6, 16.7, 15.0.</p><p>Mass Spectrometry (AGILENT, ESI+): Calculated for C34H32O8[M]: 568.62, found 569.22 [M<sup>+</sup>H]<sup>+</sup> and 591.21 [M<sup>+</sup>Na]<sup>+</sup>.</p><p>CK21 crystals were obtained by careful evaporation of a mixture of CK21 in combined solvent of dichloromethane and hexane at room temperature.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Wafik El-Deiry as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Katerina Gurova (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Tian et al., describe a novel modified version of the pro-drug triptolide, CK21, and provide evidence for its improved pharmacokinetics and its safety and efficacy in multiple xenograft models of pancreatic cancer. The authors performed transcriptomic analysis upon CK21 treatment which revealed that downregulation of NF-κB and mitochondrial dysfunction induce apoptosis and therefore lead to tumor regression. These findings have potential clinical significance as the efficacy of CK21 in preclinical PDAC models is compelling. However, there are also some limitations to their experiments and more validation studies are necessary to strengthen their findings regarding the mechanism of action of the drug.</p><p>1) How does the in vivo toxicity and efficacy of CK21 compare to that of other triptolide analogs like minnelide, which is in clinical trials for pancreatic cancers? Side-by-side comparisons are needed to show CK21 is at least as efficacious as other analogs, especially since minnelide was shown to synergize with conventional chemotherapy in PDAC mouse models, whereas CK21 does not appear to.</p><p>2) The authors propose that CK21 induce mitochondrial dysfunction based on RNA-seq. They should validate these findings through functional assays such as the Seahorse extracellular flux analyzer.</p><p>3) What accounts for the resistance of some PDAC cell lines (such as those derived from the KPC mice) to CK21? The changes in expression of the genes shown in Figure S10 are largely similar to those observed for the sensitive PDAC cells and organoid lines. Transcriptomic analysis of the resistant cells and comparison to the sensitive ones could uncover potential resistance mechanisms and might reveal ways to overcome that resistance. Also, does the in vitro sensitivity, or lack thereof, to CK21 mimic the sensitivity observed in vivo?</p><p>4) There are some limitations to the interpretation of the effects of CK21 on the tumor stroma. The authors note that 3D patient derived organoids better recapitulate human PDAC. However, they transplanted these cells subcutaneously instead of orthotopically, which would have had more biological and pharmacological relevance to human disease. Additionally, the limitations of the experiments performed on immunocompetent mice due to the unexplained tumor rejection makes it difficult to interpret the data. No major immunosuppression was observed within the time frame of the treatment. However, the question of whether CK21 is efficacious in syngeneic orthotopic PDAC models is critical and has to be addressed with the right immunocompetent PDAC model, especially since CK21 was shown to have an impact on NF-ΚB which plays a major role in the immune compartment.</p><p>5) Given that AsPC-1 cells did not show any cleaved caspase-3/7 in vitro, but TUNEL staining did detect apoptosis in vivo, are there any genes involved in caspase3-independed forms of apoptosis in the in vivo RNA-seq that could explain the observed apoptosis?</p><p>6) Since CK21 induced reactive oxygen species and the Ingenuity pathway analysis revealed necrosis as being induced by CK21, was necrosis observed in the tumors following CK21 treatment? This is an important question because necrosis initiates pro-inflammatory signaling cascades whereas apoptosis does not elicit inflammation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>&quot;CK21 had a T<sub>1/2</sub> of 1.3 h and 0.225 h for male and female rats respectively.

Lower doses did not show tumor regression.</p><p>&quot;To further confirm the lack of toxicity of CK21 (3 mg/kg), we performed HandE and TUNEL staining to detect cell apoptosis on the kidney, liver, and pancreas of mice after 28 days treatment. We observed no toxicity in the kidney, liver, and pancreas tissues after 28 days of treatment (Figure 2e); in contrast, after 14 days of CK21 treatment, AsPC-1 tumors showed a 5-fold increase of TUNEL-positive staining compared to the no Rx group (Figures2f and g)&quot;.</p><p>To do this comparison TUNEL staining of the kidney, liver, and pancreas tissues and HandE of tumor need to be shown.</p><p>How long mice were observed in the orthotopic experiment?

Indeed, we agree that the transcriptomic analysis of both organoids (U049MAI is more sensitive than U123M15-T in vitro) showed similar differentially expressed genes at all time points tested. Likewise, AsPC-1 tumors showed a better sensitivity to CK21 in vivo compared to in vitro results. We speculate that the differential sensitivity might be due to different mutational profiles of the two organoids but their impact was not captured by the 3-12 h transcriptomic analysis and that longer exposure may reveal relevant underlying cause. Furthermore, differences in CK21 metabolism in vivo compared to in vitro may also be relevant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There are some limitations to the interpretation of the effects of CK21 on the tumor stroma. The authors note that 3D patient derived organoids better recapitulate human PDAC. However, they transplanted these cells subcutaneously instead of orthotopically, which would have had more biological and pharmacological relevance to human disease.

However, it’s difficult to monitor the growth of the organoids when implanted orthotopically as they are not transfected with luciferase; this, would make the evaluation of the efficacy of CK21 with the orthotopic model very challenging. Hence, we chose to use the subcutaneous model for human organoids in vivo study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Given that AsPC-1 cells did not show any cleaved caspase-3/7 in vitro, but TUNEL staining did detect apoptosis in vivo, are there any genes involved in caspase3-independed forms of apoptosis in the in vivo RNA-seq that could explain the observed apoptosis?</p></disp-quote><p>We conducted the caspase-3 assay at 2-24 h of in vitro treatment whereas the in vivo TUNEL study captured the late-stage events (at 2 weeks post-CK21 treatment). Notably, pathway analysis of the statistically significant differentially expressed genes in AsPC-1 tumors after 3 days of CK21 treatment revealed enrichment in Cell Cycle: G2/M DNA Damage Checkpoint Regulation, which corresponds to AsPC-1 tumor apoptosis. We have now included this analysis in Figure 5—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Since CK21 induced reactive oxygen species and the Ingenuity pathway analysis revealed necrosis as being induced by CK21, was necrosis observed in the tumors following CK21 treatment? This is an important question because necrosis initiates pro-inflammatory signaling cascades whereas apoptosis does not elicit inflammation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have assessed the areas of necrosis in the recovered tumors in tumor samples that had been collected at the end of the study (4 weeks of CK21 treatment). A higher percentage necrotic area was observed in the untreated tumors compared to untreated tumors (~0.04% vs. ~0.15%), but the confounding variable was that the tumors from untreated mice were much larger than the CK21 treated tumors, where many had minimally detectable tumors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>&quot;CK21 had a T<sub>1/2</sub> of 1.3 h and 0.225 h for male and female rats respectively.

Those studies concluded that gender differential disposition of triptolide may be the cause of increased toxicity in females (Liu et al. 2015). Therefore, our pharmacokinetics study was performed at the highest non-toxic doses for male and female rats.</p><p>[1] Liu et al., Gender Differences in the Toxicokinetics of Triptolide after Single- and Multiple-dose Administration in Rats.

What we observed was NF-κB activation and upregulation of genes enriched in cell death pathways at the 12 h time point. We therefore conclude that the direct anti-tumor effect of CK21 is cell death through NF-κB activation, mitochondrial dysregulation and ROS production.</p></body></sub-article></article>
