epilepsy with comorbid intellectual disability. Recently, two de novo heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding TRPM3, a calcium permeable ion channel, were identified as the cause of DEE in eight probands, but the functional consequences of the mutations remained elusive. Here we demonstrate that both mutations (V990M and P1090Q) have distinct effects on TRPM3 gating, including increased basal activity, higher sensitivity to stimulation by the endogenous neurosteroid pregnenolone sulfate (PS) and heat, and altered response to ligand modulation. Most strikingly, the V990M mutation affected the gating of the non-canonical pore of TRPM3, resulting in large inward cation currents via the voltage sensor domain in response to PS stimulation. Taken together, these data indicate that the two DEE mutations in TRPM3 result in a profound gain of channel function, which may lie at the basis of epileptic activity and neurodevelopmental symptoms in the patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>trp channel</kwd><kwd>TRPM3</kwd><kwd>developmental and epileptic encephalopathies</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G.084515N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vriens</surname><given-names>Joris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G.0B1819N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vriens</surname><given-names>Joris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G.0565.07</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Voets</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name><name><surname>Vriens</surname><given-names>Joris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G.0825.11</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Voets</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name><name><surname>Vriens</surname><given-names>Joris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004040</institution-id><institution>KU Leuven</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C1-TRPLe</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Voets</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>12U7918N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Held</surname><given-names>Katharina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Two mutations in TRPM3 resulting in developmental and epileptic encephalopathies result in a gain-of-channel function, which may lie at the basis of epileptic activity and neurodevelopmental symptoms in the patients.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channel TRPM3 is a calcium-permeable cation channel that can be activated by heat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Vriens et al., 2011</xref>) and by a variety of chemical ligands, including the endogenous neurosteroid pregnenolone sulfate (PS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Wagner et al., 2008</xref>). TRPM3 is expressed in a large subset of mouse and human somatosensory neurons, where it is involved in the detection of noxious heat and the development of inflammatory pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Vriens et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Vangeel et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, TRPM3 is expressed in several brain areas, including the choroid plexus, cerebellum, cortex and the hippocampal formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Grimm et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Oberwinkler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Zamudio-Bulcock et al., 2011</xref>), but its functional role in these areas is unknown. Recently, two de novo substitutions in TRPM3 (V990M and P1090Q) were identified as the cause of intellectual disability and epilepsy in eight probands with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Dyment et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, clinical findings in these eight individuals also included one individual with an altered pain sensitivity and a second individual showing a modified heat sensitivity, even if pain sensitivity was not systematically tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Dyment et al., 2019</xref>). However, the consequences of these mutations on TRPM3 function remained elusive. We here demonstrate that both mutations lead to significant gain-of-channel function, including increased basal activity and higher sensitivity to PS and heat. V990M exhibits further pronounced functional alterations, including anomalous activation of the alternative current through the voltage-sensor domain, reduced sensitivity to receptor-mediated inhibition and calcium-dependent inactivation, and lower sensitivity to block by the anticonvulsant primidone.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>When performing Fura-2-based calcium imaging on transiently transfected HEK293T cells, we observed significantly higher intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) in cells expressing the two DEE mutants compared to wild type human TRPM3 (WT; GenBank: AJ505026.1), an effect that was much more pronounced in the V990M mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>).

In line with earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Wagner et al., 2008</xref>), we found that PS (40 µM) reversibly activated outwardly rectifying whole-cell currents in cells expressing WT, whereas application of Clt (10 µM) did not activate currents by itself but potentiated responses to PS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). In particular, application of PS in the presence of Clt provoked activation of a large inwardly rectifying current component, which has been attributed to activation of an alternative ion permeation pathway located in the voltage-sensing domain, distinct from the central pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Vriens et al., 2014</xref>). The response pattern was strikingly altered in cells expressing the DEE mutants. In the case of V990M, whole-cell current densities in response to PS were significantly larger compared to WT, and notably, exhibited a prominent inwardly rectifying current component. In addition, application of Clt induced robust currents in the absence of PS, whereas currents in the combined presence of Clt and PS were similar in amplitude and shape as WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). In the case of P1090Q, whole-cell current densities in response to PS were also significantly larger compared to WT, but lacked the inwardly rectifying component observed in the V990M mutant. Clt did not activate currents in cells expressing P1090Q, and in contrast to WT, inhibited the response to PS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that both DEE mutants lead to significant changes in channel gating, including increased basal activity and pronounced alterations in ligand responses.</p><p>To further assess the enhanced response to PS stimulation of the DEE mutants, we compared their apparent affinity to PS by measuring [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> responses to stepwise increases in PS concentrations. We found that the concentration-response curve for both mutants was shifted to significantly lower concentrations compared to WT. Notably, whereas a PS concentration of 10 µM was required to induce a detectable response in cells expressing WT TRPM3, we observed robust calcium responses at concentrations as low as 100 nM for V990M and 1 µM for P1090Q. Moreover, the maximal increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> to saturating PS concentrations was significantly higher in P1090Q expressing cells compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>).

To evaluate whether G<sub>βγ</sub>-dependent modulation is altered in the DEE mutations, we co-transfected HEK293T cells with the µ-opioid receptor and WT or mutant TRPM3, and evaluated the effect of the selective agonist DAMGO on PS-activated whole-cell currents. In cells expressing WT or P1090Q, application of 1 µM DAMGO induced a complete and rapidly reversible inhibition of inward and outward currents, whereas V990M was only partly inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–I</xref>).

A difference in sensitivity was also found for the anticonvulsant drug primidone, which at a concentration of 25 µM caused a full inhibition of PS-activated inward and outward currents mediated by WT or P1090Q, but blocked currents mediated by V990M by only ~50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–G,I</xref>).

A similar inwardly rectifying current component can also be activated in WT TRPM3 when PS is applied in the presence of Clt. In earlier work, we have demonstrated that this inwardly rectifying current component represents ion flux through an alternative ion permeation pathway located in the voltage sensor domain of TRPM3, which can be distinguished from the central pore based on its voltage dependence, insensitivity to pore block by La<sup>3+</sup> and ion selectivity (including a lower permeability for monomethylammonium (MMA<sup>+</sup>) compared to Na<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Vriens et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Held et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Held et al., 2018</xref>).

We therefore hypothesized that gating of the alternative ion permeation pathway is facilitated in V990M, such that it can be activated by PS even when Clt is not co-applied. We found that the PS-activated current in the V990M mutant showed a bimodal voltage dependence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), its inward current component was resistant to block by the central pore blocker La<sup>3+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref>), and inward currents were reduced when extracellular Na<sup>+</sup> was replaced by MMA<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>).

To mimic the heterozygous condition in vitro, we performed a limited number of experiments in cells co-transfected with a mixture of cDNA encoding WT and mutant TRPM3 in a 1:1 ratio. The current densities of PS-induced inward currents in cells expressing a WT:V990M mixture was intermediate between cells expressing only WT or only V990M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). Moreover, the PS-activated currents exhibited the typical inwardly rectifying current component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). Finally, in contrast to WT but like V990M, Clt (10 µM) activated robust currents in cells expressing a WT:V990M mixture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). Next, the WT:P1090Q co-transfected cells showed PS-induced current densities that were intermediate between WT and P1090Q transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>) and showed a shift in the rectification pattern of the PS-induced currents that was different from the homozygote situation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Moreover, the effect of Clt pre-incubation was different in co-transfected cells. WT:P1090Q cells showed first a potentiation of the PS responses by pre-incubation of Clt, followed by a time-dependent current inhibition. This was in contrast to the block of PS-induced currents by pre-incubation with Clt for the P1090Q mutant in isolation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Taken together, these findings indicate that also in the heterozygous condition both DEE mutations lead to a gain of channel function.

All data sets were tested for normality and the Student’s paired, two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test or the Mann-Whitney U test were used for statistical comparison between two different data sets. For comparison between multiple data sets One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s posthoc test or Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA with Dunn’s posthoc test were performed. P values below 0.05 were considered as significantly different. Data points represent means ± SEM of the given number (n) of identical experiments. No exclusion of statistical outliers was performed in this study.</p><p>Conductance-voltage (<italic>G-V</italic>) curves were fitted with a Boltzmann function of the form:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:msub><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>exp</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>⟮</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⟯</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula>where <italic>z</italic> is the apparent gating charge, <italic>V<sub>1/2</sub></italic> the potential for half-maximal activation, <italic>G<sub>max</sub></italic> the maximal conductance, <italic>F</italic> the Faraday constant, <italic>R</italic> the gas constant and <italic>T</italic> the absolute temperature.

The experiments shown here demonstrate that these mutations produce a gain of function, which the authors suggest could be responsible for the increased excitability associated with the described pathology. These findings are of general relevance since they demonstrate, if indirectly, that TRPM3 channels serve important functions in the central nervous system. The characterization of the mutations' effects is thorough and the experiments are well conducted.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Overall, it is convincing that both V990M and P1090Q mutations confer some gain-of-function channel properties. However, it is well known that in the heterologous overexpression systems, the expression levels of the wild-type (WT) and mutant TRP channels may sometimes affect their ligand sensitivities and basal activities. What is the evidence that the expression levels of the V990M and P1090Q mutants are comparable to that of the WT channel? When comparing current magnitude between WT and mutants (Figure 1—figure supplement 1), data should be presented as averages of current density, not absolute current, since expression levels surely vary between cells and between mutants. Are the current densities of the maximal currents (i.e., PS+clt-induced currents) comparable for WT and mutant channels? Whereas representative traces were shown, the average current densities under various agonist conditions should be provided.</p><p>2) In Figure 1C, it would be more informative to present the fraction of calcium signal inhibited by primidone instead of -delta Ca.</p><p>3) Regarding the WT:mutant mixing experiments, it’s not clear how these data can be interpreted. The channel composition in humans is unknown; thus assuming that a heterozygous condition implies heteromeric channels is unsupported. The data presented in Figure 4 only indicate that the effects of the mutations can be conferred by a limited number of subunits, if the mutant can form tetramers with WT subunits (in 1:1 ratio), which is also not demonstrated and cannot be assumed a priori. If these data remain in the paper, these possibilities and limitations of the interpretation put forward should be clearly stated and discussed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57190.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Overall, it is convincing that both V990M and P1090Q mutations confer some gain-of-function channel properties.

Therefore, we have performed additional analysis of the microfluorimetric experiments and have checked the expression levels of the different transfected cells by analyzing the YFP fluorescent intensity of all transfected cells. All cDNA constructs were designed with an YFP tag that is directly coupled to the C-terminal tail of TRPM3 WT, V990M or P1090Q, implying that YFP fluorescence can be used to evaluate total cellular expression levels. Although there was some variation in fluorescence levels between individual cells, no significant differences were observed between WT and the DEE mutants. Altogether, the results suggest that the protein expression level of WT and DEE mutants are within the same range. These data are included in the revised version of the manuscript (Figure 1—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>When comparing current magnitude between WT and mutants (Figure 1—figure supplement 1), data should be presented as averages of current density, not absolute current, since expression levels surely vary between cells and between mutants.

However, the main problem of this type of analysis is the definition of 100% inhibition, since for individual cells it is unknown what their basal calcium concentration would be in the absence of TRPM3 activity. We tentatively defined 100% inhibition of basal activity when primidone reduced the calcium concentration to the mean basal calcium level in non-transfected cells (~30nM), according to:<disp-formula id="equ3"><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mi>%</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>100</mml:mn><mml:mi>%</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.222em"/><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo form="prefix" stretchy="true">[</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mtext mathvariant="normal">Ca</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo form="postfix" stretchy="true">]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo form="prefix" stretchy="true">[</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mtext mathvariant="normal">Ca</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo form="postfix" stretchy="true">]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mtext mathvariant="normal">primidone</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo form="prefix" stretchy="true">[</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mtext mathvariant="normal">Ca</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo form="postfix" stretchy="true">]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.222em"/><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mtext mathvariant="normal">mean </mml:mtext><mml:mspace width="0.333em"/></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo form="prefix" stretchy="true">[</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mtext mathvariant="normal">Ca</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo form="postfix" stretchy="true">]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>However, especially for WT and the P1090Q mutant, this approach often yielded spurious values. In particular, when the basal level before primidone was close to or below the 30 nM level, this approach yielded either negative values or values up to 4000% block (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, top plot). On average, the levels of inhibition calculated in this way were similar for the three channels, at around 70-80 % block (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, bottom).

Nevertheless, there are numerous examples in the literature of TRP (e.g. Hoenderop et al. EMBO J 2003) and other tetrameric channels (e.g. MacKinnon Nature, 1991) showing that mixing WT subunits with subunits carrying single point mutations generally leads to the random formation of heteromultimers, following a binomial distribution. Considering that the DEE mutations are point mutations, and not located in domains that are likely to be involved in tetramerisation, we believe it is fair to assume that also here there will be formation of heterotetramers. Currently, there is no knowledge available regarding the exact subunit composition of TRPM3 channels in the cells of human patients. Nevertheless, most dominantly inherited channelopathies caused by point mutations in TRP or other tetrameric channels are attributed to the random formation of heteromultimeric channels with variable subunit composition and altered functionality. In the revised manuscript, we have briefly discussed these possibilities and the limitations of the interpretation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
