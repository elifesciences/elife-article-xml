Restoration of <italic>NPRL2</italic> induces DNA damage, apoptosis, and cell-cycle arrest. We investigated <italic>NPRL2</italic> antitumor immune responses in aPD1<sup>R</sup>/<italic>KRAS/STK11<sup>mt</sup></italic> NSCLC in humanized-mice. Humanized-mice were generated by transplanting fresh human cord blood-derived CD34 stem cells into sub-lethally irradiated NSG mice. Lung-metastases were developed from <italic>KRAS/STK11<sup>mt</sup></italic>/aPD1<sup>R</sup> A549 cells and treated with <italic>NPRL2</italic> w/wo pembrolizumab. <italic>NPRL2</italic>-treatment reduced lung metastases significantly, whereas pembrolizumab was ineffective. Antitumor effect was greater in humanized than non-humanized-mice. <italic>NPRL2</italic> + pembrolizumab was not synergistic in <italic>KRAS/STK11<sup>mt</sup></italic>/aPD1<sup>R</sup> tumors but was synergistic in <italic>KRAS<sup>wt</sup></italic>/aPD1<sup>S</sup> H1299. <italic>NPRL2</italic> also showed a significant antitumor effect on <italic>KRAS<sup>mt</sup></italic>/aPD1<sup>R</sup> LLC2 syngeneic-tumors. The antitumor effect was correlated with increased infiltration of human cytotoxic-T, HLA-DR<sup>+</sup>DC, CD11c<sup>+</sup>DC, and downregulation of myeloid and regulatory-T cells in TME. Antitumor effect was abolished upon in-vivo depletion of CD8-T, macrophages, and CD4-T cells whereas remained unaffected upon NK-cell depletion. A distinctive protein-expression profile was found after <italic>NPRL2</italic> treatment. <italic>IFNγ, CD8b</italic>, and <italic>TBX21</italic> associated with T-cell functions were significantly increased, whereas <italic>FOXP3, TGFB1/B2</italic>, and <italic>IL-10RA</italic> were strongly inhibited by <italic>NPRL2</italic>. A list of T-cell co-inhibitory molecules was also downregulated. Restoration of <italic>NPRL2</italic> exhibited significantly slower tumor growth in humanized-mice, which was associated with increased presence of human cytotoxic-T, and DC and decreased percentage of Treg, MDSC, and TAM in TME. <italic>NPRL2</italic>-stable cells showed a substantial increase in colony-formation inhibition and heightened sensitivity to carboplatin. Stable-expression of <italic>NPRL2</italic> resulted in the downregulation of MAPK and AKT-mTOR signaling. Taken-together, <italic>NPRL2</italic> gene-therapy induces antitumor activity on <italic>KRAS/STK11<sup>mt</sup></italic>/aPD1<sup>R</sup> tumors through DC-mediated antigen-presentation and cytotoxic immune-cell activation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>nprl2 gene therapy</kwd><kwd>NSCLC</kwd><kwd>anti-PD1 resistance</kwd><kwd>KRAS/STK11 mutation</kwd><kwd>humanized mouse model</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA-016672</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roth</surname><given-names>Jack A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Genprex Inc</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Sponsor research agreement</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roth</surname><given-names>Jack A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>NPRL2 gene therapy induces robust antitumor immunity and overcome anti-PD1 resistance through augmenting antigen-presentation and cytotoxic T cells activation in KRAS/STK11 mutant NSCLC in humanized mouse model.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>NPRL2</italic> (Nitrogen Permease Regulator-Like 2) is also known as <italic>TUSC4</italic>, a tumor suppressor gene, located on chromosome 3p21.31 in a cluster with other tumor suppressor genes including <italic>TUSC2/FUS1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kondo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lerman and Minna, 2000</xref>). Reduced expression or deletion of NPRL2 was found in many cancers including lung, renal, colorectal, glioma, gastric, and hepatocellular carcinoma, and has been closely correlated with poor clinical outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Huang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Otani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Senchenko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zabarovsky et al., 2002</xref>). We previously reported that low expression of NPRL2 in distinct types of lung cancers was associated with cisplatin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ueda et al., 2006</xref>) and restoration of <italic>NPRL2</italic> in <italic>NPRL2</italic> deficient cells overcomes cisplatin resistance through the activation of the DNA damage checkpoint pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Jayachandran et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>NPRL2</italic> was also shown to induce apoptosis, inhibition of cell proliferation, and cell cycle arrest in many other cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Jayachandran et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liu et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Li et al., 2004</xref>). <italic>NPRL2</italic> induces apoptosis and DNA damage in cells with active p53 and inactive p53 by causing cell cycle arrest in G1 and G2/M arrest, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ma et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Immunotherapy with checkpoint blockade has shown clinical benefits for NSCLC in only a subset of patients. The majority of patients do not respond (primary resistance) or develop resistance after initial tumor regression (acquired resistance) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sharma et al., 2017</xref>). Checkpoint blockade therapy (ICB) was found to be effective primarily among patients with high programmed death protein ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and with no oncogenic driver mutations such as <italic>EGFR, ALK, or ROS1, MET, KRAS</italic>, and <italic>STK11/LKB1</italic>. The tumors harboring co-mutation of <italic>KRAS</italic> and <italic>STK11/LKB1</italic> (KL) subtypes are also resistant to ICB treatment and showed worse overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival PFS (PFS) in the clinic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shire et al., 2020</xref>). The inactivated <italic>STK11</italic> gene was recently reported to weaken the innate immune responses by epigenetic inhibition of stimulator of IFN genes (<italic>STING</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Kitajima et al., 2019</xref>). The tumor microenvironment (TME) of these resistant tumors displayed a distinct immune contexture which is characterized by poor infiltration of cytotoxic immune cells and higher infiltration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tumeh et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, the development of novel approaches to modulate the TME leading to increased T cell infiltration and its cytotoxic functions within the TME is of paramount importance to overcome ICB resistance.</p><p>To this point, compelling evidence indicates the critical role of <italic>NPRL2</italic> in causing DNA damage and double-strand break (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ueda et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Jayachandran et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ma et al., 2017</xref>) which can be used to trigger DC activation, antigen presentation, and priming of tumor-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the TME. The effect of tumor suppressor genes in modulating immune cells in the TME has been poorly investigated. The effect of <italic>NPRL2</italic> gene therapy, a tumor suppressor gene, on innate and adaptive immune cells in tumors has not been previously studied. However, we recently established the role of <italic>TUSC2</italic>, another tumor suppressor gene in the same cluster in chromosome 3p21.31, in activating innate and adaptive immunity. <italic>TUSC2</italic> selectively augments natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity in peripheral blood and the TME, induces a Th1-mediated immune response, and downregulates MDSC and regulatory T cells (Treg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Meraz et al., 2018</xref>). We also showed that <italic>TUSC2</italic> gene therapy synergizes with anti-PD-1 in syngeneic <italic>KRAS</italic> mutant lung cancer mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Meraz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cao et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We recently developed an improved humanized mouse model using fresh human umbilical cord blood-derived CD34<sup>+</sup> stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Meraz et al., 2019</xref>). The reconstituted humanized mice have a fully competent human immune system with major functional immune populations, which showed antigen-specific T-cell responses as well as antitumor activity with immune checkpoint blockade therapy. This model provides a unique opportunity for establishing an effective drug screening workflow for immunotherapy.</p><p><italic>NPRL2</italic> gene therapy is effective in overcoming cisplatin resistance in NSCLC, but the antitumor immune response and the effectiveness of <italic>NPRL2</italic> have not been studied on ICB-resistant KL (<italic>KRAS</italic> &amp; <italic>LKB1/STK11</italic> co-mutant) tumors. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that <italic>NPRL2</italic> which induces apoptosis and DNA damage in tumor cells, would promote a variety of innate and adaptive immune responses and exert a strong antitumor effect in overcoming anti-PD1 resistance in KL mutant tumors. Our data show the robust antitumor activity in a variety of anti-PD1 resistant tumors both in syngeneic and humanized mouse models. The efficacy was associated with the induction of an antitumor immune response. The cellular mechanism of <italic>NPRL2</italic> treatment or permanent restoration of <italic>NPRL2</italic> in tumors showed that the antitumor activity was dependent on the induction of antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DC) and activation of cytotoxic T cells. Altogether, our study shows a novel approach of <italic>NPRL2</italic> tumor suppressor gene therapy in sensitizing immunotherapy-resistant tumors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Restoration of <italic>NPRL2</italic> expression mediates inhibition of colony formation and induction of apoptosis in human NSCLC</title><p>The basal level of NPRL2 expression is markedly reduced in most NSCLC cells, as we previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ueda et al., 2006</xref>). We validated the baseline expression of NPRL2 in H1299, A549, H358, H1975, and H23 cell lines, which was found to be very low or undetectable.

This study presents a novel finding on NPRL2 gene therapy, which induces antitumor activity on aPD1-resistant tumors. Since KRAS/STK11 mutant tumors were reported to be less benefited from ICIs, this study has potential clinical application value.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This work uncovers the advantage of NPRL2 gene therapy by using humanized models and multiple cell lines. Moreover, via immune cell depletion studies, the mechanism of NPRL2 gene therapy has focused on dendritic cells and CD8+T cells.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>A major concern would be the lack of systematic, and logical rigor. This work did not present a link between apoptosis and antigen presenting induced by NPRL2 restoration. There is no evidence proving that the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway is related to antigen presenting, which is the major reason of NPRL2 induced antitumor response. Therefore, the two parts may not support each other logically.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id

clarified:</p><p>(1) In KRAS mutant cell lines with LKB1 co-mutations or deletions, such as A549 cells, does treatment with NPRL2 not increase the efficacy of immunotherapy?

The antitumor effect of NPRL2 combined with aPD1 immunotherapy was not significantly different from NPRL2 alone in immunotherapy-resistant models but was significantly greater than immunotherapy alone.

Is there any effect on FUS or MYC?</p></disp-quote><p>NPRL2 is a multifunctional tumor suppressor gene that is downregulated or absent in many cancers. NPRL2 has been shown to induce apoptosis, inhibit cell proliferation, and cause cell cycle arrest in various cancer types. Compelling evidence highlights the critical role of NPRL2 in causing DNA damage and double-strand breaks, which can trigger dendritic cell (DC) activation, antigen presentation, and priming of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Our data indicate that NPRL2 treatment is associated with the induction of DC activation and maturation.</p><p>The cellular mechanism of NPRL2 suggests that NPRL2-mediated antitumor immunity depends on the presence of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and macrophages. Interestingly, the expression of FUS1, another tumor suppressor gene, was mostly absent or severely downregulated in most non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) and was unaffected by NPRL2 treatment. While MYC expression was not assessed in this study, it remains an area of interest for future research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Is there any way to carry out a clinical study of systematically delivering NPRL2 in KRAS lung cancer patients?</p></disp-quote><p>In this preclinical study, a clinical-grade DOTAP-NPRL2 formulation was prepared, utilizing NPRL2 encapsulated within nanovesicles for delivery.

This study presents a novel finding on NPRL2 gene therapy, which induces antitumor activity on aPD1-resistant tumors. Since KRAS/STK11 mutant tumors were reported to be less benefited from ICIs, this study has potential clinical application value.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This work uncovers the advantage of NPRL2 gene therapy by using humanized models and multiple cell lines. Moreover, via immune cell depletion studies, the mechanism of NPRL2 gene therapy has focused on dendritic cells and CD8+T cells.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>A major concern would be the lack of systematic, and logical rigor. This work did not present a link between apoptosis and antigen presenting induced by NPRL2 restoration. There is no evidence proving that the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway is related to antigen presenting, which is the major reason of NPRL2 induced antitumor response. Therefore, the two parts may not support each other logically.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your review and comments. We agree that future studies are necessary to establish a direct link between apoptosis and antigen presentation induced by NPRL2 restoration, as well as NPRL2-mediated downregulation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling and its direct effect on antigen presentation. Although NPRL2 restoration directly induced apoptosis in several cell lines shown in Figure 1C and Figure 8Q and significantly increased the number of antigen-presenting DC cells in the tumor microenvironment upon NPRL2 treatment or NPRL2 restoration. Similarly, NPRL2 restoration downregulated the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which was associated with increased antitumor immunity.</p></body></sub-article></article>
