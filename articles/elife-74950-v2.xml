Neurons in the prelimbic (PL) cortex respond to both threat- and reward-associated cues. However, it remains unknown whether PL regulates threat-avoidance vs. reward-approaching responses when an animals’ decision depends on previously associated memories. Using a conflict model in which male Long–Evans rats retrieve memories of shock- and food-paired cues, we observed two distinct phenotypes during conflict: (1) rats that continued to press a lever for food (<italic>Pressers</italic>) and (2) rats that exhibited a complete suppression in food seeking (<italic>Non-pressers</italic>). Single-unit recordings revealed that increased risk-taking behavior in <italic>Pressers</italic> is associated with persistent food-cue responses in PL, and reduced spontaneous activity in PL glutamatergic (PL<sup>GLUT</sup>) neurons during conflict. Activating PL<sup>GLUT</sup> neurons in <italic>Pressers</italic> attenuated food-seeking responses in a neutral context, whereas inhibiting PL<sup>GLUT</sup> neurons in <italic>Non-pressers</italic> reduced defensive responses and increased food approaching during conflict. Our results establish a causal role for PL<sup>GLUT</sup> neurons in mediating individual variability in memory-based risky decision-making by regulating threat-avoidance vs. reward-approach behaviors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>motivation</kwd><kwd>prefrontal cortex</kwd><kwd>olfactory fear</kwd><kwd>memory</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00-MH105549</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Do Monte</surname><given-names>Fabricio H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-MH120136</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Do Monte</surname><given-names>Fabricio H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000874</institution-id><institution>Brain and Behavior Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NARSAD Young Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Do Monte</surname><given-names>Fabricio H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012615</institution-id><institution>University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Rising STARs Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Do Monte</surname><given-names>Fabricio H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A combination of electrophysiological and optogenetic approaches revealed a causal role for glutamatergic neurons in the prelimbic cortex in regulating individual differences in decision-making strategies during a threat-avoidance vs. reward-approach conflict paradigm in rats.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The brain’s ability to identify and discriminate cues associated with threat or reward allows organisms to respond appropriately to changes in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Schultz, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hu, 2016</xref>). Animals respond to threatening cues with a series of defensive behaviors including avoidance responses that decrease their chances of being exposed to aversive outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">McNaughton and Corr, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Krypotos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cain, 2019</xref>). In contrast, reward cues have attractive and motivational properties that elicit approach behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Robinson and Flagel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Morales and Berridge, 2020</xref>). When animals are exposed to threat and reward cues simultaneously, an approach–avoidance conflict emerges, and decision-making processes are recruited to resolve the situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kirlic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barker et al., 2019</xref>). While many studies have investigated the neural mechanisms that control threat-avoidance and reward-approach independently of each other, it is unclear how the brain uses previously learned information to regulate the opposing behavioral drives of avoiding threats and seeking rewards during a conflict situation.</p><p>Neurons in the prelimbic (PL) subregion of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) change their firing rates in response to cues that predict either threat or reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baeg et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Burgos-Robles et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Burgos-Robles et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Moorman and Aston-Jones, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dejean et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Otis et al., 2017</xref>). Accordingly, activity in PL neurons is necessary for the retrieval of both food- and threat-associated memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Sierra-Mercado et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Courtin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sangha et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Do-Monte et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Otis et al., 2017</xref>). PL neurons are reciprocally connected with the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">McDonald, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Vertes, 2004</xref>), a region implicated in the detection of threats or rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amir et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Namburi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beyeler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). During a risky foraging task in rats, dynamic modifications in the activity of PL and BLA neurons correlate with the detection of imminent threats and the defensive readiness for action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kyriazi et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, during a modified Pavlovian cue discrimination task involving footshocks as punishment, increased activity in the BLA–PL pathway is sufficient and necessary for the expression of freezing responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Burgos-Robles et al., 2017</xref>), a passive form of defensive behavior. Conversely, inhibitory signaling in PL neurons correlates with threat-avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Diehl et al., 2018</xref>), an active form of defensive behavior. While these studies suggest a potential role of PL during motivational conflict involving states of certainty (i.e., imminent threats), it is unknown whether changes in PL activity underlie the behavioral variability in approach–avoidance responses under states of uncertainty, when animal’s decision depends entirely on the retrieval of previously associated memories. It is also unclear whether PL activity is necessary to coordinate appropriate behavioral responses during conflict, and if so, which subtypes of PL neurons govern the competing demands of approaching rewards vs. avoiding potential threats.</p><p>To address these questions, we designed an approach–avoidance conflict test that assesses the ability of rats to remember cues previously associated with either food or footshocks to make a behavioral decision. Using a combination of optogenetics and single-unit recordings, we investigated rats’ individual variability in reward seeking and defensive responses during the conflict test and correlated their behaviors (e.g., freezing, avoidance, and risk-assessment) with the firing rate of photoidentified glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in PL. We then examined the role of PL neurons in risky decision-making by optogenetically manipulating PL activity with high temporal resolution and cell-type specificity during the conflict test.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Rats show individual variability in reward-seeking and defensive responses during the approach–avoidance conflict test</title><p>To investigate the motivational conflict between approaching rewards and avoiding potential threats, we established a behavioral model in which rats need to balance food seeking with conditioned defensive responses based on their memories of previously acquired cues. Food-restricted rats (18 g of chow per day) were initially placed in an operant box and trained to press a lever for sucrose in the presence of audiovisual cues that signaled the availability of food. Each lever press during the audiovisual cue presentation resulted in the delivery of a sucrose pellet into a nearby dish (see Methods for details). When rats reached 50% of discrimination during cued food seeking, they began lever pressing for sucrose preferentially during the audiovisual cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). During the habituation day, rats were placed in an odor arena and familiarized with the food cues and the neutral odor amyl acetate (see Methods for details). Next, to pair the odor cue with an aversive stimulus, rats were exposed to an olfactory threat conditioning training (day 1). Animals were placed in an operant box (conditioning box; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left) previously connected to an olfactometer and habituated to one odor presentation (amyl acetate, 30 s) without footshock, followed by five odor presentations of the same odor that coterminated with an electrical footshock (0.7 mA, 1-s duration, 270–390-s intertrial intervals, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, far-left). Food cues (30-s duration) were presented during the odor intervals to assess how threat conditioning alters lever-press responses. Rats showed robust defensive responses during the threat conditioning training, as evidenced by an increase in freezing (Shapiro–Wilk normality test, p &lt; 0.001, Friedman test, Friedman statistic = 84.08, p &lt; 0.001; Dunn’s post hoc, p &lt; 0.001) during the conditioned odor presentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), and a decrease in lever presses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, Shapiro–Wilk normality test, p &lt; 0.001, Friedman test, Friedman statistic = 35.11, p &lt; 0.001; Dunn’s post hoc, p &lt; 0.001) and an increase in the latency to press the lever (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, Shapiro–Wilk normality test, p &lt; 0.001, Friedman test, Friedman statistic = 29.45, p &lt; 0.001; Dunn’s post hoc, p &lt; 0.001) during the presentation of the food cues across trials. After rats have acquired the reward and threat associations, they were returned to the same odor arena in which they were previously habituated and exposed to a test session (day 2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right).

Introduction of the shock-paired odor during the odor phase reduced the percentage of time rats spent in the food area to ~15% (Shapiro–Wilk normality test, p &lt; 0.05, Friedman test, Friedman statistic = 32.19, p &lt; 0.001, Dunn’s post hoc, p &lt; 0.001) and increased defensive behaviors characterized by freezing (Shapiro–Wilk normality test, p &lt; 0.05, Friedman test, Friedman statistic = 40.46, p &lt; 0.001, Dunn’s post hoc, p &lt; 0.001), avoidance (Shapiro–Wilk normality test, p &lt; 0.05, Friedman test, Friedman statistic = 31.67, p &lt; 0.001, Dunn’s post hoc, p &lt; 0.001), and risk-assessment responses (Shapiro–Wilk normality test, p &lt; 0.05, Friedman test, Friedman statistic = 29.86, p &lt; 0.001, Dunn’s post hoc, p &lt; 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–H</xref>). These defensive behaviors were attenuated by the introduction of food cues during the conflict phase, as evidenced by a reduction in the percentage of time avoiding the conditioned odor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, Dunn’s post hoc, p = 0.0031) and an increase in the percentage of time approaching the food area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, Dunn’s post hoc, p &lt; 0.001). This indicates that the concomitant presentation of food cues and shock-paired odor induced a behavioral conflict in the animals. Interestingly, when we analyzed the percentage of rewarded presses during the conflict phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>), two behavioral phenotypes emerged: (1) rats that continued to press the lever for food in the presence of the threatening odor (<italic>Pressers</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>) and (2) rats that showed a complete suppression in lever presses in the presence of the threatening odor (<italic>Non-pressers</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). We then separated the animals into two different groups based on whether the animals pressed the lever or not during the conflict phase and compared their behaviors during the entire test session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K–R</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). <italic>Pressers</italic> and <italic>Non-pressers</italic> exhibited similar behavioral responses during the reward phase (all p’s &gt; 0.05, see , <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>).

These results indicate that both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in PL may contribute to the expression of distinct defensive responses during conflict.

Taken together, these results demonstrate that reduced activity in PL<sup>GLUT</sup> neurons during conflict situations decreases defensive responses and biases rats’ behavior toward food seeking.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Using a novel approach–avoidance conflict test, we identified two distinct behavioral phenotypes during the combined presentation of reward- and threat-paired cues: (1) rats that continued to press a lever for food (<italic>Pressers</italic>), and (2) rats that exhibited a complete suppression in food-seeking responses (<italic>Non-pressers</italic>). Single-unit recordings revealed that PL neurons regulate reward-approach vs. threat-avoidance responses during situations of uncertainty, when rats use previously associated memories to guide their decisions. We observed that increased risk-taking behavior in <italic>Pressers</italic> was associated with a larger number of food-cue responses in PL neurons, which showed sustained excitatory activity that persisted during the conflict phase, when compared to <italic>Non-pressers</italic>. In addition, PL<sup>GLUT</sup> neurons showed reduced spontaneous activity during risky reward seeking and photoactivation of these cells in a neutral context was sufficient to suppress lever-press responses. Accordingly, photoinhibition of PL<sup>GLUT</sup> neurons at the onset of the food cues in <italic>Non-pressers</italic> reduced defensive responses and increased food-approaching during the conflict phase, consistent with our observation that a small fraction of PL neurons changed their activity at the onset of freezing, avoidance, or risk-assessment responses. Altogether, these results suggest that under memory-based conflict situations, reduced or increased activity in PL<sup>GLUT</sup> neurons can favor the behavioral expression of food-approaching or threat-avoidance responses, respectively.</p><p>During our approach–avoidance conflict test, <italic>Pressers</italic> and <italic>Non-pressers</italic> showed similar levels of lever pressing before the conflict phase (e.g., cued food-seeking training, threat conditioning, and reward phases). This observation suggests that these two individual phenotypes most likely emerged during the test session and were independent of prior differences in sucrose preference or food-seeking motivation. Similarly, because both groups exhibited the same percentage of freezing to the shock-paired odor during the olfactory threat conditioning session, the increased defensive behaviors and the reduced food-seeking responses observed in <italic>Non-pressers</italic> during the test session were unlikely due to higher acquisition of conditioned threat responses. Furthermore, other internal factors such as shock sensitivity or pain tolerance cannot be accounted for the individual differences observed in our experiments because both groups reacted equally to the unconditioned stimulus (i.e., velocity measured as maximum speed after the footshocks) and, different from other conflict tasks using footshocks as a punishment during the conflict test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Geller, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Vogel et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Oberrauch et al., 2019</xref>), in our model rats were not exposed to footshocks during the conflict phase. Therefore, the most plausible interpretation for the behavioral differences observed in our task is that <italic>Pressers</italic> and <italic>Non-pressers</italic> have allocated distinct motivational significance to the food- or shock-paired cues during the test session.</p><p>Individual differences in risky decision-making have also been reported in other studies using rodent models of behavioral conflict involving footshock punishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Simon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bravo-Rivera et al., 2021</xref>), reversal learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bari et al., 2010</xref>), or variations in reward probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ainslie, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">St Onge and Floresco, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dellu-Hagedorn et al., 2018</xref>), although the neural mechanisms underlying such differences are less clear. Evidence indicates that some of the neurobiological bases of individual variation in stimulus–reward response depend on differences in dopamine levels in subcortical circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Tomie et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Flagel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Flagel et al., 2011</xref>), which are regulated by top-down mechanisms involving the mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ferenczi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Haight et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Serrano-Barroso et al., 2019</xref>). Accordingly, our neural correlate analyses of risk-taking vs. risk-avoiding behaviors in the PL subregion of the mPFC revealed some clear differences between the two phenotypes, suggesting that PL neurons participate in behavioral selection when rats’ decision depends on the conflicting memories of reward and threat. Both <italic>Pressers</italic> and <italic>Non-Presses</italic> showed a reduction in the number and magnitude of food-cue responses from reward to conflict phases, indicating that PL neurons can differentiate between situations involving motivational conflict and those that do not.</p><p>One intriguing finding in our study was the observation that <italic>Pressers</italic> showed a larger number of sustained excitatory food-cue responses during the conflict phase, when compared to <italic>Non-pressers</italic>. Because PL neurons are known for encoding the value of reward-predictive cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sharpe and Killcross, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Otis et al., 2017</xref>), the increase in the number and magnitude of food-cue responses observed in <italic>Pressers</italic> might result in a greater allocation of attention to reward cues, which would explain the persistent reward-seeking responses observed in this group during motivational conflict. In support of this interpretation, reward-paired cues can acquire motivational salience in some subjects and become sufficient to elicit reward-seeking responses in both rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Robinson and Flagel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Robinson et al., 2014</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Smith et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Jensen and Walter, 2014</xref>). Consistently, <italic>Pressers</italic> also showed a larger number of food-cue responses in PL before the conflict phase (i.e., reward phase), although the percentage of rewarded presses and the latency to press the lever during the reward phase were similar between the two groups.</p><p>Another possible interpretation for the differences in food-cue responses in <italic>Pressers</italic> and <italic>Non-pressers</italic> is the reduced excitatory food-cue responses in <italic>Non-pressers,</italic> which may be mediated by cue-evoked activity in inhibitory inputs to PL during the conflict phase. While the source of this inhibition is unclear, a potential candidate are GABAergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA<sup>GABA</sup>), which correspond to 35% of the cells in this region and send significant projections to PL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Nair-Roberts et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Breton et al., 2019</xref>). Previous studies have shown that VTA<sup>GABA</sup> neurons change their firing rates in response to reward-predicting cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>), and chemogenetic activation of these cells suppress the activity of local dopaminergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">van Zessen et al., 2012</xref>), reduces cue-evoked sucrose-seeking responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Wakabayashi et al., 2019</xref>), and induces conditioned place aversion in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Tan et al., 2012</xref>). Future studies need to determine whether this regulation of rewarding and aversive responses by VTA<sup>GABA</sup> neurons can also be attributed to their long-range inhibitory projections to PL neurons, particularly during conflict situations.</p><p>Differences in risk-taking and risk-avoiding behaviors were also reflected on LFP frequencies in PL neurons in the beginning of the test session, with <italic>Pressers</italic> and <italic>Non-pressers</italic> displaying increased power in the delta or theta bands, respectively. These findings are in corroboration with previous studies showing that increased delta power activity in the mPFC is associated with both reward seeking and preparatory attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Horst and Laubach, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Totah et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Emmons et al., 2016</xref>), whereas augmented theta power in the mPFC or synchronized theta activity between mPFC and BLA is correlated with the expression of avoidance responses or the consolidation of threat memories, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Popa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Padilla-Coreano et al., 2019</xref>). More specifically, increased synchrony between mPFC and BLA activity in the theta frequency range has been reported for animals that successfully differentiate between aversive and safe cues (or environments) during a differential threat conditioning task (or an open field arena) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Likhtik et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Stujenske et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, prior studies have shown that 4 Hz LFP oscillations in the mPFC and BLA were strongly synchronized during conditioned freezing episodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Courtin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dejean et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Karalis et al., 2016</xref>), and these sustained 4 Hz oscillations in the mPFC were independent of hippocampal low-theta oscillations, suggesting that they were internally generated in the mPFC during the expression of freezing behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Karalis et al., 2016</xref>). Consistent with these findings, in our study <italic>Non-pressers</italic> showed increased theta activity and marked 4 Hz oscillations in PL neurons, which were associated with better discrimination between reward and threat cues and increased freezing responses during the test session, when compared to <italic>Pressers</italic>.</p><p>Increased risk-taking behavior in <italic>Pressers</italic> was associated with a higher number of PL<sup>GLUT</sup> neurons showing reduced spontaneous activity during the conflict phase. In contrast, risk-avoiding responses in <italic>Non-pressers</italic> were associated with increased spontaneous activity during conflict. While this set of results suggest that distinct patterns of PL activity are associated with risk-taking or risk-avoiding behaviors in conflict situations, our optogenetic manipulation provided a causal role for PL<sup>GLUT</sup> neurons in the regulation of approach–avoidance conflict. For instance, the reduction in food-seeking responses during photoactivation of PL<sup>GLUT</sup> neurons indicates that increased activity in PL pyramidal cells is sufficient to recapitulate the reward-seeking suppression observed during conflict. Our findings agree with previous studies showing that increased activity in mPFC neurons, including PL, attenuates reward-seeking responses in a neutral context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berglind et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ferenczi et al., 2016</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Warthen et al., 2016</xref>), an effect that has been attributed, at least in part, to downstream projections to the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Otis et al., 2017</xref>). Notably, PVT neurons are necessary for the retrieval of both reward- and threat-associated memories (for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Do Monte et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Millan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">McGinty and Otis, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Penzo and Gao, 2021</xref>), and activity in PVT neurons has recently been shown to be associated with the regulation of approach–avoidance responses during situations of conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Choi and McNally, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Choi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Engelke et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting a potential target by which PL glutamatergic neurons may exert their effects.</p><p>Considering that <italic>Pressers</italic> showed a higher number of sustained excitatory food-cue responses than <italic>Non-pressers</italic>, it is counterintuitive that photoactivation of PL<sup>GLUT</sup> neurons during the food-cue onset resulted in reduced food-seeking responses. However, it is important to note that our optogenetic manipulation not only altered the activity of food-cue responsive neurons, but mostly the global activity of other PL<sup>GLUT</sup> neurons. Thus, it is possible that increased activity in the firing rate of PL<sup>GLUT</sup> neurons may result in reduced signal-to-noise ratio during the food-cue onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kroener et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">McGinley et al., 2015</xref>), and consequently decreased food-seeking responses. In contrast, we speculate that by reducing their spontaneous firing rates during conflict situations, PL<sup>GLUT</sup> neurons become more likely to fire in response to food cues due to an increase in the signal-to-noise ratio, thereby resulting in persistent reward-seeking responses during the conflict phase as we propose in our schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Schematic showing differences in food-cue responses and spontaneous firing rate of prelimbic (PL neurons in <italic>Pressers</italic> and <italic>Non-pressers</italic>).</title><p>Left, <italic>Pressers</italic> showed reduced spontaneous firing rate and increased food-cue responses in PL neurons during the conflict test, which may have resulted in higher signal-to-noise ratio and increased food-seeking responses.

The lack of effects on lever pressing indicates that other parallel brain regions may be modulating the suppression of operant lever-press responses during conflict. Alternatively, photoinhibition of PL<sup>GLUT</sup> neurons was not large enough to produce a more global effect on risky behavior (i.e., completely restore lever presses).

Adding to these findings, our recordings demonstrated that the activity of a small number of PL neurons changed immediately before or after the onset of freezing responses, with the same proportion of freezing-responsive cells being classified as PL<sup>GLUT</sup> or PL<sup>GABA</sup> neurons (~6–14%). At first sight, the lack of effects on freezing behavior following optogenetic activation of PL<sup>GLUT</sup> neurons seems at odds with our recordings. It also seems to disagree with previous studies showing that electrical stimulation or optogenetic induction of 4 Hz oscillations in PL increases conditioned freezing responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Vidal-Gonzalez et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Courtin et al., 2014</xref>) by synchronizing the neural activity between PL and BLA regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Karalis et al., 2016</xref>). However, one important difference between our study and others is that photoactivation of PL<sup>GLUT</sup> neurons in our experiments was performed in naive rats, in the absence of shock-paired cues. Thus, the increased freezing responses following PL activation reported in previous studies appear to be dependent on the preexistence of a conditioned threat memory.</p><p>Overall, our results outline the neural correlates of risk-taking and risk-avoiding behaviors in PL and reveal an important role for PL<sup>GLUT</sup> neurons in coordinating memory-based risky decision-making during conflict situations. Further studies will focus on identifying the PL downstream/upstream circuits that regulate reward-approaching and threat-avoidance responses, as well as the potential genetic and epigenetic factors that could contribute to the observed behavioral phenotypes. Elucidating the underlying mechanisms that mediate risk-taking vs. risk-avoiding responses during situations of uncertainty may help to provide understanding of response selection and adaptive behaviors, and may have clinical relevance to many psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aupperle and Paulus, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kirlic et al., 2017</xref>). Whereas persistent avoidance of presumed threats is the cardinal symptom of anxiety disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Treanor and Barry, 2017</xref>), seeking reward despite negative consequences is a hallmark of both eating and substance use disorders in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Volkow et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4"

The National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals were strictly followed to minimize any potential discomfort and suffering of the animals. Male Long–Evans hooded adult rats (Charles Rivers Laboratories) with 3–5 months of age and weighing 300–450 g at the time of the experiment were used. Rats were single housed and after a 3-day acclimation period handled and trained to press a lever for sucrose as described below. Animals were kept in a 12 hr light/12 hr dark cycle (light from 7:00 to 19:00) and maintained on a restricted diet of 18 g of standard laboratory rat chow provided daily at the end of experimentation. Animals were given ad libitum access to water. Animals’ weights were monitored weekly to ensure all animals maintained their weight under food restriction. During pre- and postsurgery phases, animals were given ad libitum access to food for a total of 7 days.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Surgeries</title><p>Rats were anesthetized with 5% isoflurane in an induction chamber. Animals were positioned in a stereotaxic frame (Kopf Instruments) and anesthesia was maintained with 2.5% isoflurane delivered through a facemask. A heating pad was positioned below the body of the animal and both temperature and respiration were monitored during the entire surgery. Veterinary lubricant ointment was applied on the eyes to avoid dryness during the surgery. Animals received a subcutaneous injection of the local anesthetic bupivacaine (0.25%, 0.3 ml) at the incision site. Iodine and ethanol (70%) were alternately applied for asepsis of the incision site. The surgery procedures varied according to the type of implantation/injection (see below). For injection-only surgeries, the incision was stitched after the injection by using surgical suture (Nylon, 3–0). For implantation surgeries, the implants were fixed to the skull using C&amp;B metabond (Parkell), ortho acrylic cement, and four to six anchoring screws. After surgery, animals received a subcutaneous injection of meloxicam (1 mg/kg) and a topical triple antibiotic was applied to the incision area.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Viral vector injection</title><p>Viral injections were performed using a microsyringe (SGE, 0.5 μl) with an injection rate of 0.04 μl/min plus an additional waiting time of 12 min to avoid backflow. The adeno-associated virus (AAV) was bilaterally injected at a volume of 0.4 μl per side. The AAV-CaMKIIα-eNpHR-eYFP vector was used to inhibit glutamatergic neurons, whereas AAV-mDlx-ChR2-mCherry or AAV-CaMKIIα-ChR2-eYFP vectors were used to activate either GABAergic or glutamatergic neurons, respectively. The use of mDlx or CaMKIIα promoters enabled transgene expression favoring either GABAergic or glutamatergic neurons, as previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Gradinaru et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Tye et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dimidschstein et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Sun et al., 2020</xref>) and was confirmed by our immunohistochemical and RNAscope assessment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The viral construct AAV-CaMKIIα-eYFP was used to control for any nonspecific effects of viral infection or laser heating. All plasmid or viral vectors were obtained from Addgene or University of North Carolina Viral Vector Core. For implantation of optrodes, the following coordinates from bregma were used for virus injection: PL, +2.7 mm AP, ±0.7 mm ML, −3.8 mm DV at a 0° angle. For PL soma illumination, an optical fiber (0.39 NA, 200 nm core, Inper) was implanted in each hemisphere targeting PL neurons using the following coordinates from bregma: +2.7 mm AP, ±1.5 mm ML, −4.0 mm DV at a 15° angle.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Single-unit electrodes</title><p>An array of 16 or 32 microwires was unilaterally implanted targeting the PL using the following coordinates from bregma: +2.7 mm AP, ±0.8 mm ML, −3.9 mm DV. Three different electrode configurations were used: (1) 32-channel silicon probes (Buzsaki32-CM32 or A1 × 32-5 mm-25-177-CM32, Neuro Nexus Technologies, USA), (2) Micro-Wire Arrays of 16 or 32 channels (Bio-Signal Technologies Ltd, USA); or (3) custom designed electrodes with 2 × 8 grid with 150 μm of space between wires, 200 μ of space between rows, with 35 μm diameter wires (Innovative Neurophysiology Inc, USA). For photoidentification of GABAergic or glutamatergic neurons, a Hermes 32 channels optrode array was used (200 nm core, Bio-Signal Technologies Ltd). Optrodes were unilaterally implanted at the same coordinates described above after the infusion of 0.6 μl of AAV-mDlx-ChR2-mCherry or AAV-CaMKIIα-ChR2-eYFP vectors. In all cases, the ground wire was wrapped around a grounding screw previously anchored into the skull. Two insulated metal hooks were implanted bilaterally into the cement to allow firmly attachment of the array connector to the cable during recording.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Odor preparation</title><p>A 99% amyl acetate solution (Sigma-Aldrich) was diluted in propylene glycol (Bluewater Chemgroup, Inc) to a 10% solution and presented to the rats during the different stages and phases of the olfactory threat conditioning test. A customized olfactometer (Med Associates) was used to control the flow of air into the animal’s chamber. Before being mixed with the 10% amyl acetate solution, the air was passed through a desiccant and a charcoal filter to remove any moisture and odors, and was finally rehydrated with distilled water before being delivered into the chamber through a thermoplastic PVC-based tube (Tygon) attached to an odor port located in the odor area.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Behavioral tasks</title><sec id="s4-6-1"><title>Lever-press training</title><p>Rats were placed in a plexiglass, standard operant box (34 cm high × 25 cm wide × 23 cm deep, Med Associates), and trained to press a lever for sucrose on a fixed ratio of one pellet for each press. Next, animals were trained in a variable interval schedule of reinforcement that was gradually reduced across the days (one pellet every 15, 30, or 60 s) until the animals reached a minimum criterion of 10 presses/min. All sessions lasted 30 min and were performed on consecutive days. Sucrose pellet delivery, variable intervals, and session duration were controlled by an automated system (ANY-maze, Stoelting). Lever-press training lasted approximately 1 week, after which animals were assigned to surgery or cued food-seeking training. A small number of rats failed to reach the lever press criteria and were excluded from the experiments (&lt;3%).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-2"><title>Cued food-seeking training</title><p>Rats previously trained to press a lever for sucrose were trained to learn that each lever press in the presence of an audiovisual cue (tone: 3 kHz, 75 dB; light: yellow, 2.8 W; 30-s duration) resulted in the delivery of a sucrose pellet into a nearby dish. Reward cue conditioning also took place in the standard operant boxes. While the light cue helps to direct the animals toward the lever during the beginning of the training phase, the tone assures that the animals will not miss the presentation during the trial and provides the temporal precision required for single-unit recordings. After ~4 consecutive days of training (24 trials per day, pseudorandom intertrial interval of ~120-s, 60-min session), rats learned to discriminate the food-associated cue as indicated by a significant increase in press rate during the presence of the audiovisual cues, when compared to the 30 s immediately before the cue onset (cue-off, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The cued food-seeking training was completed when animals reached 50% of discriminability index (presses during cue-on period minus presses during cue-off period divided by the total number of presses).</p><p>After the cued food-seeking training was completed, rats with single-unit electrodes were exposed to an additional training session in which the audiovisual cue ceased immediately after the animals pressed the lever and a single sucrose pellet was delivered into the dish. This extra training reduced the rat’s response to a single press and dish entry per cue, thereby enabling us to correlate each food-seeking event with the neuronal firing rate by avoiding overlapping between consecutive events (e.g., lever presses). The single-pellet training took place in the same plexiglass rectangular arena subsequently used for the odor test (40 cm high × 60 cm wide × 26 cm deep, Med Associates, see schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right). The arena consisted of a hidden area (40 cm high × 20 cm wide × 26 cm deep) separated from an open area by a plexiglass division. An 8-cm slot located in the center of the division enabled the animal to transition between both sides of the arena. For behavioral quantification, the open area was subdivided into a center area and a food area (40 cm high × 12 cm wide × 26 cm deep), the latter containing a lever, a dish, and an external feeder similar to the food-seeking operant box.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-3"><title>Habituation day</title><p>Animals were placed in the odor arena and exposed to 12 audiovisual cues (30-s duration, pseudorandom intertrial intervals of between 25 and 40 s) followed by 10 min of presentation to the neutral odor alone (10% amyl acetate) and an additional 12 audiovisual cues similar to the first cues but in the presence of the neutral odor delivered in the food area of the arena. Each lever press in the presence of the audiovisual cue resulted in the delivery of a sucrose pellet into the dish, and the audiovisual cue ceased immediately after the animal pressed the lever.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-4"><title>Threat conditioning day</title><p>One day after the habituation day, rats were placed in a plexiglass, standard operant box similar to the cued food-seeking training box, but with the grid floor previously attached to a shock generator system. Rats were habituated to one nonreinforced odor presentation (10% amyl acetate, 30-s duration) followed by five odor presentations that coterminated with a foot shock (0.7 mA, 1-s duration, 258–318-s intertrial intervals). An olfactometer system was used to deliver the odor into the box (see Odor preparation session), whereas an exhaustor system was used to remove it during the intertrial intervals. Between each odor presentation, audiovisual cues (30-s duration) signaling the availability of sucrose were presented to the animals. Each lever press during the audiovisual cues resulted in the delivery of a sucrose pellet into the dish. Shock grids and floor trays were cleaned with 70% ethanol between each rat. No rats were excluded from the analyses due to distinct levels of freezing following the threat conditioning session.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-5"><title>Test day</title><p>One day after the threat conditioning session, rats were returned to the same arena used during the habituation and exposed to the exact same protocol. The first phase of the test session was called <italic>reward phase</italic> (12 min) and the animals were exposed to 12 food cues. The second phase was called <italic>odor phase</italic> and the animals were exposed to 10 min of conditioned odor (10% amyl acetate) alone. The last phase was called <italic>conflict phase</italic> (12 min) and the animals were exposed to 12 food cues in the presence of the conditioned odor. An odor dispersion sensor (200B miniPID, Aurora Scientific) revealed that the odor took approximately 2.21 ± 0.28 s to reach detectable concentrations (56 particles per billion; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Punter, 1983</xref>) in the arena after the olfactometer onset, and approximately 19.59 ± 0.97 s to be completely removed from the arena after the olfactometer offset and concomitant activation of the exhaustor fan. Due to the low temporal resolution to control the delivery of the odor in the arena, the odor was maintained constant during the entire duration of the odor and conflict phases. In order to press the lever for sucrose during the conflict phase, rats had to approach the conditioned odor presented in the food area. After the end of the conflict phase, the odor was extracted from the arena with the exhaustor fan and the floor and walls of the arena were cleaned thoroughly with 70% ethanol solution.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-6"><title>Behavioral tracking</title><p>Both the standard operant boxes and the testing arenas were equipped with video cameras and a behavior tracking software (ANY-maze, Stoelting) which were used to record the animal’s behavior and control the delivery of sucrose, foot shock, tone, light, and odor in the apparatuses. Avoidance responses were characterized by the time spent in the hidden area of the arena. Freezing responses were characterized by the complete absence of movements except those needed for respiration. Risk-assessment responses were characterized by a body stretching movement to peep out toward the food area while in the hidden area and were used as a measure of risk-assessment behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blanchard et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>For single-unit recording analyses, the detection of freezing, avoidance, and risk assessment behaviors were performed using the open source tool DeepLabCut, a machine learning software that tracks complex patterns of behavior from videos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mathis et al., 2018</xref>). After a video has been analyzed, the data were saved to a.csv file that contained the <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> location of each rat’s body part in pixels, as well as the analysis of the expected accuracy (i.e., likelihood) of the tracked positions across time. After DeepLabCut has calculated the positions and the likelihood, we used three different Python codes to identify each one of the three behaviors. For freezing behavior, the code used DeepLabCut’s position data and determined if the rat was still for more than 500 ms. The animal was considered to be still if the position in question was within 1.05 pixels of each other. For avoidance behavior, the code used DeepLabCut’s position data to determine the location of the rat in the arena and based on the center of its head to identify when the animals entered the hidden area of the arena. Finally, for risk assessment behavior, the code used DeepLabCut’s position data to identify the nose, ears, center of the head, and spine to determine whether the rat was located in the hidden area of the arena with its body stretched and the head looking through the open division of the apparatus. Each of these codes generated a.xlsx file that contained the onset and the total duration of each behavioral episode (see Single-unit analyses for more details).</p><sec id="s4-6-6-1"><title>Optogenetic stimulation during behavior</title><p>Bilateral optical cables (200 μm core, 0.37 NA, 2.5 mm ceramic ferrule, Inper) were connected to a blue laser (diode-pumped solid-state, 473 nm, 150 mW output, OptoEngine) or a yellow laser (diode-pumped solid-state, 593.5 nm, 300 mW output, OptoEngine) by using a patch cord (200 μm, 0.39 NA, FC/PC connector, Inper) through a dual rotary joint (200 μm core, Doric lenses). During the stimulation, the optical cables were coupled to the previously implanted optical fibers by using a ceramic sleeve (2.5 mm, Precision Fiber Products). An optogenetic interface (Ami-2, Stoelting) and an electrical stimulator (Master 9, A.M.P. Instruments) were used to control the onset of the laser, pulse width, train duration, and frequency. The power density estimated at the tip of the optical fiber was 7–10 mW for illumination of PL somata (PM-100D, Power Energy Meter, Thor Labs).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-6-2"><title>Single-unit recording</title><p>A 64-channel neuronal data acquisition system (Omniplex, Plexon) integrated with a high-resolution video-tracking system (Cineplex, Plexon) was used for electrophysiological recordings from freely behaving animals. Both videos and neuronal recordings were combined within the same file, thereby facilitating the correlation of behavior with neuronal activity. An electrical isolation, Faraday cage was made and connected to the grounding port of the data acquisition system. The system was connected to the head-mounted electrode/optrode by using a digital headstage cable (32 channels, Plexon), a motorized carrousel commutator (Plexon), and a digital headstage processor (Plexon). Rats were habituated to the headstage cable daily for approximately 1 week before the beginning of the experiments. Extracellular waveforms exceeding a voltage threshold were band-pass filtered (500–5000 Hz), digitized at 40 kHz, and stored onto disk. Automated processing was performed using a valley-seeking scan algorithm and then visually evaluated using sort quality metrics (Offline Sorter, Plexon, see Single-unit analyses).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-6-3"><title>Photoidentification of PL neurons during recordings</title><p>During neuronal photoidentification, we recorded from rats expressing channelrhodopsin (ChR2) in PL neurons previously implanted with an optrode in the same region. An optical cable connected to a blue laser was attached to the headstage cable and coupled to the previously implanted optical fiber by using a ceramic sleeve. At the end of the behavioral session, 10 trains of 10-s blue laser pulses (5 ms pulse width, 5 Hz) were delivered by a Master-9 programmable pulse stimulator, which also sent flags to the data acquisition system to mark the time of the laser events.</p><p>Neurons were considered to be responsive to photoactivation if they showed a significant increase in firing rate above baseline (20 ms, <italic>Z</italic>-score &gt;3.29, p &lt; 0.001) and higher reliability within the 6 ms after laser, similar to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lima et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Pi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Burgos-Robles et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Engelke et al., 2021</xref>). To identify the threshold separation for the frequency distribution of response latencies to laser illumination, we implemented the triangle method detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Zack et al., 1977</xref>). This calculation is particularly effective for left-skewed distributions as in our sample. We considered bins with response latency values from 0 to 12 ms and excluded those with larger values as they would most likely reflect indirect stimulation via collateral activity. We computed the distance normal to the line along with the minimum and maximum values in the histogram. The threshold was defined as the maximum distance between the histogram and the line (i.e. a normalized level within 0 and 1), which in our analysis resulted in 5.8 ms (rounded to 6 ms bin). In addition, to measure the reliability of neural responses to photoactivation, we calculated the Fano factor (FF), defined as the variance-to-mean ratio of spike counts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Churchland et al., 2011</xref>), to characterize the variability of neuronal responses 6 ms before (FF before) and 6 ms after (FF after) the laser pulses for each train of illumination (10 trains of 50 laser pulses, 200-ms pulse interval). When the variance in the counts equals the mean count, FF was equal to 1. Afterwards, we computed the ‘overall FF ratio’ between the ‘FF after’ divided by the ‘FF before’ to compute the reliability of each cell to the laser onsets. Only neurons showing an overall FF higher than 1, which indicates reliable responses to laser illumination compared to baseline, were included as photoidentified cells.</p><p>A small number of laser-generated photoelectric artifacts (~10% of the channels in less than 10% of the rats) were observed during the photoactivation. However, they were easily distinguished from the action potentials by their descending voltage signals of high amplitude, pulse shapes distinct from the regular waveforms, isolated spatial distribution in the PCAs, and occurrence restricted to the period of laser activation, which resulted in lack of activity during the behavioral session.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-6-4"><title>Optogenetic manipulation of PL neurons during behavior</title><p>During the cued food-seeking test, rats expressing ChR2 or eNpHR in PL were bilaterally illuminated in the same region by using a blue (5-ms pulse width, 5 Hz for CaMKIIα or 20 Hz for mDlx) or a yellow laser (constant illumination), respectively. The laser was activated at cue onset and persisted throughout the entire 30 s of the audiovisual cue presentation. Rats were exposed to two consecutive cues with laser off followed by 2 consecutive cues with laser on in a total of 12 cues (pseudorandom intertrial intervals of between 25 and 40 s). To assess the effects of PL illumination on rat’s defensive behavior, PL neurons of rats expressing ChR2 or eNpHR were bilaterally illuminated during six distinct epochs of 30 s during the <italic>odor phase</italic> by using a blue (5-ms pulse width, 20 Hz) or a yellow laser (constant illumination), respectively. To assess the effects of PL illumination on food-seeking responses during the conflict phase, rats were exposed to two consecutive cues with laser off followed by 2 consecutive cues with laser on in a total of 12 cues (pseudorandom intertrial intervals of between 25 and 40 s). The laser was activated at cue onset and persisted on until the animal pressed the bar or the 30 s of the audiovisual cue was completed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-6-5"><title>Histology</title><p>Animals were transcardially perfused with KPBS followed by 10% buffered formalin. Brains were processed for histology as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Do-Monte et al., 2013</xref>). At the end of the recording sessions, a microlesion was made by passing anodal current (0.3 mA for 15 s) through the active wires to deposit iron in the tissue. After perfusion, brains were extracted from the skull and stored in a 30% sucrose/ 6% ferrocyanide solution to stain the iron deposits. Only rats with the presence of eYFP or mCherry labeling and the track of the electrode wires or optical fiber tips located exclusively in PL were included in the statistical analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-6-6"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Rats previously infused with AAV-mDlx-ChR2-mCherry or AAV-CaMKIIα-ChR2-eYFP were transcardially perfused with 300 ml of KPBS followed by 500 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were removed from the skull, transferred to a 20% sucrose solution in KPBS for 24 h, and stored in a 30% sucrose solution in KPBS for another 24 hr. Next, coronal PL sections (40 μm thick) were cut in a cryostat (CM 1860, Leica), blocked in 20% normal goat serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 in KPBS at room temperature for 1 hr. For identification of GABAergic neurons, PL sections were incubated with anti-GAD67 serum raised in mouse (1:400; Millipore-Sigma) at 4°C for 48 hr. After sections were washed in KPBS for five times, sections were incubated with a secondary anti-mouse antibody (1:200, Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 594, Abcam) for 2 hr. Sections were washed with KPBS, mounted in Superfrost Plus slides, and coverslipped with antifading mounting medium (Vectashield, Vectorlabs). Images were generated by using a microscope (Nikon, Eclipse NiE Fully Motorized Upright Microscope) equipped with a fluorescent lamp (X-Cite, 120 LED) and a digital camera (Andor Zyla 4.2 PLUS sCMOS).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-6-7"><title>In situ hybridization</title><p>Single molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Detection Kit v2, Advanced Cell Diagnostics) was used following the manufacturer protocol for fixed-frozen brains sample. Brain samples were sectioned at a thickness of 20 μm in a cryostat (CM1860, Leica). Sections were collected onto superfrost plus slides (Fisher Scientific) and transferred to a −80°C freezer. To prepare for the assay, brain sections were serially dehydrated with EtOH (50%, 75%, and 100%, each for 5 min) and then incubated in hydrogen peroxide for 10 min. Target retrieval was performed with RNAscope target retrieval reagents at 99°C for 5 min. The sections were then pretreated with Protease III (RNAScope) for 40 min at 40°C. RNAscope probes (Advanced Cell Diagnostics) for mCherry (Cat No. 431201-C3) and vGAT (Cat No. 424541) were hybridized at 40°C for 2 hr, serially amplified, and revealed with horseradish peroxidase, Opal Dye/TSA Plus fluorophore (Akoya Biosciences), and horseradish peroxidase blocker. Sections were coverslipped with antifading mounting medium with DAPI (Vectashield, Vectorlabs) and kept in the refrigerator. Images were generated by using an epifluorescent microscope (Nikon, Eclipse NiE Fully Motorized Upright Microscope) equipped with a fluorescent lamp (X-Cite, 120 LED) and a digital camera (Andor Zyla 4.2 PLUS sCMOS). Expression of mCherry mRNA (red, Opal 620) and GAD67 mRNA (green, Opal 520) was determined by using an automated fluorescent threshold detector (NIS-Elements). Colabeled cells were manually counted by an experimenter by measuring either the percentage of mCherry-positive neurons in PL that were also labeled with GAD67, or the percentage of GAD67-positive neurons in PL that were also labeled with mCherry.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Data analyses</title><sec id="s4-7-1"><title>Behavioral quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>Rats were recorded with digital video cameras (Logitech C920) and behavioral responses were measured by using an automated video-tracking system (ANY-maze) or machine learning (DeepLabCut). Presses per minute were calculated by measuring the number of presses during the 30 s cue multiplied by two. All graphics and numerical values reported in the figures are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean. Given that the different phases of the test have different duration, we have normalized the data in percentage to be able to compare the behavior of the animals across the different phases of the test. Shapiro–Wilk normality test was performed before all the statistical analyses to determine parametrical or nonparametrical statistical tests, and reported in Results when the values showed nonnormal distribution. For normal data, statistical significance was determined with paired Student’s <italic>t-</italic>test, Welch’s <italic>t</italic>-test, repeated measures ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc comparisons (Prism 7), and <italic>Z</italic>-test or Fisher Exact Test, as indicated in Results, figure legends, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>. For nonparametric data, Wilcoxon test (paired groups) or Mann–Whitney test (unpaired groups) w performed. Effects sizes for pairwise comparisons or ANOVA were calculated by using Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> or partial eta squared, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cohen, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Richardson, 2011</xref>). Effect sizes &lt;0.2 were considered small, effects sizes between 0.2 and 0.8 were considered medium, and effect sizes &gt; 0.8 were considered large (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cohen, 1988</xref>). Sample size (<italic>n</italic>) was based on estimations by power analysis with a level of significance of 0.05 and an expected effect size of 0.8.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-2"><title>PCAs on behaviors</title><p>The PCA method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Jolliffe, 2002</xref>) was implemented to further understand the relationships between approaching, avoidance, freezing, and latency to press during the conflict phase for both <italic>Pressers</italic> and <italic>Non-pressers</italic>. This method was used to reduce the dimensionality of our multivariate data while preserving as much of the relevant information as possible. Briefly, we performed a linear transformation of the data to a new coordinate system such that the new set of variables, the principal components, were linear functions of the original variables. These variables were also uncorrelated, and the greatest variance by any projection of the data came to lie on the first coordinate, the second greatest variance on the second coordinate, and so on. Afterwards, we analyzed the explained variance (%) of the first two PCs (i.e., PC1 and PC2) together with the relevance of each analyzed behavior to define which variables better explained the differences between <italic>Pressers</italic> and <italic>Non-pressers</italic> (see Results for additional details).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-3"><title>Single-unit analyses</title><p>Single units were selected based on three principal components and waveform features such as valley-to-peak and amplitude measurements. The principal component scores for unsorted waveforms were computed and plotted in a three (or two)-dimensional principal component space. Clusters containing similar valid waveforms were manually defined. After manually clustering similar valid waveforms, a group of spikes were considered from a single neuron if the waveforms formed a discrete, isolated, cluster in the principal component space. A Commercial software (NeuroExplorer, NEXT Technologies) combined with Matlab (MathWorks) scripts, and Python scripting were implemented to calculate the spontaneous firing rate, changes in neural activity in response to food cues, lever presses, food dish entries, as well as the neural correlates of freezing, avoidance, and risk-assessment behaviors. The spontaneous firing rate was calculated by comparing the frequency of spike trains during the last 30 s of the food-seeking phase, odor phase, or conflict phase against the 30 s prior to the beginning of each session. Food cue, lever press, and food dish responses were calculated by implementing Matlab scripts as <italic>Z</italic>-scores normalized to 20 precue bins of 300 ms. Neurons showing a <italic>Z</italic>-score &gt;2.58 (p &lt; 0.01) during the first two bins following the onset of the aligned event were classified as excitatory responses, whereas neurons showing a <italic>Z</italic>-score &lt;−1.96 (p &lt; 0.05) during the same first two bins were classified as inhibitory responses. A temporal frequency separation was used to classify the food-cue responses according to the pattern of activity, similar to a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bezdudnaya et al., 2006</xref>). Neurons showing a transient increase in firing rate (&lt;600-ms duration) were classified as transient activity, whereas neurons showing a sustained increase in firing rate (≥900-ms duration) were classified as sustained activity (<italic>Z</italic>-score &gt;2.58 during the first 3 s after food-cue onset).</p><p>To analyze freezing, avoidance, and risk-assessment responses, the time onsets for each behavior were filtered by selecting only the events that lasted more than 1 s and were not preceded by the same behavior during the previous 6 s (baseline). The final list of time onsets was entered into the single-unit recording files to create the events and temporally align them with the neuronal recordings. To increase the number of events during our analyses, we combined the behavioral responses emitted during the odor and conflict phases. Only animals exhibiting at least six events for each behavior were included. We used an interval criterium of 600 ms to select the neurons that responded close in time to the onset of the analyzed behavior (before or after), thereby avoiding potential neural activity contamination caused by other types of behavioral responses.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology, Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All experimental procedures were approved by the Center for Laboratory Animal Medicine and Care of The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston.

It uses a variety of cutting-edge tools to dissect the microcircuits of the prefrontal cortex. This report is novel, timely, and important.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;Neural correlates and determinants of approach-avoidance conflict in the prelimbic prefrontal cortex&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Shelly B Flagel (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>After consultation between the editors and the reviewers, we have decided that this work, in its present form, will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>. During the review process a number of concerns were raised (see appended reviews for details) regarding the statistics, the lack of direct comparisons between the Pressers and Non-Pressers, the behavioural designs and the conclusions regarding the neural findings.

The task consisted of lever press during an audio-visual compound in the presence of an aversively conditioned odour. The behavioural data indicated that two cohort of animals were generated – pressers and non-pressers. Pressers continued to press the lever (reward-seek) in the presence of the aversively conditioned odour (albeit to a lesser degree) whereas the non-pressers ceased pressing. Single unit recordings revealed a reduction in the number of food-cue responsive neurons under conflict (compared to no conflict). Different subsets of PL neurons were shown to signal freezing, avoidance and risk-assessment during conflict. The data show reduced spontaneous activity in PL glutamatergic neurons when animals lever press under conflict. Activation of these neurons using ChR2 under the control of the CaMKII promotor attenuated food-seeking behaviour in a neutral context in pressers. Inhibiting the same neurons in non-pressers reduced defensive behaviours often seen to cues conditioned with shock and increased food-based conditioned behaviours.</p><p>The strengths of the paper are numerous and include the novel behavioural design that pits reward up against aversion. Examining the distinct conflict phenotypes throughout the paper was also excellent. The integration of single-cell recordings, LFPs, and optogenetics were considerable strengths allowing to dissect the glutamatergic vs GABAergic microcircuits in the PL during this behaviour. The discussion of the results in the context of the existing literature was excellent.</p><p>Despite the clear strengths of the paper, some weaknesses exist. A closer examination of the single units is warranted. The claim that putative classification of PL neurons into glutamatergic and GABAergic based on waveform and spike timing given the optotagging results seems premature. The optotagging analysis needs additional data including an eYFP control to show what, if any, effect light stimulation alone has on neural responses. Some consideration of whether the two behavioural phenotypes are due to differences under conflict or due to perception is also needed.</p><p>Additional neural analyses are necessary to understand what the PL neurons are doing:</p><p>1) For example in Figure 2 panels E, G, H,O, Q, R – the signal seems to be present at food cue onset but it is the sustained portion of that signal that is different between the pressers and non-pressers.</p><p>2) Some single unit analyses are needed here that better capture the individual profile of neurons. The current population based analyses are not sufficient to understand if there is any heterogeneity in the neural firing. For example the heatplots suggest that some neurons show the sustained firing but others do not. It may be important to pull those out as they may be doing different things across the different patterns of stimulation (reward cues only, odour, conflict).</p><p>3) A statistical analysis of whether these proportions can be obtained by chance is needed.</p><p>Optotagging studies require additional investigation to justify the strong claims:</p><p>1) I wasn't convinced by the claim that the optotagging proves that waveform and spike timing analyses are inappropriate.

A cluster analysis of the optotagged cells and their responses may help to see how responses are distributed in time as well as a response reliability analysis (as per Lima et al., 2009). This may need to be coupled with pharmacology showing which signals are synaptic and which directly induced by the light.</p><p>3) The optotagging studies did not include an eYFP control and to ensure that there are no light artifacts (which I have seen). This control is needed.</p><p>4) It is unclear why stimulation with ChR2 using the Dlx promotor does not lead to excitation of GABAergic neurons. This requires clarification.</p><p>The reward-cues were trained as discriminant in an operant and this is different to the Pavlovian associations in the aversive conditioning. To what extent do the neural response reflect this distinction and do the authors expect that a similar neural profile would be seen if the reward cues were trained in a Pavlovian procedure?</p><p>To what extent could the distinct of the pressers vs non-pressers be due to individual differences in the relative salience of the odour vs audio-visual cues rather conflict?</p><p>The data in Figure 7 suggest that only two/three rats were tested in some conditions (e.g., panels O, P). If this is the case then the study is underpowered and more data need to be collected, if that is because the points overlap, then the authors should represent the circle as adjacent so that the reader and see the n clearly from the figure.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript includes a series of studies to assess the role of prelimbic neurons in mediating behavior during an approach-avoidance conflict task. The authors used a novel task to assess the ability of rats to remember cues previously associated with either reward (food) or threat (footshocks) to make a behavioral decision. In doing so, they uncovered two behavioral phenotypes: &quot;Pressers&quot;, who continued to press a lever for food during conflict; and &quot;Non-Pressers&quot;, who exhibited a suppression of food-seeking behavior in face of conflict. A combination of optogenetics and single-unit recordings were used to assess the neural mechanisms underlying this individual variability in reward-seeking behavior during conflict. The authors report that increased risk-taking behavior in &quot;Pressers&quot; is associated with reward-cue-elicited responses in the prelimbic cortex and reduced spontaneous activity in prelimbic glutamatergic neurons during conflict. Further, activation of prelimbic glutamatergic, but not GABAergic, neurons attenuated reward-seeking responses selectively in &quot;Pressers&quot;; and inhibition of prelimbic glutamatergic neurons increased reward-approach behavior and decreased freezing behavior during conflict in &quot;Non-Pressers&quot;.</p><p>These experiments were well-designed, the methods were appropriate to address the questions at hand, and the manuscript is well-written. The ethologically-relevant approach-avoidance task is novel and will be of interest to the field. In particular, the ability to capture distinct behavioral phenotypes and individual differences using this test will allow further investigation of the neural determinants of reward-seeking and threat-avoiding behavior during conflict.</p><p>As currently presented, there are some concerns regarding the statistical analyses and whether they support all of the authors' claims. As the individual differences component of the manuscript is particularly novel and of interest, it is a bit concerning that these analyses include a sample size of 25 &quot;Pressers&quot; and 7 &quot;Non-Pressers&quot;. In relation, it is not clear that the neural responses of these two behavioral phenotypes were ever directly compared. For example, in Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 2, the area under the curve for neural responses during reward and conflict are presented independently for the two phenotypes and direct comparisons to assess group differences and/or interactions are not apparent. Similarly, it is not clear why data only from &quot;Non-Pressers&quot; is shown in Figure 7, as the methods suggest that both &quot;Pressers&quot; and &quot;Non-Pressers&quot; were used for this experiment. Further, in general, it is difficult to deduce which statistical analyses support the claims made in the manuscript text, as the analyses are only presented in the Figure legends and in Source data 1 and don't always seem congruent.</p><p>The two behavioral phenotypes that are reported are novel and of great potential interest, thereby warranting more detailed analyses and description. For one, the characterization of the behavioral phenotypes is not described in detail in the methods or data analyses. Was this based only on the percentage of rewarded presses during the conflict phase? What it a median split based on this value? Is the distribution of &quot;Pressers&quot; and &quot;Non-Pressers&quot; consistent across experiments, as it seems to be skewed towards &quot;Pressers&quot; in the current data set. In addition, while these phenotypes that emerge during conflict do appear to be independent of other behavior in the current study, additional analyses, like principal components analysis, would help support this claim by showing whether there is a relationship (e.g. clustering or reduction of variables) between certain behavioral responses and whether this relationship differs between the phenotypes. That is, such an analysis would allow one to better determine if this behavioral outcome measure is indeed independent of others.</p><p>Given the skewed sample sizes, it would be good to include effect sizes to further support the claims made based on these data.</p><p>It is quite difficult to determine which statistical effects are being reported in the Figure Legends and how they correspond to those presented in Supplementary Source data 1 and the claims made in the text. It would be beneficial to put supporting statistics following claims made in the primary text.</p><p>In relation to the point above, justification is needed for the Wilcoxon Test. While it seems to be appropriate for some datasets, for others it is questionable. For example, for the data presented in Figure 7, it would be important to report interactions between control and eNpHR groups for laser on vs. laser off conditions.</p><p>What is the justification for showing almost all behavioral data as percentages rather than raw values of time or other metrics?</p><p>Figure 5 legend, panel O – Fisher's exact test for the Reward Phase seems to be lacking.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Fernandez-Leon et al. investigate the role of the pre-limbic area (PL) in regulating approach avoidance behavior in situations of learned motivational conflict where animals experience both cues that predict an aversive outcome as well as cues that signal the availability of food. This region has been implicated in threat responding and food seeking separately but has not previously been examined in situations of conflict. The authors employ an individual differences approach, subdividing animals based on their food seeking behavior in the presence of conflicting cues that signal food availability and footshock and use a combination of in vivo recordings and optogenetic manipulations to identify a role for specific cell types in the PL in regulating risky behaviors in aversive contexts. This manuscript adds to the growing literature on neural mechanisms of processing approach-avoidance conflict.</p><p>This work has many strengths. Examining approach and avoidance in a conflict paradigm, rather than separately, provides a more ethological study of the neural basis of these behaviors as, beyond the confines of a laboratory, action selection commonly occurs in the face of multiple competing cues. Subdividing animals into 'pressers' and 'non-pressers' based on individual differences in engagement in food seeking behavior is an excellent strategy to gain insight into the behavioral function of these cells. Recognizing that not engaging in food seeking does not necessarily reflect failure to complete the task but rather a bias toward avoidance behavior is insightful and important. The authors suggest a number of interesting and potentially important differences in PL neural activity between pressers and non-pressers. For example, pressers (i.e. rats that continue to seek food in the presence of an aversive cue) have both more food-cue responsive neurons and greater magnitude of excitatory and inhibitory responses to food-cues, a difference that is sustained when food-cues are presented in the presence of an aversive cue. Pressers and non-pressers also had marked differences in oscillatory frequency, an intriguing finding that warrants further investigation. Optogenetic experiments nicely establish causality with precise temporal resolution.</p><p>The design of the behavioral paradigm somewhat limits the ability the ability to draw certain conclusions. During testing, food-cues were presented discretely while the shock-cue was constant preventing direct comparison of responding to appetitive and aversive cues that would have been highly interesting. Furthermore, during the test session, reward cues are always presented first followed by the addition of the shock-cue. This, and the extended shock-cue presentation under extinction conditions makes it difficult to entirely rule out alternative interpretations for differences between pressers and non-pressers, for example, more rapid extinction of fear memory in pressers than non-pressers. Beyond this, the lack of direct statistical comparison of neural activity in pressers and non-pressers undermines the strength of the central conclusions of this paper.</p><p>The authors hypothesize that stimulating glutamatergic PL neurons decreases signal to noise ratio between cells that are active during food seeking and those that are not, thus resulting in a decrease in food-seeking. This is interesting and plausible proposal to be further explored in future research.</p><p>I have a number of concerns about the behavioral paradigm. Although both food and shock cues were presented as discrete 30s cues during conditioning, in the test phase, the shock associated cue was presented as a constant cue, first alone for 10 minutes and then with discrete 30s food associated cues overlayed. No rationale is provided for this specific design. I struggle to think of benefits for such a design compared to all discrete cue presentations, and see clear disadvantages. For example, it is not possible to compare responding to food and shock cues and the sustained exposure to the shock cue may result in extinction. Further, the cues are in different modalities and not counterbalanced across animals: the food cue is always a tone &amp; light and the shock cue is always odor. The manuscript also does not provide definitive behavioral evidence to show learning of the shock-odor association. Although for food-seeking discrimination between cue on and cue off periods is shown, the same is not shown for fear conditioning. In the absence of an unconditioned stimulus (CS-), it would be good to at least show discrimination from the pre-cue period (or an equivalent time where there is no food seeking or shock cue present) when comparing pressers and non-pressers in order to confirm that freezing and defensive behaviors are specific to learned odor association and not a generalized fear response. This is especially important given that lever pressing during food cues during the threat conditioning day is suppressed, indicating that the animals show a generalized increase in freezing.</p><p>Given the sustained exposure to the shock cue under extinction conditions during test, a potential interpretation of the difference between pressers and non-pressers is that pressers may extinguish faster than non-pressers leading to behavioral differences in the odor phase. Enhanced extinction could reflect differences in underlying learning that are occluded on the conditioning day by high levels of freezing or an alteration in the mechanisms of extinction. It is notable that pressers and non-pressers do show differences in freezing on the test day. It would be good to look at freezing and pressing cue by cue as is done in Supplemental Figure 1C for the threat conditioning.</p><p>Wherever neural activity is compared between pressers and non-pressers, statistical testing should be conducted and reported. For example, the section starting on line 183 includes many statements comparing pressers and non-pressers with no statistical analysis to support this and Figure 1 only presents analyses within each group. If the authors wish to directly compare pressers and non-pressers, a more appropriate analysis (e.g. a two-way ANOVA) should be used.</p><p>Can the authors explain why they chose to stimulate PGLUT neurons in shock naïve animals? The paper is looking to show the involvement of these cells in approach avoidance in situations of conflict, but this design simply assesses food seeking.</p><p>Starting on line 578 the authors note that activation of PGLUT neurons decreases food seeking responses despite Pressers showing increased excitatory food cue responses. They hypothesize that optogenetic activation of PGLUT neurons also activates cells not active during food seeking, decreasing signal to noise during the cue and therefore decreases food seeking behavior (FIGURE 8). Although a reasonable hypothesis, there is no direct evidence provided to support this. This claim could be strengthened by showing the magnitude of excitatory and inhibitory responses in PGLUT neurons specifically rather than across PL neurons generally like in Figure 2 E/F and O/P.</p><p>The title of Figure 5 is misleading in its exclusive focus on the conflict phase. In fact, this is true for the reward only period also. This should be amended to more accurately convey the data presented in the figure. The associated text in the Results section (e.g. line 418-420) also presents the interpretation that increased firing of PLGLUT neurons associates with increased reward seeking during conflict. While strictly speaking this is not incorrect, not also discussing that the same effect is observed in the reward only period misconstrues this data by potentially suggesting an effect specific to conflict when in fact it would appear to be a general phenomenon reflecting reward seeking. The appropriate interpretation should be clarified throughout the manuscript.</p><p>In general, more nuanced analysis of the temporal dynamics of neural responses relative to behavior would be of interest and could more convincingly establish the link between neural activity and behavior.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Neural correlates and determinants of approach-avoidance conflict in the prelimbic prefrontal cortex&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Kate Wassum (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and the original reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers and editors agreed that the authors have done a commendable job responding to prior concerns and suggestions. The amount of data and analyses included is impressive, and the responses were not only thorough but also thoughtful. In reading the manuscript, it was often difficult to recognize and appreciate the most meaningful effects. Additional clarity could be provided regarding statistical analyses included in the text and how they relate to the graphical illustrations, which, at times, seems incongruent. To help the authors revise their manuscript, the Reviewing Editor has outlined the key comments that need additional attention.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Regarding the neural analyses comment #3 by Reviewer 1, the question pertained to whether the number of neurons obtained for a given population differed from chance. This is not a question about whether neural modulation was different from baseline for the neurons. It's generally answered with a chi squared test of independence. Is the population of neurons obtained one that is different from a population that could be obtained by chance?</p><p>2) Some of the most interesting, innovative, and impactful aspects of this work is the behavioral characterization based on individual differences. For this reason, the authors should consider reframing the Discussion, starting with a description of the behavioral phenotypes and what they might be capturing before describing the neuronal findings.</p><p>3) Pg. 10; lines 243-251: The authors state that Pressers showed a higher number of food-cue responsive neurons than Non-Pressers during the reward phase, and that both Pressers and Non-Pressers showed a significant reduction in the number of food-cue responsive neurons during the conflict phase. In the latter case, it is unclear if the reduction from 33% to 14% in Pressers is significantly different from the reduction of 21% to 6% in Non-Pressers (i.e. is there an interaction with phenotype in this reduction). It seems that this would be the case and that it would be important to recognize, but it is written as though both show an equivalent reduction in the number of food-cue responsive neurons during conflict. Direct phenotype comparisons appear to be lacking in subsequent analyses of the same dataset, which limits the conclusions that can be drawn. In this regard, additional clarity is needed regarding what comparisons are being made and reported and what the authors can or cannot conclude based on these comparisons. Another example comes from the data described for the inset in Figure 2I and 2S, for which it is stated that &quot;Pressers show a higher magnitude of inhibitory food-cue responses during the reward phase, and, in contrast to Non-Pressers, such responses were attenuated during the conflict phase&quot;. However, it is not clear from the statistics included or the text that the authors are directly comparing Pressers and Non-Pressers and/or which statistics speak to this comparison.</p><p>4) Clarification points:</p><p>i) Pg. 11, line 270: The authors should replace &quot;the same number&quot; with &quot;the same percentage&quot;. This also raises the concern as to whether or not it is appropriate to compare percentages when the denominator is 237 in Pressers and 89 in Non-Pressers. That is, how does recording from 237 neurons vs. 89 neurons affect the interpretation of the results given that the likelihood of detecting differences is presumably greater with 237 neurons.</p><p>ii) Pg. 12, lines 293-297: Similar to the point above, is the Fisher's Exact Test reported here only comparing the proportions of neurons between phases and not between behavioral phenotypes?</p><p>iii) Figure 6M, 6N. It looks as though the significant effects of laser diminish over time for the CaMKII-ChR2 group. Can the authors comment on this in the manuscript?</p><p>iv) A description of the principal components analysis used to assess the behavioral data seems to be lacking in the primary text.</p><p>5) Additional analyses:</p><p>i) Please include insets of the AUC analyses reported in the text, this applies for 4B, C, D and E.</p><p>ii) Pg. 17, lines 405-412: It is stated that proportions of excitatory and inhibitory food cue response for PL(Glut) and PL(GABA) neurons were similar during the reward and conflict phase (Figure 5J-K). However, it does not appear that an analysis was conducted to compare proportions between different neuronal subtypes. That is, it seems like it would be meaningful to be able to say that the proportion of excited glutamatergic neurons in response to the food cue during the conflict phase was less than the proportion of GABAergic neurons excited during the conflict phase (should that prove to be the case). Again, as written, it is difficult to discern what analyses were or were not conducted and which are being described.</p><p>Please also include a Key Resources Table.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74950.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

To clarify this point, we have improved the description in the Methods section and added the following sentence in the figure legends of all the single-unit recording figures: “The threshold used to identify significant differences per neurons was Z-score &gt; 2.58 for excitation and Z-score &lt; -1.96 for inhibition.”</p><p>In addition to the Z-score classification for individual cells, we have used the appropriate statistical analysis to compare differences between phases or groups, as indicated in the Results section, Figure Legends, Methods, and Supplementary Source data 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Optotagging studies require additional investigation to justify the strong claims:</p><p>1) I wasn't convinced by the claim that the optotagging proves that waveform and spike timing analyses are inappropriate.

This control is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>Optogenetic-induced light artifacts was not a confounding in our photoidentification experiments for several reasons: (i) photoelectric artifacts were very rare (1 or 2 channels in less than 10% of the rats), most likely due to the large distance between the optical fiber tip and the contact area of the wires (~300 μm) with the Hermes 32 channels optrode arrays (Biosignal Technologies); (ii) the small number of photoelectric artifacts generated by laser activation were easily distinguished from the action potentials. They were characterized by descending voltage signals of high amplitude and pulse shapes visibly distinct from the regular waveforms, which resulted in different spatial distribution in the principal component analyses; and most importantly, (iii) the occurrence of photoelectric artifacts was restricted to the period of laser illumination and their frequency corresponded approximately to the number of laser pulses delivered during the optogenetic stimulation (~500). Because all photoidentification sessions occurred by the end of the behavioral test and were recorded within the exact same file, real spikes triggered by the laser populated a cluster of thousands of spikes previously recorded during the behavioral session. In contrast, the photoelectric artifacts resulted in a separate cluster with a much smaller number of “spikes” and absence of activity during the behavioral session. Please see the representative example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> for a comparison between a sorted photoidentified neuron (yellow, &gt;18 thousand spikes recorded along the entire session) and a photoelectric artifact (green, 501 “spikes” recorded along the entire session but observed exclusively during the 10 trains of illumination) in the same channel.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-74950-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Although the photoelectric artifact was not an issue during our experiments, we have followed the reviewer’s recommendation of testing a few control animals to completely rule out the possibility that the laser illumination could generate a signal that resembles an action potential, which would lead to an inaccurate classification of the cells. For this purpose, we used two control rats implanted with the same model of optrodes but without channelrhodopsin expression in PL. We then exposed the animals to the same behavioral and laser illumination protocol used in the previous experiments. We found that none of the 14 recorded cells show any type of response when aligned to the onset of the laser (see the PSTH graphics <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>).

The authors used a novel task to assess the ability of rats to remember cues previously associated with either reward (food) or threat (footshocks) to make a behavioral decision. In doing so, they uncovered two behavioral phenotypes: &quot;Pressers&quot;, who continued to press a lever for food during conflict; and &quot;Non-Pressers&quot;, who exhibited a suppression of food-seeking behavior in face of conflict. A combination of optogenetics and single-unit recordings were used to assess the neural mechanisms underlying this individual variability in reward-seeking behavior during conflict. The authors report that increased risk-taking behavior in &quot;Pressers&quot; is associated with reward-cue-elicited responses in the prelimbic cortex and reduced spontaneous activity in prelimbic glutamatergic neurons during conflict. Further, activation of prelimbic glutamatergic, but not GABAergic, neurons attenuated reward-seeking responses selectively in &quot;Pressers&quot;; and inhibition of prelimbic glutamatergic neurons increased reward-approach behavior and decreased freezing behavior during conflict in &quot;Non-Pressers&quot;.</p><p>These experiments were well-designed, the methods were appropriate to address the questions at hand, and the manuscript is well-written. The ethologically-relevant approach-avoidance task is novel and will be of interest to the field. In particular, the ability to capture distinct behavioral phenotypes and individual differences using this test will allow further investigation of the neural determinants of reward-seeking and threat-avoiding behavior during conflict.</p></disp-quote><p>We are glad the reviewer recognizes the strengths of our work. Thank you!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As currently presented, there are some concerns regarding the statistical analyses and whether they support all of the authors' claims. As the individual differences component of the manuscript is particularly novel and of interest, it is a bit concerning that these analyses include a sample size of 25 &quot;Pressers&quot; and 7 &quot;Non-Pressers&quot;. In relation, it is not clear that the neural responses of these two behavioral phenotypes were ever directly compared. For example, in Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 2, the area under the curve for neural responses during reward and conflict are presented independently for the two phenotypes and direct comparisons to assess group differences and/or interactions are not apparent. Similarly, it is not clear why data only from &quot;Non-Pressers&quot; is shown in Figure 7, as the methods suggest that both &quot;Pressers&quot; and &quot;Non-Pressers&quot; were used for this experiment. Further, in general, it is difficult to deduce which statistical analyses support the claims made in the manuscript text, as the analyses are only presented in the Figure legends and in Source data 1 and don't always seem congruent.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the thoughtful comments.

It now reads: “An average firing rate analysis across phases demonstrated that the activity of PL<sup>GLUT</sup> neurons didn’t change significantly from the reward to the odor phase (Fisher Exact Test, all p’s &gt; 0.05), but was inhibited from the odor to the conflict phase when Pressers resumed searching for food (Figure 5O, Fisher Exact Test, odor vs conflict, p = 0.0046)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Fernandez-Leon et al. investigate the role of the pre-limbic area (PL) in regulating approach avoidance behavior in situations of learned motivational conflict where animals experience both cues that predict an aversive outcome as well as cues that signal the availability of food. This region has been implicated in threat responding and food seeking separately but has not previously been examined in situations of conflict. The authors employ an individual differences approach, subdividing animals based on their food seeking behavior in the presence of conflicting cues that signal food availability and footshock and use a combination of in vivo recordings and optogenetic manipulations to identify a role for specific cell types in the PL in regulating risky behaviors in aversive contexts. This manuscript adds to the growing literature on neural mechanisms of processing approach-avoidance conflict.</p><p>This work has many strengths. Examining approach and avoidance in a conflict paradigm, rather than separately, provides a more ethological study of the neural basis of these behaviors as, beyond the confines of a laboratory, action selection commonly occurs in the face of multiple competing cues. Subdividing animals into 'pressers' and 'non-pressers' based on individual differences in engagement in food seeking behavior is an excellent strategy to gain insight into the behavioral function of these cells. Recognizing that not engaging in food seeking does not necessarily reflect failure to complete the task but rather a bias toward avoidance behavior is insightful and important. The authors suggest a number of interesting and potentially important differences in PL neural activity between pressers and non-pressers. For example, pressers (i.e. rats that continue to seek food in the presence of an aversive cue) have both more food-cue responsive neurons and greater magnitude of excitatory and inhibitory responses to food-cues, a difference that is sustained when food-cues are presented in the presence of an aversive cue. Pressers and non-pressers also had marked differences in oscillatory frequency, an intriguing finding that warrants further investigation. Optogenetic experiments nicely establish causality with precise temporal resolution.</p></disp-quote><p>We are glad the reviewer recognizes the strengths of our work. Thank you!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The design of the behavioral paradigm somewhat limits the ability the ability to draw certain conclusions. During testing, food-cues were presented discretely while the shock-cue was constant preventing direct comparison of responding to appetitive and aversive cues that would have been highly interesting. Furthermore, during the test session, reward cues are always presented first followed by the addition of the shock-cue. This, and the extended shock-cue presentation under extinction conditions makes it difficult to entirely rule out alternative interpretations for differences between pressers and non-pressers, for example, more rapid extinction of fear memory in pressers than non-pressers. Beyond this, the lack of direct statistical comparison of neural activity in pressers and non-pressers undermines the strength of the central conclusions of this paper.</p><p>The authors hypothesize that stimulating glutamatergic PL neurons decreases signal to noise ratio between cells that are active during food seeking and those that are not, thus resulting in a decrease in food-seeking. This is interesting and plausible proposal to be further explored in future research.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the thoughtful comments. Below we provide a detailed explanation about how we have addressed each one of these points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I have a number of concerns about the behavioral paradigm. Although both food and shock cues were presented as discrete 30s cues during conditioning, in the test phase, the shock associated cue was presented as a constant cue, first alone for 10 minutes and then with discrete 30s food associated cues overlayed. No rationale is provided for this specific design. I struggle to think of benefits for such a design compared to all discrete cue presentations, and see clear disadvantages. For example, it is not possible to compare responding to food and shock cues and the sustained exposure to the shock cue may result in extinction.</p></disp-quote><p>We want to thank the reviewer for raising this important point. We recognize that we have not been very clear explaining the rationale for the use of a constant odor in the previous version of the manuscript, but we have now clarified it in the Methods section. The main reason why we have decided to proceed with a constant odor presentation during our test protocol is the limitation to effectively introduce (and extract) the odor into (from) the chamber with accurate temporal precision. Although we have used a TTL-controlled olfactometer to insert the odor into the chamber and an exhaustor fan to remove it, after performing a series of pilot experiments we have learned that using an odor as a discrete cue in freely behaving animals is extremely challenging. By using an odor dispersion sensor (200B miniPID, Aurora Scientific) to quantify the amount of odor particles in the chamber right after the onset of the odor cues, we found that the amyl acetate odor takes approximately 2.21 ± 0.28 s to reach detectable concentrations in the arena (56 particles per billion; Punter, 1983). Our pilot tests also revealed that the delay and the variability to detect the odor after the olfactometer activation were even larger when we looked at the animals’ behavior (e.g., sniffing movements) because the distance of the animals from the odor port varied across the trials. Using the same odor dispersion sensor, we observed a large delay for the odor particles to be completely removed from the chamber after the offset of the olfactometer and the concomitant activation of the extractor fan (19.59 ± 0.97 s). This lack of temporal precision made it impossible for us to use the olfactory stimulus as a discrete cue during the conflict test, particularly because the single-unit recording experiments require high temporal resolution. Therefore, we have decided to use the odor as a constant cue, similar to an approach-avoidance conflict test with predator odor cues that our group has recently published (Engelke et al., 2021). Using a similar protocol with a constant odor presentation will allow us to perform future comparison between learned and innate defensive responses during the conflict test. It is important to note that, despite the lack of fine temporal resolution during the odor delivery, the presentation of 30 s odor cues during the acquisition phase resulted in significant expression of defensive behaviors during the odor test phase in the following day. The lack of freezing responses before the first food cue and odor presentation observed in the two groups (see Supplementary Figure 1I) suggests that the animals did not show signals of threat memory generalization to the context, as clarified in the Results section now.</p><p>To address the reviewer’s concern about the possibility of extinction taking place during the constant odor presentation, we have performed a minute by minute analyses of the behavioral responses during the odor phase for both groups. Similar to what we have reported in Figure 1M, N, P, we observed that <italic>Pressers</italic>, compared to <italic>Non-Pressers</italic>, showed a lower percentage of time exhibiting freezing and avoidance responses and a greater percentage of time approaching the food area. These behavioral differences were already observed in the very beginning of the odor phase and remained constant from the beginning to the end of the session for both groups, indicating that the animals did not extinguish their defensive responses across the session (see new Supplementary Figure 1J-L). We have added a similar description in the Results section (Page 9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further, the cues are in different modalities and not counterbalanced across animals: the food cue is always a tone &amp; light and the shock cue is always odor.</p></disp-quote><p>While an auditory or a visual cue can be easily controlled with high temporal precision, an olfactory cue cannot. Thus, due to the lack of temporal control over the odor presentation (see more details in the answer above), we opted for not counterbalancing the cue modalities because millisecond temporal precision is necessary for electrophysiological recordings in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript also does not provide definitive behavioral evidence to show learning of the shock-odor association. Although for food-seeking discrimination between cue on and cue off periods is shown, the same is not shown for fear conditioning. In the absence of an unconditioned stimulus (CS-), it would be good to at least show discrimination from the pre-cue period (or an equivalent time where there is no food seeking or shock cue present) when comparing pressers and non-pressers in order to confirm that freezing and defensive behaviors are specific to learned odor association and not a generalized fear response.</p></disp-quote><p>The odor discrimination question is another important point that we would like to clarify to the reviewer. Using previous odor threat conditioning studies as a reference, we have performed a series of pilot tests in our lab with the intention of finding the best training protocol for the animals to discriminate a non-shock paired odor (CS-) from a shock-paired odor (CS+) during the conditioning phase. Despite trying different intertrial intervals, shock intensities, and rat strains, we failed to validate a protocol in which the animals would show defensive responses exclusively to the CS+ presentation during the acquisition phase (see an example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig5">Author response image 5</xref> using amyl acetate as CS+ and peppermint as CS-, intertrial intervals of ~5 min, 30s cue duration, 0.5 mA shock intensity, 1s duration). We therefore concluded that, at least in our hands, rats cannot discriminate well the CS+ from the CS- during the conditioning session.</p><fig id="sa2fig5" position="float"><label>Author response image 5.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-74950-sa2-fig5-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Following the reviewer’s recommendation, we have now quantified the amount of freezing during the pre-odor presentation during the conditioning and test phases. It turns out that both groups show high freezing levels during the pre-odor trials of the conditioning phase, but very low freezing levels before the first food cue and odor presentation during the test session on the next day. We have added two new panels in Supplementary Figure 1 and a description of the findings in the Results section, which now reads: <italic>“</italic>Although Non-Pressers exhibited higher freezing levels during pre-odor trials 3 and 4 of the threat conditioning phase (Supplementary Figure 1H, F(5, 250) = 3.038, p = 0.011, Bonferroni's post-hoc p &lt; 0.05), freezing responses before the first food cue and odor presentation were the same during the test day, indicating similar contextual discrimination between the two groups (Supplementary Figure 1I, Shapiro Wilk normality test, p &lt; 0.05, Mann-Whitney test, U = 248, p = 0.113).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This is especially important given that lever pressing during food cues during the threat conditioning day is suppressed, indicating that the animals show a generalized increase in freezing.</p></disp-quote><p>Please notice that a suppression in lever presses during the conditioning phase does not necessarily mean fear generalization. Lever press suppression has been also reported in several previous studies using discrete visual or auditory cues. However, this suppression has been attributed to conditioned inhibition in response to the unconditioned stimulus (i.e., footshocks), rather than threat generalization, because pre- CS lever presses (i.e., context) were not altered during the test session in the following day (Rescorla, 1968; Quirk et al., 2000; Bouton et al., 2008; McDannald and Galarce, 2011; Sierra-Mercado et al., 2011). Accordingly, a behavioral analysis of our results during the reward phase in the next day revealed that rats pressed the lever in &gt;95% of the trials (Figure 1J), with response latencies during the reward phase (Figure 1I, 5.98 ± 0.73s) being similar to those observed during the pre-conditioning trials (Figure 1D habituation trial, 6.77 ± 1.20; Paired Student’s t-test, p = 0.579).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given the sustained exposure to the shock cue under extinction conditions during test, a potential interpretation of the difference between pressers and non-pressers is that pressers may extinguish faster than non-pressers leading to behavioral differences in the odor phase. Enhanced extinction could reflect differences in underlying learning that are occluded on the conditioning day by high levels of freezing or an alteration in the mechanisms of extinction. It is notable that pressers and non-pressers do show differences in freezing on the test day. It would be good to look at freezing and pressing cue by cue as is done in Supplemental Figure 1C for the threat conditioning.</p></disp-quote><p>As reported above, we have performed a minute by minute analyses of the behavioral responses during the odor phase for both groups.

The paper is looking to show the involvement of these cells in approach avoidance in situations of conflict, but this design simply assesses food seeking.</p></disp-quote><p>The rationale for this experiment is based on the observation that <italic>Pressers</italic> showed an inhibition of spontaneous activity in PL<sup>GLUT</sup> neurons from the odor to the conflict phase. We then hypothesized that reverting this inhibition by increasing the firing rate of PL<sup>GLUT</sup> neurons would reduce lever presses. However, before testing the effects of PL<sup>GLUT</sup> photoactivation during the conflict test, we first wanted to make sure that the stimulation had no effect on cued food seeking per se. Otherwise, it would be impossible to interpret the results during the conflict test. Surprisingly, we observed that stimulating PL<sup>GLUT</sup> neurons in a neutral context was already sufficient to reduce cued food seeking. We therefore aborted the PL<sup>GLUT</sup> photoactivation experiment during the conflict test and focused on inhibiting the same cells in <italic>Non-Pressers</italic> during conflict as an attempt to increase reward-seeking responses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Starting on line 578 the authors note that activation of PGLUT neurons decreases food seeking responses despite Pressers showing increased excitatory food cue responses. They hypothesize that optogenetic activation of PGLUT neurons also activates cells not active during food seeking, decreasing signal to noise during the cue and therefore decreases food seeking behavior (FIGURE 8). Although a reasonable hypothesis, there is no direct evidence provided to support this. This claim could be strengthened by showing the magnitude of excitatory and inhibitory responses in PGLUT neurons specifically rather than across PL neurons generally like in Figure 2 E/F and O/P.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s recommendation, but due to the reduced number of PL<sup>GLUT</sup> neurons showing food cue responses, we could not perform the same calculation as in Figure 2E/F and O/P. We have now tuned down our interpretation in the discussion session by clarifying that this is a speculation.</p><p>“Thus, it is possible that increased activity in the firing rate of PL<sup>GLUT</sup> neurons may result in reduced signal-to-noise ratio during the food cue onset (Kroener et al., 2009; McGinley et al., 2015), and consequently decreased food-seeking responses. In contrast, we speculate that by reducing their spontaneous firing rates during conflict situations, PL<sup>GLUT</sup> neurons become more likely to fire in response to food cues due to an increase in the signal-to-noise ratio, thereby resulting in persistent reward-seeking responses during the conflict phase as we propose in our schematic in Figure 8.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The title of Figure 5 is misleading in its exclusive focus on the conflict phase. In fact, this is true for the reward only period also. This should be amended to more accurately convey the data presented in the figure. The associated text in the Results section (e.g. line 418-420) also presents the interpretation that increased firing of PL<sup>GLUT</sup> neurons associates with increased reward seeking during conflict. While strictly speaking this is not incorrect, not also discussing that the same effect is observed in the reward only period misconstrues this data by potentially suggesting an effect specific to conflict when in fact it would appear to be a general phenomenon reflecting reward seeking. The appropriate interpretation should be clarified throughout the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We recognize that this was not the most accurate way to report the results in the first version of the manuscript. However, after applying the new photoidentification criteria suggested by Reviewer 1, the PL<sup>GLUT</sup> photoidentified cells have changed and the significant effect that was initially observed when comparing reward and odor phases has now disappeared (please see updated Figure 5O). Because the effect is still present when comparing the odor and conflict phases, we have kept the same description we had initially.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In general, more nuanced analysis of the temporal dynamics of neural responses relative to behavior would be of interest and could more convincingly establish the link between neural activity and behavior.</p></disp-quote><p>We have followed the reviewer’s recommendation and performed some additional analyses of neuronal activity relative to rats’ behavioral responses during the test day. We aligned the firing rate of the cells to the onset of freezing, avoidance, and risk-assessment responses and selected those neurons that significantly responded 600 ms before the onset of each behavior (see new Supplementary Figure 6). The new sentence in the Results section now reads: “Moreover, a smaller fraction of PL neurons changed their firing rates 600 ms before the onset of either freezing, avoidance or risk assessment responses in both Pressers and Non-Pressers (Supplementary Figure 5A-M), indicating that some PL neurons can anticipate animal’s behavior during the test.”</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Regarding the neural analyses comment #3 by Reviewer 1, the question pertained to whether the number of neurons obtained for a given population differed from chance. This is not a question about whether neural modulation was different from baseline for the neurons. It's generally answered with a chi squared test of independence. Is the population of neurons obtained one that is different from a population that could be obtained by chance?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the recommendation. To verify whether PL neurons responsive to food cues, as well as PL neurons responsive to other events, change their firing rates specifically to the onset of the audio-visual cues (and not by chance at any random timepoint), we performed an additional analysis to quantify the proportion of cells that were either excited or inhibited 1 second before the food cue onset using the exact same Z-score criteria performed for other analyses in the manuscript. We observed that &lt;2% of the 237 neurons recorded from <italic>Pressers</italic> and &lt;3% of the 89 neurons recorded from <italic>Non-Pressers</italic> changed their firing rates when aligned to 1 second before the food cue onset. Notably, the percentage of responsive neurons increased significantly to 33% in <italic>Pressers</italic> and 21% in <italic>Non-Pressers</italic> when the same cells were aligned to the onset of the food cues, indicating that the proportion of food-cue responsive neurons in both groups was different from the proportion of responsive cells obtained by change at a random timepoint (Fisher Exact Test, all p’s &lt; 0.0001). Similarly, the proportion of PL neurons that responded to lever presses (23%) and dish entries (16%) was also significantly different from that obtained by chance (&lt;3%, all p’s &lt; 0.0001).</p><p>Another possible way to test whether the number of PL responsive neurons differ from chance would be comparing the percentage of cells that showed excitatory, inhibitory, or no chances in response to the food cues with the percentage that could be obtained by chance (33%), assuming that excitatory, inhibitory, or no changes are equally likely to occur. However, this method may not be very informative because a series of previous studies have demonstrated that the prelimbic cortex is a very heterogenous region and only a small fraction (~30%) of PL neurons responds to conditioned cues. We therefore used the first method to address this point and added a new sentence in the Results section to report the new comparison. The new sentence reads:</p><p>“An analysis of PL activity at a random timepoint (e.g., 1 second before the food cue onset) resulted in less than 3% of responsive cells, indicating that the proportion of PL neurons that responded to food cues, lever presses, and food dish entries was significantly different from the proportion obtained by chance (Fisher Exact Test, all p’s &lt; 0.05).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Some of the most interesting, innovative, and impactful aspects of this work is the behavioral characterization based on individual differences. For this reason, the authors should consider reframing the Discussion, starting with a description of the behavioral phenotypes and what they might be capturing before describing the neuronal findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We have followed the reviewer’s recommendation and fixed the beginning of the discussion session to highlight the individual differences in behavior. The updated first paragraph of the discussion session now reads:</p><p>“Using a novel approach-avoidance conflict test, we identified two distinct behavioral phenotypes during the combined presentation of reward- and threat-paired cues: (i) rats that continued to press a lever for food (Pressers), and (ii) rats that exhibited a complete suppression in food-seeking responses (Non-Pressers). Single-unit recordings revealed that PL neurons regulate reward-approach vs. threat-avoidance responses during situations of uncertainty, when rats use previously associated memories to guide their decisions. We observed that increased risk-taking behavior in Pressers was associated with a larger number of food-cue responses in PL neurons, which showed sustained excitatory activity that persisted during the conflict phase, when compared to Non-Pressers. In addition, PL<sup>GLUT</sup> neurons showed reduced spontaneous activity during risky reward seeking and photoactivation of these cells in a neutral context was sufficient to suppress lever press responses. Accordingly, photoinhibition of PL<sup>GLUT</sup> neurons at the onset of the food cues in Non-Pressers reduced defensive responses and increased food approaching during the conflict phase, consistent with our observation that a small fraction of PL neurons changed their activity at the onset of freezing, avoidance or risk-assessment responses. Altogether, these results suggest that under memory-based conflict situations, reduced or increased activity in PL<sup>GLUT</sup> neurons can favor the behavioral expression of food approaching or threat-avoidance responses, respectively.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Pg. 10; lines 243-251: The authors state that Pressers showed a higher number of food-cue responsive neurons than Non-Pressers during the reward phase, and that both Pressers and Non-Pressers showed a significant reduction in the number of food-cue responsive neurons during the conflict phase. In the latter case, it is unclear if the reduction from 33% to 14% in Pressers is significantly different from the reduction of 21% to 6% in Non-Pressers (i.e. is there an interaction with phenotype in this reduction). It seems that this would be the case and that it would be important to recognize, but it is written as though both show an equivalent reduction in the number of food-cue responsive neurons during conflict. Direct phenotype comparisons appear to be lacking in subsequent analyses of the same dataset, which limits the conclusions that can be drawn. In this regard, additional clarity is needed regarding what comparisons are being made and reported and what the authors can or cannot conclude based on these comparisons.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed a group comparison analysis and found that <italic>Pressers</italic> and <italic>Non-Pressers</italic> exhibited similar reductions in the number of responsive neurons from the reward to the conflict phases. We have added the new analysis in the Results section, which now reads:</p><p>“In addition, the percentage of reduction in the number of responsive cells across the phases was similar between Pressers and Non-Pressers (Figure 2C vs. Figure 2M, Fisher Exact Test, 47 out of 232 neurons for Pressers, 13 out of 89 neurons for Non-Pressers, p = 0.427), suggesting that PL neurons can distinguish between reward and conflict situations (Figure 2G vs. 2H and 2Q vs. 2R).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another example comes from the data described for the inset in Figure 2I and 2S, for which it is stated that &quot;Pressers show a higher magnitude of inhibitory food-cue responses during the reward phase, and, in contrast to Non-Pressers, such responses were attenuated during the conflict phase&quot;. However, it is not clear from the statistics included or the text that the authors are directly comparing Pressers and Non-Pressers and/or which statistics speak to this comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for raising this point. We have clarified the text now by indicating that a direct statistical comparison was made between <italic>Pressers</italic> and <italic>Non-Pressers.</italic> The new sentence now reads:</p><p>“In addition, Pressers showed a higher magnitude of inhibitory food-cue responses during the reward phase when compared to Non-Pressers (Figure 2I blue bar inset vs. 2S blue bar inset, Shapiro-Wilk normality test, p &lt; 0.001, Mann-Whitney test, U = 50, p = 0.0045).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Clarification points:</p><p>i) Pg. 11, line 270: The authors should replace &quot;the same number&quot; with &quot;the same percentage&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have incorporated the suggestion. Thank you!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This also raises the concern as to whether or not it is appropriate to compare percentages when the denominator is 237 in Pressers and 89 in Non-Pressers. That is, how does recording from 237 neurons vs. 89 neurons affect the interpretation of the results given that the likelihood of detecting differences is presumably greater with 237 neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>For all the between-group comparisons performed in the manuscript, we have used the most appropriate statistical analyses for samples of unequal size and variance. Because unpaired Student’s t test comparison has been criticized by some authors, we have now replaced it by Welch’s t test, which is more recommended for group comparisons of unequal variance.

It looks as though the significant effects of laser diminish over time for the CaMKII-ChR2 group. Can the authors comment on this in the manuscript?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for raising this point. We have included a new sentence in the manuscript to provide some potential explanations for the diminished effect of laser illumination observed by the end of the session. The text now reads:</p><p>“The diminished behavioral effect observed during the third block of laser on could be the result of conformational changes in the opsin (e.g. photobleaching) or temporary depletion of synaptic vesicles following repeated laser illumination, as previously reported (Kittelmann et al., 2013; Stahlberg et al., 2019).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iv) A description of the principal components analysis used to assess the behavioral data seems to be lacking in the primary text.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a brief explanation of the principal component analysis in the Methods section together with a reference about the topic. The new paragraph now reads:</p><p>“Principal component analyses on behaviors. The principal component analysis (PCA) method (Jolliffe, 2002) was implemented to further understand the relationships between approaching, avoidance, freezing, and latency to press during the conflict phase for both Pressers and NonPressers. This method was used to reduce the dimensionality of our multivariate data whilst preserving as much of the relevant information as possible. Briefly, we performed a linear transformation of the data to a new coordinate system such that the new set of variables, the principal components, were linear functions of the original variables. These variables were also uncorrelated, and the greatest variance by any projection of the data came to lie on the first coordinate, the second greatest variance on the second coordinate, and so on. Afterwards, we analyzed the explained variance (%) of the first two PCs (i.e. PC1 and PC2) together with the relevance of each analyzed behavior to define which variables better explained the differences between Pressers and Non-Pressers (see Results section for additional details).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Additional analyses:</p><p>i) Please include insets of the AUC analyses reported in the text, this applies for 4B, C, D and E.</p></disp-quote><p>We have created new inset graphics for all the AUC quantifications and performed the appropriate statistical comparisons, which were reported in the text and in details in Source data 1.

However, it does not appear that an analysis was conducted to compare proportions between different neuronal subtypes. That is, it seems like it would be meaningful to be able to say that the proportion of excited glutamatergic neurons in response to the food cue during the conflict phase was less than the proportion of GABAergic neurons excited during the conflict phase (should that prove to be the case). Again, as written, it is difficult to discern what analyses were or were not conducted and which are being described.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed all the possible comparisons (within and between phases) and have not observed any significant differences in the proportion of PL<sup>GABA</sup> vs PL<sup>GLUT</sup> neurons that were responsive to food cues. The p values for each one of the eight comparisons can be found now in Source data 1. Following the reviewer’s recommendation, we have now rephrased the sentence to better reflect the performed comparisons.
