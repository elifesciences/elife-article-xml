Under this assumption, recent single-molecule studies proposed a branched Brownian ratchet mechanism that necessitates a putative secondary nucleotide binding site on the enzyme. By challenging individual yeast RNA polymerase II with a nucleosomal barrier, we separately measured the forward and reverse translocation rates. Surprisingly, we found that the forward translocation rate is comparable to the catalysis rate. This finding reveals a linear, non-branched ratchet mechanism for the nucleotide addition cycle in which translocation is one of the rate-limiting steps. We further determined all the major on- and off-pathway kinetic parameters in the elongation cycle. The resulting translocation energy landscape shows that the off-pathway states are favored thermodynamically but not kinetically over the on-pathway states, conferring the enzyme its propensity to pause and furnishing the physical basis for transcriptional regulation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00971.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00971.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00971.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The production of a protein inside a cell starts with a region of the DNA inside the cell nucleus being transcribed to form a molecule of messenger RNA. This process involves an enzyme called RNA polymerase that moves along the DNA, reading the bases and making a complementary strand of messenger RNA from molecules called nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs).

It has long been assumed that the back-and-forth motion occurs much faster than the overall reaction of adding one NTP to the messenger RNA. This assumption has now been tested by using a single-molecule assay to monitor transcription in real time.</p><p>Dangkulwanich et al. measured the elongation velocities of yeast RNA polymerase II (Pol II) on bare DNA and on DNA in which a nucleosome–a structure that consists of a segment of DNA wrapped around histone proteins–had been placed as a “road block” in front of the enzyme.

Dangkulwanich et al. also measured the rates associated with a process called backtracking in which the polymerase moves away from the transcription site to “pause” the process. These measurements show that there is a delicate balance between elongation and pausing during transcription.</p><p>Overall, by revealing the energy landscape associated with transcription, the work of Dangkulwanich et al. will bring us closer to the goal of creating a molecular movie of this extremely important–and complex–process.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00971.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00971.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>RNA polymerase II</kwd><kwd>transcription elongation</kwd><kwd>Brownian ratchet</kwd><kwd>translocation</kwd><kwd>backtracking</kwd><kwd>optical tweezer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM032543</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bustamante</surname><given-names>Carlos J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Department of Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE-AC02-05CH11231</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bustamante</surname><given-names>Carlos J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bustamante</surname><given-names>Carlos J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Quantification of all the major on- and off-pathway kinetic parameters in the transcription elongation cycle reveals that RNA polymerase II translocates slowly in a linear, non-branched Brownian ratchet mechanism.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transcription constitutes the first and a central regulatory step for gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Greive and von Hippel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coulon et al., 2013</xref>). During the process of RNA synthesis, RNA polymerase (RNAP) converts the energy from chemical catalysis of the nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) into mechanical translocation along the DNA template. Two classes of mechanisms have been offered to describe the mechanochemical coupling of transcription elongation. The first class, known as the ‘power stroke’ mechanism, suggests that the forward translocation of RNAP is directly driven by a chemical step such as the release of the pyrophosphate (PP<sub>i</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yin and Steitz, 2004</xref>). The second class, known as the ‘Brownian ratchet’ mechanism, postulates that the polymerase oscillates back and forth on the DNA template between a pre- and a post-translocated state at the beginning of each nucleotide addition cycle, and that such thermally-driven motions are rectified to the post-translocated state by the incorporation of the incoming NTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guajardo and Sousa, 1997</xref>). After extensive structural and biochemical investigations, it is now generally thought that multi-subunit RNAPs, including bacterial and eukaryotic enzymes, function through the Brownian ratchet mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Komissarova and Kashlev, 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bar-Nahum et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brueckner and Cramer, 2008</xref>). This mechanism received further support from single-molecule studies, which followed the dynamics of individual transcription elongation complexes (TECs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbondanzieri et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Larson et al., 2012</xref>). Nonetheless, in order to explain the relationship between the elongation velocity and the external force applied to RNAP obtained from single-molecule experiments, the classical linear ratchet mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) had to be modified such that the incoming NTP must also bind to the pre-translocated TEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbondanzieri et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Larson et al., 2012</xref>). In the pre-translocated TEC, the primary nucleotide binding site is occupied by the 3′-end of the nascent transcript. Thus, the branched Brownian ratchet scheme necessarily requires a secondary NTP binding site on the enzyme. However, the precise location of this secondary site and the mechanism by which the NTP is transferred to the primary site remain poorly defined.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00971.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Nucleotide addition cycle and off-pathway pausing of transcription elongation.</title><p>The nucleotide addition phase and the pausing phase are colored in green and blue, respectively.

In one view of the mechanisms of transcriptional pausing, RNAP first enters an elemental pause state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Herbert et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Toulokhonov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sydow et al., 2009</xref>), whose structural evidence was recently presented in bacterial RNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Weixlbaumer et al., 2013</xref>). However, similar evidence is lacking for eukaryotic polymerases. These elemental pauses can be subsequently stabilized into longer-lived pauses by the formation of a hairpin structure in the nascent RNA transcript or by RNAP backtracking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Artsimovitch and Landick, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herbert et al., 2008</xref>). The backtracking process is caused by upstream movements of the polymerase, displacing the 3′-end of the nascent RNA away from the active site into the secondary channel of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nudler et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Komissarova and Kashlev, 1997b</xref>). An alternative view poses that most pauses are attributed to backtracking, which can be described as a one-dimensional random walk of the enzyme along the DNA template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Galburt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mejia et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Depken et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hodges et al., 2009</xref>). RNA synthesis resumes when the polymerase diffusively realigns its active site with the 3′-end of the transcript.</p><p>Both the nucleotide addition phase and the pausing phase are closely regulated by conserved structural motifs near the active center of the polymerase, namely the bridge helix and the trigger loop (TL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bar-Nahum et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vassylyev et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brueckner and Cramer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaplan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tan et al., 2008</xref>). In order to understand the mechanism of transcription and its regulation, it is important to achieve a detailed description of both on- and off-pathway kinetics of the elongation reaction. Previous efforts to dissect the kinetic scheme of transcription elongation have assumed that the forward and reverse translocation steps of the Brownian ratchet occur in rapid equilibrium relative to the chemical steps in the nucleotide addition cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guajardo and Sousa, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbondanzieri et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tadigotla et al., 2006</xref>). However, the assumption of fast translocation equilibrium has never been experimentally validated. In fact, recent studies suggested that the translocation step may be partially rate-limiting for the nucleotide addition cycle, which gives rise to the heterogeneous elongation rates at different template positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nedialkov et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kireeva et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maoiléidigh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Malinen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nedialkov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Imashimizu et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In this work, we sought to achieve a comprehensive kinetic characterization of transcription elongation without making any assumption about the rate-limiting mechanism of the reaction. We used an optical tweezers assay to follow the transcription trajectories of single yeast RNA polymerase II (Pol II) molecules under a variety of conditions, including varying NTP concentrations, assisting and opposing applied forces, and different tracks (bare and nucleosomal DNA). In vivo, eukaryotic DNA is organized around histone octamers to form nucleosomes, which impose physical barriers to transcription elongation. We have previously demonstrated that a transcribing Pol II cannot actively unravel a wrapped nucleosome. Instead, the polymerase pauses and waits until the local nucleosomal DNA spontaneously unwraps and permits Pol II to advance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hodges et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bintu et al., 2012</xref>). Here we used the nucleosomal barrier as a tool to specifically perturb forward translocation of a transcribing Pol II and separately measured the forward and reverse translocation rates. Surprisingly, we found that the forward translocation rate is of the same order of magnitude as the catalysis rate, in contradiction to previous assumptions of fast translocation. This finding reveals that translocation and catalysis together constitute the rate-limiting steps in the nucleotide addition cycle. As a consequence, we were able to rationalize the observed force–velocity relationship of the enzyme with a linear Brownian ratchet scheme in which the incoming NTP only binds to the post-translocated TEC, thus reconciling bulk and single-molecule data and arriving at a unifying view of the transcription elongation process. We further obtained all the major kinetic parameters in the nucleotide addition phase and the pausing phase of the elongation cycle. The energy landscape for transcription elongation derived from these parameters shows that: (i) the enzyme thermodynamically favors the pre-translocated state to the post-translocated state; (ii) entry into the 1-basepair (bp) backtracked state is easier than into further backtracked states; and (iii) from the pre-translocated state, the enzyme thermodynamically favors the backtracked states, but kinetically favors forward translocation. We also applied this analysis to a TL mutant Pol II, Rpb1-<italic>E1103G</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Malagon et al., 2006</xref>), to quantitatively elucidate the roles of the TL in transcription elongation. Our results indicate that the conformational transitions of the TL control enzyme translocation, catalysis, and pausing, rendering it a vital target element for transcriptional regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NTP concentration dependence of elongation velocity and pausing frequency</title><p>The Brownian ratchet kinetic scheme for the nucleotide addition cycle of transcription elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) can be simplified to: <disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>TEC</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>n</mml:mtext><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:munderover><mml:mo>⇄</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>TEC</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>n</mml:mtext><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:munderover><mml:mo>⇄</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mtext>NTP</mml:mtext><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>TEC</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>n</mml:mtext><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mtext>NTP</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mo>→</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>TEC</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>n</mml:mtext><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mtext>0</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula>where <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>−1</sub> are the forward and reverse translocation rate constants, <italic>k</italic><sub>2</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>−2</sub> are the NTP binding and dissociation rate constants, and <italic>k</italic><sub>3</sub> is the combined catalysis rate constant that includes NTP sequestration, bond formation, and PP<sub>i</sub> release.

The increased pause duration of Pol II on nucleosomal DNA can be explained by rewrapping of the DNA downstream of a backtracked Pol II, which prevents the polymerase from diffusing back to the 3′-end of the nascent RNA to resume transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hodges et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bintu et al., 2012</xref>). Because one bp of nucleosomal DNA fluctuates much faster (&gt;1000 s<sup>−1</sup>; see ‘Materials and methods’ for the derivation) than Pol II stepping (∼1 s<sup>−1</sup>), the nucleosomal DNA in front of the polymerase reaches wrapping/unwrapping equilibrium between each backtracking step. It follows that the pause durations on nucleosomal DNA can be drawn from the same distribution as on bare DNA, except that the effective forward stepping rate is reduced by a factor, <italic>γ</italic><sub>u</sub>, corresponding to the fraction of time the local nucleosomal DNA is unwrapped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hodges et al., 2009</xref>), that is <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>f</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">nucl</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>γ</mml:mi><mml:mtext>u</mml:mtext></mml:msub><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mtext>f</mml:mtext></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>.

Interestingly, we found that the nucleosome also delays the transcribing enzyme by modulating its pause-free velocity. As the wild-type Pol II transcribes through nucleosomal DNA at saturating [NTP], its mean pause-free velocity decreases by 14% from 26.9 ± 0.8 nt/s to 23.2 ± 0.6 nt/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Since the fluctuations of local nucleosomal DNA occur orders of magnitude faster than the translocations of Pol II during backtracking, we assume that they are also much faster than the on-pathway translocation steps of Pol II. Under this assumption, local DNA reaches wrapping/unwrapping equilibrium before Pol II makes a translocation step and the forward translocation rate (<italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub>) is effectively reduced by the fraction of time the local nucleosomal DNA is unwrapped (<italic>γ</italic><sub>u</sub>).

In order to obtain a true pause density, the apparent <italic>ρ</italic><sub>pause</sub> needs to be corrected to include pauses shorter than 1 s that are missed by our pause detection algorithm. After such a correction (‘Materials and methods’), the total <italic>ρ</italic><sub>pause(sat)</sub> is 0.045 ± 0.012 bp<sup>−1</sup>. Solving <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ14">Equation 12</xref> yields <italic>k</italic><sub>b1</sub> = 5.3 ± 2.0 s<sup>−1</sup>. This value is approximately five times larger than subsequent backward stepping rates, which are force-biased stepping rates obtained from <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ9">Equation 7</xref> (<italic>k</italic><sub>bn</sub> = 1.0 ± 0.3 s<sup>−1</sup>, n≥2). The difference between <italic>k</italic><sub>b1</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>bn</sub> indicates that the first backtracking transition is easier to make than subsequent backtracking transitions. Using this value of <italic>k</italic><sub>b1</sub>, along with the value of <italic>γ</italic><sub>u</sub> obtained above, we can predict a nucleosomal pause density of 0.035 ± 0.015 bp<sup>−1</sup> for pauses longer than 1 s, which agrees with the experimental measurement (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>We then compared the pausing kinetics between the wild-type and the mutant enzymes. Interestingly, on bare DNA, the mutation only affects the distribution of pauses that are shorter than 2 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, p=0.003, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). In contrast, the distributions of longer pauses are indistinguishable between the mutant and the wild-type Pol II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, p=0.9). It is possible to rationalize this observation if the mutation selectively influences the kinetics of the first backtracking step (<italic>k</italic><sub>b1</sub> and/or <italic>k</italic><sub>f1</sub>) without affecting subsequent backtracking steps, given that pauses of short durations involve small backtracking excursions and that entering the 1-bp backtracked state is distinct from entering longer backtracked ones (<italic>k</italic><sub>b1</sub> is different from <italic>k</italic><sub>bn</sub>, n≥2). The first backward stepping rate (<italic>k</italic><sub>b1</sub>) only influences the pause density but not the pause duration, while the first forward stepping rate (<italic>k</italic><sub>f1</sub>) does affect the pause duration. Specifically, the increase in short pauses can be explained if the mutation increases <italic>k</italic><sub>f1</sub> and accelerates the return from a pause to active elongation. Indeed, Monte Carlo kinetic simulations show that setting <italic>k</italic><sub>f1</sub> to be larger than 4 s<sup>−1</sup>—2.4-fold higher than the wild-type value (1.7 ± 0.4 s<sup>−1</sup>; <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ8">Equation 6</xref>)—can reproduce the experimentally observed pause duration distributions for the mutant Pol II on bare DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, blue dashed line) and nucleosomal DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, green dashed line, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).

The rate-limiting nature of the various steps in the nucleotide addition cycle has so far remained largely conjectural. Almost all the existing kinetic studies of transcription elongation relied on the major assumption that translocation and NTP binding follow rapid equilibrium kinetics. As a result, the catalytic step occurring after NTP binding has been assigned to be rate-limiting of the overall elongation reaction.</p><p>The linear Brownian ratchet mechanism that assumes fast translocation equilibrium predicts that, as the NTP concentration increases, the force-sensitivity of the elongation velocity decreases and eventually vanishes, because the enzyme spends less time in the load-sensitive translocation steps. However, the <italic>F</italic>–<italic>v</italic> relationships of the enzyme obtained from optical tweezers studies have shown significant dependence of elongation velocity on external force even at saturating NTP concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbondanzieri et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Larson et al., 2012</xref>), in contradiction to the above prediction. To account for this discrepancy, a modified, branched ratchet model was proposed in which the NTP must also bind to a secondary site on the polymerase in the pre-translocated configuration. Although the existence of such additional binding site may be rationalized by the downstream allosteric site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Holmes and Erie, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gong et al., 2005</xref>), the ‘E’ site or pre-insertion site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Westover et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Temiakov et al., 2005</xref>), or the tilted hybrid structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheung et al., 2011</xref>), whether it constitutes a significant pathway in the elongation reaction and how it is related to the primary nucleotide binding pathway remain obscure. More importantly, the branched model neglects the possibility that the translocation steps may not be as fast as assumed.</p><p>In this study, we tested this possibility of slow translocation by placing a nucleosome in the path of the transcribing polymerase and directly determining the rates of forward and reverse translocation. Our analyses show that the forward translocation rate is in fact within the same order of magnitude as the catalysis rate. For the wild-type Pol II, <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub> is only 2.5 times higher than <italic>k</italic><sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). For the E1103G mutant, <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub> even becomes the slowest step in the nucleotide addition cycle (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). Hence, the translocation step is one of the rate-limiting transitions during transcription elongation. Translocation and catalysis together control the overall elongation velocity. These findings naturally explain the observed <italic>F</italic>–<italic>v</italic> relationship: because the enzyme always spends a considerable amount of time in the force-sensitive pre-translocated state even at high [NTP], we should always expect a force-dependence of the velocity. Moreover, a lower <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub> renders the velocity more sensitive to force, consistent with the experimental observation that the mutant Pol II shows a steeper <italic>F</italic>–<italic>v</italic> curve than the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). Therefore, our results demonstrate that a linear ratchet model can explain the transcriptional kinetics of Pol II and that it is not necessary to invoke a conceptually more complicated branched model, as long as the constraint of fast translocation equilibrium is relieved. Note that although our data argue against rapid oscillation of the ratchet, they still support the notion that the enzyme is able to spontaneously diffuse along the DNA between the pre- and post-translocated states, as suggested by the Brownian ratchet mechanism.<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00971.020</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A quantitative kinetic model for transcription elongation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A comprehensive kinetic characterization of the nucleotide addition phase (highlighted in green) and the pausing phase (highlighted in blue) for transcription by the wild-type Pol II.

In the future, it is worthwhile to use either of these two approaches or both to test whether prokaryotic transcription also employs a linear ratchet mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The energy landscape for transcription elongation</title><p>With the same transcript length, RNAP is able to move back and forth on the DNA template, forming different TEC configurations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). Each translocation state corresponds to a local energy minimum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yager and von Hippel, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tadigotla et al., 2006</xref>). Transitions between the pre- and post-translocated states, together with NTP binding and catalysis, constitute the active elongation pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, green). The enzyme can also enter the pausing pathway by transiting from the pre-translocated state to the backtracked states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, blue). The hyper-translocated states, in which the enzyme undergoes further forward translocation beyond 1 bp, are energetically unfavorable. The rate constants extracted from our single-molecule experiments translate into a free energy landscape for Pol II’s mechanical translocations and chemical transitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>; ‘Materials and methods’), which reveals many detailed features of the kinetics of Pol II transcription.</p><p>First, the staircase shape formed by the energy minima of post-translocated, pre-translocated, and 1-bp backtracked states shows that the off-pathway backtracked states are thermodynamically more stable than the on-pathway states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). This feature confers the enzyme its propensity to enter the pausing pathway, which is the central mechanism for various types of transcriptional control, such as arrest, proofreading, co-transcriptional RNA folding, and recruitment of regulators.</p><p>Second, the energy barrier from the pre-translocated to the 1-bp backtracked state is 2.5 <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub>T higher than the barrier from the pre-translocated to the post-translocated state, causing <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub> to be more than 10 times faster than <italic>k</italic><sub>b1</sub>. Thus, at the beginning of each nucleotide addition cycle, the pre-translocated TEC favors the catalysis-competent post-translocated state kinetically over the 1-bp backtracked state, even though it is thermodynamically more favorable to move in the opposite direction. This property ensures that pausing only occurs sporadically so that the transcript can be synthesized within a reasonable amount of time. In addition, the barriers between neighboring backtracked states are also relatively high, preventing the enzyme from backtracking too far, which could lead to transcriptional arrest.</p><p>Third, the first backtracking step appears to be unique from further backtracking steps in two aspects. Kinetically, entering the 1-bp backtracked state is easier than entering subsequent backtracked states, as reflected by the difference between <italic>k</italic><sub>b1</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>bn</sub> (n≥2). Such a difference is supported by structural data: the structure of an arrested Pol II complex suggests that backtracking beyond 1 bp is disfavored as it is sterically hindered by a ‘gating’ tyrosine (Rpb2-<italic>Y769</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheung and Cramer, 2011</xref>). Thermodynamically, transiting from the pre-translocated state to the 1-bp backtracked state is favorable, while backtracking for more steps yields no additional energetic benefit. This result can also find structural support: the first backtracked nucleotide is stabilized by a binding pocket formed by several Pol II residues, whereas the second or third backtracked nucleotide makes no additional contact to the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Thus, our model depicts an enzyme with a delicate balance between active elongation and inactive pausing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">von Hippel and Pasman, 2002</xref>). This model can serve as a framework to study the effects of DNA sequence and nascent RNA structure on transcriptional dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tadigotla et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zamft et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, this model may improve our understanding of the control of transcription fidelity. The 1-bp backtracked state is closely associated with the proofreading process of Pol II, as the enzyme in this location preferentially cleaves the 3′ dinucleotide of the RNA containing the mismatched base, empting the active site for NTP binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). It is possible that nucleotide misincorporation slows down forward translocation, thereby promoting the entry to the pausing pathway and the removal of the dinucleotide.</p><p>It is worth noting that we cannot definitively rule out the alternative scenario in which the first unique pausing state corresponds to a non-backtracked intermediate. Nonetheless, no evidence has been found for the universal occurrence of such an intermediate in Pol II transcription. The interpretation that most pauses in Pol II transcription are caused by enzyme backtracking is more parsimonious, especially given the corroborating structural data mentioned above.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Roles of the TL element in transcriptional regulation</title><p>The kinetic characterization of the E1103G mutant Pol II reveals that this TL mutation results in many modifications to the enzyme dynamics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). Between the pre-translocated state and the post-translocated state, the mutant is significantly more biased toward the former than the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). This property, together with its lower forward translocation rate, renders the mutant’s elongation velocity more sensitive to perturbations of its forward translocation, such as an externally applied force (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) or the presence of a nucleosomal barrier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). It has been shown that the inter-conversion between pre- and post-translocated states involves the transitions of the TL between an open conformation and a wedged conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brueckner and Cramer, 2008</xref>). It is plausible that the mutation modulates the enzyme’s translocation kinetics by altering the rates of transition between these two conformations.</p><p>Furthermore, our analyses lead to the conclusion that the faster overall elongation velocity of the mutant is due to its much greater catalysis rate despite a slower translocation step. The increase of the catalysis rate is most likely due to a faster NTP sequestration step induced by the closure of the TL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kireeva et al., 2008</xref>). The lack of hydrogen bonding between T1095 and the mutated E1103 residue may destabilize the open state of the TL and speed up its closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Walmacq et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The E1103G mutation also affects the pausing kinetics. Specifically, a decrease in the activation energy required to return from the first backtracked state to the pre-translocated state accelerates the recovery from a pause (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Consequently, the mutant populates the 1-bp backtracked state less than the wild-type. This property might affect the overall fidelity of transcription. It has been previously shown that E1103G mutation strongly promotes incorporation of non-cognate NMP and mismatch extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaplan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kireeva et al., 2008</xref>). The destabilization of the 1-bp backtracked state relative to the pre-translocated state in the E1103G mutant, established in this work, is consistent with its efficient mismatch extension and suggests that this mutation might also confer a defect in proofreading activity.</p><p>Together, our results suggest that the dynamics of TL are involved in multiple phases of transcription elongation, including translocation, catalysis, and pausing. In vivo, various transcription factors and small molecules can directly manipulate the TL dynamics and regulate transcription elongation. For example, transcription factor IIS (TFIIS) stimulates the endonuclease activity of Pol II by replacing the TL with its zinc finger domain, and thus, rescues transcription elongation by creating a new 3′-end of the transcript at Pol II’s active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kettenberger et al., 2003</xref>). In fact, the viability of yeast cells expressing only the E1103G mutant Pol II is strictly dependent on TFIIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Malagon et al., 2006</xref>). It is interesting to investigate how these trans-acting factors modify the rate-limiting mechanism and detailed kinetics of the elongation reaction. Finally, the elementary rate constants extracted from our analyses should provide a reference frame for future computational studies aiming to fully describe the molecular trajectory of a transcribing polymerase.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Proteins and DNA preparation</title><p>Biotinylated wild-type and E1103G <italic>S. cerevisae</italic> Pol II (unphosphorylated C-terminal domain) were purified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kireeva et al., 2005</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All three reviewers find your work of significant interest and high quality. By measuring the transcription kinetics on bare and nucleosomal DNA, this single-molecule force study dissected the transcription elongation pathway, determined each individual rate constant on the pathway, and mapped out the energy landscape for transcription elongation and backtracking. Instead of assuming that the reversible transition between pre- and post-translocated states of the nucleotide addition cycle occurs much faster than the subsequent catalysis steps, this study found that the forward translocation rate is comparable to the catalysis rate. The results suggest that a linear Brownian Ratchet Model can explain the measured behavior of transcription elongation kinetics. The reviewers feel that the findings in this work are important, the experimental design is elegant, and that the data are of high quality.</p><p>The reviewers have the following concerns regarding the use of the nucleosome barrier as a tool to separately measure the forward and reverse translocation rates. Pol II interactions with a nucleosome are rather complex and hence could complicate the interpretation of data here. One of the key assumptions is that the local nucleosomal DNA fluctuations (wrapping and unwrapping) are faster than Pol II forward translocation. Is this assumption valid for the present study, which uses nucleosomes with the 601 sequence and involves predominant transcriptional pauses close to the nucleosomal dyad? What is the evidence that wrapping/unwrapping kinetics near the dyad of the 601 nucleosome is faster than Pol II translocation? How do the different interaction strengths at different sites of the nucleosome affect the results in this work? Is it possible to obtain the same conclusion using a simpler system without involving nucleosomes? For example, the application of force can also perturb the energy landscape. <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>k</italic><sub>3</sub>, and δ may be obtained by examining <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> as a function of force. This approach removes the need for <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ6">Equation 4</xref> and may potentially remove the need for using nucleosomes. Given the importance of the nucleosome barrier as an experimental tool in the work, the advantages and requirements of using this system should be more clearly explained and justified in the main text.</p><p>The reviewers also feel that the manuscript is written in a very concise and dense manner. It is not easy to follow, especially for non-experts. Give that <italic>eLife</italic> has a broad audience, we suggest that you expand the manuscript to make it easier to read and understand. In particular, the derivations of various kinetic rate constants from experimentally measured quantities are nontrivial and the manuscript often relied on citations of previous papers rather than explaining clearly the rationale of how these rate constants are derived. The manuscript should be made more self-sufficient.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00971.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The reviewers have the following concerns regarding the use of the nucleosome barrier as a tool to separately measure the forward and reverse translocation rates.

The timescale of DNA fluctuations at the nucleosome ends has been studied. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments showed that the first 20–30 bp of nucleosomal DNA spontaneously unwrap and rewrap every 10–250 ms (Li et al., NSMB 2005; Koopmans et al., Chemphyschem. 2008). Since the polymerase moves 1 bp per step, the timescale of Pol II translocation (10 ms–1 s) should be compared to that of one-bp DNA fluctuation, which has not been directly reported but can be estimated from the above experimental results. The average time for 1-bp DNA to open or close on the histone surface is expected to be less than 1 ms (a derivation is shown in the Materials and methods section). In addition, coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations showed that the first 9-bp DNA segment fluctuates very fast (ns–µs timescale) (Voltz et al., Biophys. J. 2012). Therefore, the local DNA in front of the polymerase most likely fluctuates much faster than the translocation of the polymerase. The timescale of DNA fluctuations near the nucleosomal dyad has not been directly studied. Nonetheless, we have previously compared the local wrapping/unwrapping equilibrium constants between the entry and the central regions of the nucleosome and found that they are very similar (Bintu et al., Cell 2012). It is difficult to envision a scenario in which both wrapping and unwrapping rates would slow down by the exact same amount in the central region compared to the entry region of the nucleosome. A much more likely scenario is that the wrapping/unwrapping kinetics of DNA in front of a transcribing polymerase is relatively uniform across the whole nucleosome region. Therefore, we think that the assumption of fast DNA fluctuation compared to Pol II translocation is a reasonable one.</p><p>Regarding the predominant pauses observed near the nucleosomal dyad with the 601 sequence, we have shown that they are due to the lack of secondary structures formed in the nascent transcript behind the transcribing enzyme in this region that induces extensive Pol II backtracking, rather than due to particularly strong histone-DNA interactions (Bintu et al., Cell 2012). Moreover, the pauses were also observed on bare DNA with the same sequence, although to a lesser degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—Figure supplement 4</xref>). In addition, gel-based assays showed a lack of 5-bp or 10-bp pausing periodicity within the nucleosome region for yeast Pol II (Kireeva et al., Mol. Cell 2005; Bondarenko et al., Mol. Cell 2006). Such periodicity would be expected if the strength of the histone-DNA interactions were the major determinant for Pol II pausing (Luger et al., Nature 1997; Hall et al., NSMB 2009). Therefore, we do not think that the strong pauses near the dyad drastically affect the on-pathway kinetic parameters of Pol II (i.e., <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>3</sub>), which were derived from the pause-free velocity. To further rule out the possibility that the different behavior of Pol II near the dyad may bias the values of these kinetic rates, we reanalyzed the pause-free velocity data without a 40-nt span (−35 to +5 relative to the dyad) in the central region of the nucleosome and obtained <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub> = 158±43 s<sup>-1</sup> and <italic>k</italic><sub>3</sub>= 33±2 s<sup>-1</sup> for the wild-type Pol II, and <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub> = 59±4 s<sup>-1</sup> and <italic>k</italic><sub>3</sub> = 120±13 s<sup>-1</sup> for the mutant Pol II at 6.5 pN of applied aiding force. These values are close to those obtained with all the pause-free velocity data and lead to the same conclusion that <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>3</sub> are of the same order of magnitude.</p><p>Nonetheless, it is true that the interaction between Pol II and the nucleosome is rather complex and their interaction may vary at different sites. We simplified the problem by using the averaged values of the pause-free velocity and the fraction of time the local nucleosomal DNA is unwrapped (γ<sub>u</sub>) over the whole nucleosome region to extract the intrinsic kinetic properties of Pol II. This point was probably not stressed enough in the original manuscript. It is now clearly stated in the revised manuscript.</p><p>The reviewers also made an excellent suggestion that <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>k</italic><sub>3</sub>, and <italic>δ</italic> may be extracted by examining <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> as a function of force. This is indeed possible: <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub>(<italic>F</italic>) = <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub>(<italic>F</italic>)<italic>k</italic><sub>3</sub>/(<italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub>(<italic>F</italic>)+<italic>k</italic><sub>3</sub>)*<italic>d</italic>, where <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub>(<italic>F</italic>) = <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub>(0)<italic>e</italic><sup><italic>Fδ/k<sub>B</sub></italic></sup><sup><italic>T</italic></sup>. Using our data and the published data from Larson et al. (Larson et al., PNAS 2012) collected at saturating [NTP] (1 mM) and various forces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6A and 6B</xref>), we fit the <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub>-<italic>F</italic> dependence to the above equation and obtained <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub>= 87±61 s<sup>-1</sup>, <italic>k</italic><sub>3</sub>= 33±8 s<sup>-1</sup>, and <italic>δ</italic> = 0.64±0.58 bp for the wild-type Pol II, and <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub>= 65±37 s<sup>-1</sup>, <italic>k</italic><sub>3</sub>= 62±32 s<sup>-1</sup>, and <italic>δ</italic> = 0.64±0.50 bp for the mutant Pol II. Thus, the same qualitative conclusion, i.e., <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>3</sub> are comparable and translocation is one of the rate-limiting steps, can be drawn from this analysis. Compared to the approach in which the nucleosomal barrier is used to specifically perturb forward translocation, fitting the <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub>-<italic>F</italic> dependence involves one additional free parameter (<italic>δ</italic>) and the values are less constrained. If we fix <italic>δ</italic> at 0.5 bp and only fit for <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>3</sub> using the <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub>-<italic>F</italic> dependence, the values are better bound (<italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub>= 72±13 s<sup>-1</sup> and <italic>k</italic><sub>3</sub>= 35±3 s<sup>-1</sup> for the wild-type; <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub>= 55±10 s<sup>-1</sup> and <italic>k</italic><sub>3</sub>= 75±13 s<sup>-1</sup> for the mutant). However, this analysis involves one additional assumption (<italic>δ</italic> = 0.5 bp), which may not always be valid as is the case for the mutant Pol II (<italic>δ</italic> = 0.24±0.05 bp). One reason for this relatively poor fitting is that force has a relatively small effect on <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub>, given the small step size of the polymerase (1 bp or 0.34 nm). The nucleosomal barrier effectively decreases <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub> by 40%. The same amount of reduction would require 13 pN of opposing force, which is not feasible because the operational stall force for Pol II is only ∼8 pN due to backtracking (Galburt et al., Nature 2007). In the revised Discussion section, we have added a comparison between the two approaches of using force or nucleosome to extract the kinetic parameters of Pol II transcription.</p><p><italic>The reviewers also feel that the manuscript is written in a very concise and dense manner.
