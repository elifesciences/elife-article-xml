loss links to plasticity remains largely unknown. To understand the mechanisms and mediators regulating plasticity upon polarity loss, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovaries, where inducing polarity-gene <italic>l(2)gl</italic>-knockdown (Lgl-KD) causes invasive multilayering of the follicular epithelia. Analyzing the integrated Lgl-KD and <italic>wildtype</italic> transcriptomes, we discovered the cells specific to the various discernible phenotypes and characterized the underlying gene expression. A genetic requirement of Keap1-Nrf2 signaling in promoting multilayer formation of Lgl-KD cells was further identified. Ectopic expression of Keap1 increased the volume of delaminated follicle cells that showed enhanced invasive behavior with significant changes to the cytoskeleton. Overall, our findings describe the comprehensive transcriptome of cells within the follicle cell tumor model at the single-cell resolution and identify a previously unappreciated link between Keap1-Nrf2 signaling and cell plasticity at early tumorigenesis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>In the body, most cells exhibit some form of spatial asymmetry: the compartments within the cell are not evenly distributed, thereby allowing the cells to know whether a surface is on the ‘outside’ or the ‘inside’ of a tissue or organ. In the cells of epithelial tissues, which line most of the cavities and the organs in the body, this asymmetry is known as apical-basal polarity. Maintaining apical-basal polarity in epithelial cells is one of the main barriers that stops cancer cells from invading other tissues, which is the first step of metastasis, the process through which cancer cells leave their tissue of our origin and spread to distant locations in the body.</p><p>In the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, scientists have engineered cells in several tissues to stop producing the proteins that help establish apical-basal polarity, in an effort to study the earliest steps of tumor formation. Unfortunately, these experiments frequently lead to rampant metastasis, making it difficult to identify the earliest changes that make the tumor cells more likely to become invasive. Therefore, finding a tissue in which loss of apical-basal polarity does not cause aggressive cancer progression is necessary to address this gap in knowledge.</p><p>The epithelial cell layer lining the ovaries of fruit flies may be such a tissue. When these cells lose their apical-basal polarity, rather than becoming metastatic and spreading to distant organs, they interleave with each other, forming a tumorous growth that only invades into the neighboring compartment. Chatterjee et al. used this system to study individual invasive cells. They wanted to know whether the genes that these cells switch on and off are known to be involved in human cancers, and if so, which of them control the invasive behavior of tumor cells.</p><p>Chatterjee et al. determined that when cells in the fruit-fly ovary lost their polarity, they turned genes on and off in a pattern similar to that seen both in mammalian cancers and in tumors from other fly tissues. One of the notable changes they observed in the ovarian cells that lost apical-basal polarity was the activation of the Keap1/Nrf2 oxidative-stress signaling pathway, which normally protects cells from damage caused by excessive oxidation. In the ovarian cells, however, the activation of these genes also led to aggressive invasion of the collective tumor cells into the neighboring compartment.</p><p>Interestingly, this increase in invasiveness was characterized by polarized changes within the cells, specifically in the scaffolding that allows cells to keep their shape and move: the edge of the cells leading the invasion had greater levels of a protein called actin, which enables the cells to protrude into the neighboring compartments.</p><p>Chatterjee et al. have identified a new mechanism that impacts the migratory behavior of cells. Insights from their findings will pave the way for a better understanding of how and when this mechanism plays a role in metastasis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell polarity</kwd><kwd>follicle cells</kwd><kwd>collective cell invasion</kwd><kwd>Keap1-Nrf2</kwd><kwd>transcriptomics</kwd><kwd>scRNA-seq</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Comprehensive transcriptomic analyses describe the underlying tumorigenic gene expression state in the invasive <italic>Drosophila</italic> follicle cells following the loss of epithelial cell polarity and identify a non-canonical role of Keap1-Nrf2 signaling in regulating collective cell invasion.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Apical–basal cell polarity acts as a major gatekeeper against tumorigenesis in epithelial tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Royer and Lu, 2011</xref>). While its dysregulation is commonly associated with tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chatterjee and Deng, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rudrapatna et al., 2012</xref>), cell polarity disruption is tightly controlled to also allow cellular movement during critical developmental processes such as gastrulation and wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barriere et al., 2015</xref>). This regulation of cell polarity enables the cells to undergo changes in plasticity, which is the ability of cells to change their phenotype in response to environmental factors without acquiring genetic mutations. Plasticity in these cells facilitates epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) causing them to lose apical–basal polarity and weaken cell–cell adhesion with the purpose of promoting their movement beyond the confined space of the tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moreno-Bueno et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Plygawko et al., 2020</xref>). For these reasons, EMT is also associated with behaviors such as increased invasiveness and metastatic migration of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brabletz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mani et al., 2008</xref>). Recently emerging consensus in the field of EMT research draws attention to the presence of a continuum of metastable cells undergoing partial-EMT in cancer tissues, instead of one stable state of either epithelial or mesenchymal identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grigore et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Saxena et al., 2020</xref>). A significant gap exists in our understanding of how these different metastable cell states are supported by the underlying gene expression and how it determines the overall behavior of the tumor cells.</p><p>Epithelial polarity is maintained by the mutually antagonizing, spatially restricted protein complexes at the apical and basolateral cytosolic domains of the cell that are frequently found disrupted in several cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elsum et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang and Muthuswamy, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Parker et al., 2014</xref>). A causative link between polarity loss and tumorigenesis has since been established in the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, where the loss of basolateral polarity proteins – such as Scribble (Scrib), Discs large (Dlg), and Lethal giant larvae (l(2)gl or simply, Lgl) – combined with oncogenic Notch or Ras signaling, causes malignant tumorigenesis in several tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chatterjee and Deng, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Enomoto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Papagiannouli and Mechler, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Papagiannouli and Mechler, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">St Johnston and Ahringer, 2010</xref>). While several advances have since been made in identifying genetic factors that regulate tumorigenesis in the wing-disc tumor model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atkins et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dillard et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doggett et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Logeay et al., 2022</xref>), our understanding of the mechanisms driving neoplastic remodeling of the tissue is lacking. This limitation is due to (1) the use of bulk tissue-based approaches that cannot resolve the cellular heterogeneity inherent to the growing tumor, and (2) rampant malignancy in the wing-disc tumor model that obscures characterization of individual cell behavior. In a recent study, we drew attention to the phenotypic heterogeneity within multilayered follicle cells of <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovaries where Lgl-knockdown (Lgl-KD) is induced to cause polarity loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jevitt et al., 2021</xref>). Even in the presence of oncogenic Notch signaling, these multilayered cells displayed continued survival and sustained growth without causing long-distance metastasis when transplanted into the host’s abdomen. This lack of oncogenic complexity provides an opportunity to study the behavior of discrete dysplastic cells upon polarity loss and determine how the underlying gene expression might regulate it.</p><p>The normally developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> follicular epithelium has been instrumental in our understanding of cellular plasticity that facilitates developmental EMT and collective migration of the anterior follicle cells and border cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Silver et al., 2001</xref>). In 2019, we published a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic atlas describing the gene expression signatures of individual <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> follicle cells, which also included the abovementioned cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jevitt et al., 2020</xref>). In this study, we utilized the <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> follicle cell dataset as a template to isolate Lgl-KD cells that exhibit gene expression that is divergent from that of the normally developing (as in <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>) follicle cells. We characterized the transcriptomic signatures of these abnormal cells and validated their association with the distinct phenotypes that are observed within the ovaries containing Lgl-KD follicle cells. The oxidative stress-responsive Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway was found to be enriched in the multilayered cells and unexpectedly, manipulating the expression of both Keap1 and Nrf2 was found to regulate the invasiveness of collective Lgl-KD cells with significant F-actin remodeling. Overall, our findings in this study describe the earliest transcriptomic changes within dysplastic cells of the follicular epithelia with polarity loss in its cells and identify novel regulatory pathways that determine plasticity in the invading tumor.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Lgl silencing causes distinct phenotypic and transcriptomic changes in egg chambers</title><p>Using the pan follicle cell <italic>traffic jam</italic> (<italic>tj</italic>)-Gal4 driver with temperature-sensitive (TS) Gal80 (Gal80<sup>TS</sup>) repressor to control transcriptional induction, follicle cell-specific RNAi-mediated silencing of Lgl (Lgl-KD) was induced in adult female flies for 72 hr, which resulted in the premature failure of oogenesis. This failure of egg development resulted in the accumulation of degenerated egg chambers within the epithelial sheath (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Additionally, phospho-Histone 3 (pH3) accumulation was observed in the follicle cells at the egg chamber termini during mid-oogenesis, when normal follicle cells of the experimental control and Lgl-KD follicle cells in the lateral epithelia cease to undergo mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Cross-section of these egg chambers revealed significant multilayering of the epithelia, where cells exhibited decreased expression of the differentiated follicle cell marker Hindsight (Hnt) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sun and Deng, 2007</xref>) and increased expression of the immature cell marker Cut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">López-Schier and St Johnston, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sun and Deng, 2005</xref>), suggesting changes to the expected cell fate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). To determine how Lgl loss of function affects epithelial cell plasticity, we stained them with common epithelial cell markers Shotgun or Shg (also known as DE-Cad, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of E-cadherin) and its binding partner Armadillo or Arm (<italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of α-catenin). Both Shg and Arm staining displayed gradually decreasing enrichment at the multilayered cell junctions along the apical–basal axis, with the basal-most layer expressing Shg at levels comparable to that observed in the monolayered cells of the experimental control egg chambers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). When the intensities of F-actin (Phalloidin) and Shg were measured along the apical–basal axis of the invasive multilayer shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, significant decrease in Shg enrichment was observed along with mildly elevated F-actin at the apical-most tip of the invading group of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Apically invasive movement was also detected in the single-cell derived, positively marked (GFP+) <italic>lgl<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> MARCM clones, as well as groups of mitotic clones derived from negatively marked (GFP-) homozygous <italic>lgl<sup>4</sup></italic> mutant follicle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Quantifying our observations across five independent experiments, we found that multilayering at midoogenesis was the most prevalent (83.25%; n = 280) large-scale phenotype observed across the different stages of oogenesis in <italic>tj<sup>TS</sup>&gt;lgl<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> ovarioles after 72 hr of Lgl-knockdown (72h-Lgl-KD) induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Additionally, about 6.05% (n = 280) of egg chambers displayed fused egg chambers at early oogenesis, while degenerated egg chambers were observed in about half of all egg chambers (51.86%; n = 280) at developmental stages beyond stage 9 or 10 during late oogenesis as a consequence of germline cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

To test this, we performed whole-tissue RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of ovarian tissues from both experimental control and Lgl-KD flies with RNAi induction for 24 hr (shorter) and 96 hr (longer periods of time).

Border cell-specific expression of <italic>sn</italic> further implied that once the egg chambers have individualized, the polar to border cell fate is not disrupted upon Lgl-KD, despite the impairment of border cell migration. In contrast, clusters 7, 13, and 16 did not exhibit markers distinguishable from the normally developing cells from which they likely originate. While markers of immature, mitotic follicle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jevitt et al., 2020</xref>) such as <italic>Myc</italic>, <italic>Df31,</italic> and <italic>HmgD</italic> were detected in cluster 13, it showed significant overlap with cluster 16, with the notable exception of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Cdc25 homolog <italic>string</italic> (<italic>stg</italic>) expression. This difference in Stg expression led us to believe that clusters 13 and 16 represent immature (mitotic) and mature (endocycling) follicle cells. Additionally, very few specific markers were identified for cluster 7 as the markers either shared gene expression with (1) the main body follicle cells (expressing <italic>Yp2</italic> and <italic>Yp3</italic>), suggestive of a shared (and possibly, derivative) lineage, and (2) clusters 8, 13, and 16, exhibiting only quantitative differences between them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). While such results are insightful, these observations somewhat highlight the limitations of marker validation to identify specific cells of the differential Lgl-KD phenotype.</p><p>Instead of focusing on individual gene expression, we assessed the transcription factor (TF) regulon activity in the unique Lgl-KD clusters using SCENIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aibar et al., 2017</xref>). We specifically focused on cluster 7 (1144 cells), cluster 8 (913 cells), and cluster 13 (538 cells), and removed clusters 16 and 17 from the regulon analysis due to their low cell numbers (128 and 79 cells, respectively). While clusters 7 and 13 showed major differences in the enriched regulons, we found only two regulons (Hr4 and crc_extended) specific to cluster 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Hierarchically grouping the clusters based on scaled regulon activity found cluster 7 to be more similar to cluster 8 than cluster 13, as was also evident from the relatively lower values for the enrichment of several regulons. To further explore this relatedness between the clusters, we evaluated regulon specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Suo et al., 2018</xref>) for each cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). The five most specifically enriched regulons of cluster 7 included the TFs crc (regulon specificity score [RSS] = 0.42), Xbp1 (0.42), Pdp1 (0.41), BEAF-32 (0.41), and CrebA (0.41) and were identified alongside the AP-1 TFs <italic>Jra</italic> (0.4) and <italic>kay</italic> (0.39) that have been reported to drive tumorigenic JNK signaling upon polarity loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bunker et al., 2015</xref>).

Consolidating the results from marker validation, RNA velocity-based lineage inference and the relative specificity as well as activity of detected regulons, a dynamic gene expression profile was observed in cluster 7 cells. These cells are derived from both mitotic cells (as velocity vectors can be seen transitioning from cluster 13 to 7) as well as endocycling cells (given the expression of main body follicle cell markers) and represent a transcriptomic state preceding that of the cluster 8 (that represents cells at a later developmental timepoint), as the enriched regulons show similar specificity but elevated activity from cluster 7 to cluster 8.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Cluster 7 represents transient cells with heterogenous gene expression</title><p>Among the regulons exhibiting elevated activity in cluster 7 than cluster 8, the JNK signaling-associated AP-1 TFs <italic>Jra</italic> and <italic>kay</italic> have been previously implicated in polarity loss-induced metastatic tumor formation in the wing discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bunker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Igaki et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Külshammer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Uhlirova and Bohmann, 2006</xref>). We then sought to assess the presence of tumorigenic JNK signaling in our Lgl-KD follicle cell model using quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR. We specifically assessed the transcript levels of genes such as Ets at 21C (Ets21C), TNFα-receptor Grindelwald (grnd), Jra, kay, and the downstream target matrix metalloproteinase-1 (Mmp1), which are associated with tumorigenic JNK signaling network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Toggweiler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Uhlirova and Bohmann, 2006</xref>) in whole ovaries with Lgl-KD in all follicle cells.

The underlying lineage among these subclusters was then inferred from the inherent RNA velocity specific to cells in cluster 7. From the stream of velocity vectors superimposed on the cells embedded on UMAP space, we deduced that clusters 7_0 (293 cells) and 7_2 (193 cells) were the ‘roots’ of the inferred lineage that terminated into cluster 7_1 (291 cells), while clusters 7_3 (191 cells) and 7_4 (176 cells) were the intermediate states of transcriptional transition. To describe the regulatory relationships of TFs in all cluster 7 cells, we evaluated which of them might cooperate with each other by assessing the Connection Specificity Index (CSI) metric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fuxman Bass et al., 2013</xref>). Hierarchically clustering the 16 regulons active in cluster 7 (including those that are suffixed ‘_extended’ since they incorporate low-confidence TF associations and are inclusive of more genes), we inferred that the regulons could be organized into two larger clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). One of these highly correlated clusters contained both the AP-1 TF heterodimers <italic>Jra</italic> and <italic>kay</italic> along with the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TF <italic>Usf, ftz transcription factor 1</italic> (<italic>ftz-f1</italic>) and the GATA-binding TF <italic>serpent</italic> (<italic>srp</italic>).

Furthermore, when the relative activity of these regulons was compared between clusters, highly cooperative regulons showed similar extent of enrichment for each cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). For example, regulons associated with TFs Jra and kay showed low activity in clusters representing earlier timepoints, intermediate enrichment in the transitioning clusters and high activity in the terminal cluster. Similarly, the Ets21C regulon exhibit a pattern that was opposite to that shown by the AP-1 TFs.

This conclusion was in agreement with the assignment of clusters 7_0 and 7_2 as ‘roots’ and 7_1 as the ‘terminal’ state, and we hypothesized that these cells were those that comprised the heterogenous multilayer. We were particularly interested in identifying the differentially enriched markers of cluster 7_3, which were composed of cells that transitioned from the mature cell cluster 7_0, as the underlying gene expression in them would likely represent the multilayered cells at the leading edge, given that the invasive front is composed of delaminating postmitotic follicle cells.

To test how <italic>Keap1</italic> manipulation regulates Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway in the ovaries with and without Lgl-KD follicle cells, we assessed the relative levels of pathway components in the different genotypes using qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). We found that in the absence of Lgl-KD either overexpression or knockdown of <italic>Keap1</italic> did not significantly affect the levels of <italic>cnc</italic> but caused a decrease in the levels of GstD2, the bona fide target of Keap1-Nrf2 pathway. Manipulating Keap1 also did not cause a decrease in the number of egg chambers (data not shown) with migrating border cells that specifically express the GstD-lacZ reporter independent of Lgl-KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), thereby suggesting that the change is not because of the relative loss of sample. In the presence of Lgl-KD, however, overexpressing Keap1 caused an increase in GstD2 levels that was comparable to that observed in Lgl-KD alone. In these egg chambers with Lgl-KD+Keap1-OE follicle cells, we noticed a remarkable worsening of the Lgl-KD phenotype as the egg chambers appeared both multilayered as well as increasingly fused (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). We also observed epithelial ‘bridging’ in several egg chambers (n = 119/185) at midoogenesis, where the multilayered cells formed invasive inroads through the recesses between germline cells that connected to the lateral epithelia, forming a bridge between two separate sections of the follicular epithelia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, arrowheads). While ectopic expression of UAS-CncC (longest isoform of wildtype Cnc; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sykiotis and Bohmann, 2008</xref>) also resulted in some enhancement of the Lgl-KD multilayering as well as fused egg chambers at early oogenesis (N = 39/121), it did not exhibit the ‘bridging’ phenotype in egg chambers at midoogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). However, that the fused egg chamber phenotype occurred due to increased invasiveness, and not as a consequence of two individualized egg chambers fusing at the ends due to improper stalk cell differentiation, was evident from the observation that nurse cell nuclei were abnormally compressed by the invasive fronts of collectively migrating Lgl-KD+CncC-OE follicle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Phenotypic enhancement in Lgl-KD+CncC-OE was also verified by observing increased multilayer formation in egg chambers at midoogenesis in 22.85% intact ovarioles (N = 16/70) at 2 days after heat shock (AHS) induction, which is an insufficient amount of time for Lgl-KD to exhibit multilayering (only 2% egg chambers showed multilayering; N = 50 ovarioles) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We believe that the CncC-mediated enhancement is partially caused by the autonomous activation of Keap1 in the UAS-CncC-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sykiotis and Bohmann, 2008</xref>) and that the increased egg chamber fusion is a phenotype specific to the earlier developmental stages. Nonetheless, given that the invasive phenotype was not regulated by antagonizing functions of Keap1 and Cnc, the increased invasiveness of Lgl-KD by Keap1 overexpression was likely controlled by the noncanonical functions of Keap1-Nrf2 signaling outside its role in oxidative stress response.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Elevated Keap1 increases collective invasiveness of multilayered cells</title><p>Unlike the Lgl-KD multilayers, in the egg chambers with Lgl-KD+Keap1-OE or Lgl-KD+CncC-OE enhanced invasion, we noticed gaps within the multilayers, indicating a probable loss of cell–cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

We believe that our observations of tumor-like behavior in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> follicle cell model support several of these conclusions from mammalian studies and our in-depth characterization of the underlying transcriptome at single-cell resolution represents an important step toward developing a unified understanding of gene expression changes driving early tumorigenesis following polarity loss.</p><p>Among our primary findings is the identification of a heterogenous group of cells that transcriptomically deviate from their corresponding cells of origin. Given the absence of distinguishable markers (compared to the normally developing cells of origin), we hypothesized that these clusters represent divergent cell states and not unique cell types. Indeed, the cells in these clusters are characterized by only a relative enrichment of differentially expressing, tumorigenic stress signaling markers that have been previously identified from studies using the wing-disc tumor model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bunker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hamaratoglu and Atkins, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mundorf et al., 2019</xref>). Validating the expression of these markers using expression reporters and antibodies against specific proteins, we detected them either in the multilayered cells or in the polarity-deficient follicle cells at late stages of aborted development. Among the earliest distinguishable phenotypes, activation of Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway was detected within the multilayered cells, which was likely a response to the elevated ER stress (evidenced by an enrichment of <italic>crc</italic>, <italic>Xbp1,</italic> and several CREB/ATF-associated regulons in those cells) as has also been previously reported to happen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wortel et al., 2017</xref>). This, however, does not occur on account of significant build-up of oxidative stress as neither the superoxide-detector dihydroethidium (DHE) nor the common oxidative stress response genes were detected in the multilayers or in cluster 7, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Nonetheless, the role of oxidative stress cannot be ruled out entirely since a stressed ER also causes the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Limia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wortel et al., 2017</xref>) that would directly impact Keap1 structure, allowing increased Nrf2-mediated transcription. Considering this redundancy in signaling regulation, it is difficult to ascertain the direct cause of Keap1-Nrf2 pathway activation in the multilayered cells from these experiments alone. Our conclusions from this study therefore warrant further investigations to understand the precise cause of Keap1-Nrf2 signaling activation in the cells with polarity loss.</p><p>Given that the role of Keap1-Nrf2 signaling in cancers is more commonly investigated by using loss-of-function mutants of <italic>KEAP1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wu and Papagiannakopoulos, 2020</xref>), the role of its <italic>wildtype</italic> protein in regulating tumor cell behavior remains largely unexplored. Outside its role as a redox sensor, limited studies have indeed identified additional roles of Keap1 in regulating invasive cell behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rachakonda et al., 2010</xref>) and maintaining cytoskeletal stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yamaguchi and Condeelis, 2007</xref>). <italic>Wildtype</italic> Keap1 has been shown to inhibit single-cell motility by strengthening stress fibers bundles via upregulated RhoA activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wu et al., 2018</xref>), but also stabilizing focal adhesion assemblies by reducing their turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dinkova-Kostova et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Velichkova and Hasson, 2003</xref>). Reduction in focal adhesion turnover maintains mature adhesions that are resistant to disassembly as cells change shape and protrude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fessenden et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Oakes et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, the observation of Keap1-induced enhancement of Lgl-KD cell invasion having high F-actin enrichment likely reflects these autonomous cytoskeletal changes. Our study, therefore, attributes a highly tumor-relevant function to Keap1 as it stands to play during the earliest stages of locally growing tumors, during which the cellular burden of mutations is low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bozic et al., 2010</xref>). Recently, dynamic regulation of Nrf2 within the collectively invading cancer cells has been shown to also have an effect on the metastable states of cancer cells displaying partial EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bocci et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vilchez Mercedes et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>). It is therefore also possible that in our experiments Nrf2 expression regulates the metastability of Lgl-KD cells by indirectly modulating Keap1 as a result of which the invasive behavior of the delaminated tissue on the whole is likely being determined.</p><p>Conclusions from existing investigations of Keap1’s role in cytoskeletal regulation are often confounded by the lack of a standardized approach to define semantics relevant to the distinct invasion/migration patterns in cells and how they may relate to the different steps of metastatic progression. Applying a framework developed for cancer cells to address potential mechanisms of migratory behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Friedl et al., 2012</xref>), we further characterized the invasive behavior of multilayered cells. Enriched F-actin at the leading edge of invasive fronts is a hallmark of invasive membrane protrusions of leader cells in a collectively migrating cell cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eddy et al., 2017</xref>) and is frequently observed in tumor buds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grigore et al., 2016</xref>). In our observations, we concluded that the delaminated cells showed leading-edge behavior based on the differential enrichment of F-actin in cells at the invasive front. Moreover, the presence of holes within the epithelia – which was not observed in Lgl-KD multilayers alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goode et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Szafranski and Goode, 2007</xref>) – further suggested that the delaminating cells exhibit a differential capacity to migrate as the holes would likely have been filled if every cell could either exert independent migratory force or exhibit uniform proliferation to compensate for the increased invasiveness. It is therefore plausible that the increase in polarized invasiveness is able to outrun the pace of cell division, leaving behind gaps in the delaminated epithelia. Despite strong evidence suggesting that ectopic Keap1 drives leading-edge-directed collective invasion of Lgl-KD multilayers, our conclusions are mildly tempered by the constraints of available space within the egg chambers, which limits the ability to separate collective invasion maintained by weak cell–cell adhesions and random movements of cells in the narrow passage between the germline cells. Time-lapse or live imaging of this invasive behavior could be used in subsequent studies to understand the underlying mechanism better. Nonetheless, our study presents an innovative analytical approach, which identifies novel regulators of tumor cell behavior in vivo in the polarity-deficient <italic>Drosophila</italic> follicular tumor model.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly husbandry</title><p>Flies were reared under standard lab conditions at 25°C and were fed dry yeast a day before dissections.

We applied scVelo to obtain information on the underlying lineage for (1) all unique Lgl-KD clusters and (2) cluster 7 cells. The cells of the unique Lgl-KD clusters represent a mixed population of mitotic, postmitotic, border follicle cells, and dying germline cell-associating cells that depict inconsistent transcriptional lineages. In this group of cells, the true developmental end point of the observed Lgl-KD lineage is cluster 8 (germline cell death occurs at the end of Lgl-KD follicular development), which likely consists of a mixed population of cells from the lateral epithelia as well as the multilayered epithelia, all responding to germline cell death. Indeed, certain sections of cluster 7 appear more similar to cluster 8 and others seem comparable to that of cluster 13. These observations underscore our conclusions that the unique Lgl-KD clusters exhibit distinguishable gene expression, representing different cell states. For cluster 7, the state of transcriptomic heterogeneity is what defines its unique state of gene expression and we have assessed this heterogeneity by specifically subsetting those cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-2"><title>Regulon analysis using SCENIC</title><p>Regulon activity was assessed using the R package SCENIC v1.1.2-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aibar et al., 2017</xref>). Expression matrix from the ‘spliced’ assay in each cell along with the corresponding Seurat metadata were used as input for SCENIC.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and David James as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Mayu Inaba (Reviewer #1); Stefan Bekiranov (Reviewer #2); José M Martín-Durán (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Provide higher magnification images.</p><p>2) Determine (or predict) cells of each cluster, especially for some key clusters (including 7_3) within actual tissue by co-staining of several identified genes.</p><p>3) Measure Nrf2 protein levels Nrf2 protein levels in flies with and without Lgl-KD with various manipulations of Keap1 including control, KD, and OE.</p><p>4) Review major findings that show that Lgl is a tumor suppressor as is its human homologue Hugl-1 as well as making a stronger case that studying Lgl-KD in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is relevant for tumorigenesis and EMT. This information should be added to the discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>As I noted in public review, I would suggest authors to improve images now these are low magnification and difficult to see individual cells.

They are sufficiently detailed and the relevant analyses, experiments, reframing and clarifications are effectively suggested there.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I do not have any major concerns on the manuscript. I think the analyses (computation and experimental) are done to high standards and the experimental validation of the single cell transcriptomic analyses is crucial to provide a clear understanding of the transcriptional changes brought by Lgl-KD. However, the authors might want to clarify the timings used for scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq. Why were 72h-induction originally chosen and selected for scRNA-seq? I do not think it is needed, but why did not the authors include 72h in the whole-tissue RNA-seq samples?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80956.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Provide higher magnification images.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to the reviewer’s comments, we have modified the images in several figures. The revised manuscript has entirely new (or improved versions of) image panels in figure 5. In figure 1A, the focus is the entire ovariole and therefore, we have only highlighted the enrichment of Hnt and pH3 antibody staining separately for a subsetted region of interest (ROI). The ROI panels are included within the larger image itself. For figure 6, we have converted the LUTs of panels showing distinct channels for RFP and Shg/Arm antibody stainings to grayscale.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Determine (or predict) cells of each cluster, especially for some key clusters (including 7_3) within actual tissue by co-staining of several identified genes.</p></disp-quote><p>Unlike other studies where different clusters exhibit unique markers, the clusters derived from our integrated analysis do not exhibit mutually exclusive gene expression (with the exception of drpr/crq+ cluster 8). This is especially true for cluster 7, where the sub-clusters represent transitioning cell states and not distinguishable cell types. As is also evident from Figure 2B, the unique Lgl-KD specific clusters continue to show the enrichment of several stage-specific markers (e.g., <italic>peb</italic>, <italic>mirr</italic>, <italic>brk</italic>, <italic>mid</italic> and <italic>slbo</italic>) that are specific to the <italic>wild-type</italic> (<italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup>) follicle cells at corresponding developmental stages during midoogenesis. This result suggests that even though the Lgl-KD cells transcriptomically deviate from their corresponding cells of origin to form their own clusters, they continue to express several markers that show gene-expression overlap with normal follicle cells, thereby exacerbating the problem of identifying these cells using differentially-enriched markers.</p><p>To determine how the unique clusters of Lgl-KD distinguish from the <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> cells, we identified an upregulation of <italic>JNK</italic> signaling, Keap1-Nrf2 signaling as well as UPR-stress signaling, which are likely all related to each other. Puckered (puc) expression and pJNK staining has been detected in the egg chambers with either multilayers or apoptotic germline cells – however, <italic>JNK</italic> activity is not distinguishable between cluster 7 and cluster 8, as it is activated in both tumorigenic conditions as well as during apoptotic-cell clearance. We have validated the expression of Drpr (which is expressed in the Lgl-KD follicle cells surrounding the dying germline cells, as well as in the <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> follicle cells surrounding the dying nurse cells at later stages of normal development) and Mmp1 expression (which is expressed downstream of <italic>JNK</italic> signaling and only at later stages of terminated egg-chamber development containing when Lgl-KD is induced in follicle cells). Besides these 2 markers, we have also validated the presence of Keap1-Nrf2 signaling activity in the multilayered cells (Figure 4G). In the revised manuscript, we have provided further validation of UPR stress signaling activation by using the Xbp1-GFP sensor in the Lgl-KD egg chambers. We found Xbp1-GFP expression in all follicle cells of egg chambers that contain apoptotic follicle cells, with their earliest expression in the multilayered cells. Additionally, we validated Thor (the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein) expression in cluster 7 (mild expression) and cluster 8 (high expression). Images for pJNK, puc, Xbp1-GFP and Thor have been added to the Supplementary figures.</p><p>Among the markers enriched in the sub-groups of cluster 7 (Figure 4D), one can see that the differential markers enriched in each group is not so “differential” after all – as each marker shows some level of expression in almost all cluster-7 cells with only relative differences in their scaled expression. This is evident from GstD2 expression, which is highest in cluster 7_3 (Figure 4D) but is detected as a (relatively) differential marker of cluster 7 among the unique Lgl-KD clusters (Figure 3C) as well as in the integrated analysis with <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> clusters (Supplementary Figure 3B). In summary, multilayering/apically-invading Lgl-KD cells do not exhibit distinguishable gene-expression changes from their cells of origin, with the exception of cytoskeletal changes, <italic>JNK</italic> signaling and stress signaling – all 3 of which have been individually validated at the level of both mRNA expression as well as protein localization. Additional validation of the functional relevance of Keap1-Nrf2 pathway have been achieved via genetic-epistasis experiments. These clusters therefore most likely represent separable cell <italic>states</italic> and not distinguishable cell <italic>types</italic>. This rationale has been included in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Measure Nrf2 protein levels Nrf2 protein levels in flies with and without Lgl-KD with various manipulations of Keap1 including control, KD, and OE.</p></disp-quote><p>In the current manuscript, we have measured mRNA levels of Nrf2 (Cnc) as well as that of GstD2, the bona fide target of the Keap1-Nrf2 oxidative-stress signaling pathway in the different genetic backgrounds involving Lgl-KD, Keap1-OE and Keap1-KD as well as the experimental control. These assays do not represent expression levels within individual cells from the multilayers, as the samples are derived from whole ovaries. Given the lack of distinguishable markers, we cannot sort single cells from within the multilayers and so, detecting protein levels would also suffer from similar shortcomings. GstD-lacZ expression being sporadic and transient in individual cells (as every cell responds to oxidative stress differently), it cannot be used as a quantifiable measure of pathway activation. However, its expression is differentially observed within the multilayers, leading us to only conclude that the pathway is indeed active in the invasive multilayered cells.</p><p>From the results discussed in the previous version of the manuscript, it was unclear how the mutually-antagonizing relationship between Keap1 and Nrf2 (that is essential to their antioxidant response) effects the observed phenotype. In the revised manuscript, we have performed additional experiments to comprehensively conclude that the phenotype is not dependent on the relationship between Keap1 and Nrf2. Along with the evidence that other oxidative-stress response genes (Nox, Duox, Sod1 and Cat) are not active in cluster 7 and that ROS is not detected in these cells (no significant DHE staining), we believe that Keap1-Nrf2 mediated oxidative-stress response is likely not regulating the invasive phenotype directly. Knocking down both Keap1 and Cnc decreases multilayer growth and overexpressing them individually promotes Lgl-KD invasion. In light of the genetic epistasis experiments (that have made the assessment of Keap1 and Nrf2 expression levels irrelevant) and the abovementioned evidence (as well as the aforementioned technical difficulties), measuring Nrf2 protein levels won’t be able to add any significance to the study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Review major findings that show that Lgl is a tumor suppressor as is its human homologue Hugl-1 as well as making a stronger case that studying Lgl-KD in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is relevant for tumorigenesis and EMT. This information should be added to the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this concern by rewriting the Discussion section. In the first paragraph, we have discussed how inducing polarity loss via Lgl knockdown is relevant to human cancers. We have also added new paragraphs discussing Keap1’s role in cytoskeletal regulation and how they may relate to the different aspects of metastasis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I do not have any major concerns on the manuscript. I think the analyses (computation and experimental) are done to high standards and the experimental validation of the single cell transcriptomic analyses is crucial to provide a clear understanding of the transcriptional changes brought by Lgl-KD. However, the authors might want to clarify the timings used for scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq. Why were 72h-induction originally chosen and selected for scRNA-seq? I do not think it is needed, but why did not the authors include 72h in the whole-tissue RNA-seq samples?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their words of affirmation, and hope that they will also appreciate the revisions that now make this story have an even sharper message. The following paragraph has been added to the Methods section (within the subsection “Single-Cell RNA-Sequencing Sample Preparation”) to address this issue:</p><p>“In contrast to the 24h and 96h time-points chosen for whole-tissue RNA-Seq experiments, we chose 72h as the time-point to construct the scRNA-Seq dataset. This was chosen to mitigate the effects of increased germline cell-death at 96h which, at 96h, would produce significant debris that could contaminate the ovarian transcriptome by means of the ambient RNA within droplets. Additionally, wide-spread multilayering is first observed after 72h of Lgl-KD induction, which is significantly enhanced at 96h. We argued that whole-tissue RNA-Seq analysis would only be able to capture statistically significant, multilayer-specific differential gene expression when the multilayers are significantly enhanced. However, given that gene expression is resolved for individual cells in scRNA-Seq, preparing the dataset for cells derived from the 72h time-point would be sufficient.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
