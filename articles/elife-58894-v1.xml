but the neural circuits linking stress to these responses are not well understood. Here, we describe a novel population of lateral septum neurons expressing neurotensin (LS<sup>Nts</sup>) in mice that are selectively tuned to specific types of stress. LS<sup>Nts</sup> neurons increase their activity during active escape, responding to stress when flight is a viable option, but not when associated with freezing or immobility. Chemogenetic activation of LS<sup>Nts</sup> neurons decreases food intake and body weight, without altering locomotion and anxiety. LS<sup>Nts</sup> neurons co-express several molecules including Glp1r (glucagon-like peptide one receptor) and manipulations of Glp1r signaling in the LS recapitulates the behavioral effects of LS<sup>Nts</sup> activation. Activation of LS<sup>Nts</sup> terminals in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) also decreases food intake. These results show that LS<sup>Nts</sup> neurons are selectively tuned to active escape stress and can reduce food consumption via effects on hypothalamic pathways.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>stress</kwd><kwd>feeding</kwd><kwd>anorexia</kwd><kwd>lateral septum</kwd><kwd>neurotensin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007457</institution-id><institution>JPB Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Friedman</surname><given-names>Jeffrey M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005310</institution-id><institution>Klarman Family Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Friedman</surname><given-names>Jeffrey M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000874</institution-id><institution>Brain and Behavior Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Azevedo</surname><given-names>Estefania P</given-names></name><name><surname>Stern</surname><given-names>Sarah A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Azevedo</surname><given-names>Estefania P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32DK107077</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stern</surname><given-names>Sarah A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99DA048749</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stern</surname><given-names>Sarah A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Lateral septum neurotensin neurons are active in response to stress where escape is a viable strategy and decrease consumption via effects on hypothalamic pathways regulating food intake.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A key function of the central nervous system (CNS) is to sense external conditions and orchestrate an appropriate behavioral response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McEwen and Akil, 2020</xref>). The detection of stressful conditions, in particular, is of critical importance asÂ it enables animals to remove themselves from dangerous situations while suppressing competing (maladaptive) behaviors. Responses to stress can differ and can be characterized as either active coping (e.g.Â fight or flight) or passive coping (e.g. freezing, immobility). These responses are also associated with other adaptive behavioral effects including reduced feeding until the period of danger has passed, and these stereotyped feeding responses are conserved across organisms ranging from flies to mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yau and Potenza, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Surendran et al., 2017</xref>). Although an association between stress and reduced food intake is well established, the specific neural circuits that are activated by active versus passive coping strategies and reduced food intake have not been delineated.</p><p>We, therefore, set out to map neural circuits that are activated by stress and regulate feeding by identifying the neuronal cell types that are activated after immobilization (i.e. acute restraint) using a well-established behavioral paradigm that leads to a robust decrease in food intake for up to 48 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Donohoe, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shimizu et al., 1989</xref>). Previous studies have shown increased expression of c-fos, an early immediate gene, in many areas of the brain following acute stress, including regions of the limbic system (e.g. lateral septum;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sheehan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aloisi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Figueiredo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sood et al., 2018</xref>). Despite thisÂ finding, neitherÂ the cell-type specificity and the activation dynamics of stress-responsive neurons in the limbic system have been determined nor the mechanisms by which these neurons regulate homeostatic behaviors, such as feeding.</p><p>In this study, we used an unbiased transcriptomic approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Knight et al., 2012</xref>) to map and identify neurons in the limbic system that are activated during stressful situations. Our studies revealed that neurons in the lateral septum that express neurotensin (LS<sup>Nts</sup> neurons) are acutely activated by restraint stress. In vivo calcium recordings from LS<sup>Nts</sup> neurons show that these neurons selectively respond to stressful situations when escape is a viable option, indicating that these neurons are selectively tuned to active coping. Acute or chronic chemogenetic activation of these neurons leads to significant reductions in food intake and body weight, without an effect on locomotion and anxiety-like behaviors. Molecular profiling of LS<sup>Nts</sup> neurons revealed co-expression of glucagon-like-peptideÂ oneÂ receptor (<italic>Glp1r</italic>) and accordingly, activation of LS<sup>Glp1r</sup> neurons also led to a decrease in feeding. Finally, we mapped the projections of the LS<sup>Nts</sup> neurons and found that optogenetic activation of LS<sup>Nts</sup> projections to the lateral hypothalamus also reduces feeding in mice. Overall, our data define a limbic circuit selectively tuned to active escape stress and that, once activated, can reduce food intake via projections to the lateral hypothalamus, a well-established feeding center.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of a limbic population activated by stress</title><p>To identify specific neuronal populations that respond to acute stress, we subjected wild-type C57Bl/6J mice to restraint stress using a flexible, plastic decapicone for immobilization. After 1 hr, we mapped the expression pattern of c-fos in the whole mouse brain and found increased numbers of c-fos+ cells in several regions of the brain such as the basolateral amygdala (BLA), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), cortex (insular cortex [IC]), lateral septum (LS; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), and elsewhere (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kubo et al., 2002</xref>), acute restraint stress led to a marked increase in the number of c-fos+ cells in the LS compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>, Unpaired Studentâs t-test, *p&lt;0.05).

This method takes advantage of the fact that neuronal activation results in a cascade of signaling events culminating in the phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein S6 (pS6). These phosphorylated ribosomes can be immunoprecipitated from mouse brain homogenates, thereby enriching the sample for RNAs selectively expressed in the activated neuronal population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, left panel). After polysome immunoprecipitation, RNA extraction, and sequencing, RNAs enriched relative to total RNA have been shown to mark activated neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Knight et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Azevedo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stern et al., 2019</xref>). We applied this method to identify markers for neurons in the lateral septum that are activated after acute restraint stress relative to control naÃ¯ve mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The enrichment for each gene was calculated as the number of reads in the immunoprecipitated RNA (IP) relative to the total input RNA (IP/INP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As expected based on data from immediate-early gene mapping, we found enrichment for activity-related genes (<italic>Fosb</italic> and <italic>Fos,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, middle panel) in the samples from mice exposed to acute restraint stress (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, LS and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Next,Â we analyzed the data to identify other genes that were significantly enriched (&gt;2-fold or greater with a q-valueÂ &lt;0.05) in the samples from mice exposed to acute restraint stress (RS) compared to control mice (q-valueÂ &lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We found enrichment for several markers, including the gene for the neuropeptide neurotensin (<italic>Nts</italic>, aÂ 2.41-fold increase compared to control samples; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schroeder et al., 2019</xref>). We confirmed the enrichment using qPCR and found a 3.6-fold enrichment in neurotensin mRNA in the samples from the lateral septum of mice exposed to acute restraint stress compared to samples from control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, Unpaired Studentâs t-test, p&lt;0.05).</p><p>We further confirmed the activation of <italic>Nts</italic>-expressing neurons by acute restraint stress by analyzing the colocalization of <italic>Nts</italic> and <italic>Fos</italic> mRNA expression in the LS using in situ hybridization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We found significant colocalization of <italic>Fos</italic> and <italic>Nts</italic> in the LS after mice were subjected to restraint stress compared to controls (~37 cells in stressed mice vs. 22 cells in non-stressed control mice; Unpaired Studentâs t-test, p&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We also found that the increased colocalization between <italic>Fos</italic> and <italic>Nts</italic> in stressed mice was due to both an increase in the levels of <italic>Fos</italic> in <italic>Nts</italic> neurons and a concomitant induction of <italic>Nts</italic> mRNA during stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). These results suggest that theÂ activity of Nts neurons as well as the expression of the <italic>Nts</italic> gene in the LS is regulated by acute restraint stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>LS<sup>Nts</sup> neurons regulate food intake and body weight</title><p>In humans and rodents, the sensory cues conveying the perception of danger during stressful events have lasting behavioral consequences.

We injected an AAV encoding a Cre-dependent excitatory DREADD (Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armbruster et al., 2007</xref>]) into the LS of Nts-Cre mice. As expected, injection of clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) into these mice increased c-fos expression in the LS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>, Unpaired Studentâs t-test, p&lt;0.01) and significantly decreased food intake compared to mice treated with CNO after injection of a control Cre-dependent mCherry AAV into Nts-cre mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, red bars vs. black bars, Two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc, ***p&lt;0.001) as well as compared with saline-injected mice expressing the DREADD construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>).

To test this further, we exposed mice to a simulated âpredatorâ using a remote-controlled robotic spider (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, left panel). In this paradigm, mice are habituated to an open field arena containing a homemade opaque acrylic nest that serves as a protected âsafe zoneâ. The remote-controlled robotic spider was placed into the arena and after 5 min of habituation, the spider movement was manually controlled so that it only moved when mice left the acrylic nest. We observed that theÂ forward movement of the robotic spider toward the mouse induced a rapid retreat and led the mice to immediately return to the inside the acrylic nest (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). We simultaneously used in vivo fiber photometry to monitor the activity of LS<sup>Nts</sup> neurons during this simulated predator attack and found that movement of the robotic spider toward the mouse led to strong activation of LS<sup>Nts</sup> neurons that persisted until the mouse had returned to the nest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, Paired Studentâs t-test, *p&lt;0.05).

In aggregate, these results show that LS<sup>Nts</sup> neurons are activated by stressful stimuli in which the animalâs response includes active movement such as struggling or flight (active coping strategies) and further suggest that these neurons are not activated by stressful stimuli associated with immobility or freezing, thatÂ is, passive coping responses.</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-58894-video1.mp4"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Representative video of the simulated âpredatorâ test.</title><p>The mouse is placed in the open field with a designated safe zone.

Calcium recordings were taken throughout the entire task.</p></caption></media><p>To further confirm the tuning of LS<sup>Nts</sup> to stress stimuli that involved active coping, we monitored the activity of LS<sup>Nts</sup> neurons in mice during a contextual fear conditioning protocol (CFC), in which mice are trained to associate a novel environment with an unpredicted foot shock. This task enables a comparison of different types of stress responses because during the training phase, the foot shock leads to active movement away from the shock source, while during testing, exposure to the contextual cue results in freezing behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1GâH</xref>). Moreover, unlike restraint, which is imposed by the experimenter, freezing is self-initiated. Consistent with the prior results, we found that during the training session, LS<sup>Nts</sup> calcium signals were increased following the foot shock, time-locked with movement as the mice jumped away from the shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>, Paired Studentâs t-test, p&lt;0.05). However, during the recall test the following day, when mice exhibited freezing behavior after being placed in the chamber that they associated with a foot shock, the LS<sup>Nts</sup> calcium signal was significantly decreased compared to the period before the onset of freezing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, Paired Studentâs t-test, p&lt;0.05). Taken together, these data are consistent with the possibility that the activity of these neurons is tuned to active, but not passive, responses to stressful stimuli. They also indicate that these neurons remain active until the animal is in an environment that is either perceived to be âsafeâ or until the animal freezes as part of a passive coping strategy. By contrast, we did not find any significant temporal correlation between calcium signals in LS<sup>Nts</sup> neurons and feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1CâD</xref>) or voluntary movement in an open field arena in the absence of danger signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1EâF</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Stress elicits a pleiotropic set of adaptive physiologic and behavioral responses enabling animals to rapidly respond to threatening situations. These responses include suppression of other behaviors such as feeding while animals initiate defensive behaviors. Accordingly, the inhibition of consummatory behaviors when animals are threatened decreases an animalâs vulnerability to predation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Petrovich et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kunwar et al., 2015</xref>). Many brain regions are activated after stressful stimuli including the LS which shows increased c-fos expression under different stressful conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sheehan et al., 2004</xref>). We set out to identify these stress-activated neurons using an unbiased screen to identify molecular markers of LS neurons that are activated by stress. Our study identified a novel population of neurons in the LS that express Nts (LS<sup>Nts</sup> neurons). We further showed that these neurons are specifically activated by active escape in response to stress and that chemogenetic activation of LS<sup>Nts</sup> neurons can suppress food intake and body weight via a projection to the LH. These neurons respond to stress and specifically regulate feeding, but not other components of the stress response. These data thus delineate a molecularly defined limbic circuit selectively tuned to active escape and that acts to suppress food intake in mice.</p><p>These data are consistent with a number of prior studies suggesting that the LS plays a role in mediating elements of a stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Singewald et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bondi et al., 2007</xref>) though the cell types in the LS that mediate this response had not been identified. In our study, we also characterized the calcium dynamics of the LS<sup>Nts</sup> neurons response using in vivo calcium recordings. We first performed a manual immobilization experiment while recording from LS<sup>Nts</sup> neurons. We found that LS<sup>Nts</sup> neurons were not active during immobilization and were only active before or after the immobilization period when animals could struggle. This finding was surprising because our initial results from experiments placing animals in a plastic decapicone led to increased c-fos expression in the LS. There are a few possibilities that might explain these conflicting results. First, the temporal activation of c-fos is imprecise compared to measuring calcium dynamics and did not allow us to discern whether the LS<sup>Nts</sup> neurons were activated while the animal was moving prior to or after the stress versus when they were completely immobile. Second, these two experiments were subtly different in that restraint stress using the decapicone may allow subtle movements such as struggling/squirming while the manual immobilization did not. We encountered technical difficulties while performing the same restraint experiment using the decapicones during in vivo recordings due to theÂ volume of the fiber-optic implant that hindered our experimental approach. Thus, in our in vivo calcium recording studies, mice were manually restrained by the experimenterâs hand and we observed that mice did not actively struggle during this type of restraint. This also raises the possibility that either manual restraint does not cause significant stress or this type ofÂ stress elicits effectsÂ independently of LS<sup>Nts</sup> neurons and is thus encoded differently. To further resolve this, we employed additional stress paradigms to better understand the dynamics of Nts activation in the lateral septum. We found that LS<sup>Nts</sup> neurons are specifically activated only in response to stressful stimuli associated with active movement (i.e. flight) and not with stressful situations associated with freezing/immobility. Thus,Â LS<sup>Nts</sup> neurons were activated during active escape in a predator-attack paradigm, during tail suspension, and during the startle response to a foot shock. By contrast, the immobility associated with manual restraint, or freezing after fear conditioning did not lead to theÂ activation of these neurons. This suggested that different neural populations within the LS may be specially tuned to different aspects of the stress response (sensory, movement, among others). Further studies will be needed to determine whether other populations are activated by complete immobilization or immobility (i.e. freezing) and define whether or not these populations intersect with the pathways activated by LS<sup>Nts</sup> neurons.</p><p>We also found that LS<sup>Nts</sup> neurons, in particular, do not regulate anxiety-like behaviors but instead reduce food intake suggesting that they link specific stressful stimuli to reduced food intake. Thus, LS<sup>Nts</sup> neuronal activation appears to be tuned to active coping mechanisms that dispense with voluntary food intake until appropriate countermeasures to mitigate the stressful event have been enacted. For example, this circuit would be useful for suppressing the urge to forage when predators are in the vicinity, thus serving an important evolutionary function. Consistent with this, activation of LS<sup>Nts</sup> neurons suppresses food intake even in animals that have been deprived ofÂ food,Â although future studies are needed to confirm the sufficiency of these neurons for stress-induced reductions in feeding by inhibiting the LS<sup>Nts</sup> neurons during the stressful stimulus. Many of the stress paradigms used during in vivo calcium recordings were performed acutely which we found to be insufficient to elicit a significant impact on food intake. However, several of the stressors that were used, such as foot shock, can reduce food intake if applied chronically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Halataei et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rostamkhani et al., 2016</xref>). If LS<sup>Nts</sup> sufficiency is confirmed, neural plasticity and/or genetic alterations within this circuit (e.g. by mutations in the Nts gene as observed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lutter et al., 2017</xref> or changes in âallostatic loadâ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McEwen and Akil, 2020</xref>) could contribute to persistent maladaptive eating strategies, such as those observed in eating disorders or in other cases obesity. Presumably, other neural circuits mediate the effects of stressful stimuli that lead to freezing, raising the possibility that different circuits have evolved to process different types of stress, and that different types of chronic stress might be associated with different disorders.</p><p>The LS neuronal population is mainly composed of GABAergic neurons although there are also some glutamatergic neurons (Sunkin, 2013). In this study, we also explored the molecular diversity of LS<sup>Nts</sup> neurons. Our findings suggest that the LS<sup>Nts</sup> neuronal population is heterogeneous and co-express a variety of molecules, including Glp1r. Consistent with our results, a previous report showed that theÂ infusion of a Glp1r antagonist (Ex9) directly into the LS diminished the anorexigenic effects of stress, suggesting that Glp-1 signaling in LS contributes to this response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Terrill et al., 2018</xref>). The LS is innervated by pre-proglucagon (PPG) neurons in the brainstem expressing Glp-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Trapp and Cork, 2015</xref>) and these neurons have also been shown to mediate stress-induced hypophagia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Holt et al., 2019</xref>). In aggregate, these data suggest that LS<sup>Nts</sup> neurons that co-express Glp1r provide a link between brainstem circuits conveying stress to key output pathways to regulate feeding. The LS also receives inputs from many cortical and limbic areas, including the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tingley and BuzsÃ¡ki, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Azevedo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jakab and Leranth, 1990</xref>) and in turn sends projections to many other brains areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deng et al., 2019</xref>) including theÂ hypothalamus, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, thalamus, and amygdala. Further studies to map which brain areas convey inputs to LS<sup>Nts</sup> neurons and control their excitability are currently underway.</p><p>In summary, these data show that LS<sup>Nts</sup> neurons play an important integratory function linking stress to food suppression and serving as an important integrator between the limbic system and the hypothalamus. The identification of these neurons thus provides an entry point for understanding how complex inputs âin this case food deprivation versus dangerâcompete to generate an appropriate and adaptive response. In addition, these findings may in time illuminate why in some cases stress can elicit a pathologic response such as in the case of eating disorders. These and other data further suggest that higher-order, limbic brain regions integrate diverse sensory information to modulate subcortical feeding circuits in health and possibly disease (<xref

Mice were housed together (4â5 mice/cage) for most experiments, except feeding experiments (one mouse/cage). All feeding experiments used standard rodent chow pellets.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Stereotaxic injections</title><p>All AAVs used in this study were purchased from UNC Vector Core or Addgene, except where noted. AAV5-DIO-hM3Dq-mCherry or AAV5-DIO-Chr2-mCherry was used for activation studies. AAV5-DIO-hM4Di-mCherry was used for inhibition studies. Control AAV5-DIO-mCherry virus was used for comparison and terminal projection mapping. AAV5-DIO-GCaMP6s was used for fiber photometry studies. AAV5-Introvert-GFPL10a was a gift from Alexander Nectow. H129ÎTK-TdTomato virus was a gift from David Anderson and was used as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lo and Anderson, 2011</xref>) Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, placed in a stereotaxic frame (Kopf Instruments,Â Tujunga,Â CA) and bilaterally injected in the lateral septum using the following coordinates relative to bregma: AP: +0.58; ML: 0.0, DV: â3.00 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Paxinos and Franklin, 2019</xref>). A total of 400 nL of virus at high titer concentrations (at least 10<sup>11</sup>) were injected per site at a rate of 100 nL/min. For pharmacological experiments, cannulae were implanted in the LS at the same coordinates as above. For fiber photometry experiments, optic fiber implants (Doric,Â Quebec,Â Candada) were inserted at the same coordinates as above. For optogenetics experiments, optic fiber implants (Thor Labs,Â Newton,Â NJ) were implanted bilaterally over the LH at the following coordinates relative to bregma: AP: â1.80 mm; ML: + 1.50 mm, DV: â5.25 mm at a 10Â° angle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Paxinos and Franklin, 2019</xref>). Implants were inserted slowly and secured to the mouse skull using two layers of Metabond (Parkell Inc,Â Edgewood,Â NY). Mice were singly housed and monitored in the first weeks following optic fiber implantation. For all surgeries, mice were monitored for 72 hr to ensure full recovery.Â AfterÂ 2 weeks,Â mice were used for experiments. Following behavioral procedures, mice were euthanized to confirm viral expression and fiber placement using immunohistochemistry.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Restraint stress</title><p>Except where noted for fiber photometry studies, restraint stress consisted of 1 hr of immobilization in a decapicone (Braintree Scientific,Â Braintree,Â MA) in a separate room adjacent to the housing room. Mice were returned to their home cage following restraint for further food intake measurements or until euthanasia. For in vivo fiber photometry, restraint stress was given manually by the investigator during recordings.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Fiber photometry</title><p>Mice were acclimated to patch cables for 5 min for 3 d before experiments. Analysis of the signal was done using theÂ fiber photometry system and processor (RZ5P) from TDT (Tucker-Davis Technologies,Â Alachua,Â FL), which includes the Synapse software (TDT). The bulk fluorescent signals from each channel were normalized to compare across animals and experimental sessions. The 405 channel was used as the control channel. GCaMP6s signals that are recorded at this wavelength are not calcium-dependent; thus, changes in signal can be attributed to autofluorescence, bleaching, and fiber bending. Accordingly, any fluctuations that occurred in the 405 control channels were removed from the 465 channel before analysis. Change in fluorescence (ÎF) was calculated as (465 nm signal â fitted 405 nm signal), adjusted so that a ÎF/F was calculated by dividing each point in ÎF by the 405-nm curve at that time.

Behavioral variables were timestamped in the signaling traces via the real-time processor as TTL signals from Noldus (Ethovision) software (Wageningen, the Netherlands). This allowed for precise determinations of the temporal profile of signals in relation to specific behaviors. Behaviors were tested as follows. First, we tested theÂ response to food. Mice were fasted overnight and then placed into a clean home cage with food pellets introduced 5 min later. Food approach and consumption were scored. We then tested restraint by manually restraining mice for 5 min. Tail suspension was conducted by suspending mice by their tails for 5 min. To examine the role of predator escape, mice were placed into an open field that contained a designated safe zone consisting of a homemade acrylic nest. After 5 min, a remote-controlled spider (Lattburg) was introduced into the open field and began to pursue the mouse at random intervals. After 10â15 min, the nest was removed. We scored times when the mouse fled from the spider as well as the removal of the nest. Locomotion was scored during the first 5 min in the open field arena. All behaviors were manually scored by a second investigator who did not conduct the photometry experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Chemogenetic and pharmacological feeding experiments</title><p>For acute feeding, mice were singly housed and injected with either saline or clozapine-N-oxide (CNO; Sigma) at 1 mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.), exendin-4 (Tocris, 1 mg/mL), or y-msh (Tocris, 150 nM) directly into the lateral septum before the dark phase and theÂ cumulative food intake and body weight was measured at selected time periods. For chronic feeding, mice were single or double injected (every 12 hr) with CNO or saline before theÂ dark phase and food intake and body weight were measured.

Animals were sacrificed to confirm viral expression and fiber placement using immunohistochemistry. Each feeding session lasted forÂ 80 min and was divided into one trial of 20 min to allow the animal to acclimate to the cage and three trials of 20 min each (1 hr feeding session). During each feeding session, light was turnedÂ off during the first 20 min, on for 20 min and off again for the remaining 20 min. Consumed food was recorded manually before and after each session. To facilitate measurement, three whole pellets were added to cups and food crumbs were not recorded.

Brain slices were taken using a vibratome (Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL), blocked for 1 hr with 0.3% Triton X-100, 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 2% normal goat serum (NGS) and incubated in primary antibodies for 24 hr at 4Â°C. Then, free-floating slices were washed three times for 10 min in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (PBS-T), incubated for 1 hr at room temperature with secondary antibodies, washed in PBS-T and mounted in Vectamount with DAPI (Southern Biotech,Â Birmingham,Â AL). Antibodies used here were: anti-c-fos (1:500; Cell Signaling,Â Danvers,Â MA), anti-mCherry (1:1000; Abcam,Â Cambridge,Â MA) goat-anti-rabbit (Alexa 488 or Alexa 594, 1:1000; Molecular Probes), goat anti-chicken Alexa488 or Alexa594 (1:1000; Molecular Probes). Images were taken using Axiovert 200 microscope (Zeiss, White Plains, NY) or LSM780 confocal (Zeiss) and images were processed using ImageJ software (NIH, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>). C-fos counts were conducted for three or more sections/animal and averaged for each animal for statistical analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Fluorescent in situ hybridization</title><p>For theÂ examination of gene expression and Fos experiments, tissue samples underwent single molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH). Isoflurane anesthetized mice were decapitated, brains harvested and flash frozen in aluminum foil on dry ice. Brains were stored at â80Â°C. Prior to sectioning, brains were equilibrated to â16Â°C in a cryostat for 30 min. Brains were cryostat sectioned coronally at 20 Î¼m and thaw-mounted onto Superfrost Plus slides (25 Ã 75 mm<sup>2</sup>, Fisherbrand). Slides were air-dried for 60â90 min prior to storage at â80Â°C. smFISH for all genes examinedâ<italic>Fos</italic>, <italic>Nts</italic>, <italic>Sst</italic>, <italic>Glp1r</italic>, <italic>Cartpt</italic>, <italic>Mc3r</italic>âwas performed using RNAscope Fluorescent Multiplex Kit (Advanced Cell Diagnostics,Â Newark,Â CA) according to the manufacturerâsÂ instructions. Slides were counterstained for the nuclear marker DAPI using ProLong Diamond Antifade mounting medium with DAPI (Thermo Fisher). Sections were imaged using an LSM780 confocal (Zeiss) and processed using ImageJ software. Counts were conducted for two or more sections/animal and averaged for each animal for statistical analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All results are presented as meanÂ Â±Â SEM and were analyzed with GraphpadÂ Prism software or Matlab. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes, but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous studies. Normality tests and F tests for equality of variance were performed before choosing the statistical test. Unless otherwise indicated, for theÂ feeding experiments, we used a Two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction to analyze statistical differences. p&lt;0.05 was considered significant (*p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001, ****p&lt;0.0001). Image quantifications were analyzed using Unpaired Student's t-test. Fiber photometry data were analyzed using Paired Student's t-test. Animals in the same litter were randomly assigned to different treatment groups and blinded to investigators in the various experiments. Injection sites and viral expression were confirmed for all animals. Mice showing incorrect injection sites or optic fiber placement were excluded from the data analysis.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Ravi Tolwani and the staff of the Comparative Biosciences Center, Connie Zhao and the staff of the Genomics Resource Center, and Alison North and the staff of the Bioimaging Resource Center at Rockefeller University for technical assistance.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kate Wassum as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Azevedo and colleagues use multiple techniques to identify a circuit that acts to modulate escape activity and food intake. Specifically, aided by PhosphoTrap-seq they identify a group of neurotensin (NTS)-positive neurons in the lateral septum that are activated in response to acute restraint stress. Activation of these neurons (cFos staining) is dependent on sex and estrus cycle. Using chemogenetics the authors show activation of these neurons suppresses food intake. Additionally, in vivo bulk calcium imaging data suggests these neurons are associated with escape behaviors, not necessarily the stressor itself. Furthermore, using TRAP-seq they identified the molecular identity of these NTS neurons, and showed both pharmacologically and pharmacogenetically that septal activation of the coexpressed Glp1 receptor neurons, leads to similar food suppression seen with NTS neuronal activation. Finally, using channelrhodopsin optogenetic activation of hypothalamic neurons, the authors implicate NTS neuronal projections from the lateral septum to the lateral hypothalamus in regulating food suppression. The implication of this population in stress-induced hypophagia is not novel, as a series of published papers described this phenomenon using a different molecular marker (Glp1r), which is also expressed in LS<sup>NTS</sup> neurons. These studies extend beyond what has already been described in two important ways. First, they demonstrate that the anorexigenic activity of LS<sup>NTS</sup> neurons is mediated via projections to the lateral hypothalamus. Second, analyses of calcium imaging data across different types of stress paradigms support the idea that LS<sup>NTS</sup> neurons are only activated under stressful conditions involving active coping responses (i.e. escape). These findings will be of broad interest to researchers studying circuits regulating both feeding and stress-induced behaviors.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Sex differences, defined by restraint stress-induced c-fos and Nts expression in the LS are inconsistent with published studies in rats from 3 independent groups that restraint stress induces more c-fos in males than females (Aloisi, Zimmerman and Herdegen, 1997; Figueiredo, Dolgas and Herman, 2002; Sood, Chaudhari and Vaidya, 2018). Moreover, electrophysiological studies identified as proestrus with the highest LS neuronal firing rates; diestrus and estrus had similar levels of activity (Contreras Physiology and Behavior 2000). The failure to observe sex differences in feeding behavior raises concerns about the physiological relevance of sex differences in restraint-induced c-fos/Nts expression.</p><p>The authors frame the rationale and discussion of these experiments in the context of eating disorders. LS<sup>NTS</sup> neurons are only active during the coping phase of the stress response (Figure 4) and food intake rebounds when these neurons are switched off (Figure 6C). The relevance of circuits regulating acute escape behaviors for the chronic suppression of energy intake in anorexia is not obvious and should be discussed.</p><p>The manuscript would be strengthened by removing the sex differences experiments in Figure 2 and the discussion of anorexia, and reframing the discussion around the most novel finding â the striking differences in LS<sup>NTS</sup> neuronal firing in response to stressors that involving active responses vs. immobility. The presentation of the experiments should build up to the interesting and novel fiber photometry data, which should be presented at the end.</p><p>The authors claim that inconsistencies between LS<sup>NTS</sup> neuronal activation in response to restraint in Figure 1 and inhibition in Figure 4 stem from differences in the ability of the mouse to escape. Calcium imaging using the restraint paradigm from Figure 1 would help to resolve this issue. A discussion of this point would be helpful.</p><p>Inhibitory DREADD experiments during stress-induced escape behavior (complementary to excitatory experiments in Figure 3D) would strengthen the study by allowing the authors to parse the requirement for these neurons in suppressing food intake vs. coping responses per se. This could be noted in the Discussion as well.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58894.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Sex differences, defined by restraint stress-induced c-fos and Nts expression in the LS are inconsistent with published studies in rats from 3 independent groups that restraint stress induces more c-fos in males than females (Aloisi, Zimmerman and Herdegen, 1997; Figueiredo, Dolgas and Herman, 2002; Sood, Chaudhari and Vaidya, 2018).

The restraint paradigm from Figure 1 is performed by placing a mouse in a decapicone (a plastic, cone shaped bag) which is then tightly to restrain the animal, with air flow through a small hole. To perform fiber photometry, we had to attach a cable to the mouseâs head. Because the implant plus the cable increases the volume which no longer fits into the decapicone (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.braintreesci.com/prodinfo.asp?number=DC">https://www.braintreesci.com/prodinfo.asp?number=DC</ext-link>). For this reason, we instead used the manual restraint paradigm. We have added a statement in the second paragraph of the Discussion section explaining this technical limitation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Inhibitory DREADD experiments during stress-induced escape behavior (complementary to excitatory experiments in Figure 3D) would strengthen the study by allowing the authors to parse the requirement for these neurons in suppressing food intake vs. coping responses per se.

Unfortunately, due to COVID-19 and current university restrictions, this experiment would require a long time to be performed. Thus, we have added a discussion about the sufficiency of this population to this behavior in the third paragraph of the Discussion section, noting that our data do not exclude the possibility that other cell populations might also contribute to the effects described herein.</p></body></sub-article></article>
