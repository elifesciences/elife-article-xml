suggests that stress experienced prior to or during gestation may also negatively impact the health of future offspring. Rodent models of gestational physiologic stress can induce neurologic and behavioral changes that persist for up to three generations, suggesting that stress signals can induce lasting epigenetic changes in the germline. Treatment with glucocorticoid stress hormones is sufficient to recapitulate the transgenerational changes seen in physiologic stress models. These hormones are known to bind and activate the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a ligand-inducible transcription factor, thus implicating GR-mediated signaling as a potential contributor to the transgenerational inheritance of stress-induced phenotypes. Here, we demonstrate dynamic spatiotemporal regulation of GR expression in the mouse germline, showing expression in the fetal oocyte as well as the perinatal and adult spermatogonia. Functionally, we find that fetal oocytes are intrinsically buffered against changes in GR signaling, as neither genetic deletion of GR nor GR agonism with dexamethasone altered the transcriptional landscape or the progression of fetal oocytes through meiosis. In contrast, our studies revealed that the male germline is susceptible to glucocorticoid-mediated signaling, specifically by regulating RNA splicing within the spermatogonia, although this does not abrogate fertility. Together, our work suggests a sexually dimorphic function for GR in the germline, and represents an important step towards understanding the mechanisms by which stress can modulate the transmission of genetic information through the germline.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>glucocorticoid</kwd><kwd>cortisol</kwd><kwd>germ cell</kwd><kwd>fetal

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The impact of stress on mammalian reproductive capacity has long been appreciated. The hypothesis that psychological stress not only limits the ability to conceive, but may also impact the health of offspring has gained considerable attention in recent years. A growing body of work has demonstrated that rodent models of stress can induce a variety of neurologic and behavioral responses that may persist across generations, even in generations unexposed to the initial stressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Franklin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gapp et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Franklin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Weiss et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Saavedra-RodrÃ­guez and Feig, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Babb et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Manners et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bohacek et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gapp et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Razoux et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chan et al., 2020</xref>). The persistence of such responses for up to three generations suggests that stress signals can induce epigenetic changes in the germline that propagate. As the committed precursors of eggs and sperm established during early embryogenesis, germ cells are responsible for transmitting genetic as well as epigenetic information across generations. Perturbations of the messenger can potentially corrupt the transmission of this information, thus understanding the mechanism by which stress can lead to epigenetic alterations in the germline remains a crucial unanswered question.</p><p>It has been demonstrated that prenatal treatment of rodents with synthetic glucocorticoid stress hormones is sufficient to recapitulate the transgenerational changes seen in physiologic stress models; however, it remains unclear how glucocorticoids are sensed and remembered by developing germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Short et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moisiadis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Constantinof et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Constantinof et al., 2019a</xref>). Multigenerational effects of preconception paternal exposures to stress were shown to rely on an indirect mechanism; glucocorticoid (cortisol) altered the small RNA cargo released in extracellular vesicles from epididymal epithelial cells to maturing sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Short et al., 2016</xref>). These hormones bind and activate the nuclear hormone receptor glucocorticoid receptor (GR; encoded by the <italic>Nr3c1</italic> gene), thus implicating GR-mediated signaling in transgenerational inheritance of stress. The engagement of GR with its ligand in the cytoplasm promotes translocation to the nucleus where it then binds DNA response elements and recruits transcriptional cofactors to modulate target gene expression. As such, GR functions as a ligand-inducible transcription factor, allowing for robust changes to gene expression in response to stress hormones. While GR is known to be a potent transcriptional regulator in a wide variety of cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Whirledge and DeFranco, 2018</xref>), its function and targets in the cells of the developing gonad remain less clear.</p><p>Abundant levels of GR have been identified in the Leydig and peritubular myoid cells of the testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Stalker et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Schultz et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biagini and Pich, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Weber et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hazra et al., 2014</xref>), which supports the possibility that stress is sensed by somatic cells, which in turn elicit epigenetic changes in germ cells. Prior evidence for GR expression in the germ cells is sparse. In the adult mouse testis, one study suggested GR expression was limited to primary spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Schultz et al., 1993</xref>), while others suggested that GR is expressed in both spermatogonia as well as spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biagini and Pich, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Weber et al., 2000</xref>). In humans, multiple studies have shown robust GR expression in differentiating spermatogonia, as well as low expression in primary spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nordkap et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Welter et al., 2020</xref>). In the female, a single study of the human fetal ovary found evidence for GR expression by IHC in the oocytes of a 9-week-old embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Poulain et al., 2012</xref>), although expression was heterogeneous across the tissue. A more recent study of mouse fetal oocyte development using single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed increasing expression of GR in the oocytes between E12.5 and E14.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ge et al., 2021</xref>). Together these data suggest that GR may be expressed in the rodent / human germline, but in limited developmental windows. However, no studies to date have directly assessed the cell-intrinsic role of GR in the germ cells. While several publications describe a variety of responses of the male and female germline to glucocorticoid treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Short et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Poulain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Orazizadeh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ren et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mancini et al., 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yazawa et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mahmoud et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gapp et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">GonzÃ¡lez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tohei et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wei et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yuan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yuan et al., 2016</xref>), it is unclear whether such changes arise from direct action of glucocorticoids on germ cells, or the indirect effects of systemic glucocorticoid treatment on hormone production by gonadal somatic cells and/or the hormone producing cells of the hypothalamus and pituitary.</p><p>Here, we characterized the expression of GR in the germline of the developing and adult mouse gonads, and determined the role of GR in normal germline formation and function. We discovered that GR is expressed in the female germline exclusively during fetal development, but absent from the adult oocyte. We demonstrated that the female germline is, surprisingly, resistant to changes in GR signaling. Negligible changes in transcription or meiotic progression of fetal oocytes resulted from either genetic deletion or agonism of GR with dexamethasone (dex), suggesting that the female germline is intrinsically buffered from changes in GR signaling. In contrast, we found that GR is expressed in pro-spermatogonia of the perinatal testis and spermatogonia of the adult testis, and transcriptomic analysis of germ cells from dex-treated males revealed a potential role of GR in regulating RNA splicing. Together our data confirm the dynamic spatiotemporal regulation of GR expression in both the male and female germ cells, and suggest a sexually dimorphic role for this receptor in the mammalian germline.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Spatiotemporal expression of GR and novel isoforms in fetal oocytes</title><p>To assess GR expression in the developing female germline, we performed immunofluorescence (IF) on mouse fetal ovaries ranging from embryonic day (E) 12.5 through E18.5.

Our efforts to characterize the role of GR-mediated signaling in male and female germ cells represent an important step in understanding the intrinsic effects of stress hormones on the germline. In this study, we confirmed that germ cells of the testis and the ovary both show dynamic temporal regulation of GR expression over fetal and adult development, with distinct sex-specific differences. We demonstrated that in the context of pharmacologic activation or genetic deletion of GR, fetal oocytes show minimal transcriptional changes and no significant changes in progression through meiotic prophase I, suggesting that the fetal oocytes are somehow resistant to changes in GR signaling. In contrast, we show that prospermatogonia downregulate genes important for RNA splicing in response to GR activation, suggesting a potential role for stress signaling in regulating transcript diversity in the male germline. Together, our work demonstrates a sexually dimorphic response to GR signaling within the germline, and suggests alternative mechanisms by which the male and female germline may be differentially affected by stress.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Glucocorticoid receptor immunofluorescence in the ovary and testis: discrepancies and similarities with the literature</title><p>Our time course of GR expression in the fetal ovary revealed a peak in GR expression in E13.5 fetal oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), a result highly consistent with a scRNA-seq study that found GR was expressed in the developing oocytes (at both the transcript and protein level) between E12.5 to E14.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ge et al., 2021</xref>).

This suggests that a larger diversity of upstream regulatory DNA sequences may be available for regulating GR expression more dynamically in the germline compared to the soma. We also observed that GR is expressed just prior to the onset of meiotic initiation in male and female germ cells. This suggests GR may have an upstream regulatory element that is either regulated by a meiotic transcription factor, or that is sensitive to changes in the chromatin landscape induced in germ cells upon meiotic initiation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The female germline is insulated from changes in GR-mediated signaling</title><p>Given that GR is a potent transcription factor with a wide variety of functions across cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Whirledge and DeFranco, 2018</xref>), it was striking to find that both complete genetic deletion of GR and robust pharmacologic activation led to minimal changes in the transcriptional landscape of the female germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Furthermore, the robust response to dex administration between E12.5 and E15.5 observed in ovarian soma in contrast to the meager response of adjacent germ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) suggested that the transcriptional response to changes in GR signaling was buffered in the cellular context of fetal oogonia. This is an interesting premise, as it may be advantageous for the germ cells to evolve protection against rampant GR-induced transcriptional changes in response to stress hormones experienced during gestation. Why the female germline has retained temporally restricted expression of GR given its apparent lack of a functional role, however, remains unclear. We have shown there is no evidence for inhibitory isoforms of GR, including both known truncated protein isoforms, as well as the GRÎ² transcriptional isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). We did, however, observe that GR is able to change its subcellular localization in response to ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, ii</xref>), suggesting that the ligand binding and nuclear translocation abilities of GR remain intact despite this attenuated function in female germ cells.</p><p>A possible mechanism for insulating fetal germ cells from response to GR signaling involves PTMs to the receptor that could interfere with its ability to bind DNA, interact with other transcription factors, or recruit other cofactors required for its transcriptional activity. While a wide variety of PTMs to GR have been documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Weikum et al., 2017</xref>), the limiting number of germ cells that can be obtained from the fetal ovary has made the detection of these PTMs via biochemical methods difficult. One particular PTM of interest is acetylation of GR by the circadian histone acetyltransferase protein, CLOCK. Acetylation of lysines within the hinge region of GR by CLOCK has been shown to result in normal ligand binding and nuclear translocation, but a complete loss of the ability of GR to both activate and repress transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nader et al., 2009</xref>), very similar to what is seen in fetal oocytes. Interestingly, our single-cell RNA-seq data shows a strong enrichment for <italic>Clock</italic> expression in the germ cells in comparison to the soma (data not shown), further bolstering the idea that CLOCK could acetylate and inactivate GR specifically in the germ cells. Further biochemical analyses will be required to determine whether GR is being modified in this manner, or by any other PTMs. Lastly, while our RNA-seq results show a very minimal response to GR signaling in germ cells at the transcriptional level, we cannot rule out a potential non-canonical signaling function of GR, such as the regulation of cellular kinases (reviewed extensively elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Oakley and Cidlowski, 2013</xref>), or the regulation of non-coding RNAs at the post-transcriptional level.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>GR in the regulation of RNA splicing in the male germline</title><p>In contrast to the lack of dex-induced transcriptional changes in the female germ cells, the male germline showed a considerable transcriptional response to dex treatment at PN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Instead, the downregulated transcripts showed a strong enrichment for genes involved in RNA processing and RNA splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A</xref>).

To our knowledge, this is the first time GR has been implicated in regulating the expression of genes involved in RNA splicing. Interestingly, it has been well documented in the literature that a full genetic deletion of a single splice factor leads to impairments in spermatogenesis, and ultimately infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kuroda et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">OâBryan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zagore et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Xu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Horiuchi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ehrmann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Legrand et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yuan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). We suspect that dex treatment leads to fewer differential splicing events than a full splice factor deletion, given that dex treatment causes a broader decrease in splice factor expression without entirely abolishing any single splice factor. Unfortunately, we have been unable to assess the consequences of dex-induced splicing decreases on fertility, as dex- and/or glucocorticoid-mediated inhibition of testosterone production in the Leydig cells would impair spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ren et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bambino and Hsueh, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hales and Payne, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kavitha et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Orr and Mann, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Orr and Mann, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Smith and Walker, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rengarajan and Balasubramanian, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rengarajan and Balasubramanian, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Saez et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sankar et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cumming et al., 1983</xref>), and thus would confound the results.</p><p>While it has been shown that some histone modifications such as H3K4me3 can be transmitted transgenerationally through sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lismer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Siklenka et al., 2015</xref>), there is also a growing body of evidence demonstrating that physiological stress leads to changes in the signature of non-coding RNA within the sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gapp et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gapp et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gapp et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rodgers et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rodgers et al., 2015</xref>).

Our finding that perinatal dex treatment increases GR activity in developing prospermatogonia and leads to altered RNA splicing could confer an evolutionary advantage by increasing the overall transcript diversity of the germline in times of stress, allowing for increased adaptation of the germline to selective pressures from the environment. Distinct from the effects of stress on small RNAs originating from epididymal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chan et al., 2020</xref>), this raises the question whether direct activation of GR signaling in male germ cells could lead to alterations in small non-coding RNAs, and whether such changes could be heritable across generations.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conditional deletion of GR using Prdm1-Cre does not affect male fertility</title><p>As proper RNA splicing is crucial for meiotic progression in the spermatogenic lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kuroda et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">OâBryan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schmid et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zagore et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Naro et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Xu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Horiuchi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ehrmann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Legrand et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yuan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wu et al., 2021</xref>), perturbations to RNA splicing as a result of elevated GR signaling could have important consequences for fertility.

While the subfertility caused by the presence of the <italic>Prdm1-</italic>Cre transgene alone could be masking a more subtle subfertility phenotype caused by loss of GR, it is also possible that homeostatic levels of GR signaling do not regulate splicing. While pharmacologic agonism of GR signaling in the adult testis could lead to more pronounced disruptions to splicing and subsequent fertility compared to deletion of GR, we were unfortunately unable to test this possibility.

They further investigate the impact of tissue specific genetically induced receptor absence and/or systemic receptor activation on fertility and RNA regulation. They are motivated by several lines of research that report inter and transgenerational effects of stress and or glucocorticoid receptor activation and suggest that their findings provide an explanatory mechanism to mechanistically back parental stress hormone exposure induced phenotypes in the offspring.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>- A chronological immunofluorescent assessment of GR in fetal and early life oocyte and sperm development.</p><p>- RNA seq data that reveal novel cell type specific isoforms validated by q-RT PCR E15.5 in the oocyte.</p><p>- 2 alternative approaches to knock out GR to study transcriptional outcomes. Oocytes: systemic GR KO (E17.5) with low input 3-tag seq and germline specific GR KO (E15.5) on fetal oocyte expression via 10X single cell seq and 3-cap sequencing on sorted KO versus WT oocytes - both indicating little impact on polyadenylated RNAs -</p><p>- 2 alternative approaches to assess the effect of GR activation in vivo (systemic) and ex vivo (ovary culture): here the RNA seq did show again some changes in germ cells and many in the soma.</p><p>- They exclude oocyte specific GR signaling inhibition via beta isoforms</p><p>- Perinatal male germline shows differential splicing regulation in response to systemic Dex administration, results were backed up with q-PCR analysis of splicing factors.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>- Sequencing techniques used are not Total RNA but either are focused on all polyA transcripts (10x) - effects on non-polyA-transcripts are left unexplored.</p><p>The number of replicates in the low input seq is very low and hence this might be underpowered. Since Dex treatment showed some (modest) changes in oocyte RNA effects of GR depletion might only become apparent upon Dex treatment as an interaction. Meaning GR activation in the presence of GR shows changes, upon GR depletion those changes are abolished --&gt; statistically speaking an interaction --&gt; conclusion: there are germline GR effects that get abolished when there is no GR hinting on germline GR autonomous effects.</p><p>- Effects in oocytes following systemic Dex might be indirect due to GR activation in the soma. The changes observed might be irrelevant to meiosis and thus in the manuscript are deemed irrelevant, but they could still lead to settle consequences. in other terms.</p><p>Even though ex vivo culture of ovaries shows GR translocation to nucleus it is not sure whether the in vivo systemic administration does the same. The authors argue in their rebuttal that GR is already nuclear in fetal oocytes hence the</p><p>conclusion that fetal oocytes are resistant to GR manipulation is understandable, at least for the readouts that were considered. Yet the question arises: If GR is already nuclear (active) in the absence of additional Dex treatment why does GR knock out not elicit any changes in the considered readouts -&gt; what are we missing.</p><p>This work is a good reference point for researchers interested in glucocorticoid hormone signaling fertility and RNA splicing. It might spark further studies on germline-specific GR functions and the impact of GR activation on alternative splicing.</p><p>The study provides a characterization of GR and some aspects of GR perturbation, and the negative findings in this study do help to rule out a range of specific roles of GR in the germline. This will help the study of unexplored options. The authors do acknowledge the unexplored options in their discussion.</p><p>The intro of the study eludes to implications for intergenerational effects via epigenetic modifications in the germline and points out additional potential indirect effects of reproductive tissue GR signaling on the germline. Future studies might hence focus on further exploration of epigenetic modifications and/or indirect effects.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.90164.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Cincotta</surname><given-names>Steven A</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, San Francisco</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">San Francisco</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Richardson</surname><given-names>Nainoa</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, San Francisco</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">San Francisco</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Foecke</surname><given-names>Mariko H</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, San Francisco</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">San Francisco</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Laird</surname><given-names>Diana J</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, San Francisco</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">San Francisco</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p><p>We are very grateful to both reviewers for taking the time to review our manuscript and data in great detail.

They are motivated by several lines of research that report inter and transgenerational effects of stress and or glucocorticoid receptor activation and suggest that their findings provide an explanatory mechanism to mechanistically back parental stress hormone exposure-induced phenotypes in the offspring.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>A chronological immunofluorescent assessment of GR in fetal and early life oocyte and sperm development.</p><p>RNA seq data that reveal novel cell type specific isoforms validated by q-RT PCR E15.5 in the oocyte.</p><p>2 alternative approaches to knock out GR to study transcriptional outcomes.

We feel that our IF data do match transcript data in our validation studies of the GR KO using (1) qRT-PCR on fetal ovary in Fig 2E and (2) scRNA-seq in germ cells and ovarian soma in Fig S2B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>COMMENT #2: (staining of spermatids is referred to but not shown).</p></disp-quote><p>You are correct that this statement was based on a morphological identification of spermatids using DAPI morphology. We have performed a co-stain for GR with the spermatocyte marker SYCP3, and the spermatid/spermatozoa marker PNA (Peanut Agglutinin; from Arachis hypogaea) in adult testis tissue. We have updated Figure 4D to reflect this change, as well as the corresponding text in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>COMMENT #3: The authors do not consider post-transcriptional level (a) modifications also triggered by GR activation (b) non-coding RNAs (not assessed by seq).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this very important point about potential post-transcriptional (non-genomic) effects of GR in the fetal oocyte. We agree that while our RNA-seq results show only a minimal transcriptional response, we cannot rule out a non-canonical signaling function of GR, such as the regulation of cellular kinases (as reviewed elsewhere1), or the regulation of non coding RNAs at the post-transcriptional level, and we have amended the discussion to include a sentence on this point. However, while we fully acknowledge the possibility of GR regulating non-genomic level cellular signaling, we chose not to explore this option further based on the lack of any overall functional effect on meiotic progression when GR signaling was perturbed- either by KO (Figure 2D) or dex-mediated activation (Figure S3C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>COMMENT #4: Sequencing techniques used are not total RNA but either are focused on all polyA transcripts (10x) or only assess the 3' prime end and hence are not ideal to study splicing</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this concern, however this statement is not correct and we have clarified this point in the Results section to explain how the sequencing libraries of the male germ cell RNA-seq were prepared. We agree that certain sequencing techniques (such as 3â Tag-Seq) that generate sequencing libraries from a limited portion of an entire transcript molecule are not appropriate for analysis of differential splicing. This was not the case, however, for the RNA-seq libraries prepared on our male germ cells treated with dexamethasone. These libraries were constructed using full length transcripts that were reverse transcribed using random hexamer priming, thus accounting for sequencing coverage across the full transcript length. As a result, this type of library prep technique should be sufficient for capturing differential splicing events along the length of the transcript. We do, however, point out that these libraries were constructed on polyA-enriched transcripts. Thus while we obtained full length transcript coverage for these polyA transcripts, any differential splicing taking place in non poly-adenylated RNA moieties were not captured. While we are excited about the possibility of exploring GR-mediated splicing regulation of other RNA species in the future, we chose to focus the scope of our current study on polyA mRNA molecules specifically.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>COMMENT #5: The number of replicates in the low input seq is very low and hence this might be underpowered</p></disp-quote><p>While the number of replicates (n=3-4 per condition) is sufficient for performing statistical analysis of a standard RNA-seq experiment, we do acknowledge and agree with the reviewer that low numbers of FACS-sorted germ cells from individual embryos combined with the low input 3â Tag-Seq technique could have led to higher sample variability than desired. Given that we validated our bulk RNA-seq analysis of GR knockout ovaries using an orthogonal single-cell RNA-seq approach, we feel that our conclusions regarding a lack of transcriptional changes upon GR deletion remain valid.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>COMMENT #6: Since Dex treatment showed some (modest) changes in oocyte RNA - effects of GR depletion might only become apparent upon Dex treatment as an interaction.</p></disp-quote><p>We may be missing the nuance of this point, but our interpretation of an effect that is seen only when the KO is treated with Dex would be that the mechanism would not be autonomous in germ cells but indirect or off-target.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>COMMENT #7: Effects in oocytes following systemic Dex might be indirect due to GR activation in the soma.</p></disp-quote><p>As both the oocytes and ovarian soma express GR during the window of dex administration, we agree that it is possible that the few modest changes seen in the oocyte transcriptome are the result of indirect effects following robust GR signaling in the somatic compartment. However, given that these modest oocyte transcript changes in response to dex treatment did not significantly alter the ability of oocytes to progress through meiosis, we chose not to explore this mechanism further.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>COMMENT #8: Even though ex vivo culture of ovaries shows GR translocation to the nucleus it is not sure whether the in vivo systemic administration does the same.</p><p>AND</p><p>The conclusion that fetal oocytes are resistant to GR manipulation is very strong, given that &quot;only&quot; poly A sequencing and few replicates of 3-prime sequencing have been analyzed and information is lacking on whether GR is activated in germ cells in the systemically dex-injected animals.</p></disp-quote><p>If we understand correctly, the first part refers to a technical limitation and the second part takes issue with our interpretation of the data. For the former, we appreciate this astute insight on the conundrum of detecting a response to systemic dex in fetal oocytes, which is generally monitored by nuclear translocation of GR. As shown in Figure 1A and 1B, GR localization is overwhelmingly nuclear in fetal oocytes of WT animals at E13.5 without addition of any dex. We could not, therefore, use GR translocation as a proxy for activation in response to dex treatment. We instead used ex vivo organ culture to monitor localization changes, as we were able to maintain fetal ovaries ex vivo in hormone-depleted and ligand negative conditions. As shown in Fig. 3, these defined culture conditions elicited a shift of GR to the cytoplasm of fetal oocytes. This led us to conclude that GR is capable of translocating between nucleus and cytoplasm in fetal oocytes, and we were able to counteract this loss in nuclear localization by providing dex ligand in the media.</p><p>We feel that our conclusion that oocytes are resistant to manipulation of glucocorticoid signaling despite their possession of the receptor and capacity for nuclear translocation is substantiated by multiple results: meiotic phenotyping, bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq analysis of both GR KO and dex dosed mice. Our basis for testing the timing and fidelity of meiotic prophase I was the coincident onset of GR expression in female germ cells at E13, and the disappearance of GR in neonatal oocytes as they enter meiotic arrest. The lack of transcriptional changes observed in oocytes in response to dex has made it even more challenging to demonstrate a bona fide âactivationâ of GR. Observation of a dose-dependent induction of the canonical GR response gene Fkbp5 in the somatic cells of the fetal ovary (Figure S3A and 3A) affirmed that dex traverses the placenta. We agree with the reviewer that it remains possible that dex or GR KO could lead to changes in epigenetic marks or small RNAs in oocytes, and have mentioned these possibilities in the discussion, but we note that even epigenetic perturbations during oocyte development such as the loss of Tet1 or Dnmt1 result in measurable changes in the transcriptome and the timing of meiotic prophase 2â4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>COMMENT #9: This work is a good reference point for researchers interested in glucocorticoid hormone signaling fertility and RNA splicing. It might spark further studies on germline-specific GR functions and the impact of GR activation on alternative splicing. While the study provides a characterization of GR and some aspects of GR perturbation, and the negative findings in this study do help to rule out a range of specific roles of GR in the germline, there is still a range of other potential unexplored options. The introduction of the study eludes to implications for intergenerational effects via epigenetic modifications in the germline, however, it does not mention that the indirect effects of reproductive tissue GR signaling on the germline have indeed already been described in the context of intergenerational effects of stress.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an excellent point that we have not made sufficient distinction in our manuscript between prior studies of gestational stress and preconception stress and the light that our work may shed on those findings. We have revised the introduction to clarify this difference, and added reference to an outstanding study that identifies glucocorticoid-induced changes to microRNA cargo of extracellular vesicles shed by epididymal epithelial cells that when transferred to mature sperm can induce changes in the HPA axis and brain of offspring 5. Interestingly, this GR-mediated effect in the epididymal epithelial cells concurs with our observation in the adult testis that GR can be detected only cKit+ spermatogonia but not in subsequent stages of spermatids.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>COMMENT #10: Also, the study does not assess epigenetic modifications.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that exploring the role of GR in regulating epigenetic modifications within the germline is an area of extreme interest given the potential links between stress and transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. As this is a broader topic that requires a more thorough and comprehensive set of experiments, we have intentionally chosen to keep this work separate from the current study, and hope to expand upon this topic in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>COMMENT #11: The conclusion that the persistence of a phenotype for up to three generations suggests that stress can induce lasting epigenetic changes in the germline is misleading. For the reader who is unfamiliar with the field, it is important to define much more precisely what is referred to as &quot;a phenotype&quot;. Furthermore, this statement evokes the impression that the very same epigenetic changes in the germline have been observed across multiple generations.</p></disp-quote><p>We see how this may be misleading, and we have amended the text of the introduction and discussion accordingly to avoid the use of the term âphenotypeâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>COMMENT #12: The evidence of the presence of GR in the germline is also somewhat limited - since other studies using sequencing have detected GR in the mature oocyte and sperm.</p></disp-quote><p>As described above in response to Comment #2, we have included immunostaining of adult testis in a revised Figure 4D and shown that we detect GR in PLZF+ and cKIT+ spermatogonia. We also show low/minimal expression in some (SYCP3+) early meiotic spermatocytes, but not in (Lectin+) spermatids. We are not aware of any studies that have shown expression of GR protein in the mature oocyte.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>COMMENT #13: The discussion ends again on the implications of sex-specific differences of GR signaling in the context of stress-induced epigenetic inheritance. It states that the observed differences might relate to the fact that there is more evidence for paternal lineage findings, without considering that maternal lineage studies in epigenetic inheritance are generally less prevalent due to some practical factors - such as more laborious study design making use of cross-fostering or embryo transfer.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this valid point, and we have amended the discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>There is increasing evidence in the literature that rodent models of stress can produce phenotypes that persist through multiple generations. Nevertheless, the mechanism(s) by which stress exposure produces phenotypes are unknown in the directly affected individual as well as in subsequent offspring that did not directly experience stress. Moreover, it has also been shown that glucocorticoid stress hormones can recapitulate the effects of programmed stress. In this manuscript, the authors test the compelling hypothesis that glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-signaling is responsible for the transmission of phenotypes across generations. As a first step, the investigators test for a role of GR in the male and female germline. Using knockouts and GR agonists, they show that although germ cells in male and female mice have GR that appears to localize to the nucleus when stimulated, oocytes are resistant to changes in GR levels. In contrast, the male germline exhibits changes in splicing but no overt changes in fertility.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Although many of the results in this manuscript are negative, this is a careful and timely study that informs additional work to address mechanisms of transmission of stress phenotypes across generations and suggests a sexually dimorphic response to glucocorticoids in the germline. The work presented here is well-done and rigorous and the discussion of the data is thoughtful. Overall, this is an important contribution to the literature.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>RECOMMENDATION #1: To assess whether in females the systemic Dex administration directly activates GR in oocytes it would be great to assess GR activation following Dex administration, and ideally to see the effects abolished when Dex is administered to germline-specific KO animals.</p></disp-quote><p>In regard to the recommendation to assess GR activation in response to systemic dex administration, we refer the reviewer back to our response in Comment #8 highlighting the difficulties defining and measuring GR activation in the germline.</p><p>This therefore has made it difficult to assess whether any of the modest effects seen in response to dex are abolished in our germline-specific KO animals. While repeating our RNA-seq experiment in dex-dosed germline KO animals would address whether the ~60 genes induced in oocytes are the result of oocyte-intrinsic GR activity, we have decided not to explore this mechanism further due to the overall lack of a functional effect on meiotic progression in response to dex (Figure S3C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>RECOMMENDATION #2: To further strengthen the link between GR and alternative splicing it would be great to see the dex administration experiment repeated in germline specific GR KO's.</p></disp-quote><p>While we understand the reviewerâs suggestion to explore whether deletion of GR in the spermatogonia is sufficient to abrogate the dex-mediated decreases in splice factor expression, we chose not to explore the details of this mechanism given that deletion of GR in the male germline does not impair fertility (Figure 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>RECOMMENDATION #3: I am wondering how much a given reduction in one of the splicing factors indeed affects splicing events. Can the authors relate this to literature, or maybe an in vitro experiment can be done to see whether the level of differential splicing events detected is in a range that can be expected in the case of the magnitude of splicing factor reduction?</p></disp-quote><p>It has been shown in many instances in the literature that a full genetic deletion of a single splice factor leads to impairments in spermatogenesis, and ultimately infertility 6â16. We suspect that dex treatment leads to fewer differential splicing events than a full splice factor deletion, given that dex treatment causes a broader decrease in splice factor expression without entirely abolishing any single splice factor. We have amended the discussion section to include this point. While we share the reviewerâs curiosity to compare the effects of dex vs genetic deletion of splicing machinery on the overall magnitude of differential splicing events, we unfortunately do not have access to mice with a floxed splice factor at this time. While we have considered knocking out one or more splice factors in an ex vivo cultured testis to compare alongside dex treatment, our efforts to date have proven unsuccessful due to high cell death upon culture of the postnatal testis for more than 24 hours.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>RECOMMENDATION #4: It is unclear from the methods whether in germline-specific KO's also the controls received tamoxifen.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for catching this missing piece of information. All control embryos that were assessed received an equivalent dose of tamoxifen to the germline-specific KO embryos. The only difference between cKOs and controls was the presence of the Cre transgene. We have updated the Materials and Methods 3â Tag-Seq sample preparation section to include the sentence: âBoth GRcKO/cKO and control GRflox/flox embryos were collected from tamoxifen-injected dams, and thus were equally exposed to tamoxifen in uteroâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>I just have only a few comments/questions.</p><p>RECOMMENDATION #5: It is somewhat surprising that GR is expressed in female germ cells, yet there doesn't seem to be a requirement. Is there any indication of what it does? Is the long-term stability of the germline compromised?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these questions, and we agree that it was quite surprising to find a lack of GR function in the female germline despite its robust expression. The question of whether loss of GR affects the long-term stability of the female germline is interesting, given that similar work in GR KO zebrafish has shown impairments to female reproductive capacity, yet only upon aging 17â19.</p><p>While we have shared interest in this question, technical limitations thus far have prevented us from properly assessing the effect of GR loss in aged females. Homozygous deletion of GR results in embryonic lethality at approximately E17.5. Conditional deletion of GR using Oct4-CreERT2 with a single dose of tamoxifen (2.5 mg / 20g mouse) at E9.5 results in complete deletion of GR by E10.5, although dams consistently suffer from dystocia and are no longer able to deliver viable pups. While using the more active tamoxifen metabolite (4OHT) at 0.1 mg / 20g has allowed for successful delivery, the resulting deletion rate is very poor (see qPCR results in panel below, left). While using half the dose of standard tamoxifen (1.25 mg / 20g mouse) at E9.5 has on rare occasions led to a successful delivery, the resulting recombination efficiency is insufficient (Author response image 1 right panel).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-90164-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>While a Blimp1-Cre conditional KO model was used to assess male fertility on GR deletion, we believe this model may not be ideal for studying fertility in the context of aging. While Blimp1-Cre is highly specific to the germ cells within the gonad, there are many cell types outside of the gonad that express Blimp1, including the skin and certain cells of the immune system. It is unclear, particularly over the course of aging, whether any effects on fertility seen would be due to an oocyte-intrinsic effect, or the result of GR loss elsewhere in the body. While we hope to explore the role of GR in the aging oocyte further using alternative Cre models in the future, this is currently outside the scope of this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>RECOMMENDATION #6: Figure 5b: what is the left part of that panel? Is it the same volcano plot for germ cells as shown in part a but with splicing factors?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize if this panel was unclear. Yes, the left panel of Figure 5B is in fact the same volcano plot in 5A, labeled with splicing factors instead of top genes. We have edited Figure 5B and corresponding figure legend to clarify this.</p><p>References:</p><p>1. Oakley, R.H., and Cidlowski, J.A. (2013).
