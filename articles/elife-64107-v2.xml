contributor to passive force; however, its role in active force generation is unresolved. Here, we use a novel titin-cleavage (TC) mouse model that allows specific and rapid cutting of elastic titin to quantify how titin-based forces define myocyte ultrastructure and mechanics. We show that under mechanical strain, as TC doubles from heterozygous to homozygous TC muscles, Z-disks become increasingly out of register while passive and active forces are reduced. Interactions of elastic titin with sarcomeric actin filaments are revealed. Strikingly, when titin-cleaved muscles contract, myosin-containing A-bands become split and adjacent myosin filaments move in opposite directions while also shedding myosins. This establishes intact titin filaments as critical force-transmission networks, buffering the forces observed by myosin filaments during contraction. To perform this function, elastic titin must change stiffness or extensible length, unveiling its fundamental role as an activation-dependent spring in contracting muscle.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>skeletal muscle fibers</kwd><kwd>mechanics</kwd><kwd>ultrastructure</kwd><kwd>elasticity</kwd><kwd>contraction</kwd><kwd>immunocytochemistry</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>German Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB1002-A08</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Linke</surname><given-names>Wolfgang A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>IZKF Muenster</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Li1/029/20</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Linke</surname><given-names>Wolfgang A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Research Area Network on Cardiovascular Disease consortium</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MINOTAUR</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Linke</surname><given-names>Wolfgang A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>MedK Program Medical Faculty Muenster</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Recker</surname><given-names>Jannik</given-names></name><name><surname>Linke</surname><given-names>Wolfgang A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Elastic forces generated by the giant protein titin define both passive and active tension of skeletal muscle fibers and protect the sarcomeric myosin filaments from severe disruption during contraction.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The theories of muscle contraction were originally developed under the assumption that active force of a muscle cell’s contractile unit, the sarcomere, was entirely generated by the interactions of thick and thin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gordon et al., 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Huxley, 1957</xref>). Many years later, a third sarcomeric filament called titin (also known as connectin) was discovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maruyama, 1976</xref>), and research since then has demonstrated that titin is a critical component of sarcomeric function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Linke, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nishikawa, 2020</xref>). Titin is the largest known protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bang et al., 2001</xref>) and spans half of the sarcomere from the Z-disk to the M-band. The titin gene is truncated in a substantial proportion of the general population, and these truncations are frequently associated with cardiomyopathy and occasionally with skeletal myopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Linke, 2018</xref>). The I-band portion of titin links the thick and thin filaments as an extensible and viscoelastic spring. While the I-band titin spring produces most, if not all, of the passive force in sarcomeres, the role of titin during active contraction remains undefined, but yet seems critical because the (unspecific) destruction of titin coincides with passive <italic>and</italic> active tension loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Higuchi, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Horowits et al., 1986</xref>). In agreement, changes to I-band titin affect active force production but are not easily explained under the current paradigm of muscle contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Linke, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nishikawa, 2020</xref>). For example, skeletal muscles with genetically modified I-band titin show altered mechanical properties, including muscle stiffness and force, length-dependent activation, and mechanosignaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brynnel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buck et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mateja et al., 2013</xref>). A relationship between titin-based and actomyosin-based forces has been suggested to optimize the work generated by muscle contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rivas-Pardo et al., 2016</xref>). However, direct empirical evidence into titin-based regulation of active contraction is limited.</p><p>To study titin’s role in passive and active force production, the most straightforward experimental strategy is to compare the mechanical properties of muscle before and after the functional removal of titin. Classic techniques include genetically impairing titin synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Radke et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Swist et al., 2020</xref>), chemical degradation of titin via trypsin digestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Higuchi, 1992</xref>), or protein destruction via target ionizing radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Horowits et al., 1986</xref>). However, almost all animal models with a mutational change in titin present a phenotype of muscle dystrophy and wasting (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Radke et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Swist et al., 2020</xref>), and all previous methods to degrade titin also degrade other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Horowits, 1999</xref>). Therefore, it is difficult to identify data trends that are caused directly by the changes in titin or indirectly by the consequences of the ensuing ‘disease’ state.</p><p>To mitigate the problems outlined above, a new mouse model was generated with a cloned-in HaloTag-TEV cassette inserted into I-band titin close to the A-band (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rivas-Pardo et al., 2020</xref>). We refer to this mouse as the titin cleavage (TC) model. The tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease-recognition site is specifically cleaved by the TEV protease, while the HaloTag domain allows for easy protein labeling, useful, for example, for the assessment of titin cleaving. The insertion itself does not affect mouse development, muscle structure, or performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rivas-Pardo et al., 2020</xref>). Our experimental strategy is to use TEV protease to cleave I-band titin and terminate its functionality in a targeted and controllable fashion. This abrupt change to otherwise-normal sarcomeres allows us to precisely track the immediate changes in sarcomere structure and function with titin loss, and study as purely a titin-based effect as possible.</p><p>The purpose of this study is to use the TC model to define the role of titin-based forces in skeletal muscle contraction and sarcomere integrity. We achieve this by cleaving 0%, ~50%, and 100% I-band titin molecules in permeabilized wild-type (Wt), heterozygous (Het), and homozygous (Hom) TC fibers, respectively. We find that passive and active forces become progressively reduced as TC doubles from Het to Hom TC muscles, and we observe a striking disruption of Z-disk alignment. Remarkably, we uncover a previously unknown function of titin to support M-band structures by partially bearing the opposing forces that develop between adjacent thick filaments during contraction. Based on the established properties of titin elasticity and force, we find that titin’s mechanical buffering role requires a substantial increase in titin stiffness during contraction or a shortening of the extensible length of elastic titin, which we propose to take place by an activation-dependent enhancement of titin-actin binding.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Different TC muscle genotypes allow graded TC</title><p>Initially, we quantified the proportion of titin molecules containing the HaloTag-TEV cassette by antibody labeling the HaloTag in psoas skeletal muscles of all three genotypes (Wt, Het, Hom) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Both confocal immunofluorescence (IF) and immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) indicated the absence of HaloTag labeling in Wt TC fibers, whereas in Het and Hom TC fibers, HaloTag signals localized to their expected I-band (near I/A-band junction) position in the sarcomeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). On IF images, a signature doublet pattern of HaloTag labeling appeared. We used ACTN2, the Z-disk marker of α-actinin, as an internal normalization signal for HaloTag IF intensity. Het produced 57.3% of normalized HaloTag IF staining intensity compared to Hom TC fibers (Het: 32.08 ± 0.90) arbitrary units (a.u.; mean ± SEM, Hom: 55.95 ± 0.64 a.u.; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). When comparing the label abundance of HaloTag antibody-conjugated nanogold particles on IEM images between genotypes, Het contained 36.8% of Hom (Het: 34.42 ± 2.42 a.u., Hom: 93.60 ± 1.98 a.u., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We continued this assessment by treating permeabilized (skinned) TC skeletal muscle fibers with TEV protease for 6 hr, followed by titin analysis on Coomassie-stained protein gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Compared to a single N2A titin band (~3.7 MDa) in control samples (including treated and untreated Wt), after TEV protease treatment, two smaller bands were clearly visible in Het and Hom TC muscles at the expected sizes of ~2.3 MDa for A-M-band titin and ~1.4 MDa for Z-I-band titin, indicating specific titin cleavage. The ~2.3 MDa titin cleavage product was slightly smaller than a doublet running at ~2.4 MDa, which contains proteolytic titin fragment T2 and the alternative titin isoform, Cronos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Swist et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Densitometric analysis of intact and A-M-band titin intensities confirmed full cleavage in Hom fibers and revealed 43.12 ± 0.85% cleaved titins in Het (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). However, the ‘gold standard’ for protein quantification is western blotting, which we performed with anti-HaloTag antibodies following titin gel electrophoresis. We found that the proportion of mutant titins in Het was 49.86 ± 1.24% (n = 29) of Hom (100.00 ± 5.51%; n = 13) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). These data show that on average, approximately 50% of HaloTag-TEV titins are present in Het fibers and that these molecules are effectively cleaved by TEV protease.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mutant titin expression in skeletal muscles of different genotypes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of titin cleavage (TC) mouse half-sarcomere.

Periodic ramp-hold cycles then continued for an additional 30 min, and the final force trace was compared to the force trace immediately before the addition of TEV protease. Titin cleavage readily resulted in a length-dependent decrease of passive tension in Het and Hom TC fibers, but not Wt fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Fiber force was separated into velocity-insensitive (elastic; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>) and velocity-sensitive (viscous; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>) components as titin has viscoelastic properties. Both components were reduced in the mutant genotypes after titin cleavage, more so in Hom than in Het (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,D</xref>). The relative force decreases in Hom vs. Wt typically reached ~50–55% at SLs between 2.6 and 3.2 µm. Next, we searched for a correlation between decreasing passive force components and mean proportion of intact titins after TEV-protease treatment at each SL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,E</xref>). We found that negative correlations were strongest (R<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.5) at moderate or long SLs, with the slope of the regression becoming steeper at the longer SLs. At the shortest SLs, we found weak correlations (R<sup>2</sup> &lt; 0.5) as forces were always close to 0, which is in line with the relatively small titin- or fiber-based passive forces at these lengths, as well as the non-linear nature of the titin force–SL relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Prado et al., 2005</xref>). Hom and Het data was fit well by a linear curve, indicating that the proportion of titin cleavage was nearly the only factor affecting force in both genotypes.</p><p>Note that in glycerol-skinned fiber preparations, some but not all extra-myofibril components to passive force are removed; thus, non-titin contributions to passive force will be realized in passive force traces. Indeed, non-titin force components clearly appeared in treated Hom fibers, where nearly 50% of passive elastic forces remained between 2.4 and 3.2 μm SL and &gt;50% remained at 3.4 μm SL. These residual forces after titin cleavage in Hom skinned fibers are presumably due to strained intracellular (e.g. microtubules; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kerr et al., 2015</xref>) and/or extramyofibrillar structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Prado et al., 2005</xref>). Taken together, these results provide a precise quantification of titin’s contribution to permeabilized fiber viscoelasticity under relaxing conditions and substantiate the function of titin as a main determinant of passive, longitudinal cellular forces.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Radial compressive forces depend less on intact titin stiffness than tensile stretch forces</title><p>An often-neglected passive mechanical property of titin is its contribution to transverse stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 2016</xref>). As I-band titin is cleaved, this radial stiffness component will decrease, which is predicted to also decrease the magnitude of compressive forces the myocyte can withstand, and increase its indentability. We evaluated titin cleavage-induced changes to transverse (compressive) stiffness by nanoindentation using the atomic force microscope (AFM). We measured radial indentation depth and stiffness (Young’s modulus; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 2016</xref>) before and after TEV treatment of skinned, single, Wt and Hom psoas fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We found that titin loss in Hom fibers increased the indentation depth at 3 nN indentation force ~33% from 295.90 ± 5.97 nm to 392.70 ± 11.60 nm, and the Young’s modulus decreased ~33% from 4.81 ± 0.15 kPa to 3.24 ± 0.15 kPa (mean ± SEM; n = 34/38 recordings for Hom/Wt) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Thus, titin-based transverse stiffness is an important component of cellular transverse stiffness in skinned skeletal fibers.

Wt fibers treated with TEV protease appeared structurally normal, whereas TEV protease-treated Het and Hom TC fibers revealed A-band disorder (streaming) and Z-disks that lost their typical linear appearance. We quantified this Z-disk ‘waviness’ in EM images by comparing Wt with Het and Hom fibers fixed at average SL 3.3 μm. To this end, we developed custom software (see Materials and methods) that extracts Z-disk pattern data from EM images and calculates a variable that quantifies the level of Z-disk disorder, which we term ‘fracture area’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

Specific removal of thin filaments was possible by treatment with a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent gelsolin fragment, although this approach works well only in cardiac muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Linke et al., 1997</xref>), as confirmed for this study using permeabilized Wt cardiac and psoas muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Strikingly, while TEV-only treated cardiomyocytes demonstrated partial titin recoil, as in skeletal fibers, the removal of actin filaments allowed cleaved titins to recoil all the way to the Z-disk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

The A-band disruption was striking because the damage arose within individual A-bands, among adjacent thick filaments. In normal sarcomeres, the A-band is densely packed with well-organized thick filaments and associated proteins, and so present in EM images as an electron-dense darker ‘rectangle’ region with a center region of lighter and darker bands that characterizes the M-band, where adjacent thick filaments are tethered together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, Wt). However, after titin cleavage, individual A-bands showed a streaming effect of the electron-dense material and a loss of the typical M-band structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), all indicative of a loss of A-band protein order. Remarkably, these images suggested that single or groups of adjacent thick filaments detached from the M-band complex and from one another and traveled in opposite directions until driven against the Z-disks. Furthermore, Hom, and to a lesser extent Het fibers, presented thick filaments that appeared shorter than normal (&lt;1.6 μm), as if the myosin molecules were being shed from the tips of the thick filaments.</p><p>To substantiate this observation, we used loose protein gels (2.4% polyacrylamide) to quantify myosin heavy chain (MyHC) protein content relative to titin or nebulin (NEB) protein content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). In spite of substantial data scatter, general trends were apparent: the titin/NEB ratio of contracting fibers was largely unaffected by titin cleavage (Wt+TEV: 1.90 ± 1.15; Het+TEV: 2.19 ± 1.13; Hom+TEV: 1.19 ± 0.93), whereas the MyHC/titin ratio tended to be reduced (Wt+TEV: 13.72 ± 4.91; Het+TEV: 5.67 ± 2.05; Hom+TEV: 8.82 ± 4.71), and this trend was even stronger for the MyHC/NEB ratio (Wt+TEV: 11.03 ± 3.36; Het+TEV: 5.37 ± 1.38; Hom+TEV: 3.475 ± 1.73; p=0.081, Wt vs. Hom). These findings suggest that myosin molecules are free to float out into solution following titin cleavage and active contraction, emphasizing that contraction with cleaved I-band titin leads to rapid A-band destruction.</p><p>To further evaluate whether individual thick filaments travel toward the Z-disk and/or shed thick filament tips, we took a subset of mutant fibers from the activation experiments and labeled the HaloTag with antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref>). As the HaloTag localizes at the edges of the thick filaments, we used these markers to assess the relative position and length of individual thick filaments on immunoelectron micrographs. We found that A-band length is smaller after contraction of TEV-treated Het fibers and even shorter for Hom fibers. It is worth noting that the spread of A-band lengths observed in Hom emphasizes that A-band destruction is a dynamic process, of which our analysis only captures a snapshot in time.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Effect of titin cleavage on A-band structure during active contraction.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) A-band disorder visualized by tracking the HaloTag position by antibody labeling (red fluorescent secondary antibodies or nanogold particles), using correlative immunofluorescence (IF) and immunoelectron microscopy (IEM).

From our data, we draw the following main conclusions: (1) Titin-based passive stretch forces in permeabilized fibers scale linearly with the proportion of intact titin springs. (2) Titin contributes at least one-half of the passive viscous and elastic forces of permeabilized fibers in the longitudinal direction. (3) Titin stiffness is critical for maintaining Z-disk organization and structure under mechanical stress. (4) Cleaved titins not only recoil toward the Z-disk elastically but also bind to thin filaments. (5) Titin-based forces are crucial to maintaining high active contractile forces. (6) When titin-cleaved Het and Hom TC fibers contract, individual thick filaments quickly begin to separate from each other and travel toward the Z-disks. In parallel, myosin shedding from the thick-filament tips functionally shortens the thick filaments, sometimes up to almost their entire length. Taken together, these findings indicate that titin serves a protective role by preventing active forces from disrupting the A-band organization.</p><p>It is well established that the passive force magnitude and the SL at which passive force is measurable are correlated with titin size and stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brynnel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mateja et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Prado et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, unspecific titin degradation by trypsin or ionizing radiation in skinned fibers leads to passive force reductions proportional to the amount of titin destroyed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Higuchi, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Horowits et al., 1986</xref>). A linear relationship between the number of intact titin springs and titin-based passive force is clearly supported by our results. If all titins are cleaved in permeabilized Hom fibers, passive forces drop by a little over 50%, except at the extreme extensions, when other load-bearing elements (e.g. remnant extracellular matrix proteins; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Prado et al., 2005</xref>) become relatively more important.</p><p>Surprisingly, in Hom fibers held in a high-stretch state, titin cleavage caused an over-proportionate decrease (~67%) in passive force. The TEV-cleavage site is located in the distal Ig region, where six titin molecules engage in inter-titin interactions for ~100 nm, making up the ‘end-filament’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liversage et al., 2001</xref>). Beyond the end-filament, in the direction of the Z-disk, titin molecules divide into dimers or monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kötter et al., 2014</xref>); in the opposite direction, they probably run as dimers along the thick filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zoghbi et al., 2008</xref>). Because of the homotypic interactions within the end filament, it is likely that titin sometimes maintains a connection to its partner titins when cleaved at low passive force and so continues to bear force even when stretched to a long length for a short time (as in our stepwise-stretch protocol). However, in Hom fibers that are held at the long length for an extended time and then TEV treated, all six end-filament titins (per half-thick filament) may retract as a unit, presumably explaining the relatively large drop in passive force. Others have estimated that titin generates &gt;90% of total passive longitudinal force in skinned psoas fibers, when assessed using high-salt extraction baths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brynnel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Irving et al., 2011</xref>). These high-salt solutions have the disadvantage of also removing other proteins that are potentially load bearing (i.e. intermediate filaments). In contrast, TC fibers allow for target titin cleavage while leaving other proteins intact. Therefore, we provide an update to the current knowledge that in the physiological operating range (&lt;3.4 µm SL), titin contributes less than 70%, but over 50%, of total longitudinal force in permeabilized fibers. It will be interesting to study in future work with the TC mouse model how these values compare to the passive forces of intact fibers or whole muscles.</p><p>In contrast to longitudinal, permeabilized fiber transverse stiffness depends to a lesser degree on intact titin, which is responsible for approximately one-third of this stiffness. Other contributors to myocyte stiffness, especially transverse compressive stiffness, may include the microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kerr et al., 2015</xref>), the desmin intermediate filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Charrier et al., 2018</xref>), and the non-sarcomeric actin filament (microfilament) network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). Glycerol permeabilization procedures on fibers (performed in the current work) degrade some, but not all, of these extramyofibrillar structures, and so their contributions to fiber stiffness will probably be greater for intact fibers or whole muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brynnel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Irving et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In TEV-treated passive muscle fibers, cleaved titin recoiled toward the Z-disk but also got stuck to thin filaments along the way. Our data are in agreement with the hypotheses that titin functionalities in muscle contraction include titin-actin interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Linke, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nishikawa, 2020</xref>), which have previously been observed in molecular and myofibril preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dutta et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kulke et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nagy et al., 2004</xref>). Another interesting implication of our finding is that although titin-based passive forces are frequently not detectable &lt;2.5 μm SL in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Linke et al., 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Prado et al., 2005</xref>), they must be present even at shorter SLs, as titin was able to recoil all the way to the Z-disk. This makes it clear that titin always has some level of force that can contribute to Z-disk alignment and A-band centering at any SL, at least down to ~1.8 μm SL, where the I-band disappears as thick filaments drive into the Z-disk.</p><p>Titin has long been thought to maintain A-band stability during and after active muscle contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Higuchi, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Horowits et al., 1986</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Horowits et al., 1986</xref> used EM and graded radiation-induced titin destruction to demonstrate that titin plays a critical role in centering the A-band complex. Our results fully confirm and extend this ‘classic’ finding. We show, for the first time, that specific cleavage of the titin springs reduces active forces dramatically and that the tension loss correlates to the amount of titin being cleaved. Strikingly, after activation experiments, the sarcomere structures of TEV-treated Het and Hom fibers present severe disruption and widespread A-band distortion that forcibly detach and deteriorate A-band proteins. Because of their location around a thick filament, the 12 titin molecules (six titins per half-thick filament; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liversage et al., 2001</xref>) have long been thought to produce a centering force against thick-filament movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Horowits, 1999</xref>). These predictions are now demonstrated by the deterioration of thick filaments in titin-cleaved TC fibers.</p><p>The question thus arises as to what magnitude of passive elastic forces are generated by titins to sufficiently protect A-band stability during active contraction. The A-band is made up of ~500 parallel thick filaments per μm<sup>2</sup> cross-sectional area that sit in register and are connected at the M-band through force-bearing M-bridges, predominately made up of myomesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lange et al., 2020</xref>). At rest, all thick filaments are radially and longitudinally centered in a sarcomere by titin-based forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Horowits, 1999</xref>), and so tension on the M-band structures, caused by adjacent thick filaments, is ~0 pN. Importantly, because of thin filament length variability as large as 100 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Littlefield and Fowler, 2002</xref>), the force producing region between each half-thick filament and thin filament is variable at the immediate onset of contraction. Thick-filament movement away from a central position is exacerbated by M-band structures, which can extend up to 70 nm at low force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berkemeier et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Xiao and Gräter, 2014</xref>), allowing thick-filament movement toward the stronger side of the sarcomere during active contraction and enhancing force imbalances especially during prolonged contractions. Considering this within the context of sarcomere geometry, filament overlap, and structural mechanics between thick filaments, we conservatively estimate forces on M-bridges are &lt;50 pN (0–6.25% maximal force at optimal overlap, P<sub>0</sub>) on average, with pockets that could reach as high as 120 pN (~25% P<sub>0</sub>) at 2.6–2.7 µm SL. On the other side of the equation, there are the six titin filaments per half-thick filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liversage et al., 2001</xref>), and their forces have been estimated from passive myofibril mechanics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Linke et al., 1998b</xref>). Thick-filament movement within A-bands will lead to a titin length change of ~35 nm (six lengthening on one side/six shortening on the other side) and generate a titin-based centering force in psoas of ~12 pN/molecule at 2.65 μm SL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Linke et al., 1998b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Prado et al., 2005</xref>). Based on this first approximation, titin-based centering forces are up to an order of magnitude smaller than potential thick-filament movement forces. To produce 120 pN of centering force against our upper estimate of thick filament force, and provide A-band stability, active titin stiffness would need to be approximately 4x larger than measured in passive muscle.</p><p>Interestingly, recent hypotheses in muscle contraction purport that titin undergoes a structural rearrangement during contraction that leads to actin binding at or around the N2A/PEVK regions upon activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dutta et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kulke et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nagy et al., 2004</xref>). Consequently, the functional extensibility of I-band titin is thought to change so that only the stiffer PEVK region, and not the more compliant proximal Ig region, is extensible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Linke, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nishikawa, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Powers et al., 2020</xref>). This structural change has the effect of increasing titin stiffness by fourfold to sixfold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nishikawa, 2020</xref>), which is in agreement with our estimation that titin must become up to fourfold stiffer in active, compared to passive, permeabilized fibers. How actin–titin interactions are regulated upon active contraction to increase titin stiffness remains to be addressed in future work.</p><p>Finally, an unexpected result was the shedding of myosin proteins off the tips of individual thick filaments during contraction. The atomic structure of the thick filament remains to be fully resolved in mammalian muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Irving, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zoghbi et al., 2008</xref>). However, we do know that the central portion of the thick filament contains an even volume of myosin proteins, whereas the last ~160 nm of the thick-filament ends (including the D-zone; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) taper down until only a few myosin proteins are left, in a potentially unstabilized manner. Because the six titin filaments that run along the half-thick filament all converge at the end of the thick filament into the end-filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Houmeida et al., 2008</xref>), it is not difficult to consider that this region of titin can help stabilize the tips of the thick filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tskhovrebova and Trinick, 2017</xref>). This view is supported by the findings in zebrafish containing an A-band titin null mutation, where prenatal sarcomeres assemble normally, but quickly degrade at the start of prenatal contractile activity, indicating a lack of structural stability and a need for titin proteins for stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Myhre et al., 2014</xref>). Uncovering the reason for thick-filament instability after titin is cleaved, but not removed from the A-band, will be an interesting future line of investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene <italic>Mus musculus</italic></td><td valign="top">Ttn</td><td valign="top">Ensembl</td><td valign="top">ENSMUSG00000051747</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain background <italic>Mus musculus</italic></td><td valign="top">C57BL/6J</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rivas-Pardo et al., 2020</xref>, UKM animal facility</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:000664</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Approved by LANUV NRW, 81–02.04.2019.A472</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <italic>Mus musculus</italic></td><td valign="top">Ttn sequence between exons 224 and 234</td><td valign="top">doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-15465-9">10.1038/s41467-020-15465-9</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">HaloTag-TEV knock-in cassette</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-titin PEVK, rabbit polyclonal</td><td valign="top">Eurogentec, Belgium</td><td valign="top">Custom-made</td><td valign="top">IEM ‘(1:500)’, <break/>IF ‘(1:400)’</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-titin N2A, rabbit polyclonal</td><td valign="top">Eurogentec, Belgium</td><td valign="top">Custom-made</td><td valign="top">IEM ‘(1:400)’, <break/>IF ‘(1:400)’</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-titin T12, mouse monoclonal</td><td valign="top">Provided by Dr. D.O.

To limit protein degradation, all solutions contained one tablet of protease inhibitor (Complete, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) per 100 ml of solution. For activation experiments, fiber activation (high calcium) solutions were prepared (in mmol l<sup>−1</sup>: potassium propionate [170], magnesium acetate [2.5], MOPS [10], and ATP [2.5]; CaEGTA and K<sub>2</sub>EGTA were mixed at different proportions to obtain the target value of pCa 5 [−log(Ca<sup>2+</sup>)], pH 7.0). Data were collected for six treatment conditions: three genotypes (Wt/Het/Hom) at two treatment levels (with and without TEV protease incubation) each. On the day of experiments, permeabilized muscles were removed from the storage solution and vigorously washed in relaxing solution on ice. Small fiber bundles of 5–15 fibers were separated from the muscle and attached lengthwise to a piezomotor on one end and a force transducer on the other end via aluminum clamps (Scientific Instruments, Heidelberg, Germany). All mechanical experiments were performed at room temperature (20–22°C). Force data were recorded at 1000 Hz. Each fiber bundle was initially suspended in a bath of relaxing solution and then readily transferred to other baths as needed. SL was measured by laser diffraction and initially set to slack length (~2.2 μm SL). Length changes were accomplished by manual or computer-driven means. Experiments were conducted at room temperature (20–22°C).</p><p>We first performed passive mechanics on Wt, Het, and Hom fibers in relaxing solution based on established protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Prado et al., 2005</xref>). Muscle fibers were mechanically stretched from 2.2 to 3.4 μm SL in six incremental stretch-hold steps (0.2 μm SL at ~0.2 μm SL s<sup>−1</sup>) and returned to slack length. In between each stretch step, the fiber was held isometrically for 10 s to record stress relaxation. Fibers were repeatedly moved through this protocol (rest time in between trials, 10 min) until force traces became consistent between trials (~2–3 times), and the final run was recorded. Then, the sample was treated with TEV protease in relaxing solution for 10 min – found to be sufficient to achieve cleavage of all TC titin – and the stretch-hold protocol was repeated at regular intervals for 30 min. The final run was recorded and forces compared before and after treatment. To account for typical force decreases over multiple stretch-hold protocols, these experiments were repeated again without TEV protease incubation and these data used as a control baseline. Force was normalized to the peak force during the last stretch at 3.4 µm SL before addition of TEV, as a function of titin cleavage.</p><p>We then conducted an experiment to time-resolve the action of TEV protease on TC fibers. Titin cleavage removes titin-based passive fiber forces, and so we monitored passive force during TEV protease treatment as a proxy for TEV protease activity. We stretched fiber bundles slowly (&lt;0.5 μm s<sup>−1</sup>) in relaxing solution to 3.3 μm SL and allowed for stress relaxation for 10 min. Next, the samples were treated with TEV protease in relaxing solution for 30 min while recording force. A 30 min hold protocol naturally decreases passive force in untreated fibers (stress relaxation), and so to remove this force decrease, we normalized force data to time-matched control force. Data were normalized to the starting force right before TEV protease treatment. Data from time points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 min after the addition of TEV protease (or no addition, for control) were used for statistical analysis.</p><p>We also measured isometric active force in fiber bundles before and after TEV protease treatment. Fiber bundles began in relaxing solution at 2.2 μm SL and were then passively stretched (~0.5 μm s<sup>−1</sup>) to an average SL of 2.6 μm, held for at least 1 min to accommodate stress relaxation, and then activated in activation solution (pCa 5) for ~120 s, at which point force was always plateaued to a steady-state force. Fibers were deactivated by two relaxing solution washes and shortened back to 2.2 μm SL. Fiber bundles were then treated with TEV protease in relaxing solution for at least 10 min (based on findings in passive experiments), washed in fresh relaxing solution, and then the activation protocol repeated. Force data were normalized to the maximum steady-state active force before TEV protease treatment for each fiber bundle. To account for typical force decreases over activation protocols, these experiments were repeated without TEV protease incubation and this data used as a control baseline.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Radial stiffness measurements by AFM nanoindentation</title><p>To determine the contribution of elastic titin to radial compressive forces in myocytes, isolated, relaxed psoas fibers were probed by nanoindentation using an atomic force microscope (Nanowizard 3 AFM system, JPK, Berlin, Germany), as described recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Swist et al., 2020</xref>).

Indentation and Young’s modulus data were pooled by genotype (Wt/Hom) and treatment type (with or without TEV protease incubation) for statistical analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Transmission-EM and immuno-EM</title><p>To visualize the ultrastructure of fibers, muscle samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 15% picric acid in 100 mM phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4 for at least 24 hr. Samples were cut into longitudinal sections with a VT 1000S Leica vibratome (Mannheim, Germany) and rinsed twice in PBS. To visualize the HaloTag in situ, samples were blocked in 20% normal goat serum (NGS) for 1 hr and incubated with the HaloTag polyclonal anti-rabbit (Promega, 100-fold dilution) in PBS supplemented with 2% NGS overnight at 4°C. A subset of fibers from passive and active experiments were prepared with one or more of the primary antibodies specific for various parts of I-band titin: PEVK (polyclonal IgG, custom-made; Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium, 1:500 in PBS), N2A (polyclonal IgG, custom-made; Eurogentec, Belgium, 1:400 in PBS), and T12 (monoclonal IgG, kindly provided by DO Fürst, Bonn, 1:100 in PBS) sites. For cardiomyocytes, the primary antibody for the cardiac-specific N2B titin (TTN-3 against central I-band titin; polyclonal IgG, Myomedix, Mannheim, Germany; 1:500 in PBS) was used in place of N2A. The sections were then triple-washed with PBS and incubated with the respective secondary antibody conjugated to 1.4 nm Nanogold (Nanoprobes, Stony Brook, NY) overnight at 4°C under agitation. After extensive washing, all sections were post-fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde for 10 min and after rinsing, they were reacted with HQ Silver kit (Nanoprobes) to increase the apparent gold particle (GP) diameter. After treatment with OsO<sub>4</sub>, samples were counterstained with uranyl acetate in 70% ethanol, dehydrated, and embedded in Durcupan resin (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland). Resin blocks were made and ultrathin sections prepared with a Leica Ultracut S (Mannheim, Germany). Sections were adsorbed to glow-discharged Formvar carbon-coated copper grids. Images were taken using a Zeiss LEO 910 electron microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with a TRS sharpeye CCD Camera and manufacturer’s software (Troendle, Moorenweis, Germany).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Quantification of immunogold particle distribution</title><p>On immune-EM images, we measured the nearest distance between the sarcomeric Z-disk center and the epitope positions for several anti-titin antibodies, including the T12 (peripheral Z-disk), N2A or N2B (central I-band), and PEVK (I-band near A-band edge) antibodies, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Unger et al., 2017</xref>), following GP-conjugated secondary antibody labeling. In addition, we measured GP abundance per half-sarcomere on another subset of fibers. To quantify GP distribution, micrographs from at least three independent fiber preparations were analyzed. A minimum of 10 different cells and 50 sarcomeres per experimental condition were included in the analysis. As we intended to analyze the location of titin I-band epitopes, we defined a region of interest containing the sarcomeric I-band including Z-disk, ±20 nm, focusing on areas slightly below the surface of the fibers, because the pre-embedding immuno-EM technique provides best results in more superficial tissue regions. Counting of GPs was done in at least five non-adjacent sarcomeres (minimum, 100 GPs/condition). GP labeling that was considered background staining (e.g. cytosolic and/or extrasarcomeric [such as mitochondria] labeling) was excluded from the analysis. Only GPs with a minimum diameter of 8 nm and an appropriate electron density were included in the analysis. Fused (aggregated) GPs were also assessed if individual GPs were recognizable.</p><p>Additionally, in activated fiber bundles stained against the HaloTag with primary antibodies and GP-conjugated secondary antibodies, we measured the end-to-end length of thick filaments using the HaloTag positions as markers of the A-band edge. When individual thick filaments were not resolvable in the A-band, we connected epitopes that fell on a line perpendicular to the long axis of the sarcomere, on either side of the A-band (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Image processing and epitope distance measurements were done with ImageJ 64 bit Java 1.8 (NIH, Bethesda, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Quantification of Z-disk disorder</title><p>We created a new semi-automatic program that quantifies the level of Z-disk disorder on electron micrographs of muscle samples; we named this parameter ‘fracture area’. The value was compared among genotypes (Wt/Het/Hom) after TEV treatment of permeabilized fibers in a stretched state (average SL, 3.3 µm; range, 3.0–3.6 µm). The fracture area is a measure of discontinuities in the typically linear shape of Z-disks, the details of which will be submitted to a web-based collection of protocols; currently accessible at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/UKMPhysII/QuantitativeFractureCode">https://github.com/UKMPhysII/QuantitativeFractureCode</ext-link>. Briefly, transmission-EM images of fibers were processed with various filters to isolate the Z-disk structures. From these Z-disks, each pixel of a Z-disk line is assigned an x- and y-coordinate, which are then linearly regressed to create a straight line of best fit. The residuals of these are then weighted by the angular difference between the linear regressions for all Z-disks in the x–y coordinate space, averaged, and further processed to output the fracture area (measured in nm<sup>2</sup>). Increasing values indicate more Z-disk disorder.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Confocal laser scanning IF microscopy</title><p>Skeletal muscle samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 15% saturated picric acid in 100 mM PBS overnight at 4°C, dehydrated via ascending ethanol series, and embedded in paraffin. Thin sections (5–7 μm) were cut with an RM 2235 Leica microtome (Mannheim, Germany). Sections were rehydrated, blocked in peroxidase buffer, and a citrate-EGTA antigen recovery protocol was performed. Slides were rinsed with PBS and then blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin including 0.5% Triton X-100 for 60 min. Subsequently, sections were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C, using one of the following antibodies against (all dilutions in PBS): HaloTag polyclonal anti-rabbit (G928A, Promega, 1:100); ACTN2 monoclonal anti-mouse (EA-53, Sigma–Aldrich; 1:100), T12 monoclonal anti-mouse (kindly provided by D.O. Fürst, Bonn; 1:100), N2A polyclonal anti-rabbit (custom-made by Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium), PEVK polyclonal anti-rabbit (Myomedix, Mannheim, Germany, 1:400), and myomesin-1 monoclonal anti-mouse (MYOM clone B4; a kind gift from E. Ehler, London; 1:100). Secondary antibodies were Cy3- or FITC-conjugated IgG (Rockland, Limerick, PA; 1:400), which were incubated overnight at 4°C. Stained samples were embedded in Mowiol supplemented with N-propyl-gallate for bleaching protection and analyzed. IF imaging was performed with a Leica SP8 confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with an HC PL Apo CS2 63x NA 1.4 oil immersion objective.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistics</title><p>For each response parameter, full factorial ANOVAs with main effects genotype (WT, Het, Hom) and treatment (with or without TEV protease treatment) or Student’s t-tests were used. When ANOVA model effects were significant, a post hoc Tukey’s Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) all-pairwise comparison analysis was used to test for differences among group means. Alpha values were set at 0.05, and assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance were evaluated using the Shapiro–Wilk test of normality, Levene’s test for equality of variances, and residual analysis. A best Box–Cox transformation was applied to data, if needed, to meet assumptions. When assumptions were not met, we conducted a non-parametric analysis using a Kruskal–Wallis test (non-parametric ANOVA) and Steele-Dwass method (non-parametric Tukey’s HSD multicomparison analysis). Data are presented as mean ± standard error mean (SEM) unless otherwise noted. In figures, significant differences are indicated by n.s., not significant at p&gt;0.05, *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001. The exact value is given for p-values near the significance threshold of 0.05. Statistical analysis was conducted using Microsoft Excel (v11, Microsoft Inc, Seattle, WA) and GraphPad Prism (V7, GraphPad Software, Inc, San Diego, CA).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title> <p>We thank Dieter Fürst (Bonn) for providing the T12 titin antibody, Elisabeth Ehler (London) for the gift of the MYOM antibody, Marion von Frieling-Salewsky and Marianne Wilhelmi (Münster) for excellent technical support, Anna Good (Bochum) for critical text and artistic editing, and Julio Fernandez (New York) for providing the impetus for this study.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Visualization, Methodology, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: Laboratory mice were bred and housed at the University Clinic Muenster, in strict accordance with, and approval from the local authorities (LANUV NRW, Germany, 81-02.04.2019.A472).

A TEV recognition site is inserted between two distal Ig domains close to the I/A bands border region, allowing to very quickly – in the span of few minutes – cut titin in two via TEV protease digestion. This model by itself does not affect mouse development, muscle structure, or performance, but helps monitor titin cleavage at the boundary of I-band region and A-band in sarcomeres. The authors use this titin-cleaved model in muscle explants for force measurement experimentation.</p><p>The authors interrogate the contribution of titin to transverse and longitudinal passive mechanics. They find that depending on the amount of destroyed titin molecules, passive and active forces become progressively reduced in Het and Hom permeabilized psoas fiber bundles. They also perform high-quality EM analysis to assess titin recoil and the destruction to the sarcomere (particularly the thick filament) upon active contraction. From these results, the authors provide evidence that titin has a previously unknown function, namely it can support M-band structures.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The following concerns should be addressed or discussed before acceptance:</p><p>1) Figure 1Е. To what extent are the authors sure that the band of a protein with molecular weight of 2.3МDa is Cronos, the alternative titin isoform, but not T2 or sometimes called T3 titin fragments?</p><p>2) Figure 4C.

Thus, Western blot analysis should be performed to specify the exact location of nebulin in the similar gel.</p><p>Also, loss of myosin has some ambiguity. While it seems quite reasonable that this could occur, the authors attempt to quantify this first by looking at the amount of Titin N2A/myosin ratio in protein gels, which produces somewhat ambiguous results. Is the numerator reduced in this ratio after titin cleavage, and could that contribute to variable results? The loss of myosin is an interesting finding (which could also contribute to the drop in active force of course). Perhaps normalizing to another myofibril component (such as a-actinin) could strengthen this finding, or better yet a fractionation assay separating the myofibrillar compartment from a more soluble compartment may show that myosin appears in the soluble fraction after TEV treatment (prior to other myofibrillar elements), which would greatly strengthen this point.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64107.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The following concerns should be addressed or discussed before acceptance:</p><p>1) Figure 1Е.

In a recent publication (Swist et al., 2020), we used a new anti-mouse Cronos antibody that specifically labels the N-terminus of the Cronos isoform, but no other titin isoform. From these studies, we identified that Cronos is also present in titin gels, running slightly below the proteolytic band known as T2. We would like to refer the reviewer(s) to the published article (Swist et al., 2020). An alternative confirmation of the identity of the Cronos band in human cardiac muscle was obtained by us in the following paper, which used wildtype and Cronos-deficient human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes: Zaunbrecher et al., 2019.</p><p>The current manuscript Results refer to the Swist et al., (2020) paper:</p><p>“The ~2.3 MDa titin cleavage product was slightly smaller than a doublet running at ~2.4 MDa, which contains proteolytic titin fragment T2 and the alternative titin isoform, Cronos (Swist et al., 2020) (Figure 1E).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 4C. Considering that multiple proteins contribute to Z-disk alignment and that the I-band portion of cleaved titin recoils to the Z-disk, what could account for the dramatic loss of alignment in the z-disks under passive stretch? See also comment below for Figure 6C.</p></disp-quote><p>Z-disk alignment is affected directly by the titin-based forces that are pulling at them (perpendicularly from the long axis of the Z-disk) from two directions. We can safely assume that both sides of the Z-disk have hundreds of attached and evenly distributed titins along its whole length, extending to the adjacent thick filaments. In a healthy sarcomere, titin-based forces from both sides of the Z-disk will equal out, and so the Z-disk structure should stay straight. However, as we start to cleave titin with TEV protease, titins are not all severed at the same time. This leads to unbalanced titin-based forces on the Z-disk in localized regions, which will lead to Z-disk misalignment. At short sarcomere lengths (SLs), the titin-based forces are very small, and so small or no misalignments would happen. However, in our study we sever titins at relatively long lengths (up to 3.4 μm SL), where titin-based forces are much larger, and any titin-based imbalances during TEV protease cleavage will produce large force imbalances around the Z-disk and so lead to misalignment. As can be seen from our EM images in Figure 4 and Figure 5, the amount of Z-disk misalignment is variable, and indeed is not homogenous throughout an individual fiber preparation (i.e., some EM sections show more misalignment than others). We wanted to focus on the idea that titin-based forces can have a meaningful impact on Z-disk alignment.</p><p>The concluding sentence of the subsection “Titin cleavage causes Z-disk misalignment under stretch” emphasizes these findings:</p><p>“Taken together, the observed decrease in Z-disk linearity with progressive titin cleavage demonstrates the importance of titin-based forces in balancing out the I-bands on opposite sides of a Z-disk, which is an interesting, previously unrecognized, property of titin.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 5C/D. What is the effect on the gelsolin treatment alone?</p></disp-quote><p>We now include this control (Hom cardiomyocytes treated with gelsolin but not TEV) in Figure 5—figure supplement 3. After gelsolin-only treatment, anti-N2B antibodies label titins within the I-band, indicating that titins remain intact after thin filament extraction. The N2B epitope labeling is a bit more variable than in control cardiomyocytes with no gelsolin or TEV protease treatment in Figure 5, as is expected after actin removal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 6C. Why are Hom+ z-disks still reasonably aligned, even more so considering the dramatic effect of active contraction overall? How does the z-disk alignment in the active contraction condition compare to the dramatic loss shown in the passive stretch situation?</p></disp-quote><p>The is an important observation. Our earlier comment for Z-disk misalignment (Figure 5—figure supplement 3) also discussed this point. In passive samples, TEV protease incubation at ~3.4 μm SL leads to Z-disk misalignment because titin-based forces are relatively large and so produce more Z-disk misalignment. Our activation experiments were conducted at the much shorter length of 2.6 μm SL (optimal cross bridge-based forces but consequently, small titin-based forces). In our activation experiments, titin-cleavage occurred at this relatively short SL, and so small Z-disk effects were observed. Active contraction forces, although relatively large, do not seem to affect the Z-disks alignment as much as the A-band structures. We think that this is because active cross bridge-based forces (pulling on thin filaments attached to the Z-disk) between adjacent sarcomeres are still initially similar, even after titin cleavage, and only start to become imbalanced as the A-bands break down over time. We believe that longer activation times (2+ minutes) lead to further sarcomere breakdown, to the point where Z-disks are also highly damaged. Just as in the passive muscle preparations, samples from active experiments show variable sarcomere damage throughout, including very strong Z-disk misalignment, as can be seen in the EM images from Figure 7B, C and Figure 8D, E. In the end, the thick filaments break down upon contraction, suggesting that titin-based forces/structure help with thick filament maintenance and/or stability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 6 D. The lane denoted as Nebulin could be a titin degradation product. Lane Nebulin should be lower, near 1/3 of the top portion and 2/3 of the bottom portion of the gel. Notably, there are protein bands seen lower, which could be nebulin. Thus, Western blot analysis should be performed to specify the exact location of nebulin in the similar gel.</p></disp-quote><p>The reason why the nebulin band in Figure 6D is so close to the titin band(s) is that we used an “unusual” 2.4% SDS-PAGE gel, in order to detect both titin (top of gel) and MyHC (bottom of gel) on the same gel lane. When we use a more “typical” 1.8% SDS-PAGE gel, such as that shown in 1E, which resolves the titin species much better but does not display MyHC, we do observe nebulin in the lower portion of the gel. An example is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> (right side). The relative positions of these bands on the gel also depend on the gel running time, the electrical settings used, and a few other minor factors. To help visualize the nebulin band in Figure 6D, we have enlarged the upper region of the gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, left side). We have stated in the Materials and methods that these gels are prepared with different polyacrylamide concentrations. Since we are sure about the identity of the nebulin band on our gels, we have not performed western blotting against nebulin.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>The left gel is from Figure 6D (2.4% SDS-PAGE), the right gel is a more typical titin gel of 1.8% polyacrylamide (all gels are agarose-strengthened), where the nebulin band position is where most people would expect it.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-64107-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, loss of myosin has some ambiguity.

In this revision, we have attempted this by also normalizing MyHC protein to nebulin, which should be unaffected by the titin cleavage. We find that the MyHC:NEB ratio shows a strong trend to reduction in TEV-treated, calcium-activated, Hom vs. Wt muscle fibers (new graphs in Figure 6D). Both the MyHC:titin and the MyHC:NEB ratios show a substantial mean reduction from WT to Het and Hom, by a factor of two to three, while a more definitive conclusion was prevented by the large data scatter (which we believe is an inherent property of the activation experiments in the absence of intact titins). However, we think that this result provides strong support for the observation on electron micrographs suggesting that individual thick filaments lose myosin molecules when being activated without the support of titin-based forces. Taken together, our data suggest that in titin-cleaved, activated fibers, the A-band dissolves and floats into the buffer solution.</p></body></sub-article></article>
