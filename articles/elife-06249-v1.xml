However, it remains unclear whether nucleosomes mobilized by chromatin remodelers can influence TFs that are already present on the DNA template. In this study, we investigated the interplay between nucleosome remodeling, by either yeast ISW1a or SWI/SNF, and a bound TF. We found that a TF serves as a major barrier to ISW1a remodeling, and acts as a boundary for nucleosome repositioning. In contrast, SWI/SNF was able to slide a nucleosome past a TF, with concurrent eviction of the TF from the DNA, and the TF did not significantly impact the nucleosome positioning. Our results provide direct evidence for a novel mechanism for both nucleosome positioning regulation by bound TFs and TF regulation via dynamic repositioning of nucleosomes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06249.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06249.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06249.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells contain thousands of genes that are encoded by molecules of DNA. In yeast and other eukaryotic organisms, this DNA is wrapped around proteins called histones to make structures called nucleosomes. This compacts the DNA and allows it to fit inside the tiny nucleus within the cell. The positioning of the nucleosomes influences how tightly packed the DNA is, which in turn influences the activity of genes. Less active genes tend to be found within regions of DNA that are tightly packed, while more active genes are found in less tightly packed regions.</p><p>To activate a gene, proteins called transcription factors bind to a section of DNA within the gene called the promoter. Enzymes known as ‘chromatin remodelers’ can alter the locations of nucleosomes on DNA to allow the transcription factors access to the promoters of particular genes. In yeast, the SWI/SNF family of chromatin remodelers can disassemble nucleosomes to promote gene activity, while the ISW1 family organises nucleosomes into closely spaced groups to repress gene activity. However, it is not clear if, or how, chromatin remodelers can influence transcription factors that are already bound to DNA.</p><p>Here, Li et al. studied the interactions between a transcription factor and the chromatin remodelers in yeast. The experiment used a piece of DNA that contained a bound transcription factor and a single nucleosome. Li et al. used a technique called ‘single molecule DNA unzipping’, which enabled them to precisely locate the position of the nucleosome and transcription factor before and after the nucleosome was remodeled. The experiments found that a chromatin remodeler called ISW1a moved the nucleosome away from the transcription factor, while a SWI/SNF chromatin remodeler moved the nucleosome towards it.</p><p>Significantly, Li et al. also found that a transcription factor is a major barrier to ISW1a's remodeling activity, suggesting that ISW1a may use transcription factors as reference points to position nucleosomes. In contrast, SWI/SNF was able to slide a nucleosome past the transcription factor, which led to the transcription factor falling off the DNA. Therefore, SWI/SNF is able to move transcription factors out of the way to deactivate genes.</p><p>Li et al. propose a new model for how chromatin remodelers can move nucleosomes and regulate transcription factors to alter gene activity. A future challenge will be to observe these types of activities in living cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06249.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06249.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>chromatin remodeling</kwd><kwd>transcription factor</kwd><kwd>single molecule studies</kwd><kwd>gene regulation</kwd><kwd>optical trapping</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM059849</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Michelle D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation (NSF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB-0820293</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Michelle D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM084192</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bowman</surname><given-names>Gregory D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single molecule DNA unzipping reveals a novel model for the regulation of transcription factors and nucleosome positioning via nucleosome remodeling in yeast.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dynamic access to specific genetic information is critical for cellular development and response to the environment. Thus, processes such as transcription must be mediated by mechanisms that regulate gene function rapidly and reliably (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barrera and Ren, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kornberg, 2007</xref>). In eukaryotic cells, proper transcriptional regulation depends upon transcription factors (TFs) that bind to specific DNA-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kadonaga, 2004</xref>). Additionally, the repression of transcription has often been correlated with the presence of nucleosomes, the basic units of chromatin structure, in which histone–DNA interactions act as a barrier for RNA polymerase elongation along DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Petesch and Lis, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Teves et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, understanding the relationship between TF binding and nucleosomes is essential in understanding gene expression and regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Voss and Hager, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Chromatin landscape and promoter architecture are dominated by the interplay of nucleosome and TF binding. Nucleosomes and TFs have been shown to compete for binding to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mirny, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moyle-Heyrman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lickwar et al., 2012</xref>). This competition is based on the respective affinities of the TF and nucleosome for DNA, and depends upon DNA sequence, histone variants, and histone modifications. However, a nucleosome may also be repositioned through the action of chromatin remodelers, suggesting additional levels of transcription regulation. Some TFs are known to recruit nucleosome remodelers. Previous earlier studies focused on how these recruiting TFs affect the outcomes of nucleosome remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nagaich et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boeger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dechassa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Voss et al., 2011</xref>). However, it is unclear how TFs that do not recruit remodelers influence the chromatin landscape. We hypothesize that nucleosome remodeling, without remodeler recruitment, may regulate the state of a bound TF. Specifically, a remodeler may attempt to move a nucleosome to or through a site pre-occupied by a TF. During such an encounter, the TF may be displaced, or it may act as a roadblock for nucleosome remodeling. Thus, chromatin remodeling may serve as an alternative mechanism to regulate transcription through its influence on a bound TF, and a bound TF may dictate the location of a remodeled nucleosome.</p><p>Here, we studied the influence of nucleosome remodeling on a bound TF in a single molecule assay. We used a DNA unzipping technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jiang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shundrovsky et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hall et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dechassa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li and Wang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Inman et al., 2014</xref>) to characterize the locations of a bound TF and a nucleosome simultaneously, on long DNA templates to near base pair accuracy. By examining the remodeling behavior upon encountering a bound TF, we determined that the relationship between TFs and nucleosome remodeling not only plays a critical role in nucleosome positioning, but also reveals a novel mechanism for how a TF can be dynamically recycled by nucleosome remodeling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Precise determination of the position of a transcription factor and a nucleosome</title><p>In this work, we needed to precisely locate the positions of a nucleosome and a TF before and after nucleosome remodeling. We thus employed the DNA unzipping technique (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), which has been demonstrated to be a powerful single molecule technique for accurate and precise determination of positions and strengths of DNA–protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jiang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shundrovsky et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hall et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dechassa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li and Wang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Inman et al., 2014</xref>). To evaluate the precision of this approach, we constructed a DNA template containing a single Gal4 sequence for binding to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Gal4DBD) and a single 601 nucleosome positioning sequence (601NPE) for uniquely positioning a nucleosome. Gal4DBD contains only the 147 amino acids of the N terminal domain of the Gal4 protein and does not have any known remodeler recruitment function.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows representative traces from unzipping DNA molecules without nucleosome remodeling. The top trace of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows the result when the DNA template was unzipped starting from the Gal4 side. Both Gal4DBD (a single smaller peak) and a nucleosome (two clusters of larger peaks) were readily detected above the baseline of the corresponding naked DNA. The bottom trace shows the result when the DNA template was unzipped starting from the nucleosome side. Although the nucleosome unzipping signature was readily detectable, the unzipping signature of Gal4DBD was sometimes masked by that of the nucleosome. Therefore, it was often necessary to carry out unzipping experiments from both directions. Analysis of these unzipping signatures confirmed that unzipping mapped the position of the TF and the nucleosome to near base pair precision (‘Materials and methods’; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06249.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Single molecule unzipping technique detects Gal4DBD and nucleosome to near base-pair accuracy.</title><p>DNA molecules, each containing a nucleosome and a bound Gal4DBD, were unzipped.

First, we investigated the initial direction of nucleosome remodeling in the presence of a bound Gal4DBD in close proximity. This was achieved by limiting the remodeling reaction to the first remodeling event which we define as a single round of remodeler binding, nucleosome remodeling, and remodeler detachment from the nucleosomal DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shundrovsky et al., 2006</xref>).

The slight asymmetric distribution of the remodeled nucleosome was likely due to the non-palindromic feature of the 601 sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lowary and Widom, 1998</xref>) which leads to some asymmetry in the protein–DNA interactions at the two halves of a nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hall et al., 2009</xref>).

To determine whether such a differential behavior was a result of the DNA sequence used, we engineered another DNA template that was identical to this one, except that the Gal4 binding site was located on the other side of the 601NPE. After adding Gal4DBD, ISW1a again moved the nucleosome away from the Gal4DBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), while SWI/SNF again moved the nucleosome towards the Gal4DBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).

This indicates that SWI/SNF was able to move the nucleosome in such a way that the Gal4DBD was evicted from its binding sequence. For traces where a nucleosome was remodeled to the same side of the Gal4 sequence relative to the 601NPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), we also did not detect any Gal4DBD unzipping signature. This implies that these nucleosomes were likely first remodeled towards the bound Gal4DBD, as indicated by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, resulting in the eviction of Gal4DBD. This was followed by subsequent remodeling events that moved nucleosomes to other positions. Control experiments SWI/SNF is unable to evict a bound Gal4DBD in the absence of a nucleosome or in the absence of ATP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). An increase in the separation between the Gal4 binding site and 601NPS to 24 bp still permits SWI/SNF remodeling to evict Gal4DBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that SWI/SNF remodeling is able to evict a bound TF and this eviction requires the presence of a nucleosome.</p><p>Our findings provide the first direct evidence that SWI/SNF nucleosome remodeling is capable of evicting a bound TF. Previously, SWI/SNF was shown to move one nucleosome to invade and eventually disrupt an adjacent nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dechassa et al., 2010</xref>). Taken together with our findings, SWI/SNF nucleosome remodeling appears to be powerful machinery capable of actively overcoming and removing a variety of obstacles in its vicinity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Nucleosome remodeling shows similar effects in the presence of a Lac repressor</title><p>To rule out the possibility that the interaction between a TF and a nucleosome demonstrated above is specific to Gal4DBD, we replaced Gal4 binding sequence with a Lac repressor binding sequence and repeated the above experiments using the Lac repressor. Because the Lac repressor is only found in prokaryotic cells and has no known relationship with any chromatin remodeler in eukaryotic cells, it can act as a biologically neutral bound protein. When ISW1a remodeled an end-positioned nucleosome on a template also containing a bound Lac repressor, the Lac repressor effectively dictated the position of the remodeled nucleosome, with ISW1a centering the nucleosome on the DNA with the Lac repressor acting as a barrier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In contrast, SWI/SNF was able to slide a nucleosome in either direction, displacing the bound Lac repressor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that the mechanism of TF regulation by nucleosome remodeling is likely general without any specificity to a particular TF.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06249.019</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>ISW1a remodeling is blocked by Lac repressor, while SWI/SNF remodeling evicts Lac repressor from the template.</title><p>Shaded regions indicate locations of Lac repressor binding sequence and 601NPE.

However, rather than DNA ends, in vivo DNA nucleosome remodeling will most likely encounter DNA-binding proteins such as TFs. Here, we show that ISW1a senses a bound TF as a boundary during nucleosome repositioning, while SWI/SNF remodeling is unimpeded by the presence of a bound TF and is able to slide a nucleosome and evict the TF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

Biochemical studies and the crystal structure of ISW1a indicate that the DNA-binding domain of ISW1a binds to ∼29 bp of the extranucleosomal DNA, which has been proposed to act as an anchor to pull the nucleosome towards ISW1a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gangaraju and Bartholomew, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hauk and Bowman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yamada et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hota et al., 2013</xref>). Our finding that ISW1a moves nucleosome away from a TF adjacent to the nucleosome is consistent with an important role of the DNA-binding domain in engaging fully accessible DNA immediately flanking the nucleosome. In contrast, while it has been widely acknowledged that SWI/SNF does not require extra-nucleosomal DNA binding to remodel a nucleosome, cryo-EM and DNA-crosslinking experiments have shown that the Snf6 subunit of SWI/SNF binds to ∼15 bp of the extra-nucleosomal DNA and the rest of the SWI/SNF slides the nucleosome away from where the Snf6 subunit binds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dechassa et al., 2008</xref>). Although the Snf6 subunit has not been shown to be essential for remodeling, it has DNA-binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sengupta et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dechassa et al., 2008</xref>). We speculate that it may help to orient SWI/SNF binding on the nucleosome. In the presence of a barrier adjacent to a nucleosome, Snf6 may prefer to bind to the side of the nucleosome with more linker DNA and thus orient SWI/SNF to slide a nucleosome towards the TF.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Nucleosome spacing by ISW1a in vivo</title><p>Our study of ISW1a remodeling demonstrates that Gal4DBD is an effective barrier for ISW1a-mediated nucleosome remodeling and the ISW1a is able to use Gal4DBD as a reference point to reposition nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These results have significant implications for the mechanism of nucleosome spacing in vivo. Genome-wide nucleosome mapping in budding yeast revealed that deletion of ISWI in yeast disrupts nucleosome spacing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gkikopoulos et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that ISW1 remodelers are key players in generating evenly distributed nucleosomal arrays. In addition, several recent studies have shown that certain DNA-binding factors located at the promoter region are also responsible for nucleosome positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Whitehouse et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yadon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hughes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parikh and Kim, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Struhl and Segal, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lieleg et al., 2014</xref>). Our finding that a bound Gal4DBD is a barrier to ISW1a now provides direct evidence to illustrate that ISW1a can potentially use a TF around the promoter region as a reference point to evenly position nucleosomes into the gene body.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>In vivo implications of SWI/SNF action in TF regulation</title><p>Our study shows that TF eviction is an intrinsic property of SWI/SNF remodeling and is independent of SWI/SNF recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figures 4 and 5</xref>). It has been previously shown that SWI/SNF recruitment by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) induced histone loss in nucleosomes and this was immediately followed by GR and SWI/SNF eviction from the template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nagaich et al., 2004</xref>). Our current work demonstrates that, in the absence of remodeler recruitment, TF eviction via nucleosome remodeling can take place without substantial nucleosome loss. Although SWI/SNF can translocate along naked DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lia et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sirinakis et al., 2011</xref>), raising the possibility for TF eviction solely by SWI/SNF, we found that in the absence of a nucleosome, SWI/SNF did not displace Gal4DBD from its binding site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). Thus, SWI/SNF translocation alone is insufficient to displace a bound Gal4DBD and TF eviction requires nucleosome remodeling. Previous work by Owen-Hughes and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lia et al., 2006</xref>) found that translocation by RSC was highly sensitive to a force in the DNA. Therefore, although SWI/SNF is known to translocate along naked DNA, it may have limited ability in dealing with a road block, such as a bound protein. It is also possible that SWI/SNF is unable to efficiently locate a bound protein in the absence of a nucleosome. We speculate that TF removal may be accelerated once a nucleosome is repositioned over the bound TF. Indeed, a recent single molecule fluorescence study of Gal4 binding kinetics on nucleosomal DNA showed that a nucleosome regulates Gal4 binding not only by preventing Gal4 binding, but also by dramatically increasing the Gal 4 dissociation rate from the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Luo et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>SWI/SNF family remodelers are known to be involved in transcriptional activation. Genome-wide mapping of yeast indicates that, apart from localizing to nucleosomes around transcription start sites, SWI/SNF family remodelers are also enriched upstream of the promoter regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yen et al., 2012</xref>). Genome-wide analysis of the locations of human chromatin remodelers also found that Brg1, Chd4, and Snf2h are highly enriched at the promoter and distal upstream regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Morris et al., 2014</xref>). Since many relevant transcriptional modulators, such as enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ren, 2010</xref>) and insulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bell et al., 2001</xref>), are located further upstream of promoters, SWI/SNF family remodelers could move promoter nucleosomes to dynamically regulate these factors. Thus, although SWI/SNF alone does not possess any ability to remove TFs on its own, our work shows that SWI/SNF can slide nucleosomes to displace neighboring TFs around the promoter region, providing a mechanistic basis for dynamically clearing both nucleosomes and other bound factors upon SWI/SNF recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nagaich et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids</title><p>The plasmids containing the Gal4 binding site and the 601NPE with varied distances were prepared using standard PCR and cloning methods.

The unzipping methods have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li and Wang, 2012</xref>) and briefly summarized here. Whenever the unzipping fork encountered an interaction that prevented the fork progression, the unzipping force was ramped up linearly with time (15 pN/s) until the interaction was disrupted. When two interactions occurred in close vicinity, upon the disruption of the first interaction the force was unable to relax back to the baseline before being ramped up again for the second interaction, subjecting this subsequent interaction to a higher initial force. Therefore, for each region of interactions, the dwell time histogram highlighted the edge of the region first encountered. Another feature of this method was the display of the distinctive force signature for a nucleosome, allowing for robust identification of the nucleosome structure.</p><p>Data were low pass filtered to 5 kHz, digitized at ∼12 kHz, and later low pass filtered to 60 Hz.

For the experimental curves where the nucleosomes are located at the end of the template, the cross-correlation was carried out for a region immediately before the Gal4DBD disruption or nucleosome disruption.

Your article has been overall favorably evaluated by James Manley (Senior editor), two expert reviewers, and a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the two reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this manuscript, Li et al. use a single-molecule DNA unzipping approach to probe the mechanism of nucleosome remodeling by two ATP-dependent nucleosome-remodeling complexes, Isw1a and SWI/SNF, and the influence of DNA-binding protiens on this process. While the biochemical properties and mechanisms of action of ATP-dependent remodeling factors have been studied extensively, relatively few studies have examined how DNA-binding proteins impact and are impacted by nucleosome remodeling. Using a previously described unzipping assay, the authors present evidence that a Gal4 derivative (1-147) or the Lac repressor can block nucleosome sliding by ISWI1a. By contrast, the data suggest that SWI/SNF action leads to eviction of both Gal4 and LacR. The authors find that DNA-binding proteins serve as a barrier to nucleosome sliding by Isw1a, and nucleosomes tend to become evenly spaced between the DNA-binding protein and a barrier on the other side (such as the end of the DNA fragment). By contrast, SWI/SNF preferentially remodels nucleosomes toward the DNA-binding protein and displaces the DNA-binding factor in the process. This displacement by SWI/SNF depends on nucleosome remodeling.

Since the authors already observed that nucleosomes are initially moved by SWI/SNF closer to the Gal4DBD, they infer that nucleosomes are initially moved near or past the Gal4 binding site, displacing Gal4DBD, and then move in either direction afterward. This seems like a missed opportunity—why not just examine what happens to Gal4DBD in the initial remodeling event (in a 1 minute, or slightly longer, remodeling reaction as performed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>)?

This derivative is never used as a DNA binding domain control, but rather the 1-94 derivative is employed. SWI/SNF is known to be recruited by acidic activation domains, and it is not clear if targeting/binding by Gal4 (1-147) is impacting these results, especially the directionality of remodeling.

In contrast, the ISW1a experiments employ a variety of templates with varying distances. It is not clear why the same templates were not used for SWI/SNF studies.

We agree with the reviewers that it would be interesting to gain additional mechanistic insight to determine whether the loss of a bound Gal4DBD occurs either due to the invasion of the nucleosome or prior to this invasion. We had indeed contemplated the possibility of examining the fate of Gal4DBD during the initial remodeling event. Unfortunately we concluded that this experiment does not appear to be feasible for the following reason. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, after the initial remodeling event, SWI/SNF repositions the nucleosome by ∼ 30 bp towards a bound Gal4DBD so that the nucleosome will likely overlap the Gal4 binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). However, the force signature of a bound Gal4DBD is subtle compared to that of a nucleosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), and thus the presence or the absence of a bound Gal4DBD cannot be definitively differentiated from the nucleosome by the unzipping force. Therefore, in order to determine whether a Gal4DBD was present after nucleosome remodeling, we allowed SWI/SNF to carry out multiple rounds of remodeling reactions to potentially reposition the nucleosome sufficiently far from the Gal4 binding site to allow for a definitive assay of the state of binding at the Gal4 binding site. We have now revised the main text to clarify this point (subsection headed “SWI/SNF remodeling evicts Gal4DBD from DNA”).</p><p><italic>3) It is not clear how SWI/SNF complex can translocate past the Gal4DBD without displacing it in the absence of a nucleosome (in the first paragraph of the subsection headed “In vivo implications of SWI/SNF action in TF regulation”).

Some discussion of this point would be useful</italic>.</p><p>We appreciate that the reviewers brought up this interesting point. We did not state in the manuscript that “SWI/SNF complex can translocate past the Gal4DBD without displacing it in the absence of a nucleosome”. However, the ability of SWI/SNF to translocate along DNA raises the possibility that SWI/SNF might be able to displace a TF on its own. Our control experiment was indeed designed to investigate this possibility and we found that SWI/SNF, in the absence of a nucleosome, did not displace a TF. We thus concluded that “SWI/SNF translocation alone is insufficient to displace a bound Gal4DBD, and TF eviction requires nucleosome remodeling” (please see “Differential directionality of nucleosome remodeling”).</p><p>Previous work by Owen-Hughes and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lia et al., 2006</xref>) found that translocation by RSC was highly sensitive to a force in the DNA. Therefore, although SWI/SNF is known to translocate along naked DNA, it may have limited ability in dealing with a road block, such as a bound protein. It is also possible that SWI/SNF is unable to efficiently locate a bound protein in the absence of the nucleosome. We have added some discussion on this under the Discussion section (subsection headed “In vivo implications of SWI/SNF action in TF regulation”).</p><p><italic>4) Gal4 (1-147) is known to contain a transcriptional activation domain that is functional in vitro (Lin et al., Cell. 1988 Aug 26;54(5):659-64).

If the authors wish to further investigate the directionality issue, they should either use 1-94, or use the Lac repressor constructs</italic>.</p><p>We agree that Gal4 (1-94) is a more stringent DNA binding domain control than Gal4 (1-147). We used Gal4 (1-147) for the following reasons:</p><p>A) We had in fact considered using Gal4 (1-100) initially. However, Gal4 (1-100) was shown to have 50 times lower binding affinity to the Gal4 binding site than Gal4 (1-147): <italic>K</italic>d is 500 pM for Gal4 (1-100) (Liang, S. D. et al. MCB 1996) and 20 pM for Gal4 (1-147) (Carey et al. JMB 1989). Our single molecule experiments were carried out over a course of up to one hour. Since a lower DNA binding affinity is often correlated with a shorter dwell time on DNA, we were concerned about the possibility of a short dwell time of Gal4 (1-100). We found that Gal4 (1-147) is stably bound to DNA without any substantial dissociation for the entire period of experiments in the absence of nucleosome remodeling by SWI/SNF.</p><p>B) Gal4 (1-147) has been shown not to activate transcription in vivo (Field, S. and Song, O. Nature 1989), nor does it have any known capability to recruit nucleosome remodelers. In the publication by Lin et al. (Cell, 1988), experiments were not conducted on nucleosomal DNA templates and transcription activation appeared to be mediated by a mechanism that does not involve SWI/SNF recruitment.</p><p>C) Bartholomew and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dechassa, Mol Cell, 2010</xref>) found that Gal4-VP16 recruitment of SWI/SNF biases a nucleosome away from the bound Gal4-VP16. We observed the opposite effect: SWI/SNF moves a nucleosome towards the bound Gal4 (1-147), indicating a lack of specific recruitment of SWI/SNF by Gal4 (1-147).</p><p>D) Although we used Gal4 (1-147) as the main TF in our system, we also complemented this work with the Lac repressor, which is a foreign protein not present in the eukaryotic system. The fact that we observed essentially identical results using both Gal4 (1-147) and the Lac repressor further suggests that Gal4 (1-147) served primarily as a DNA binding domain.</p><p><italic>5) The authors need to provide an ATP control to demonstrate that loss of the Gal4 signature reflects actual remodeling events, rather than simply a consequence of SWI/SNF binding. This is especially problematic as the SWI/SNF experiments all appear to use substrates where the Gal4 or Lac binding sites are extremely close to the nucleosome edge (10-11 bp). In contrast, the ISW1a experiments employ a variety of templates with varying distances. It is not clear why the same templates were not used for SWI/SNF studies. From their model, SWI/SNF should be able to evict Gal4 even if it is located at great distances from the 601 sequence. Such templates should be tested</italic>.</p><p>We appreciate that the reviewers raised the possibility that the loss of a bound Gal4DBD might be a result of SWI/SNF binding, rather than SWI/SNF remodeling of the nucleosome. We have thus conducted an additional experiment to examine this possibility by repeating experiments similar to those presented in the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, except in the absence of ATP. As shown in the new <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 4–source data 1</xref> (right column), in the absence of ATP, SWI/SNF does not result in Gal4DBD dissociation, even when the Gal4 binding site is separated by 10 bp from the 601NPE. This revised figure further demonstrates the Gal4DBD eviction requires the simultaneous presence of SWI/SNF, ATP, and nucleosome.</p><p>We also appreciate the question as to why our experiments with SWI/SNF were not conducted on a variety of templates with the Gal4 binding site separated at a range of distances from the 601NPE, as were done with ISWI experiments. This was due to technical challenges with the SWI/SNF experiments, which might not be evident from the original manuscript. In contrast to ISW1a-remodeled nucleosomes that were always located within a rather narrow distribution on one side of the TF, SWI/SNF remodeled nucleosomes were located over a much broader range of positions on both sides of the Gal4 binding site. For a given remodeling reaction time, the farther the Gal4 binding site is separated from the 601NPE, the lower the probability of detecting a remodeled nucleosome that is repositioned to the other side of the Gal4 binding site. In addition, in order to determine whether the Gal4DBD is still present on the template when a nucleosome is repositioned to the other side of the Gal4 binding site, the nucleosome must be located sufficiently far from the Gal4 binding site so that the footprint of the repositioned nucleosome does not overlap with the Gal4 binding site (see our answer to comment #2). Thus the larger the separation between the Gal4 binding site and the 601NPE, the more data traces that must be collected to accumulate sufficient statistics of such events.</p><p>That being said, we recognize the importance of providing further evidence that a bound TF, located further away from the 601NPE, can still be evicted by SWI/SNF nucleosome remodeling. Therefore, we have conducted an additional experiment on a template where the Gal4 binding site was separated from the 601NPE by 24 bp. The results from this new experiment confirm that if a nucleosome was repositioned to the other side of the Gal4 binding site, Gal4DBD was evicted. These results are now presented as the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>6) Note that previous nucleosome mapping experiments by the Bartholomew lab (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11"><italic>Dechassa et al., 2008</italic></xref><italic>) showed that the Snf6 subunit of SWI/SNF actually binds to the first 15 bp of linker DNA and would thus compete for Gal4 (1-147) or Lac binding</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for noting the Snf6’s binding to DNA and its potential effect on our results. Because the Snf6 subunit binding requires ∼ 15 bp of linker DNA, the 10 bp separation between the Gal4 binding site and the 601NPE is likely insufficient for SWI/SNF binding. Thus we feel that this constraint may lead SWI/SNF to orient itself so that Snf6 will preferably bind to the other side of the nucleosome. According to the work from the Bartholomew lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dechassa et al. 2008</xref>), the ATPase domain binds on the opposite side of the Snf6 binding location on the nucleosome, and we believe that the preferential binding of Snf6 to the relatively open side of the nucleosome eventually leads the SWI/SNF remodeling towards the bound TF. Text commenting on this can be found in the subsection headed “Differential directionality of nucleosome remodeling”.</p><p>It is worth pointing out that this preferential orientation of SWI/SNF binding on a nucleosome is not required for TF eviction. As demonstrated in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref> in response to comment #5, the 24 bp separation between the Gal4 binding site and the 601NPE should allow Snf6 subunit binding, and this configuration still results in TF eviction.</p><p><italic>7) Note that older experiments from the Kadonaga group (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51"><italic>Pazin et al., 1997</italic></xref><italic>, Science 276:809) showed very nicely that a DNA binding domain (tetR) could provide a boundary function for ATP-dependent remodeling enzymes.

However, the use of a <italic>Drosophila</italic> extract in that work made it difficult to determine which protein, or proteins, contributed to this function. Considering our findings, that SWI/SNF and ISWI family enzymes yield differential outcomes in dealing with a bound TF, we feel it is essential to study these two classes of enzymes separately. The novelty of our work lies at the findings of the highly different behaviors of these two families of enzyme, in terms of the direction to reposition a nucleosome adjacent to a bound TF, the positions of the remodeled nucleosomes, and the fate of the TF after remodeling. Nonetheless, we recognize the importance of this earlier work by the Kadonaga group, and it is now referenced in the subsection “Gal4DBD is a barrier for nucleosome sliding by ISW1a”.</p><p><italic>8) The authors state that the ability of Gal4 to impart directionality onto the SWI/SNF remodeling reaction is novel. However, Workman and colleagues have previously provided evidence for a similar effect in ensemble experiments with Gal4-VP16 (EMBO J 2007 26:730)</italic>.</p><p>We appreciate this point regarding the novelty of our work and would like to emphasize the difference between our work and Workman’s:</p><p>A) The Workman and colleagues paper focused on octamer dissociation by SWI/SNF, stimulated by Gal4-VP16. In contrast, our work focused on the fate of Gal4DBD. We also did not detect substantial octamer dissociation.</p><p>B) In terms of remodeling directionality, our findings are very different from those of Workman and colleagues. In the Workman experiment, the Gal4 binding site, separated by ∼20 bp from the nucleosome, was used to recruit SWI/SNF via a bound Gal4-VP16. Under this configuration, nucleosomes were remodeled off the template, away from the Gal4 binding site. In contrast, our template design placed the Gal4 binding site 10 bp from the 601NPE, and we found that the nucleosome was remodeled towards the Gal4 binding site. We attribute the opposite directionality from these two studies to SWI/SNF orientation on the nucleosome. In the Workman experiment, the 20 bp separation was sufficient for the binding of Snf6 subunit of the SWI/SNF, and thus the Gal4-VP16 oriented the SWI/SNF to slide the nucleosome away from the Gal4 binding site. In our experiment, the 10 bp separation prevented binding of Snf6 subunit so that the Snf6 could only bind on the site of the nucleosome distal to the Gal4 binding site. This difference in directionality also highlights the difference in nucleosome remodeling with and without specific recruitment.</p><p>C) We believe that our work provides unique insight about how SWI/SNF can further regulate a bound protein after being recruited by a specific TF. Our work complements Workman’s and provides a more comprehensive picture of how transcription can be regulated by SWI/SNF nucleosome remodeling.</p><p><italic>9) It is not clear from the Methods section when the unzipping reaction is performed.
