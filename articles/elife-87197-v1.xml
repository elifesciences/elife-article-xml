Goal-directed reading, that is, reading a passage to answer a question in mind, is a common real-world task that strongly engages attention. Here, we investigate what computational models can explain attention distribution in this complex task. We show that the reading time on each word is predicted by the attention weights in transformer-based deep neural networks (DNNs) optimized to perform the same reading task. Eye tracking further reveals that readers separately attend to basic text features and question-relevant information during first-pass reading and rereading, respectively. Similarly, text features and question relevance separately modulate attention weights in shallow and deep DNN layers. Furthermore, when readers scan a passage without a question in mind, their reading time is predicted by DNNs optimized for a word prediction task. Therefore, we offer a computational account of how task optimization modulates attention distribution during real-world reading.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>computational neuroscience</kwd><kwd>reading comprehension</kwd><kwd>eye movements</kwd><kwd>deep neural network</kwd><kwd>visual attention</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>STI2030-Major Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021ZD0204105</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ding</surname><given-names>Nai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32222035</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ding</surname><given-names>Nai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32300856</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zou</surname><given-names>Jiajie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100017530</institution-id><institution>Major Scientific Project of Zhejiang Laboratory</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019KB0AC02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ding</surname><given-names>Nai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012226</institution-id><institution>Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>226-2023-00091</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ding</surname><given-names>Nai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>When reading natural passages with or without a question in mind, the time reading each word is explained by deep neural networks optimized for information-retrieval or word prediction tasks, respectively.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Attention profoundly influences information processing in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Posner and Petersen, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Treisman and Gelade, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rayner, 1998</xref>), and a large number of studies have been devoted to studying the neural mechanisms of attention. From the perspective of David Marr, the attention mechanism can be studied from three levels, that is, the computational, algorithmic, and implementational levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Marr, 1982</xref>). At the computational level, attention is traditionally viewed as a mechanism to allocate limited central processing resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kahneman, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Franconeri et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lennie, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carrasco, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Borji and Itti, 2012</xref>). More recent studies, however, propose that attention is a mechanism to optimize task performance, even in conditions where the processing resource is not clearly constrained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dayan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gottlieb et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Legge et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu and Reichle, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Najemnik and Geisler, 2005</xref>). The optimization hypothesis can explain the attention distribution in a range of well-controlled learning and decision-making tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Najemnik and Geisler, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Navalpakkam et al., 2010</xref>), but is rarely tested in complex processing tasks for which the optimal strategy is not obvious. Therefore, the computational principles that underlie the allocation of human attention during complex tasks remain elusive. Nevertheless, complex tasks are critical conditions to test whether the attention mechanisms abstracted from simpler tasks can truly explain real-world attention behaviors.</p><p>Reading is one of the most common and most sophisticated human behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gagl et al., 2022</xref>), and it is strongly regulated by attention: Since readers can only recognize a couple of words within one fixation, they have to overtly shift their fixation to read a line of text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rayner, 1998</xref>). Thus, eye movements serve as an overt expression of attention allocation during reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rayner, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clifton et al., 2016</xref>). Computational modeling of the eye movements has mostly focused on normal reading of single sentences. At the computational level, it has been proposed that the eye movements are programmed to, for example, minimize the number of eye movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Legge et al., 2002</xref>). At the algorithmic and implementational level, models such as the E-Z reader (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reichle et al., 2003</xref>) can accurately predict the eye movement trajectory with high temporal and spatial resolution. Everyday reading behavior, however, often engages reading of a multiline passage and generally has a clear goal, for example, information retrieval or inference generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">White et al., 2010</xref>). Few models, however, have considered how the reading goal modulates reading behaviors. Here, we address this question by analyzing how readers allocate attention when reading a passage to answer a specific question in mind. The question may require, for example, information retrieval, inference generation, or text summarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We investigate whether the task optimization hypothesis can explain the attention distribution in such goal-directed reading tasks.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experiment and performance.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental procedure for Experiments 1–3.

Recent advances in DNN models, however, provide a potential tool to solve this computational problem since DNN models equipped with attention mechanisms have approached and even surpassed mean human performance on goal-directed reading tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). Attention in DNN also functions as a mechanism to selectively extract useful information, and therefore, attention may potentially serve a conceptually similar role in DNN. Furthermore, recent studies have provided strong evidence that task-optimized DNN can indeed explain the neural response properties in a range of visual and language processing tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yamins et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goldstein et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schrimpf et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hasson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Donhauser and Baillet, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rabovsky et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heilbron et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, although the DNN attention mechanism certainly deviates from the human attention mechanism in terms of its algorithms and implementation, we employ it to probe the computational-level principle underlying human attention distribution during real-world goal-directed reading.</p><p>Here, we investigated what computational principles could generate human-like attention distribution during a goal-directed reading task. We employed DNNs to derive a set of attention weights that are optimized for the goal-directed reading task and tested whether such optimal weights could explain human attention measured by eye tracking. Furthermore, since both human and DNN processing is hierarchical, we also investigated whether the human attention distribution during different processing stages, which are characterized through different eye-tracking measures, and the DNN attention weights in different layers may be differentially influenced by visual features, text properties, and the top-down task. Additionally, we recruited both native and non-native readers to probe how language proficiency contributed to the computational optimality of attention distribution.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experiment 1: Task and performance</title><p>In Experiment 1, the participants (N = 25 for each question) first read a question and then read a passage based on which the question should be answered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). After reading the passage, the participants chose from four options which option was the most suitable answer to the question. In total, 800 question/passage pairs were adapted from the RACE dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lai et al., 2017</xref>), a collection of English reading comprehension questions designed for Chinese high school students who learn English as a second language. The questions fell into six types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>): three types of questions required attention to details, for example, retrieving a fact or generate inference based on a fact, which were referred to as local questions. The other three types of questions concerned the general understanding of a passage, for example, summarizing the main idea or identifying the purpose of writing, which were referred to as global questions. None of the question directly appeared in the passage, and the longest string that overlapped in the passage and question was 1.8 ± 1.5 words on average.</p><p>Participants in Experiment 1 were Chinese college or graduate students who had relatively high English proficiency. The participants correctly answered 77.94% questions on average and the accuracy was comparable across the six types of questions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We employed computational models to analyze what kinds of computations were required to answer the questions. The simplest heuristic model chose the option that best matched the passage orthographically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This orthographic model achieved 25.6% accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Another simple heuristic model only considered word-level semantic matching between the passage and option, and achieved 27.3% accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The low accuracy of the two models indicated that the reading comprehension questions could not be answered by word-level orthographic or semantic matching.</p><p>Next, we evaluated the performance of four context-dependent DNN models, that is, Stanford Attentive Reader (SAR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2016</xref>), BERT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Devlin et al., 2019</xref>), ALBERT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lan et al., 2020</xref>), and RoBERTa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2019</xref>), which could integrate information across words to build passage-level semantic representations. The SAR used the bidirectional recurrent neural network (RNN) to integrate contextual information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and achieved 47.6% accuracy. The other three models, that is, BERT, ALBERT, and RoBERTa, were transformer-based models that were trained in two steps, that is, pre-training and fine-tuning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Since the three models had similar structures, we averaged the performance over the three models (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> for the results of individual models). The model performance on the reading task was 37.08 and 73%, respectively, after pre-training and fine-tuning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Computational models of human attention distribution</title><p>In Experiment 1, participants were allowed to read each passage for 2 min. Nevertheless, to encourage the participants to develop an effective reading strategy, the monetary reward the participant received decreased as they spent more time reading the passage (see ‘Materials and methods’ for details). The results showed that the participants spent, on average, 0.7 ± 0.2 min reading each passage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), corresponding to a reading speed of 457 ± 142 words/min when divided by the number of words per passage. The speed was almost twice the normal reading speed for native readers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rayner, 1998</xref>), indicating a specialized reading strategy for the task.</p><p>Next, we employed eye tracking to quantify how the readers allocated their attention to achieve effective reading and analyze which computational models could explain the reading time on each word, that is, the total fixation duration on each word during passage reading. In other words, we probed into what kind of computational principles could generate human-like attention distribution during goal-directed reading. A simple heuristic strategy was to attend to words that were orthographically or semantically similar to the words in the question (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The predictions of the heuristic models were not highly correlated with the human word reading time, and the predictive power, that is, the Pearson correlation coefficient between the predicted and real word reading time, was around 0.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>The DNN models analyzed here, that is, SAR, BERT, ALBERT, and RoBERTa, all employed the attention mechanism to integrate over context to find optimal question answering strategies. Roughly speaking, the attention mechanism applied a weighted integration across all input words to generate a passage-level representation and decide whether an option was correct or not, and the weight on each word was referred to as the attention weight (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> for illustrations about the attention mechanisms in the SAR and transformer-based models, respectively). When the attention weights of the SAR were used to predict the human word reading time, the predictive power was about 0.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Human attention distribution and computational models.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Examples of human attention distribution, quantified by the word reading time.

Consequently, each word had 144 attention weights (12 layers × 12 heads), which were used to model the word reading time of humans based on linear regression. Since the attention weights of three transformer-based models showed comparable power to predict human word reading time, we reported the predictive power averaged over models (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref> for the results of individual models). The attention weights of randomly initialized transformer-based models could predict the human word reading time and the predictive power, which was around 0.3, was significantly higher than the chance level and the SAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>).

These results suggested that the human attention distribution was consistent with the attention weights in transformer-based models that were optimized to perform the same goal-directed reading task.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Factors influencing human word reading time</title><p>The attention weights in transformer-based DNN models could predict the human word reading time. Nevertheless, it remained unclear whether such predictions were purely driven by basic text features that were known to modulate word reading time. Therefore, in the following, we first analyzed how basic text features modulated the word reading time during the goal-directed reading task, and then checked whether transformer-based DNNs could capture additional properties of the word reading time that could not be explained by basic text features.</p><p>Here, we further decomposed text features into visual layout features, that is, position of a word on the screen, and word features, for example, word length, frequency, and surprisal. Layout features were features that were mostly induced by line changes, which could be extracted without recognizing the words, while word features were finer-grained features that could only be extracted when the word or neighboring words were fixated. Linear regression analyses revealed layout features could significantly predict the word reading time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). Furthermore, the predictive power was higher for global than local questions (p=4 × 10<sup>–5</sup>, bootstrap, false discovery rate [FDR] corrected for comparisons across three features, i.e., layout features, word features, and question relevance), suggesting a question-type-specific reading strategy. Word features could also significantly predict human reading time, even when the influence of layout features was regressed out. Additionally, a linear mixed effect model revealed significant fixed effects for question type and all text/task-related features, as well as significant interactions between question type and these text/task-related features (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pinheiro and Bates, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kuznetsova et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The predictive power of the layout and word features, however, was lower than the predictive power of attention weights of transformer-based models (p=4 × 10<sup>–5</sup>, bootstrap, FDR corrected for comparisons across two features, i.e., layout and word features). When the layout and word features were regressed out, the residual word reading time was still significantly predicted by the attention weights in transformer-based models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>, predictive power about 0.3). This result indicated that what the transformer-based models extracted were more than basic text features. Next, we analyzed whether the transformer-based models, as well as the human word reading time, were sensitive to task-related features. To characterize the relevance of each word to the question answering task, we asked another group of participants to annotate which words contributed most to question answering. The annotated question relevance could significantly predict word reading time, even when the influences of layout and word features were regressed out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). When the question relevance was also regressed out, the residual word reading time was still significantly predicted by the attention weights in transformer-based models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>, p=0.003, bootstrap, FDR corrected for comparisons across 12 models × 6 question types), but the predictive power dropped to about 0.2. Furthermore, a linear mixed effect model also revealed that more than 85% of the DNN attention heads contribute to the prediction of human reading time when considering text features and question relevance as covariates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>). These results demonstrated that the DNN attention weights provided additional information about the human word reading time than the text-related and task-related features analyzed here.</p><p>Further analyses revealed two properties of the distribution of question-relevant words. First, for local questions, the question-relevant words were roughly uniformly distributed in the passage, while for global questions, the question-relevant words tended to be near the passage beginning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). The eye-tracking data showed that readers also spent more time reading the passage beginning for global than local questions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), explaining why layout features more strongly influenced the answering of global than local questions. Second, few lines in the passage were question relevant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>), and the eye-tracking data showed that readers spent more time reading the line with the highest question relevance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), confirming the influence of question relevance on word reading time.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Attention in different processing stages for humans and DNNs</title><p>Next, we investigated whether humans and DNNs attended to different features in different processing stages.

Previous support for the hypothesis mostly comes from tasks for which the optimal strategy can be easily derived. The current study, however, considers a real-world reading task in which the participants have to actively sample a passage to answer a question that cannot be answered by simple word-level orthographic or semantic matching. In this challenging task, it is demonstrated that human attention distribution can be explained by the attention weights in transformer-based DNN models that are optimized to perform the same reading task but blind to the human eye-tracking data. Furthermore, when participants scan a passage without knowing the question to answer, their attention distribution can also be explained by transformer-based DNN models that are optimized to predict a word based on the context.</p><p>Furthermore, we demonstrate that both humans and transformer-based DNN models achieve task-optimal attention distribution in multiple steps: For humans, basic text features strongly modulate the duration of the first reading of a word, while the question relevance of a word only modulates how many times the word is reread, especially for high-proficiency L2 readers compared to native readers. Similarly, the DNN models do not yield a single attention distribution, and instead they generate multiple attention distributions, that is, heads, for each layer. Here, we demonstrate that basic text features mainly modulate the attention weights in shallow layers, while the question relevance of a word modulates the attention weights in deep layers, reflecting hierarchical control of attention to optimize task performance. The attention weights in both the shallow and deep layers of DNN contribute to the explanation of human word reading time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Computational models of attention</title><p>A large number of computational models of attention have been proposed. According to Marr’s three levels of analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Marr, 1982</xref>), some models investigate the computational goal of attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dayan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Legge et al., 2002</xref>) and some models provide an algorithmic implementation of how different factors modulate attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reichle et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Itti et al., 1998</xref>). Computationally, it has been hypothesized that attention can be interpreted as a mechanism to optimize learning and decision-making, and empirical evidence has been provided that the brain allocates attention among different information sources to optimally reduce the uncertainty of a decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dayan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gottlieb et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Legge et al., 2002</xref>). The current study provides critical support to this hypothesis in a real-world task that engages multiple forms of attention, for example, attention to visual layout features, attention to word features, and attention to question-relevant information. These different forms of attention, which separately modulate different eye-tracking measures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), jointly achieve an attention distribution that is optimal for question answering.</p><p>The transformer-based DNN models analyzed here are optimized in two steps, that is, pre-training and fine-tuning. The results show that pre-training leads to text-based attention that can well explain general-purpose reading in Experiment 4, while the fine-tuning process leads to goal-directed attention in Experiments 1–3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>). Pre-training is also achieved through task optimization, and the pre-training task used in all the three models analyzed here is to predict a word based on the context. The purpose of the word prediction task is to let models learn the general statistical regularity in a language based on large corpora, which is crucial for model performance on downstream tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Devlin et al., 2019</xref>), and this process can naturally introduce the sensitivity to word surprisal, that is, how unpredictable a word is given the context. Previous eye-tracking studies have suggested that the predictability of words, that is, surprisal, can modulate reading time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hale, 2016</xref>), and neuroscientific studies have also indicated that the cortical responses to language converge with the representations in pre-trained DNN models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goldstein et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schrimpf et al., 2021</xref>). The results here further demonstrate that the DNN optimized for the word prediction task can evolve attention properties consistent with the human reading process. Additionally, the tokenization process in DNN can also contribute to the similarity between human and DNN attention distributions: DNN first separates words into tokens (e.g., ‘tokenization’ is separated into ‘token’ and ‘ization’). Tokens are units that are learned based on co-occurrence of letters and is not strictly linked to any linguistically defined units. Since longer words tend to be separated into more tokens, that is, fragments of frequently co-occurred letters, longer words receive more attention even if the model pay uniform attention to each of its input, that is, a token.</p><p>A separate class of models investigates which factors shape human attention distribution. A large number of models are proposed to predict bottom-up visual saliency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tatler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Borji et al., 2013</xref>), and recently DNN models are also employed to model top-down visual attention. It is shown that, through either implicit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xu et al., 2015</xref>) or explicit training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Das et al., 2017</xref>), DNNs can predict which parts of a picture relate to a verbal phrase, a task similar to goal-directed visual search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wolfe and Horowitz, 2017</xref>). The current study distinguishes from these studies in that the DNN model is not trained to predict human attention. Instead, the DNN models naturally generate human-like attention distribution when trained to perform the same task that humans perform, suggesting that task optimization is a potential cause for human attention distribution during reading.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Models for human reading and human attention to question-relevant information</title><p>How human readers allocate attention during reading is an extensively studied topic, mostly based on studies that instruct readers to read a sentence in a normal manner, not aimed to extract a specific kind of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clifton et al., 2016</xref>). Previous eye-tracking studies have shown that the readers fixate longer upon, for example, longer words, words of lower-frequency, words that are less predictable based on the context, and words at the beginning of a line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rayner, 1998</xref>). A number of models, for example, the E-Z reader (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reichle et al., 2003</xref>) and SWIFT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Engbert et al., 2005</xref>), have been proposed to predict the eye movements during reading based on basic oculomotor properties or lexical processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reichle et al., 2003</xref>). Some models also view reading as an optimization process that minimizes the time or the number of saccades required to read a sentence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Legge et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu and Reichle, 2010</xref>). These models can generate fine-grained predictions, for example, which letter in a word will be fixated first, for the reading of simple sentences, but have only been occasionally tested for complex sentences or multiline texts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mancheva et al., 2015</xref>) or to characterize different reading tasks, for example, z-string reading and visual searching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Reichle et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>When readers read a passage to answer a question that can be answered using a word-matching strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hermann et al., 2015</xref>), a recent study has demonstrated that the specific reading goal modulates the word reading time and the effect can be modeled using an RNN model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hahn and Keller, 2023</xref>). Here, we focus on questions that cannot be answered using a word-matching strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and demonstrate that, for these challenging questions, attention is still modulated by the reading goal but the attention modulation cannot be explained by a word-matching model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Instead, the attention effect is better captured by transformer models than an advanced RNN model, that is, the SAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Combining the current study and the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hahn and Keller, 2023</xref>, it is possible that the word reading time during a general-purpose reading task can be explained by a word prediction task, the word reading time during a simple goal-directed reading task that can be solved by word matching can be modeled by an RNN model, while the word reading time during a more complex goal-directed reading task involving inference is better modeled using a transformer model. The current study also further demonstrates that elongated reading time on task-relevant words is caused by counts of rereading and further studies are required to establish whether earlier eye movement measures can be modulated by, for example, a word-matching task. In addition, future studies can potentially integrate classic eye movement models with DNNs to explain the dynamic eye movement trajectory, possibly with a letter-based spatial resolution.</p><p>When human readers read a passage with a particular goal or perspective, previous studies have revealed inconsistent results about whether the readers spent more time reading task-relevant sentences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yeari et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grabe, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaakinen et al., 2002</xref>). To explain the inconsistent results, it has been proposed that the question relevance effect weakens for readers with a higher working memory and when readers read a familiar topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaakinen et al., 2003</xref>). Similarly, here, we demonstrate that non-native readers indeed spend more time reading question-relevant information than native readers do (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that when readers are more skilled and when the passage is relatively easy to read, their processing is so efficient so that they do not need extra time to encode task-relevant information and may rely on covert attention to prioritize the processing of task-relevant information.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>DNN attention to question-relevant information</title><p>A number of studies have investigated whether the DNN attention weights are interpretable, but the conclusions are mixed: some studies find that the DNN attention weights are positively correlated with the importance of each word (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lin et al., 2017</xref>), while other studies fail to find such correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Serrano and Smith, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jain and Wallace, 2019</xref>). The inconsistent results are potentially caused by the lack of gold standard to evaluate the contribution of each word to a task. A few recent studies have used the human word reading time as the criterion to quantify word importance, but these studies do not reach consistent conclusions either. Some studies find that the attention weights in the last layer of transformer-based DNN models better correlates with human word reading time than basic word frequency measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bolotova et al., 2020</xref>), and integrating human word reading time into DNN can slightly improve task performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Malmaud et al., 2020</xref>). Other studies, however, find no meaningful correlation between the attention weights in transformer-based DNNs and human word reading time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sood et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The current results provide a potential explanation for the discrepancy in the literature: The last layer of transformer-based DNNs is tuned to task relevant information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), but the influence of task relevance on word reading time is rather weak for native readers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Consequently, the correlation between the last-layer DNN attention weights and human reading time may not be robust. The current results demonstrate that the reading time of both native and non-native readers are reliably modulated by basic text features, which can be modeled by the attention weights in shallower DNN layers.</p><p>Finally, the current study demonstrates that transformer-based DNN models can automatically generate human-like attention in the absence of any prior knowledge about the properties of the human reading process. Simpler models that fail to explain human performance also fail to predict human attention distribution. It remains possible, however, different models can solve the same computational problem using distinct algorithms, and only some algorithms generate human-like attention distribution. In other words, human-like attention distribution may not be a unique solution to optimize the goal-directed reading task. Sharing similar attention distribution with humans, however, provides a way to interpret the attention weights in computational models. From this perspective, the dataset and methods developed here provide an effective probe to test the biological plausibility of NLP models that can be easily applied to test whether a model evolves human-like attention distribution.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Totally, 162 participants took part in this study (19–30 years old, mean age, 22.5 years; 84 females).

The attention weight between CLS and the <italic>n</italic>th word in the passage, that is, <italic>α<sub>Pn</sub></italic>, was compared to human attention. Here, we only considered the attention weights associated with the correct option. Additionally, DNNs used byte-pair tokenization which split some words into multiple tokens. We converted the token-level attention weights to word-level attention weights by summing the attention weights over tokens within a word (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bolotova et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clark et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Eye-tracking measures</title><p>We analyzed eye movements during passage reading in Experiments 1–3, and the passage preview in Experiment 4. For each word, the total fixation time, gaze duration, and run counts was extracted using the SR Research Data Viewer software. The total fixation time of a word is referred to as the word reading time. The gaze duration was how long a word was fixated before the gaze moved to other words, reflected first-pass processing of a word. To characterize late processing of a word, we further calculated the counts of rereading, which were defined as the run counts minus 1. Words that were not reread were excluded from the analysis of counts of rereading. Each of the eye-tracking measure was averaged across all participants who correctly answered the question.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Regression models</title><p>We employed linear regression to analyze how well each model, as well as each set of text/task-related features, could explain human attention measured by eye tracking. In all regression analyses, each regressor and the eye-tracking measure were normalized within each passage by taking the z-score. The predictive power, that is, the Pearson correlation coefficient between the predicted eye-tracking measure and the actual eye-tracking measure, was calculated based on fivefold cross-validation.</p><p>For the SAR, each word had one attention weight, which was used as the regressor. For transformer-based models, since each model contained 12 layers and each layer contained 12 attention heads, altogether there were 144 regressors. Text features included layout features and word features. The layout features concerned the visual position of text, including the coordinate of the leftmost pixel of a word, ordinal paragraph number of a word in a passage, ordinal line number of a word in a paragraph, and ordinal line number of a word in a passage. The word features included word length, logarithmic word frequency estimated based on the BookCorpus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>) and English Wikipedia using SRILM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stolcke, 2002</xref>), and word surprisal estimated from GPT-2 Medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Radford et al., 2018</xref>). The task-related feature referred to the question relevance annotated by another group of participants (see ‘Experimental materials’ for details).</p><p>Additionally, we also applied linear regression to probe how DNN attention was affected by text features and question relevance. Since information of lines and paragraphs was not available to DNNs, the layout features only included the ordinal position of a word in a sentence, ordinal position of a word in a passage, and ordinal sentence number of a word in this analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Linear mixed effect model</title><p>To characterize the influences of different factors on human word reading time, we employed linear mixed effects models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pinheiro and Bates, 2006</xref>) implemented in the lmerTest package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kuznetsova et al., 2017</xref>) of R. For the baseline model, we treated the type of questions (local vs. global; local = baseline) and all text/task-related features as fixed factors, and considered the interaction between the type of questions and these text/task-related features. We included participants and items (i.e., questions) as random factors, each with associated random intercepts. The formulation of the baseline model was <italic>reading-time</italic> ~ <italic>ParagraphNumber</italic> * <italic>QuestionType + LineNumberInPassage</italic> * <italic>QuestionType + LeftMostPixel</italic> * <italic>QuestionType + LineNumberInParagraph</italic> * <italic>QuestionType + LogWordFreq</italic> * <italic>QuestionType + WordLength</italic> * <italic>QuestionType + Surprisal</italic> * <italic>QuestionType + QuestionRelevance</italic> * <italic>QuestionType</italic> + (1 | <italic>Participant</italic>) + (1 | <italic>question</italic>). Additionally, starting from the baseline model, we augmented the baseline model by adding DNN attention as additional fixed factors. This augmentation facilitated an examination of whether DNN attention demonstrated a statistically significant contribution to the prediction of human word reading time. Notably, the DNN attention was derived from diverse sources, including SAR, randomized BERT, pre-trained BERT, and fine-tuned BERT.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical tests</title><p>In the regression analysis, we employed a one-sided permutation test to test whether a set of features could statistically significantly predict an eye- tracking measure. A total of 500 chance-level predictive power was calculated by predicting the eye-tracking measure shuffled across all words within a passage: the eye-tracking measure to predict was shuffled but the features were not. The procedure was repeated 500 times, creating 500 chance-level predictive power. If the actual correlation was smaller than <italic>N</italic> out of the 500 chance-level correlation, the significance level was (N + 1)/501.</p><p>When comparing the responses to local and global questions, the three types of local/global questions were pooled. The comparison between local and global questions, as well as the comparison between experiments, was based on bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Efron and Tibshirani, 1994</xref>). For example, to test whether the predictive power differed between the two types of questions, all global questions were resampled with replacement 50,000 times and each time the predictive power was calculated based on the resampled questions, resulting in 50,000 resampled predictive power. If the predictive power for local questions was greater (or smaller) than <italic>N</italic> out of the 50,000 resampled predictive power for global questions, the significance level of their difference was 2(N + 1)/50,001. When multiple comparisons were performed, the p-value was further adjusted using the FDR correction.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Supervision, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: The experimental procedures were approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the College of Medicine, Zhejiang University (2019-047).

Generalization across neural network models seems, to me, somewhat limited: The transformerbased models differ from baseline models in numerous ways (model size, training data, scoring algorithm); it is thus not clear what properties of these models necessarily supports their fit to human reading patterns.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the insightful comment. To dissociate the effect of model architecture and the effect of training data, we have now compared the attention weights across three transformer-based models that have the same architecture but different training data/task: randomized (with all model parameters being randomized), pretrained, and fine-tuned models. Remarkably, even without training on any data, the attention weights in randomly initialized models exhibited significant similarity to human attention patterns (Figure. 3A). The predictive power of randomly initialized transformer-based models outperformed that of the SAR model. Through subsequent pre-training and fine-tuning, the predictive capacity of the models was further elevated. Therefore, both model architecture and the training data/task contribute to human-like attention distribution in the transformer models. We have now reported this result:</p><p>“The attention weights of randomly initialized transformer-based models could predict the human word reading time and the predictive power, which was around 0.3, was significantly higher than the chance level and the SAR (Fig. 3A, Table S1). The attention weights of pre-trained transformerbased models could also predict the human word reading time, and the predictive power was around 0.5, significantly higher than the predictive power of heuristic models, the SAR, and randomly initialized transformer-based models (Fig. 3A, Table S1). The predictive power was further boosted for local but not global questions when the models were fine-tuned to perform the goal-directed reading task (Fig. 3A, Table S1).”</p><p>In addition, we reported how training influenced the sensitivity of attention weights to text features and question relevance. As shown in Figure 4AB, attention in the randomized models were sensitive to text features across all layers. After pretraining, the models exhibited increased sensitivity to text features in the shallow layers, and decreased sensitivity to text features in deep layers. Subsequent finetuning on the reading comprehension task further attenuates the encoding of text features in deep layers but strengthens the sensitivity to task-relevant information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Inferential statistics are based on a series of linear regressions, but these differ markedly in model size (BERT models involve 144 attention-based regressor, while the RNN-based model uses just 1 attention-based regressor). How are improvements in model fit balanced against changes in model size?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this issue. The performance of linear regressions was evaluated based on 5-fold cross-validation, and the performance we reported was the performance on the test set. To match the number of parameters, we have now predicted human attention using the average of all heads. The predictive power of the average head was still significantly higher than the predictive power of the SAR model. We have now reported this result in our revised manuscript:</p><p>“For the fine-tuned models, we also predict the human word reading time using an unweighted averaged of the 144 attention heads and the predictive power was 0.3, significantly higher than that achieved by the attention weights of SAR (P = 4 × 10-5, bootstrap).”</p><p>Also, it was not clear to me how participant-level variance was accounted for in the modeling effort (mixed-effects regression?) These questions may well be easily remedied by more complete reporting.</p><p>In the previous manuscript, the word reading time was averaged across participants, and we did not consider the variance between participants. We have now analyzed eye movements of each participant and used the linear mixed effects model to test how different factors affected human word reading time to account for participantslevel and item-level variances.</p><p>“Furthermore, a linear mixed effect model also revealed that more than 85% of the DNN attention heads contribute to the prediction of human reading time when considering text features and question relevance as covariates (Supplementary Results).”</p><p>“Supplementary MethodsTo characterize the influences of different factors on human word reading time, we employed linear mixed effects models [5] implemented in the lmerTest package [6] of R. For the baseline model, we treated the type of questions (local vs. global; local = baseline) and all text/task-related features as fixed factors, and considered the interaction between the type of questions and these text/taskrelated features. We included participants and items (i.e., questions) as random factors, each with associated random intercepts…”</p><p>Supplementary ResultsThe baseline mixed model revealed significant fixed effects for question type and all text/task-related features, as well as significant interactions between question type and these text/task-related features (Table S7). Upon involving SAR attention, we observed a statistically significant fixed effect associated with SAR attention. When involving attention weights of randomly initialized BERT, the mixed model revealed that most attention heads exhibited significant fixed effects, suggesting their contributions to the prediction of human word reading time. A broader range of attention heads showed significant fixed effects for both pre-trained and fine-tuned BERT.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Experiment 1 was paired with a relatively comprehensive discussion of how attention weights mapped to reading times, but the same sort of analysis was not reported for Exps 2-4; this seems like a missed opportunity given the broader interest in testing how reading strategies might change across the different parameters of the four experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the valuable suggestion. We have now also characterized how different reading measures, e.g., gaze duration and counts or rereading, were affected by text and task-related features in Experiments 2-4.</p><p>For Experiment 2:“For local questions, consistent with Experiment 1, the effects of question relevance significantly increased from early to late processing stages that are separately indexed by gaze duration and counts of rereading (Fig. S9A, Table S3).”</p><p>For Experiment 3:“For local questions, the layout effect was more salient for gaze duration than for counts of rereading. In contrast, the effect of word-related features and task relevance was more salient for counts of rereading than gaze duration (Fig. S9B, Table S3).”</p><p>For Experiment 4:“Both the early and late processing stages of human reading were significantly affected by layout and word features, and the effects were larger for the late processing stage indexed by counts of rereading (Fig. S9C, Table S3).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Comparison of predictive power of BERT weights to human annotations of text relevance is limited: The annotation task asked participants to chose the 5 &quot;most relevant&quot; words for a given question; if &gt;5 words carried utility in answering a question, this would not be captured by the annotation. It seems to me that the improvement of BERT over human annotations discussed around page 10-11 could well be due to this arbitrary limitation of the annotations.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the insightful comment. We only allowed a participant to label 5 words since we wanted the participant to only label the most important information. As the reviewer pointed out, five words may not be enough. However, this problem is alleviated by having &gt;26 annotators per question. Although each participant can label up to 5 words, pooling the results across &gt;26 annotators results in nonzero relevance rating for an average 21.1 words for local questions and 26.1 words for global question. More important, as was outlined in Experimental Materials, we asked additional participants to answer questions based on only 5 annotated keywords. The accuracy for question answering were 75.9% for global questions and 67.6% for local questions, which was close to the accuracy achieved when the complete passage was present (Fig. 1B), suggesting that even 5 keywords could support question answering.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

The manuscript was well written and enjoyable to read. However, I do have some concerns.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the accurate summary and positive evaluation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In the first paragraph of the manuscript, it appears that the purpose of the study was to test the optimization hypothesis in natural tasks. However, the cited papers mainly focus on covert visual attention, while the present study primarily focuses on overt attention (eye movements). It is crucial to clearly distinguish between these two types of attention and state that the study mainly focuses on overt attention at the beginning of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this issue. We have explicitly mentioned that we focus on overt attention in the current study. Furthermore, we have also discussed that native readers may rely more on covert attention so that they do not need to spend more time overtly fixating at the task relevant words.</p><p>In Introduction:</p><p>“Reading is one of the most common and most sophisticated human behaviors [16, 17], and it is strongly regulated by attention: Since readers can only recognize a couple of words within one fixation, they have to overtly shift their fixation to read a line of text [3]. Thus, eye movements serve as an overt expression of attention allocation during reading [3, 18].”</p><p>In Discussion:</p><p>“Therefore, it is possible that when readers are more skilled and when the passage is relatively easy to read, their processing is so efficient so that they do not need extra time to encode task-relevant information and may rely on covert attention to prioritize the processing of task-relevant information.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The manuscript correctly describes attention in DNN as a mechanism to selectively extract useful information. However, eye-movement measures such as gaze duration and total reading time are primarily influenced by the time needed to process words. Therefore, there is a doubt whether the argument stating that attention in DNN is conceptually similar to the human attention mechanism at the computational level is correct. It is strongly suggested that the authors thoroughly discuss whether these concepts describe the same or different things.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing up this very important issue and we have added discussions about why human and DNN may generate similar attention distributions. For example, we found that both DNN and human attention distributions are modulated by task relevance and word properties, which include word length, word frequency, and word surprisal. The influence of task relevance is relatively straightforward since both human readers and DNN should rely more on task relevant words to answer questions. The influence of word properties is less apparent for models than for human readers and we have added discussions:</p><p>For DNN’s sensitivity to word surprisal:</p><p>“The transformer-based DNN models analyzed here are optimized in two steps, i.e., pre-training and fine-tuning. The results show that pre-training leads to text-based attention that can well explain general-purpose reading in Experiment 4, while the fine-tuning process leads to goal-directed attention in Experiments 1-3 (Fig. 4B &amp; Fig. 5A). Pre-training is also achieved through task optimization, and the pre-training task used in all the three models analyzed here is to predict a word based on the context. The purpose of the word prediction task is to let models learn the general statistical regularity in a language based on large corpora, which is crucial for model performance on downstream tasks [21, 22, 33], and this process can naturally introduce the sensitivity to word surprisal, i.e., how unpredictable a word is given the context.”</p><p>For DNN’s sensitivity to word length:</p><p>“Additionally, the tokenization process in DNN can also contribute to the similarity between human and DNN attention distributions: DNN first separates words into tokens (e.g., “tokenization” is separated into “token” and “ization”). Tokens are units that are learned based on co-occurrence of letters, and is not strictly linked to any linguistically defined units. Since longer words tend to be separated into more tokens, i.e., fragments of frequently co-occurred letters, longer words receive more attention even if the model pay uniform attention to each of its input, i.e., a token.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. When reporting how reading time was predicted by attention weights, the authors used &quot;prediction accuracy.&quot; While this measure is useful for comparing different models, it is less informative for readers to understand the quality of the prediction. It would be more helpful if the results of regression models were also reported.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for the confusion. The prediction accuracy was defined as the correlation coefficient between the predicted and actual eye-tracking measures. We have now realized that the term “prediction accuracy” might have caused confusion. Therefore, in the revised manuscript, we have replaced this term with “predictive power”. Additionally, we have now introduced a clear definition of “prediction power” at its first mention in Result:</p><p>“…the predictive power, i.e., the Pearson correlation coefficient between the predicted and real word reading time, was around 0.2”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The motivations of Experiments 2 and 3 could be better described. In their current form, it is challenging to understand how these experiments contribute to understanding the major research question of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this issue. In Experiments 1, different types of questions were presented in separate blocks, and all the participants were L2 reader. Therefore, we conducted Experiments 2 and 3 to examine how reading behaviors were modulated when different types of questions were presented in a mixed manner, or when participants were L1 readers. We have now clarified the motivations:</p><p>“In Experiment 1, different types of questions were presented in blocks which encouraged the participants to develop question-type-specific reading strategies. Next, we ran Experiment 2, in which questions from different types were mixed and presented in a randomized order, to test whether the participants developed question-type-specific strategies in Experiment 1.”</p><p>“Experiments 1 and 2 recruited L2 readers.

The paper aims to show that human gaze is predicted the the DNN-derived task-optimal attention distribution, but the paper does not actually derive a task-optimal attention distribution. Rather, the DNNs are used to extract 144 different attention distributions, which are then put into a regression with coefficients fitted to predict human attention. As a consequence, the model has 144 free parameters without apparent a-priori constraint or theoretical interpretation. In this sense, there is a slight mismatch between what the modeling aims to establish and what it actually does.</p><p>Regarding Weakness (1): This weakness should be made explicit, at least by rephrasing line 90. The authors could also evaluate whether there is either a specific attention head, or one specific linear combination (e.g. a simple average of all heads) that predicts the human data well.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this issue. One the one hand, we have now also predicted human attention using the average of all heads, i.e., the simple average suggested by the reviewer. The predictive power of the average head was still significantly higher than the predictive power of the SAR model. We have now reported this result in our revised manuscript.</p><p>“For the fine-tuned models, we also predict the human word reading time using an unweighted averaged of the 144 attention heads and the predictive power was 0.3, significantly higher than that achieved by the attention weights of SAR (P = 4 × 10-5, bootstrap).”</p><p>On the other hand, since different attention weights may contribute differently to the prediction of human reading time, we have now also reported the weights assigned to individual attention head during the original regression analysis (Fig. S4).

Here, we demonstrate that basic text features mainly modulate the attention weights in shallow layers, while the question relevance of a word modulates the attention weights in deep layers, reflecting hierarchical control of attention to optimize task performance. The attention weights in both the shallow and deep layers of DNN contribute to the explanation of human word reading time (Fig. S4).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. While Experiment 1 tests questions from different types in blocks, and the paper mentions that this might encourage the development of question-type-specific reading strategies -- indeed, this specifically motivates Experiment 2, and is confirmed indirectly in the comparison of the effects found in the two experiments (&quot;all these results indicated that the readers developed question-typespecific strategies in Experiment 1&quot;) -- the paper seems to miss the opportunity to also test whether DNNs fine-tuned for each of the question-types predict specifically the reading times on the respective question types in Experiment 1. Testing not only whether DNN-derived features can differentially predict normal reading vs targeted reading, but also different targeted reading tasks, would be a strong test of the approach.</p><p>Regarding Weakness (2): results after finetuning for each question type could be reported.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the valuable suggestion.

Specifically, for BERT, the loss decreased from 1.08 to 0.96; for ALBERT, it decreased from 1.16 to 0.76; for RoBERTa, it went down from 0.68 to 0.54. Nevertheless, the fine-tuning process did not improve the prediction of reading time (Author response image 1). A likely reason is that the number of global and local questions for training is limited (local questions: 520; global questions: 280), and similar questions also exist in RACE dataset that is used for the original fine tuning (sample size: 87,866). Therefore, a small number of questions can significantly change the reading strategy of human readers but using these questions to effectively fine-tune a model seems to be a more challenging task.</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Fine-tuning based on local and global questions does not significantly modulate the prediction of human reading time.</title><p>Lighter-color symbols show the results for the 3 BERT-family models (i.e., BERT, ALBERT, and RoBERTa) and the darker-color symbols show the average over the 3 BERT-family models. trans_fine: model fine-tuned based on the RACE dataset; trans_local: models additionally fine-tuned using local questions; trans_global: models additionally fine-tuned using global questions.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87197-sa4-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The paper compares the DNN-derived features to word-related features such as frequency and surprisal and reports that the DNN features are predictive even when the others are regressed out (Figure S3). However, these features are operationalized in a way that puts them at an unfair disadvantage when compared to the DNNs: word frequency is estimated from the BNC corpus; surprisal is derived from the same corpus and derived using a trigram model. The BNC corpus contains 100 Million words, whereas BERT was trained on several Billions of words. Relatedly, trigram models are now far surpassed by DNN-based language models. Specifically, it is known that such models do not fit human eyetracking reading times as well as modern DNN-based models (e.g., Figure 2 Dundee in: Wilcox et al, On the Predictive Power of Neural Language Models for Human Real-Time Comprehension Behavior, CogSci 2020). This means that the predictive power of the word-related features is likely to be underestimated and that some residual predictive power is contained in the DNNs, which may implicitly compute quantities related to frequency and surprisal, but were trained on more data. In order to establish that the DNN models are predictive over and above word-related features, and to reliably quantify the predictive power gained by this, the authors could draw on (1) frequency estimated from the corpora used for BERT (BookCorpus + Wikipedia), (2) either train a strong DNN language model, or simply estimate surprisal from a strong off-the-shelf model such as GPT-2.</p><p>This concern does not fundamentally cast doubt on the conclusions, since the authors found a clear effect of the task relevance of individual words, which by definition is not contained in those baseline models. However, Figure S3 -- specifically Figure S3C -- is likely to inflate the contribution of the DNN model over and above the text-based features.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out these issues. Following the valuable suggestion of the reviewer, we have now (1) computed word frequencies based on BookCorpus and Wikipedia and (2) calculated word surprisal using GPT-2.</p><p>“The word features included word length, logarithmic word frequency estimated based on the BookCorpus [62] and English Wikipedia using SRILM [68], and word surprisal estimated from GPT-2 Medium [69].”</p><p>These recalculated word frequency and surprisal are correlated with the original measures (word frequency: 0.98; surprisal: 0.59), and the updated results are also closely aligned with those reported in the previous manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Others:</p><p>1. How does the statistical modeling take into account that measures are repeated both within the items (same texts read by different subjects) and within the subjects (some subject read multiple texts)? I only see the items-level repetition be addressed in line 715-721 in comparing between local and global questions, but not elsewhere. The standard approach in the literature on human reading times (e.g. the Wilcox et al paper mentioned above, or ref. 44) is to use mixed-effects regression with appropriate random effects for items and subjects. The same question applies to the calculation of chance accuracy (line 702-709), which is done by shuffling words within a passage. Relatedly, how exactly was cross-validation (line 681) calculated? On the level of subjects, individual words, trials, texts, ...?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising up this issue. In the previous manuscript, the word reading time was averaged across participants. The cross-validation was conducted on the level of texts (i.e., passages). Following the valuable suggestion, we have now separately analyzed each participant and applied the linear mixed effects models.</p><p>“Furthermore, a linear mixed effect model also revealed that more than 85% of the DNN attention heads contribute to the prediction of human reading time when considering text features and question relevance as covariates (Supplementary Results).”</p><p>“Supplementary MethodsTo characterize the influences of different factors on human word reading time, we employed linear mixed effects models [5] implemented in the lmerTest package [6] of R. For the baseline model, we treated the type of questions (local vs. global; local = baseline) and all text/task-related features as fixed factors, and considered the interaction between the type of questions and these text/taskrelated features. We included participants and items (i.e., questions) as random factors, each with associated random intercepts…”</p><p>Supplementary ResultsThe baseline mixed model revealed significant fixed effects for question type and all text/task-related features, as well as significant interactions between question type and these text/task-related features (Table S7). Upon involving SAR attention, we observed a statistically significant fixed effect associated with SAR attention. When involving attention weights of randomly initialized BERT, the mixed model revealed that most attention heads exhibited significant fixed effects, suggesting their contributions to the prediction of human word reading time. A broader range of attention heads showed significant fixed effects for both pre-trained and fine-tuned BERT.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

The theoretical claim, and some basic features of the research, are quite similar to other recent work (Hahn and Keller, Modeling task effects in human reading with neural network-based attention, Cognition, 2023; cited with very little discussion as ref 44), which also considered task-directed reading in a question-answering task and derived task-optimized attention distributions. There are various differences, and the paper under consideration has both weaknesses and strengths when compared to that existing work -- e.g., that paper derived a single attention distribution from task optimization, but the paper under consideration provides more detailed qualitative analysis of the task effects, uses questions requiring more high-level reasoning, and uses more state-of-the-art DNNs.</p><p>Thanks for bringing up this issue. We have now incorporated a more comprehensive discussion that compare the current study with the recent work conducted by Hahn and Keller:</p></disp-quote><p>“When readers read a passage to answer a question that can be answered using a word-matching strategy [45], a recent study has demonstrated that the specific reading goal modulates the word reading time and the effect can be modeled using a RNN model [46]. Here, we focus on questions that cannot be answered using a word-matching strategy (Fig. 1B) and demonstrate that, for these challenging questions, attention is still modulated by the reading goal but the attention modulation cannot be explained by a word-matching model (Fig. S3). Instead, the attention effect is better captured by transformer models than an advanced RNN model, i.e., the SAR (Fig. 3A). Combining the current study and the study by Hahn et al. [46], it is possible that the word reading time during a general-purpose reading task can be explained by a word prediction task, the word reading time during a simple goal-directed reading task that can be solved by word matching can be modeled by a RNN model, while the word reading time during a more complex goal-directed reading task involving inference is better modeled using a transformer model. The current study also further demonstrates that elongated reading time on task-relevant words is caused by counts of rereading and further studies are required to establish whether earlier eye movement measures can be modulated by, e.g., a word matching task.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.
