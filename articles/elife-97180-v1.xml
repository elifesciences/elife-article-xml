Recent studies have reported the successful conversion of astrocytes into DANs by repressing polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 (PTBP1), which led to the rescue of motor symptoms in a chemically-induced mouse model of PD. However, follow-up studies have questioned the validity of this astrocyte-to-DAN conversion model. Here, we devised an adenine base editing strategy to downregulate PTBP1 in astrocytes and neurons in a chemically-induced PD mouse model. While PTBP1 downregulation in astrocytes had no effect, PTBP1 downregulation in neurons of the striatum resulted in the expression of the DAN marker tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in non-dividing neurons, which was associated with an increase in striatal dopamine concentrations and a rescue of forelimb akinesia and spontaneous rotations. Phenotypic analysis using multiplexed iterative immunofluorescence imaging further revealed that most of these TH-positive cells co-expressed the dopaminergic marker DAT and the pan-neuronal marker NEUN, with the majority of these triple-positive cells being classified as mature GABAergic neurons. Additional research is needed to fully elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the expression of the observed markers and understand how the formation of these cells contributes to the rescue of spontaneous motor behaviors. Nevertheless, our findings support a model where downregulation of neuronal, but not astrocytic, PTBP1 can mitigate symptoms in PD mice.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>base editing</kwd><kwd>gene therapy</kwd><kwd>CRISPR-cas</kwd><kwd>parkinson's disease</kwd><kwd>Ptbp1</kwd><kwd>6-OHDA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030_185293</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schwank</surname><given-names>Gerald</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100013850</institution-id><institution>Helmut Horten Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schwank</surname><given-names>Gerald</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030_196455</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Patriarchi</surname><given-names>Tommaso</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004784</institution-id><institution>Novartis Foundation for Medical-Biological Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FN20-0000000203</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Böck</surname><given-names>Desiree</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>196287</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Böck</surname><given-names>Desiree</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>891959</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Patriarchi</surname><given-names>Tommaso</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>URPP Itinerare</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Böck</surname><given-names>Desiree</given-names></name><name><surname>Schwank</surname><given-names>Gerald</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Downregulation of PTBP1 in neurons, but not astrocytes, alleviates motor symptoms in a Parkinson’s disease mouse model by inducing dopaminergic marker expression in striatal neurons and increasing striatal dopamine levels.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>PD is a complex and multifactorial disorder, characterized by the progressive and irreversible loss of DANs in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), which leads to the disruption of the nigrostriatal pathway and depletion of striatal dopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bloem et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gitler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Moore et al., 2005</xref>). The cause of PD is unknown and only a handful of genetic and environmental risk factors have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brown et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Lau and Breteler, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Elbaz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kalia and Lang, 2015</xref>), making the development of a curative therapy challenging. In fact, current treatment strategies do not focus on slowing down or halting disease progression, but rather aim to control symptoms and maintain the patients’ quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Stoker and Barker, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Recently emerging <italic>in vivo</italic> transdifferentiation approaches, which leverage the plasticity of specific somatic cell types, hold great promise for developing therapies targeting a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases, including PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cohen and Melton, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Torper and Götz, 2017</xref>). Astrocytes are of particular interest for such cell fate-switching approaches. First, they are non-neuronal cells and thus not affected by neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yu et al., 2020</xref>). Second, they can acquire certain characteristics of neural stem cells, including multipotency, when activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Niu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buffo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Robel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shimada et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sirko et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, they are highly proliferative in brain injuries such as neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yu et al., 2021</xref>). Several <italic>in vivo</italic> studies have reported successful reprogramming of astrocytes to neurons via overexpression of proneuronal lineage-specific transcription factors, such as NEUROD1 or SOX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Guo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Niu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Niu et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, two recent studies have shown that repression of the RNA-binding protein PTBP1, which mainly functions as a splicing regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Valcárcel and Gebauer, 1997</xref>), efficiently converts astrocytes into DANs in the SNc or striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Qian et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). Consequently, this led to the restoration of the nigrostriatal pathway and striatal dopamine levels, as well as the rescue of motor deficits in a chemically-induced mouse model of PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Qian et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). However, since the publication of these two studies in 2020, stringent lineage-tracing strategies have revealed that neither quiescent nor reactive astrocytes convert to DANs upon PTBP1 depletion in the SNc or striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hoang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wang et al., 2021</xref>), fueling widespread debate about the origin of these <italic>de novo</italic> generated cells and their ability to alleviate motor deficits in PD mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arenas, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jiang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Qian et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we employed adenine base editors (ABEs), which enable gene editing independent of DNA double-strand break formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gaudelli et al., 2017</xref>) and thus without the risk of inducing chromosomal rearrangements, translocations, or large deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adikusuma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kosicki et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shin et al., 2017</xref>), to install a loss-of-function splice mutation in the <italic>Ptbp1</italic> gene in astrocytes or neurons. Using a chemically-induced PD mouse model, we show that downregulation of neuronal rather than astroglial PTBP1 in the SNc and striatum improves forelimb akinesia and spontaneous rotations. Histological analysis revealed that downregulation of neuronal PTBP1 induced expression of TH, which is the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of dopamine and other catecholamines and thus a characteristic marker of DANs, in non-dividing neurons of the striatum. Since lack or dysfunction of TH results in dopamine deficiency and parkinsonism, induction of TH expression in striatal neurons may explain the observed rescue of PD phenotypes in mice and provide therapeutic benefits for PD patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Adenine base editing effectively downregulates PTBP1 in cell lines</title><p>Base editors (BEs) are CRISPR-Cas derived genome engineering tools that allow the precise conversion of A-T to G-C (adenine BEs, ABEs) or C-G to T-A (cytidine BEs, CBEs) base pairs in cell lines as well as post-mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gaudelli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Koblan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Komor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Levy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Villiger et al., 2018</xref>). BEs can thus be applied to precisely disrupt canonical splice sites and permanently eliminate gene function <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kluesner et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Musunuru et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rothgangl et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Winter et al., 2019</xref>). To achieve effective and permanent repression of PTBP1, we sought to utilize ABEs to mutate canonical splice sites. To assess if adenine base editing can be used to effectively disrupt PTBP1 expression, we designed seven sgRNAs targeting canonical <italic>Ptbp1</italic> splice donor or acceptor sites in murine Hepa1-6 cells (hereafter referred to as Hepa; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Plasmids expressing the sgRNAs were co-delivered with <italic>Sp</italic>Cas-, <italic>Sp</italic>G-, or <italic>Sp</italic>Cas-NG-ABE-expressing plasmids into Hepa cells, and genomic DNA was isolated at 5 d post-transfection for analysis by deep sequencing. In line with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kluesner et al., 2021</xref>), base editing activity was higher at splice donor sites, with the highest editing rates at the exon-intron junctions of exon 3 (92.9 ± 1.0% for <italic>Sp</italic>G-ABE8e) and 7 (85.0 ± 7.2% for <italic>Sp</italic>Cas-ABE8e; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Next, we validated whether both sgRNAs resulted in a reduction of transcript and protein levels. Average editing rates of 77% (sgRNA-ex3) and 73% (sgRNA-ex7) on genomic DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) resulted in approximately 70% (p&lt;0.0004) and 50% reduction of <italic>Ptbp1</italic> transcripts (p&lt;0.0064) in Hepa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), leading to a substantial reduction in PTBP1 protein levels and a significant increase in the transcription of exons known to be repressed by PTBP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Han et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; for sgRNA-ex3: <italic>Ptbp2</italic>, p&lt;0.0014; <italic>Ptbp3</italic>, p&lt;0.0051; <italic>Kcnq2</italic>, p&lt;0.0317; for sgRNA-ex7, <italic>Ptbp2</italic>, p&lt;0.0477; <italic>Ptbp3</italic>, p&lt;0.0055; <italic>Kcnq2</italic>, p&lt;0.0160).</p><p>To analyze whether PTBP1 can also be downregulated by adenine base editing in neuronal and astroglial cells, we repeated experiments with sgRNA-ex3 and the ABE8e-<italic>Sp</italic>G variant in the neuronal Neuro2a and astroglial C8-D1A cell lines (hereafter referred to as N2a and C8-D1A). Compared to Hepa cells (92.9 ± 1.0%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), editing rates were lower in both cell lines (N2a: 64 ± 7.9%; C8-D1A: 62.7 ± 15.1%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Nevertheless, we again detected a substantial reduction of <italic>Ptbp1</italic> mRNA (N2a, p&lt;0.0073; C8-D1A, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0275) and PTBP1 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). Notably, editing of the canonical splice donor at exon 3 generated alternative <italic>Ptbp1</italic> splice sites in all three cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), which, however, did not result in functional PTBP1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

To additionally exclude that TH expression might be caused by off-target editing effects, we experimentally determined off-target sites of sgRNA-ex3 using GUIDE-seq in N2a cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tsai et al., 2015</xref>) and subsequently analyzed these sites in treated animals by deep amplicon sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). One off-target site was identified in the myopalladin (<italic>Mypn</italic>) gene, which encodes for a muscle-specific protein and plays a critical role in regulating the structure and growth of skeletal and cardiac muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Filomena et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Filomena et al., 2020</xref>), and another site was detected in the intronic region of the ankyrin-1 (<italic>Ank1</italic>) gene, which encodes for an adaptor protein linking membrane proteins to the underlying cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cunha and Mohler, 2009</xref>).

We manually dissected striata of lesioned and unlesioned hemispheres and quantified tissue dopamine levels by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Peak identities and neurotransmitter concentrations were analyzed using corresponding standards of known concentrations. Importantly, base-edited animals showed an approximately 2.5-fold increase in the concentration of striatal dopamine (AAV-hsyn: 4.4 ± 2.6 nmol/g protein; AAV-ctrl: 1.7 ± 0.7 nmol/g protein; p=0.0159) and the dopamine metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC; AAV-hsyn: 8.2 ± 3.9 nmol/g protein; AAV-ctrl: 3.1 ± 1.8 nmol/g protein; p=0.0449) in the lesioned hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our data suggest that downregulation of PTBP1 in striatal neurons of 6-OHDA-lesioned hemispheres resulted in the expression of TH and an elevation of striatal dopamine concentrations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Phenotypic characterization of TH<sup>+</sup> cells in the striatum</title><p>To characterize the TH-expressing cells in the SNc and striatum of AAV-hsyn-treated mice in more detail, we co-stained them for the pan-neuronal marker NEUN (hexaribonucleotide binding protein-3).

In line with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Qian et al., 2020</xref>), injection of AAV-hsyn into the visual cortex did not lead to TH expression in local neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>; n=174 Cas9/NEUN double-positive cells), suggesting that the local microenvironment indeed plays a contributing role in inducing TH expression in the targeted neurons. To next analyze the origin of TH-expressing cells in the striatum, we first assessed whether these cells originated from dividing neural progenitors or mature, non-dividing neurons. We, therefore, supplied bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-containing drinking water to 6-OHDA-lesioned mice after AAV-hsyn treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>).

The majority of TH<sup>+</sup> cells also expressed the marker DAT (75.2 ± 5.6%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>), further corroborating the DA identity of these cells. Moreover, supporting the results of our BrdU-labeling experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>), only a small fraction of TH/DAT double-positive cells were labeled for markers of neural progenitors (SOX2, 9.1 ± 2.4%; NESTIN, 2.1 ± 0.5%; DCX, 2.6 ± 0.8%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>).

Delivery of dual AAV vectors to the SNc resulted in the formation of TH-expressing cells and the rescue of spontaneous behaviors when a neuronal promoter was used to drive ABE expression. However, no DA projections to the striatum were detected, supporting recent findings that suggest a functional role of PTBP1 in promoting axon regeneration of adult sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alber et al., 2023</xref>). Reconstitution of the nigrostriatal pathway, which connects the SNc with the dorsal striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kalia and Lang, 2015</xref>), is therefore unlikely the mechanism underlying the observed phenotypic rescue. Supporting this hypothesis, the downregulation of neuronal PTBP1 in the striatum of 6-OHDA-lesioned mice also led to the formation of TH<sup>+</sup> cells and a rescue of spontaneous behaviors.</p><p>Two previous studies suggested that PTBP1 downregulation in the SNc, using either shRNA-mediated knockdown or knockdown via CRISPR-CasRx, led to the conversion of astrocytes into functional DANs in 6-OHDA-lesioned mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Qian et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). However, recent lineage tracing studies revealed that neither quiescent nor reactive astrocytes in the SNc or striatum convert to DANs upon PTBP1 downregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hoang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Instead, these studies hypothesize that the reported effects might be attributed to leaky activation of the GFAP promoter in neurons, which could have been misinterpreted as astrocyte-to-neuron conversion. Our study contributes to this recently growing body of evidence, indicating that downregulation of astroglial PTBP1 does not induce astrocyte conversion into DANs, and that neurons are the origin of the observed TH<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yang et al., 2023</xref>). Our 4i and BrdU experiments furthermore revealed that TH expression in the striatum was induced in mature neurons, either expressing markers of GABAergic MSNs or interneurons. These findings indicate that the induction of TH expression is not restricted to a specific neuronal subpopulation, but may rather be attributed to (1) potential bias of hsyn promoter activity towards inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Radhiyanti et al., 2021</xref>), (2) preferential AAV tropism towards distinct neuronal subpopulations in the striatum, or (3) differences in the local microenvironment, chemical signals, and neuronal circuitry required to induce TH expression in distinct neuronal subpopulations.</p><p>While our study suggests that PTBP1 downregulation can enable TH expression in various GABAergic neuronal populations in the striatum, the transcriptional changes leading to and following TH expression in these cells remain unclear. Previous research has demonstrated that the interplay between microRNAs (miRNAs) and the RNA processing proteins PTBP1 and its homology nPTBP (PTBP2) is crucial during neuronal differentiation and maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boutz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Makeyev et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zheng et al., 2012</xref>). Key events in this signaling cascade are the dynamic release of PTBP1-mediated inhibition of miRNA-124, which induces nPTBP expression and activates neuron-specific expression programs in non-neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Makeyev et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Xue et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, the activation of the PTBP1/nPTBP regulatory loops is essential for driving reprogramming toward the neuronal lineage and subsequent neuronal maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Xue et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Xue et al., 2013</xref>). While this classical model of PTBP1 down-regulation and neuronal differentiation implies negligible expression or importance of PTBP1 in mature neurons, our results indicate that PTBP1 is sufficiently expressed and plays a functional role in mature neurons, with the installation of a loss-of-function mutation resulting in a detectable reduction in relative protein amounts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) and behavioral improvements in a PD mouse model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Supporting these findings, a recent study demonstrated PTBP1 expression in axons of sensory and motor neurons as well as a functional role in sensation, injury response, and axonal regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alber et al., 2023</xref>).

Both the input to and output from D1- and D2-MSNs are dynamically controlled by striatal interneurons, which constitute approximately 5% of total striatal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clarke and Adermark, 2015</xref>). Since both MSNs and interneurons receive DA inputs from the SNc, their activity, and excitability are strongly hampered when striatal dopamine is absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bamford et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gerfen and Surmeier, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kreitzer and Malenka, 2008</xref>). It, therefore, seems feasible that PTBP1 downregulation by adenine base editing and subsequent TH expression might have enabled local dopamine synthesis in the dorsal striatum, which may have been sufficient to partly restore the function of these cell populations and compensate for the depletion of DA inputs from the SNc. Supporting this hypothesis, a recent study has shown that depletion of the orphan G-protein coupled receptor 6 (GPR6) in D2-MSNs reduced intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations, leading to increased striatal dopamine and decreased involuntary movements following apomorphine treatment in 6-OHDA-lesioned PD mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sun et al., 2021</xref>). When we quantified dopamine levels in the striatum of AAV-hsyn-treated PD mice using HPLC, we observed a 2.5-fold increase in striatal dopamine, suggesting that induction of TH expression in striatal neurons might establish a basal tone of extracellular dopamine despite the absence of striatal DA projections, akin to pharmacological replenishment in PD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Poewe et al., 2017</xref>). While the increase in dopamine levels was modest compared to 6-OHDA-lesioned rats treated with the dopamine precursor L-DOPA, which exhibited an increase in extracellular dopamine concentrations from ~0.04 fmol/µL to ~9–10 fmol/µL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lindgren et al., 2010</xref>), our results indicate that even a modest increase in striatal dopamine is sufficient to rescue spontaneous motor behaviors in PD mice. This finding aligns with recent work showing that multiple unconditioned DA-dependent motor tasks can be sustained through a diffuse basal tone of extracellular dopamine in the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Delignat-Lavaud et al., 2023</xref>). Conversely, basal dopamine levels were insufficient to improve amphetamine-induced behaviors in AAV-hsyn-treated PD mice in this study, potentially due to the lack of striatal projections from the SNc and/or insufficient availability of intracellular dopamine in striatal neurons. Likewise, the detected dopamine levels in striatal tissues were not sufficient to reverse the hypersensitivity of D1 and D2 receptors to the dopamine agonist apomorphine. Higher base editing rates, achievable using either single AAV delivery of smaller Cas9 orthologues or multiple injections into the rostral, medial, and caudal regions of the striatum, may result in more pronounced global PTBP1 downregulation and potentially higher tissue dopamine concentrations, leading to a broader behavioral rescue. Moreover, further analysis using fiber photometry or microdialysis could provide information on synaptic dopamine release and availability.</p><p>Transcriptional reprogramming is fundamental for neuronal differentiation and maturation, relying on various feedback and feed-forward circuits to regulate cell type-specific gene expression programs. While the loss of PTBP1 is considered crucial for reducing neuronal apoptosis and inducing neuronal differentiation during development, its various roles in mature neurons during adulthood remain largely elusive. Further investigation using single-cell transcriptional analysis or spatial transcriptomics is needed to identify the transcriptional changes driving the expression of DA markers in striatal GABAergic neurons upon PTBP1 downregulation. These experiments may also contribute to our understanding of how PTBP1 downregulation may affect cAMP metabolism, dopamine synthesis, and basal ganglia circuitry in PD mice. Finally, to fully explore the therapeutic potential of PTBP1 base editing, future studies should also combine detailed transcriptional analysis with stringent lineage-tracing technologies and <italic>in vivo</italic> assessment of synaptic dopamine availability and release in more sophisticated PD mouse models that exhibit neuropathological, motor, and cognitive aspects of the disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Generation of plasmids</title><p>sgRNA plasmids were generated by ligating annealed and phosphorylated oligos into a BsmBI-digested lentiGuide-Puro (Addgene #52963) using T4 DNA ligase (NEB).

Sections were left to dry until there was no visible liquid remaining around the edges of the sections. Next, tissue sections were rinsed with PBS (3×5 min), followed by 1 hr incubation in blocking solution (PBS supplemented with 3% donkey serum, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.025% PFA) at RT. Sections were then incubated in primary antibodies (list in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>), diluted in blocking solution, for three nights at 4 °C. Next, sections were washed in PBS (3×5 min), rinsed in blocking solution for 5 min, followed by incubation with secondary antibodies and DAPI (1:1000; stock 1 mg/mL) for 2 hr at RT. All the following steps were performed under low light conditions to reduce possible fluorophore crosslinking. Last, sections were washed in PBS (3×5 min), and imaging buffer (PBS supplemented with N-Acetyl-cysteine at 0.7 M final concentration, pH 7.4) was added at least 5 min prior to imaging to guarantee penetrance of tissue sections. Once the imaging cycle had finished, sections were rinsed three times with dH<sub>2</sub>0 and incubated in equal amounts of dH<sub>2</sub>0 and elution buffer (3×5 min; 0.5 M L-glycine, 3 M urea, 3 M guanidine hydrochloride, 0.07 M TCEP-HCl; pH 2.5). Successful elution of each antibody was visually confirmed using a fluorescence microscope. After elution, tissue sections were washed three times in PBS (5 min) and then another 4i round was started. A total of four imaging cycles were performed.</p><p>All 4i z-stacks (image intervals of 0.5 µm) were collected on an ImageXpress Confocal HT confocal laser-scanning microscope with a 20 x water objective (NA 0.95) using bi-directional scanning. Samples of the same imaging cycle were labeled with the same antibodies and images were collected with identical microscopy settings for laser power, gain, digital offset, pinhole diameter, and z-step. Images from tile scans were exported using MetaXpress and analyzed using Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). DAPI intensity patterns were used to align image tiles from different staining cycles.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title><italic>In vivo</italic> BrdU proliferation assay</title><p>Five days after delivery of the treatment, bromodeoxyuridine was administered to mice at a concentration of 0.8 mg/mL via drinking water. Frozen PFA-fixed brain tissues of BrdU-treated mice were cut into 40 μm-thick sections using a microtome. Sections were washed 2×15 min and 1×5 min in PBS, followed by a 10 min incubation in 1 M HCl on ice, and a 25 min incubation in 2 M HCl at 37 °C. Next, tissues were rinsed in 0.1 M borate buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min on a shaker at RT. After the tissues were rinsed in PBS for 6×10 min, brain tissues were stained as described in the section ‘Immunohistochemistry’.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Neurotransmitter purification and UHPLC-ECD quantifications</title><p>Snap-frozen fresh striata of lesioned or unlesioned hemispheres were used for the purification of neurotransmitters. All materials were kept cold on dry ice during the whole purification procedure and samples were kept under low light conditions on ice. Tissue samples were powderized with two pulses (at maximum intensity) using a CryoPrepTM system (Covaris). Equal amounts of powder were transferred to a pre-cooled 2 mL tube. For homogenization of the tissue powder, a metal ball (Qiagen) and 1 mL homogenization buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, 2 mM EDTA, pH 7.6 supplemented with protease inhibitor tablet) were added to each tube and samples were homogenized for 2×90 s at 20 Hz using a TissueLyser II (Qiagen). Next, samples were centrifuged for 20 min at maximum speed and 4 °C. Lysates were next transferred to fresh pre-cooled tubes and 1 M HCl was added to a final concentration of 10% (v/v). Subsequently, lysates were filtered using an Amicon Ultra 0.5 (Sigma-Aldrich) and a table top centrifuge (30 min at 4 °C and maximum speed). 20 µL of the filtered sample was used for quantification of total protein amounts. Protein concentrations were determined using the ABBOT Alinity C System (Abbot, Abbotpark, Illinois, USA, kit-no. 7P5920). 20 µL of the filtered sample was used in parallel for quantification of neurotransmitter levels by UHPLC-ECD. Brain monoamine neurotransmitter metabolites were analyzed in the filtered lysate using a modified Thermo Fisher UltiMate 3000 High Sensitivity HPLC Electrochemical System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). Injection volume of each sample was 20 µL and separation of the compounds was achieved using a YMC-Hydrosphere UHPLC column (C18 12 nm, S-2.0 µm, 150×30 mm, YMC Inc, Wilmington, NC, USA). As a mobile phase, a 56.7 mM sodium phosphate buffer, containing 5 mM octanesulphonic acid, 50 µM EDTA, 0.28% phosphoric acid (85%), and 23% methanol (pH 2.9–3.1, adjusted with concentrated 10 M NaOH), was used with an isocratic flow rate of 410 µL/min. The column was maintained at 27 °C by a surrounding TCC-3000SD column-thermostat. The analytical cell (Coulometric Cell Model 6011RS, Thermo Fisher Scientific) within the electrochemical detector ECD-3000RS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was adjusted to a 10 mV potential and 100µA gain range for the upstream electrode, plus 400 mV potential, plus 500nA gain range for the downstream electrode with a response time of 1 s. Data was analyzed using the Chromeleon Chromatography Data System (CDS) Software 7.1.9 (Thermo Fisher) and corrected for the protein concentrations of the respective homogenates. All measurements were performed at the clinical chemistry unit of the Kinderspital Zürich.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 10.2.0 for macOS.

There remains no real evidence that these cells actually release dopamine. Since striatal dopamine was assessed by whole-tissue analysis, which is not necessarily reflective of synaptic dopamine availability, it is difficult to assess whether the ~10% increase in TH+ cells in the striatum was sufficient to improve dopamine function. However, the improvement in motor activity suggests that it was.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.97180.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>This study explores the use of an adenine base editing strategy to knock down PTBP1 in astrocytes and neurons of a Parkinson's disease mouse model, as a potential AAV-BE therapy.

This latest study is one of a series that fails to reproduce these observations, but remarkably also reports that neuronal-specific loss of function of Ptbp1 both induces expression of dopaminergic neuronal markers in striatal neurons and rescues motor defects seen in 6-OHDA-treated mice. The claims, if replicated, are remarkable and identify a straightforward and potentially translationally relevant mechanism for treating motor defects seen in PD models. However, while the reported behavioral effects are strong and were collected without sample exclusion, other claims made here are less convincing. In particular, no evidence that Ptbp1 loss of function actually occurs in striatal neurons is provided, and the immunostaining data used to claim that dopaminergic markers are induced in striatal neurons is not convincing. Furthermore, no characterization of the molecular identity of Ptbp1-deficient striatal neurons is provided using single-cell RNA-Seq or spatial transcriptomics, making it difficult to conclude that these cells are indeed adopting a dopaminergic phenotype.</p><p>Overall, while the claims of behavioral rescue of 6-OHDA-treated mice appear compelling, it is essential that these be independently replicated as soon as possible before further studies on this topic are carried out. Insights into the molecular mechanisms by which neuronalspecific loss of function of Ptbp1 induces behavioral rescue are lacking, however. Moreover, the claims of induction of neuronal identity in striatal neurons by Ptbp1 require considerable additional work to be convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the detailed analysis of our study. Please find our answers to the points raised by the reviewer below in blue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Strengths of the study:</p><p>(1) The effect size of the behavioral rescue in the stepping and cylinder tests is strong and significant, essentially restoring 6-OHDA-lesioned mice to control levels.</p><p>(2) Since the neurotoxic effects of 6-OHDA treatment are highly variable, the fact that all behavioral data was collected blinded and that no samples were excluded from analysis increases confidence in the accuracy of the results reported here.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s feedback and acknowledgement of the strengths of our study. We undertook several optimization steps in the surgery, post-operative care, and handling of the animals for behavior experiments to ensure high reproducibility of our experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses of the study:</p><p>(1) Neurons express relatively little Ptbp1. Indeed, cellular expression levels as measured by scRNA-Seq are substantially below those of astrocytes and other non-neuronal cell types, and Ptbp1 immunoreactivity has not been observed in either striatal or midbrain neurons (e.g. Hoang, et al. Nature 2023). This raises the question of whether any recovery of Th expression is indeed mediated by the loss of function of Ptbp1 rather than by off-target effects. AAVmediated rescue of Ptbp1 expression could help clarify this.</p></disp-quote><p>In the original manuscript, we delivered control vectors that only express the ABE to 6-OHDAlesioned mice (labeled as AAV-ctrl) and did not detect TH positive cells in the midbrain or striatum of control mice or rescue of spontaneous motor skills. We can therefore exclude that the delivery procedure, AAV-PHP.eB capsid, or ABE expression caused adverse effects leading to induction of TH expression and functional rescue of spontaneous motor behaviors in PD mice. To further exclude that these effects were caused by off-target editing, we experimentally determined off-target binding sites of our sgRNA (sgRNA-ex3) using GUIDEseq and subsequently analyzed these sites in treated animals by NGS (Figure 3 – supplement 3). While two off-target sites were identified, it is unlikely that base editing at these sites caused the observed phenotypes. One off-target site was identified in the myopalladin (Mypn) gene, which encodes for a muscle-specific protein that plays a role in regulating the structure and growth of skeletal and cardiac muscle (Filomena et al., 2021, 2020). The other site is not located in a coding region, but in an intron of the ankyrin-1 (Ank1) gene, encoding for an adaptor protein linking membrane proteins to the underlying cytoskeleton (Cunha and Mohler, 2009). Even though this gene is also expressed in neurons, base editing within this intronic region did not lead to changes in transcript levels (Figure 3 – supplement 3). Thus, the induction of TH expression upon adenine base editing with sgRNA-ex3 is likely a direct consequence of PTBP1 downregulation.</p><p>Further supporting this conclusion, in the revised manuscript we additionally show PTBP1 downregulation at the RNA and protein level in the SNc and striatum after base editor treatment (Figure 2 – figure supplement 5; figure 3 – supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) It is not clear why dopaminergic neurons, which are not normally found in the striatum, are observed following Ptbp1 knockout. This is very similar to the now-debunked claims made in Zhou, et al. Cell 2020, but here performed using the hSyn rather than GFAP mini promoter to control AAV expression. While this is the most dramatic and potentially translationally relevant claim of the study, this claim is extremely surprising and lacks any clear mechanistic explanation for why it might happen in the first place.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that our study does not provide mechanistic insights into how Ptbp1 downregulation in neurons leads to the induction of dopaminergic markers in the striatum. As we believe that this is not within the scope of a revision, we discuss potential follow-up experiments in the discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This observation is even more surprising in light of reports that antisense oligonucleotidemediated knockdown of Ptbp1, which should have affected both neuronal and glial Ptbp1 expression, failed to induce expression of dopaminergic neuronal markers in the striatum (Chen, et al. eLife 2022). Selective loss of function of Ptbp1 in striatal and midbrain astrocytes likewise results in only modest changes in gene expression.</p></disp-quote><p>Using 6-OHDA lesioned <italic>Aldh1l1-CreERT2;Rpl22lsl-HA</italic> mice, the Chen et al. study (eLife 2022) assessed potential astrocyte to neuron conversion by quantifying the presence of HA-labeled neurons after ASO-mediated knockdown of Ptbp1. Even though they did not detect HApositive neurons in the SNc, suggesting absence of astrocyte to neuron conversion, the images in Figure 4D reveal TH positive cells in the lesioned hemisphere, similar to our observations in Figure 2B-D. While it cannot be excluded that these TH positive cells are remnants from an incomplete 6-OHDA lesion, they could also be endogenous neurons with induced expression of dopaminergic markers after ASO-mediated knockdown of Ptbp1.

Additional analysis revealed that this TH/DAT/NEUN expressing cell population expressed markers of GABAergic neurons, either of medium spiny neurons (~50%) and various types of interneurons (~50%). While our 4i analysis has allowed us to broadly classify these TH-expressing populations, we agree that detailed transcriptional analysis at the single cell level is required to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the generation of TH positive cells.

The authors found that knocking down PTBP1 in neurons, but not astrocytes, and in striatum, but not nigra, results in the phenotypic reorganization of neurons to TH+ cells sufficient to rescue motor phenotypes, though insufficient to normalize responses to dopaminomimetic drugs.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The manuscript is generally well-written and adds to the growing literature challenging previous findings by Qian et al., 2020 and Zhou et al., 2020 indicating that astrocytic downregulation of PTBP1 can induce conversion to dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain and improve parkinsonian symptoms. The base editing approach is interesting and potentially more therapeutically relevant than previous approaches.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The manuscript has several weaknesses in approach and interpretation. In terms of approach, the animal model utilized, the 6-OHDA model, though useful to examine dopaminergic cell loss, exhibits accelerated neurodegeneration and none of the typical pathological hallmarks (synucleinopathy, Lewy bodies, etc.) compared to the typical etiology of Parkinson's disease, limiting its translational interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the detailed assessment of our study and pinpointing its current weaknesses. Please find our answers to all comments below in blue.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the 6-OHDA model lacks the typical pathological hallmarks of PD. Nevertheless, we chose this model for two reasons:</p><p>i) The 6-OHDA model was used by both Qian et al. (2020) and Zhou et al. (2020). To allow comparison of our results to these studies, it was crucial to use the same model. Notably, the 6-OHDA model was also used by Chen et al. (2022) and Hoang et al. (2023) for comparison to the two studies from 2020.</p><p>ii) The 6-OHDA model is straightforward to generate and displays robust motor impairments for evaluation of potential therapeutic effects of neuroregeneration treatment approaches. We therefore believe that the model is well-suited to analyze the cellular and behavioral effects (specifically motor skills) of PTBP1 downregulation.</p><p>In future studies, it would be critical to include models that also display typical pathological hallmarks of the disease to further evaluate the therapeutic effect of this base editing approach. These experiments are, however, not within the scope of this study, which was aimed to focus on the cellular and behavioral effects of PTBP1 downregulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, there is no confirmation of a neuronal or astrocytic knockdown of PTBP1 in vivo; all base editing validation experiments were completed in cell lines.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we assess <italic>in vivo</italic> base editing efficiencies at the <italic>Ptbp1</italic> target site in the SNc (AAV-hsyn, 15.6%) and striatum (AAV-hysn, 21.1%).

Performing these mutations with Cas9 nucleases instead would have had potential limitations and risks, including (i) indel mutations do not always lead to a frameshift and loss-of-function despite high indel formation at the targeted site, (ii) nucleases induce DNA double strand breaks, which can have serious side effects (e.g. chromosomal rearrangements or translocations), and (iii) ‘mosaicisms’ as edited cells contain different indel mutations, which may result in different effects and thus complicate analysis of the downstream effects. We discuss these points in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In terms of interpretation, the conclusion by the authors that PTBP1 knockdown has little likelihood to be therapeutically relevant seems overstated, particularly since they did observe a beneficial effect on motor behavior. We know that in PD, patients often display negligible symptoms until 50-70% of dopaminergic input to the striatum is lost, due to compensatory activity of remaining dopaminergic cells. Presumably, a small recovery of dopaminergic neurons would have an outsized effect on motor ability and may improve the efficacy of dopaminergic drugs, particularly levodopa, at lower doses, averting many problematic side effects. Since striatal dopamine was assessed by whole-tissue analysis, which is not necessarily reflective of synaptic dopamine availability, it is difficult to assess whether the ~10% increase in TH+ cells in the striatum was sufficient to improve dopamine function. However, the improvement in motor activity suggests that it was.</p></disp-quote><p>As pointed out by the reviewer, it is difficult to estimate the therapeutic effect and importance of a ~10% increase in TH+ cells for PD patient.

A better comparison would be Lindgren et al., 2010 who showed that L-DOPA-treated animals with a physiologically relevant dose (6 mg/kg) that did not induce dyskinesia, showed a return to basal, non-lesioned dopamine levels in the striatum after LDOPA by microdialysis.

Updating these figures to display a wider view of the sequencing trace would enhance transparency.

BrdU experiments are conducted to determine the origin of these cells, leading to the conclusion that TH+ cells derive from nondividing cells and express the neuronal marker DAT, characteristic of dopamine-producing neurons (DANs). Cell shape of the TH+ cells in the striatum and SNc is also evaluated measuring their Feret's diameter and their cell surface. Authors conclude there's heterogeneity in the TH+ cell population due to the presence of TH+/Neun- as well as differences in cell shape.</p><p>However, their explanation of this heterogeneity is solely attributed to differences in the microenvironment and lacks further elaboration. Similarly, their observation that almost half the number of TH+ striatal cells after treatment express CTIP2 (Line 213 and Figure 4B), a marker for GABAergic medium spiny neurons, which they state as &quot;interesting&quot; (line 213) is not developed further.

However, it would be helpful at this point in the manuscript to reconsider the use of the term 'cell reprogramming,' as this study does not involve actual cell reprogramming. The concept &quot;reprograming&quot; entails the process of transforming adult cells into a stem cell-like state, to then differentiate them into a different cell type. As proven in section 4 by a BrdU proliferation assay, the targeted cells are differentiated neurons. Considering BrdU is administered 5 days after ABE treatment, if true cell reprogramming was taking place, there should be evidence of BrdU incorporation. Cell reprogramming or reprograming is mentioned 4 times in the manuscript (line 34, line 54, line 265, line 277). Therefore, using another terminology would be more accurate.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we removed the term “cell reprograming” from the manuscript and rather describe it as induction of TH expression in endogenous neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- As noted in the comments of section 4, a more thorough discussion about the various possibilities for heterogeneity would enhance the manuscript's contribution to the PD field.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we provided a more in-depth discussion of the 4i imaging results and potential therapeutic implications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Despite observing low numbers of TH+ cells, no significant rescue of drug-induced behaviors, and low levels of released dopamine, the authors merely state that these results make the therapy non-viable, but there is no further exploration or discussion. Whether the limitations lie in the ABE strategy itself, such as its efficiency in targeting and editing of differentiated neurons; or if the issues lie on the injection and delivery, is never discussed. A deeper argumentation on the possible underlying reasons for these challenges would greatly enhance the manuscript and contribute to the advancement of ABE therapies in the brain.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that the efficacy of our base editing approach could be significantly enhanced by optimizing the delivery. Currently, we are using a dual AAV approach to deliver intein-split ABEs. Since this approach relies on the delivery of higher AAV doses to achieve cotransduction of a cell by two different AAVs, the efficiency could be significantly enhanced by using smaller Cas9 orthologues that can be delivered as a single AAV. Furthermore, in this study we performed a single injection into the dorsal striatum to deliver ABE-expressing AAVs. Performing multiple injections into the rostral, medial, and caudal regions of the striatum might allow us to transduce more cells and induce TH expression in a larger population of striatal neurons. We have included these points in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- While drug-induced behaviors are not recovered, the data demonstrates a rescue of spontaneous behaviors.
