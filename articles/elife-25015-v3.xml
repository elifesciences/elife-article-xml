Here, we genetically deleted <italic>Srebf-2</italic> from hepatocytes and confirmed that SREBP-2 regulates all genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, the LDL receptor, and PCSK9; a secreted protein that degrades LDL receptors in the liver. Surprisingly, we found that elimination of <italic>Srebf-2</italic> in hepatocytes of mice also markedly reduced SREBP-1c and the expression of all genes involved in FA and triglyceride synthesis that are normally regulated by SREBP-1c. The nuclear receptor LXR is necessary for <italic>Srebf-1c</italic> transcription. The deletion of <italic>Srebf-2</italic> and subsequent lower sterol synthesis in hepatocytes eliminated the production of an endogenous sterol ligand required for LXR activity and SREBP-1c expression. These studies demonstrate that cholesterol and FA synthesis in hepatocytes are coupled and that flux through the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway is required for the maximal SREBP-1c expression and high rates of FA synthesis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25015.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25015.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>SREBP</kwd><kwd>LXR</kwd><kwd>cholesterol</kwd><kwd>fatty acids</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL-20948</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Horton</surname><given-names>Jay D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>SREBP-2 directly regulates genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis and indirectly regulates fatty acid synthesis through the production of a ligand responsible for the activation of LXR and SREBP-1c.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cholesterol and fatty acid (FA) biosynthetic gene expression is regulated by the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) family of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Horton et al., 2002</xref>). The three family members—SREBP-1a, SREBP-1c, and SREBP-2—are basic-helix-loop helix transcription factors that bind to sterol response elements of promoters to activate transcription. SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c are encoded by the same gene but have independent promoters that utilize a unique first exon. SREBP-2 is encoded by a separate gene.</p><p>The membrane-bound, inactive forms of SREBPs are located in the endoplasmic reticulum bound to Scap, an escort protein that serves as a sensor of cellular sterol levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Brown and Goldstein, 2009</xref>). When cellular sterol levels are high, Scap binds an ER retention protein, Insig, which retains the SREBP/Scap complex in the ER. To generate the active nuclear form of SREBPs, SREBP/Scap dissociates from Insig, and the complex moves from the ER to the Golgi where two proteases, designated S1P and S2P, sequentially cleave SREBPs releasing the amino-terminal fragment, which travels to the nucleus to activate regulated genes.</p><p>The in vivo transcriptional-activating properties of each SREBP isoform have been investigated through the generation and characterization of transgenic and knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Horton et al., 2002</xref>). In most tissues, the predominant SREBP-1 isoform expressed is SREBP-1c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Shimomura et al., 1997</xref>). Overexpression of nuclear SREBP-1c (nSREBP-1c) in livers of mice resulted in the transcriptional activation of genes involved in FA and triglyceride (TG) synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Horton et al., 2002</xref>). As a consequence of increased de novo lipogenesis, mice expressing nSREBP-1c developed fatty livers. Consistent with the role of SREBP-1c in activating lipogenesis, SREBP-1c is activated in the liver by insulin through a partially defined pathway that involves the insulin receptor, Akt, and mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Owen et al., 2012</xref>). Conversely, genetic deletion of <italic>Srebf-1c</italic> led to a selective reduction in the expression of genes involved in FA and TG synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Liang et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>The SREBP-1a isoform is a more potent transcription activator than SREBP-1c, owing to its longer transactivation domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Horton et al., 2002</xref>). Overexpression of the minor nSREBP-1a isoform in mouse liver led to the activation of genes involved in both FA and cholesterol biosynthesis; resulting in the accumulation of both cholesterol and TGs in liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Horton et al., 2002</xref>). In stark contrast, the selective deletion of <italic>Srebf-1a</italic> reduced the expression of only acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) 2 in the liver, one of the two ACC isoforms that carry out the first committed enzymatic step in FA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Im et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The genetic ablation of both <italic>Srebf-1a</italic> and <italic>Srebf-1c</italic> resulted in significant, but incomplete, embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Horton et al., 2002</xref>). In those few <italic>Srebf-1a</italic>/<italic>Srebf-1c</italic> knockout mice that survived to adulthood, the gene expression profile in the liver was similar to that observed in livers from mice that had the genetic ablation of only the <italic>Srebf-1c</italic> isoform.</p><p>Transgenic overexpression of nSREBP-2 in liver led to the preferential activation of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, the LDL receptor (LDLR), and PCSK9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Horton et al., 2003</xref>). However, nSREBP-2 overexpression also increased the mRNA levels of FA biosynthetic genes, albeit to a lesser extent than those involved in cholesterol synthesis.</p><p>To further delineate genes specifically regulated by SREBP-2, we initially attempted to obtain mice with homozygous germ-line deletions of <italic>Srebf-2</italic> using a traditional gene-replacement approach. Crosses of <italic>Srebf-2<sup>+/-</sup></italic>mice did not produce viable offspring homozygous for the disrupted <italic>Srebf-2</italic> allele. Most embryos homozygous for the disrupted <italic>Srebf-2</italic> allele appeared to die between day 7–8 post-coitum, but the cause of this embryonic lethality was not investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Horton et al., 2002</xref>). Mice that were heterozygous for the germ-line deletion of <italic>Srebf-2</italic> had no discernable phenotype.</p><p>To bypass the embryonic lethality, here we used albumin-driven, Cre-mediated recombination to delete <italic>Srebf-2</italic> in hepatocytes of mice. The results confirm that SREBP2 is required for normal levels of cholesterol biosynthetic gene expression, but unexpectedly, we found the expression of <italic>Srebf-1c</italic> and its target genes for FA and TG synthesis was also dependent on SREBP-2 expression. The absence of SREBP-2 lead to reduced LXR activity, which explained the loss of SREBP-1c expression, possibly owing to the loss of an endogenous sterol ligand that is dependent on flux through the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The vector and targeting strategy used to conditionally disrupt <italic>Srebf-2</italic> is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>.

there was an accompanying ~80% reduction in the mRNA level of PCSK9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). PCSK9 is a secreted protein that degrades LDLRs in liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lagace et al., 2006</xref>). In livers of hepatocyte-<italic>Srebf-2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, the reduction in LDLR production was balanced by the reduction in PCSK9-mediated LDLR destruction, which ultimately led to no measurable change in steady-state LDLR protein levels (data not shown). Nevertheless, plasma cholesterol levels in hepatocyte-<italic>Srebf-2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice were still 50% lower than those measured in WT mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). To determine whether lower plasma cholesterol levels were a result of increased clearance of apoB-containing lipoproteins, we measured the <sup>125</sup>I-labeled LDL clearance. LDL was isolated from LDL receptor knockout mice and labeled the apoB with <sup>125</sup>I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Horton et al., 1999</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, the clearance of LDL was identical in WT and hepatocyte-<italic>Srebf-2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. Therefore, the lower plasma and TG concentrations were likely a result of reduced VLDL production; therefore we measured rates of TG secretion in mice following the administration of Triton. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>, TG secretion rates from livers of hepatocyte-<italic>Srebf-2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice reduced by 29%.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25015.011</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>In vivo VLDL secretion and LDL clearance in WT and hepatocyte-<italic>Srebf-2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Eleven male mice (8 weeks of age) of each genotype were subjected to i.v. injection of <sup>125</sup>I-labeled LDL (15 µg of protein, 496 cpm/ng protein).

Deletion of <italic>Srebf-2</italic> in hepatocytes reduced the expression of all cholesterol biosynthetic genes and rates of hepatic cholesterol synthesis. Despite the deficiency in liver cholesterol content, no apparent additional mechanisms are present in the livers capable of restoring cholesterol levels to normal in the absence of SREBP-2. The unexpected finding in <italic>Srebf-2</italic> knockout livers was the marked reduction of SREBP-1c expression and genes involved in FA synthesis. While this manuscript was in preparation, Vergnes <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Vergnes et al., 2016</xref>) also reported that SREBP-1c expression and its regulated genes were reduced in livers of SREBP-2 hypomorphic mice. Here, dietary supplementation of cholesterol or an LXR agonist restored SREBP-1c expression and the mRNAs encoding the FA biosynthetic enzymes, which suggests that the loss of flux through the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway results in the loss of an endogenous LXR ligand required for normal LXR activity.</p><p>The current studies also have identified the first molecular mechanism linking cholesterol and FA synthesis in liver. This link requires SREBP-2 expression and is apparently supplied by an intermediate or product of cholesterol biosynthesis that serves as a ligand for LXR, which is required for SREBP-1c expression. Coupling cholesterol and FA synthesis may be important for the efficient esterification of cholesterol since oleic acid is the preferred substrate for the cholesterol esterifying enzyme ACAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Yang et al., 1997</xref>). Cholesterol may also be required for the normal formation of the VLDL particle lipid core and thus linking cholesterol and FA synthesis might be necessary for efficient VLDL production by the liver.</p><p>LXR can be activated by 20(S)-hydroxycholesterol, 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol, and 27-hydroxycholesterol as well as the cholesterol biosynthetic intermediate desmosterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Huang, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Yang et al., 2006</xref>). Supplementation of a synthetic LXR ligand or feeding cholesterol were both capable of restoring the SREBP-1c expression indicating that LXR was present and that if a ligand was provided it was capable of normally activating <italic>Srebf-1c</italic> transcription in the SREBP-2 deficient mice. However, we were unable to identify any changes in concentrations of known LXR ligands hepatocyte-<italic>Srebf-2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> liver, indicating that the missing ligand is unique and not previously identified. Further studies will be required to identify this endogenous ligand.</p><p>The phenotype that resulted from the deletion of <italic>Srebf-2</italic> in hepatocytes was nearly indistinguishable from mice that lack Scap in hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Matsuda et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Moon et al., 2012</xref>). The only molecular signature we found that differed between hepatocyte-<italic>Srebf-2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and hepatocyte-<italic>Scap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> livers was the retained expression of SREBP-1a and ACC2 in the livers of hepatocyte-<italic>Srebf-2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. These studies confirm that SREBP-1a has only a minor role in regulating basal and stimulated cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis in the liver. The phenotypic similarities between hepatocyte-<italic>Srebf-2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and hepatocyte-<italic>Scap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice also suggest that blocking SREBP-2 action would be effective in preventing the development of hepatic steatosis in mice with insulin resistance and/or diabetes. The markedly reduced expression of lipogenic genes in hepatocyte-<italic>Srebf-2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> livers and the blunted response of these genes to refeeding a high carbohydrate diet suggest that blocking SREBP-2 action would also be effective in preventing the development of hepatic steatosis induced by hyperinsulinemia, similar to the results obtained in Scap deficient mice that also lack leptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Moon et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Plasma cholesterol and TG concentrations were also significantly lower in hepatocyte-<italic>Srebf-2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. The LDLR protein level was not reduced in hepatocyte-<italic>Srebf-2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> livers despite a 20% reduction in LDLR mRNA levels; however, the mRNA levels of PCSK9 were reduced by 80% in hepatocyte-<italic>Srebf-2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> livers. Inasmuch as LDL clearance was not altered in hepatocyte-<italic>Srebf-2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, the reduced LDLR protein destruction by PCSK9 likely offset the reduced LDLR production since LDL clearance from the plasma of hepatocyte-<italic>Srebf-2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice was not lower. Thus, the lower plasma lipid levels were a reflection of reduced VLDL secretion from the liver.</p><p>A potential additional benefit of inhibiting SREBP expression in the liver, independent of the reduction in hepatic TGs, is the reduced expression of <italic>PNPLA3</italic>. Polymorphisms in <italic>PNPLA3</italic> are associated with hepatic steatosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Romeo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Speliotes et al., 2010</xref>). SREBP-1c is the only known transcriptional activator of PNPLA3 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Huang et al., 2010</xref>). In WT mice refed a high carbohydrate diet, PNPLA3 mRNA levels increased &gt;200–fold above the fasted state, whereas in livers of hepatocyte-<italic>Srebf-2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice PNPLA3 only increased 15–fold (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). The blunted PNPLA3 expression in livers of hepatocyte-<italic>Srebf-2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice was likely due to the accompanying loss of SREBP-1c since feeding the hepatocyte-<italic>Srebf-2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice diets supplemented with an LXR agonist or cholesterol (data not shown) restored SREBP-1c and PNPLA3 expression. Studies by Hobbs and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Smagris et al., 2015</xref>) previously demonstrated that high expression levels of the mutant PNPLA3 protein are required for the development of hepatic steatosis in mice. Thus, a reduction in mutant PNPLA3 expression as a result of inhibiting SREBP-2 or Scap may be of therapeutic benefit in individuals who carry the <italic>PNPLA3</italic> polymorphism.</p><p>The current report represents the last in a series of studies that we have carried out using genetically manipulated mice to elucidate the in vivo function of the SREBP family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Horton et al., 2002</xref>). They confirm that SREBP-2 mediates the regulated expression of cholesterol biosynthetic genes and also controls steady-state tissue cholesterol concentrations by simultaneously regulating cholesterol synthesis and uptake from plasma and by modulating the expression of the LDLR and PCSK9. The physiological changes that result from deleting <italic>Srebf-2</italic> mirror that of mice that lack Scap in hepatocytes since we show that SREBP-2 expression is required to produce an LXR ligand required for normal SREBP-1c expression. The resulting phenotypes suggest that the inhibition of SREBP-2 or Scap in the liver, which reduces cholesterol and FA synthesis, may be therapeutically advantageous for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>General supplies and measurements</title><p>Plasma concentrations of cholesterol, TGs, insulin, glucose, and free FAs, and liver cholesterol and TGs contents were measured as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Engelking et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ishibashi et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Matsuda et al., 2001</xref>).

A <italic>loxP</italic> site was inserted into the promoter region of the <italic>Srebf-2</italic>~660 bp upstream of exon 1, and a <italic>loxp; frt</italic>-flanked <italic>pgk-neo-pA</italic> cassette was inserted into intron 1. Exon 1 encodes the first 29 amino acids of <italic>Srebf-2</italic>. The conditional targeting vector was constructed in five steps as follows: (1) A 1.1 kb fragment of intron 1 was generated by PCR from SM-1 ES cell genomic DNA with 5’ primers that contained a HindIII sequence and a <italic>loxP</italic> site, and a 3’ primer that contained a SalI sequence (5’ primer, 5’-AAAAAAGCTTATAACTTCGTATAATGTATGCTATACGAAGTTATCCCGAAGCGGGGCTGGGGGCGTCGCGAG-3’ and 3’ primer, 5’-AAAAAGTCGACTTGTCACACTGTCTGGATGACCAAAATG-3’). This fragment was used as the short arm. (2) The HindIII- SalI fragment of the short arm and a BamHI-HindIII fragment containing a <italic>loxP;frt</italic> flanked <italic>pgk-neo-pA</italic> cassette excised from pGEMFRTNEO (provided by Joachim Herz, UT Southwestern) were ligated into the BamHI-SalI sites of pGEM-11Zf(+) (Promega, Madison, WI), yielding plasmid pBP2-KO1.

The NotI-BamHI fragment of the middle arm was ligated into the NotI and BamHI sites of pBP2-KO1, yielding plasmid pBP2-KO2. (4) Two copies of <italic>hsv-tk</italic> cassette were inserted into the SalI site of pBP2-KO2, yielding pBP2-KO3. (5) The long arm is a 7 kb fragment upstream of the promoter region of the <italic>Srebf-2</italic>. It was prepared by PCR using TaKaRa LA Taq DNA polymerase (Takara Shuzo, Shiga, Japan). The following NotI-containing PCR primers were used for amplification: 5’ primer, 5’-AAAAAGCGGCCGCCTTGGTGAGGGCAGGCTGCAGGCCACTG-3’ and 3’ primer, 5’-AAAAAGCGGCCGCATCTTACAGGTAGTCGGTCACACTGCACAC-3’). The PCR fragment was digested with NotI and inserted into the NotI site of pBP2-KO3, resulting in the final <italic>Srebf-2</italic> conditional targeting vector, designated pBP2-KO4.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Harry Dietz (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Peter Tontonoz, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript describes unexpected alteration of the SREBP-1 pathway in SREBP-2 liver specific knockout mice. The authors found that elimination of SREBP-2 in liver significantly reduced the activity of the SREBP-1c pathway and the expression of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis regulated by SREBP- 1c. Feeding mice with either LXR ligand or high cholesterol diet relieved SREBP-1c suppression. These data suggested that deletion of SREBP-2 reduced the production of an endogenous sterol ligand required for LXR activity and SREBP-1c expression. A puzzling aspect is that putative in vivo LXR oxysterol ligands are not reduced in the SREBP-2 KO livers and some oxysterol species are even higher in the KO. In general, the data presented in this manuscript is clear, and is consistent with the hypothesis put forward by the authors.</p><p>The reviewers were in agreement that the work was interesting and potentially of interest to the general audience of <italic>eLife</italic>. The studies were judged to be technically sound and the reviewers believed that the majority of the conclusions drawn were supported by the data. At the same time, the review process identified several opportunities to strengthen the work.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In this manuscript, the comparison of phenotypes was performed between wild type and Srebf-2 fl/fl, Alb-Cre mice. A more appropriate control group should be the Srebf-2 fl/fl mice, instead of the wild type mice. The authors should address if there is any difference in the concerned phenotypes between the wild type mice and the Srebf-2 fl/fl mice.</p><p>2) Results, last paragraph and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: It is surprising that the authors sought to explain a 50% reduction in plasma cholesterol in the SREBP2 KO mice on the basis of a reduction in LDL; LDL levels in mice are not high enough to explain this level of reduction. Wouldn't it be more likely that it is due to a reduction in ABCA1 expression and thus a loss of HDL? Does T901317 restore serum cholesterol levels?</p><p>3) As useful information for the research community, it would be helpful if the authors could discuss the phenotype of heterozygous liver specific Srebf-2 knockout mice.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25015.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) In this manuscript, the comparison of phenotypes was performed between wild type and Srebf-2 fl/fl, Alb-Cre mice.

Does T901317 restore serum cholesterol levels?</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the reduction of plasma cholesterol levels in this study was due to the reduced HDL-C rather than the LDL. The purpose of the LDL clearance study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), was simply to demonstrate that there was no increased clearance of LDL-C since the deletion of SREBP-2 effected the expression of the LDLR and PSCSK9. The fact that there was no difference supports the results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref> that showed there was a marked reduction in VLDL production and we feel this is the most likely cause of the lower plasma lipid levels. We did measure the expression of ABCA1 but found no changes. The LXR agonist does restored serum cholesterol levels of L-SREBP-2<sup>-/-</sup> mice.</p><p><italic>3) As useful information for the research community, it would be helpful if the authors could discuss the phenotype of heterozygous liver specific Srebf-2 knockout mice.</italic> </p><p>We have added a statement regarding the lack of phenotype in SREBP-12 heterozygous mice in the Introduction.</p></body></sub-article></article>
