In animals, a central brain clock coordinates circadian rhythms throughout the body and is characterized by a remarkable robustness that depends on synaptic connections between constituent neurons. The clock neuron network of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, which shares network motifs with clock networks in the mammalian brain yet is built of many fewer neurons, offers a powerful model for understanding the network properties of circadian timekeeping. Here, we report an assessment of synaptic connectivity within a clock network, focusing on the critical lateral neuron (LN) clock neuron classes within the Janelia hemibrain dataset. Our results reveal that previously identified anatomical and functional subclasses of LNs represent distinct connectomic types. Moreover, we identify a small number of non-clock cell subtypes representing highly synaptically coupled nodes within the clock neuron network. This suggests that neurons lacking molecular timekeeping likely play integral roles within the circadian timekeeping network. To our knowledge, this represents the first comprehensive connectomic analysis of a circadian neuronal network.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most organisms on Earth possess an internal timekeeping system which ensures that bodily processes such as sleep, wakefulness or digestion take place at the right time. These precise daily rhythms are kept in check by a master clock in the brain. There, thousands of neurons – some of which carrying an internal ‘molecular clock’ – connect to each other through structures known as synapses. Exactly how the resulting network is organised to support circadian timekeeping remains unclear.</p><p>To explore this question, Shafer, Gutierrez et al. focused on fruit flies, as recent efforts have systematically mapped every neuron and synaptic connection in the brain of this model organism. Analysing available data from the hemibrain connectome project at Janelia revealed that that the neurons with the most important timekeeping roles were in fact forming the fewest synapses within the network. In addition, neurons without internal molecular clocks mediated strong synaptic connections between those that did, suggesting that ‘clockless’ cells still play an integral role in circadian timekeeping.</p><p>With this research, Shafer, Gutierrez et al. provide unexpected insights into the organisation of the master body clock. Better understanding the networks that underpin circadian rhythms will help to grasp how and why these are disrupted in obesity, depression and Alzheimer’s disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>circadian rhythms</kwd><kwd>connectomics</kwd><kwd>clock networks</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS118012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shafer</surname><given-names>Orie T</given-names></name><name><surname>Fernandez</surname><given-names>Maria de la Paz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS077933</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shafer</surname><given-names>Orie T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K22 NS104187</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gutierrez</surname><given-names>Gabrielle J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NeuroNex Award DBI-1707398</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gutierrez</surname><given-names>Gabrielle J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000324</institution-id><institution>Gatsby Charitable Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gutierrez</surname><given-names>Gabrielle J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant #2024607</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lazar</surname><given-names>Aurel A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The most influential clocks within the <italic>Drosophila</italic> circadian clock neuron network form the fewest synapses within the network, and neurons that do not themselves contain molecular clocks mediate connections between those that do, suggesting a key role in timekeeping.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Most organisms undergo predictable daily changes in gene expression, physiology, and behavior that are driven by endogenous circadian clocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aschoff, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Takahashi et al., 2001</xref>). In animals, the molecular feedback loops underlying circadian clocks are present in all organ systems but are required within a relatively small population of brain neurons to maintain daily rhythms in behavior and physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Herzog, 2007</xref>). In mammals, the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) are the brain’s central circadian clock since the ablation of the SCN or knockouts of the molecular clock within the SCN results in loss of circadian rhythms (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Herzog et al., 2017</xref>). Compared to peripheral tissues, timekeeping in the brain’s central clock is more resilient to the loss of clock gene function and to environmental perturbations. This resilience comes from physiological connections between SCN neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buhr et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2007</xref>). Determining how clock neurons are connected is, therefore, essential to understand circadian timekeeping in animals.</p><p>A fundamental challenge to addressing this question is the complexity of the circadian neuronal networks. The paired mammalian SCN consists of tens of thousands of neurons with diverse neurochemical outputs that form a complex network (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hastings et al., 2019</xref>). The clock neuron network of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> offers a powerful model to understand the network properties of neural circadian timekeeping. The molecular clocks of insects and mammals are highly conserved and their neuronal networks appear to share common motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nitabach and Taghert, 2008</xref>). The fly’s clock neuron network consists of relatively few neurons that can be organized in a small number of discrete anatomical classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shafer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Furthermore, genetic tools to specifically manipulate subclasses of the fly circadian network have made it possible to understand the functional roles of these subclasses in the production of endogenous circadian rhythms in sleep and activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmad et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shafer and Keene, 2021</xref>). Though transgenic markers of synaptic connectivity and live-imaging-based assessments of functional connectivity have been used to address neural connectivity within the clock neuron network (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reinhard et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yao et al., 2012</xref>), a systematic assessment of synaptic connectivity within this network is lacking.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The circadian clock neuron network and identified clock neurons in the hemibrain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The circadian clock network is shown in both hemispheres.

Annotation of the Janelia hemibrain connectome contains most of the key anatomical subsets of the fly’s clock neuron network and powerful computational tools are available to navigate this connectome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lazar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>) making it possible to analyze the structure of the fly’s brain clock network.</p><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> Circadian Neuron Network is a group of ~150 neurons that display synchronous oscillation in PER and TIM abundance and can be subdivided based on gene expression, anatomy, and location in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Helfrich-Förster, 2005</xref>). These are (i) the lateral neurons (LNs), which can be subdivided into ventral lateral (LNv) and dorsal lateral (LNd) neurons, (ii) the lateral posterior neurons (LPNs), and (iii) the dorsal neurons (DNs), which can be subdivided into dorsal neurons 1, 2, and 3 (DN1, DN2, and DN3) and further subdivided into anterior (DN1a) and posterior (DN1p) DN1s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Helfrich-Förster et al., 2007b</xref>; Helfrich-Forster, Yoshii, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Helfrich-Förster et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shafer et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The LNvs release the key circadian neuropeptide Pigment Dispersing Factor (PDF) and can be further subdivided into small and large LNvs (s-LNvs and l-LNvs). Release of PDF from the s-LNvs, which takes place in the dorsal protocerebrum where the LNds and DNs reside, is required for endogenous circadian timekeeping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Park et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Renn et al., 1999</xref>). The current annotation of the hemibrain dataset identifies all the expected lateral neuron classes: four l-LNvs, four s-LNvs, the 5th-s-LNv, and six LNds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). However, some clock neurons have not yet been unequivocally identified within the hemibrain dataset: approximately half of the DN1ps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reinhard et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>) and the DN2s and DN3s. The LN classes of clock neurons represent the minimum sub-network required to produce endogenous bimodal rhythm of sleep and activity. A functional molecular clock only in the s-LNvs, 5th s-LNv, and LNds is sufficient to produce such rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grima et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rieger et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report an assessment of chemical synaptic connectivity for the critical LN clock neuron classes within the hemibrain volume. We have determined the patterns of synaptic connectivity within this core LN circadian sub-network and the connectivity with other clock neurons annotated within the hemibrain dataset. This analysis provides a significant and comprehensive insight into the synaptic circuitry underlying the organization and function of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> central brain clock. Our results reveal that previously identified anatomical and functional subclasses of LNs are distinct connectomic classes that receive unique sources of synaptic inputs and outputs. Furthermore, our analysis reveals a remarkable heterogeneity in how clock neuron subclasses form connections to other clock neurons and identifies a small number of clock cell subtypes that are highly synaptically coupled nodes. Finally, we find ‘non-clock neuron’ targets which themselves form synapses back onto clock neurons. We propose that those non-clock cells are important components of the timekeeping network.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The clock neuron network and the hemibrain dataset</title><p>Representatives of all classes of clock neurons, with the exception of the DN2 and DN3 classes, have been identified in the hemibrain volume used here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> for the naming scheme used here for the clock neurons identified in the dataset with their corresponding unique body IDs. The patterns of connectivity among some of these neurons have recently been briefly described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmad et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reinhard et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reinhard et al., 2022b</xref>). Scheffer and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>) define synaptic strength within the hemibrain volume by the number of synaptic connections formed between neurons, defining connections consisting of only one or two chemical synapses as weak and subject to error, three to nine synapses as medium strength, and of ten or more synapses as strong. We used these definitions of synaptic strength in this study. As a whole, the identified clock neurons appear to be sparsely interconnected by chemical synapses. Most clock neuron pairs form either no synapses or weak synaptic connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). However, there are a few clear exceptions: a single LNd (LNd6) and the 5th s-LNv form strong connections with one another and with members of the DN1 group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reinhard et al., 2022a</xref>) and stand out among the clock neurons as hubs of inter-clock synaptic connectivity.</p><table-wrap id="table1"

(LNs); the four Pigment Dispersing Factor (PDF) -expressing small ventral lateral neurons (s-LNvs), the six dorsal lateral neurons (LNds) and the PDF negative 5th s-LNv (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We have chosen to focus on these clock neuron classes for two reasons. First, these classes are completely accounted for in the hemibrain annotation used here. Second, the 11 neurons that comprise the LN class are sufficient to drive the fly’s endogenous bimodal rhythm in locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grima et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rieger et al., 2006</xref>) and therefore represent a critical sub-network within the fly’s circadian system.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The small LNvs are a highly unified connectomic class distinct from the 5th s-LNv</title><p>The s-LNvs have long been considered critical circadian pacemakers within the <italic>Drosophila</italic> clock neuron network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Helfrich-Förster, 1998</xref>). These cells express the neuropeptide PDF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Helfrich-Förster, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Renn et al., 1999</xref>), maintain strong molecular timekeeping under constant conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shafer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yang and Sehgal, 2001</xref>) and are required for robust endogenous circadian rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grima et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shafer and Taghert, 2009</xref>). The s-LNvs also contribute to the morning peak of the fly’s crepuscular daily activity rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grima et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Stoleru et al., 2004</xref>). In addition to PDF, these cells also release the neuropeptide short Neuropeptide F (sNPF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johard et al., 2009</xref>) and the neurotransmitter glycine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Frenkel et al., 2017</xref>). Hyper excitation of the s-LNvs leads to a morning-like gene expression profile for many circadian genes, while hyperpolarization leads to an evening-like transcriptional profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mizrak et al., 2012</xref>). Though by no means the only clock neurons capable of producing an endogenous sense of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Delventhal et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schlichting et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yao and Shafer, 2014</xref>), a large body of evidence supports the notion that s-LNvs are among the most critical neurons for the maintenance of endogenous circadian rhythms (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmad et al., 2021</xref>). The 5th s-LNv was named because it was initially thought to be anatomically similar to the PDF positive s-LNvs in the larval brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaneko and Hall, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaneko et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rieger et al., 2006</xref>). However, subsequent work has suggested that the 5th s-LNv is likely functionally and anatomically more akin to the LNds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grima et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schubert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yao and Shafer, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The four PDF-expressing s-LNvs are characterized by a relatively simple morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Helfrich-Förster et al., 2007b</xref>). Their cell bodies are located in the ventral brain, near the accessory medulla (AMe), into which they extend short neurites which likely receive input from photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Helfrich-Förster et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Malpel et al., 2002</xref>). These four sLNvs project dorsally to the posterior dorsal protocerebrum, where they turn toward the midline and form fine ramified termini that extend toward the midline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Helfrich-Förster, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Helfrich-Förster et al., 2007b</xref>). These dorsal ramifications are thought to be the major site of s-LNv synaptic output but are also known to contain synaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yasuyama and Meinertzhagen, 2010</xref>). Work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schubert et al., 2018</xref> showed that the 5th s-LNv (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), which expresses the neuropeptide ion transport peptide (ITP) and choline acetyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johard et al., 2009</xref>), an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of acetylcholine, has more extensive ramifications within the dorsal brain and accessory medulla than the PDF expressing s-LNvs and provided evidence that they are anatomically more akin to LNds than to s-LNvs. Based on these findings, Schubert et al. suggested that the 5th sLNv be reclassified as a LNv (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schubert et al., 2018</xref>), a convention we follow for the remainder of this study. Based on this work, we predict that the 5th LNv within the hemibrain will be connectomically distinct from the PDF expressing s-LNvs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Connectivity patterns of the s-LNvs.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>).

Visualization of T-bars and postsynaptic densities within these neurons reveals that their ventral neurites, which innervate the accessory medulla, are biased toward receiving synaptic input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and F</xref>). Individual PDF-positive s-LNvs display relatively simple dorsal medial termini with relatively few branch-points that tend to run in parallel to neighboring branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yasuyama and Meinertzhagen, 2010</xref>), these dorsal medial s-LNv termini contain both presynaptic and postsynaptic structures with the former significantly outnumbering the latter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The dorsal termini of the 5th LNvs also contains both pre- and postsynaptic structures but appear to be less biased toward output compared to the PDF expressing s-LNvs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Taken together, the four pdf +s LNvs form a total of 2238 synapses within the hemibrain volume: 505 inputs (postsynaptic densities) and 1733 outputs (projections onto postsynaptic densities). The single 5th s-LNv contains 1413 postsynaptic densities and forms synapses onto 1992 postsynaptic densities. Thus, the 5th LNv forms about four times the number of synapses of a single PDF-positive s-LNv (Figure 4C; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p>The four pdf +s LNvs display uniformity in their synaptic inputs for strong synaptic connections. Only three neurons in the hemibrain provide ten or more synapses onto at least one of these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), and only two of those three neurons form strong connections onto all four sLNvs (Figure 4D; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). They also appear to be remarkably uniform in their patterns of strong synaptic output. Only 11 neurons receive 10 or more synapses from at least one <italic>pdf</italic> +s LNv (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Compared to the other LN classes, these s-LNvs are highly similar to each other in both their strong and medium-strength connections (Figure 4A, B) and form few but nearly uniform patterns of strong shared synaptic connections (Figure 4). Notably, within the hemibrain volume, the pdf +s LNvs are not strongly connected to other clock neurons, though they do form medium strength connections with one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2H</xref>). The 5th LNv displays patterns of strong synaptic connectivity that are almost completely distinct from those of the four pdf +s LNvs, sharing a single strong output connection with only one of these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p>Though quite uniform in their patterns of strong synaptic input and outputs, the pdf +s LNvs do display some within-class differences in their patterns of weak and medium strength connections. Among the inputs targeting only one s-LNv, and mediated by only three synapses, is the HB-eyelet, a surprising finding given the long-held model that this external photoreceptor provides direct excitatory input onto s-LNvs and contributes to light entrainment of circadian rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Helfrich-Förster et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Malpel et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rieger et al., 2003</xref>), though recent work has indicated that the eyelet to s-LNv connection may be polysynaptic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2018</xref>). The sparse connectivity between the eyelet and the s-LNvs found within the hemibrain is consistent with recent work suggesting that the eyelet makes negligible contributions to light entrainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alejevski et al., 2019</xref>). Nevertheless, our analysis supports the notion that the pdf +s LNvs represent a uniform connectomic cell type with regard to patterns of strong synaptic connections, consistent with recent work revealing a uniformity in gene expression across the s-LNvs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ma et al., 2021</xref>). A recent connectomic analysis of the larval brain reached similar conclusions regarding the uniformity of sensory inputs, anatomy, and local connections among the four larval pdf +neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Larderet et al., 2017</xref>), which persist through metamorphosis to become the adult s-LNvs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Helfrich-Förster, 1997</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The LNds comprise several connectomic subclasses</title><p>As their name suggests, the somata of the dorsal lateral neurons (LNds) are situated dorsally relative to the LNvs, residing in the lateral cell body rind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Helfrich-Förster et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaneko and Hall, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schubert et al., 2018</xref>).

Within the Cry-positive LNds, LNd4, and LNd5 share 27 strong synaptic inputs with one another, but only seven strong connections with LNd6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Similarly, LNd4 and LNd5 share 33 strong synaptic targets with one another but only seven or fewer with LNd6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Thus, the Cry-positive LNds appear to consist of at least two connectomic subgroups, LNd4/LNd5 and LNd6. This connectomic distinction is consistent with differences in neuropeptide expression within the Cry-positive LNds, with two LNds expressing short neuropeptide F (sNPF) and the third expressing ion transport peptide (ITP), a feature it shares with the Cry expressing 5th LNv (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johard et al., 2009</xref>). A similar distinction can be made for the Cry-negative LNds, LNd2/LNd3 and LNd1, in terms of patterns of strong synaptic connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>). Based on these patterns of strong synaptic connections, the LNd class appears to consist of four distinct connectomic types. This number matches the number of transcriptomic classes of LNds recently revealed by single cell sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ma et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The four connectomic groups of LNd clock neurons correspond to previously identified cellular and functional clock subsets</title><p>The LNds vary in their coupling patterns to the s-LNvs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yao and Shafer, 2014</xref>) in addition to differences in their expression profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The two sNPF positive LNds, which express Cry and PdfR, remain tightly coupled to the s-LNvs when the circadian clock in the latter neurons is slowed down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yao and Shafer, 2014</xref>). The sNPF expressing LNds were termed E1 oscillators based on this tight temporal coupling to the s-LNvs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yao and Shafer, 2014</xref>), which also express sNPF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johard et al., 2009</xref>). The NPF/ITP expressing LNd, despite being receptive to PDF released from the LNvs, does not display coupling to the slowed s-LNv clocks and was grouped with the ITP-expressing 5th s-LNv as E2 oscillators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yao and Shafer, 2014</xref>). The remaining LNds, which consist of the Cry-negative LNds, were classified as E3 oscillators, which are neither PDF receptive nor coupled to s-LNvs with modified clock speeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yao and Shafer, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The Cry-positive LNds, therefore, appear to consist of two functional types; two LNds making up E1 and a single LNd corresponding to E2. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schubert et al., 2018</xref> established the anatomical hallmarks of these two Cry-positive LNds, with the single E2 LNd sending more extensive ventral projections compared to the E1 LNds. Examination of hemibrain LNd volumes indicates that LNd6 corresponds to LNd-E2 (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), and that LNd4 and LNd5 are the E1 LNds. This LNd5/4 (E1) and LNd6 (E2) distinction mirrors the patterns of shared strong synaptic connectivity displayed by the Cry-positive LNds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>). Therefore, functionally distinct LNd subgroups share patterns of strong synaptic inputs and outputs.</p><p>The 5th LNv, which shares cellular and anatomical similarities with LNd6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schubert et al., 2018</xref>), was assigned as a member of the E2 functional class by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yao and Shafer, 2014</xref>, based on the absence of coupling to timekeeping within the PDF positive s-LNvs, despite receptivity to PDF and their role in the generation of evening activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grima et al., 2004</xref>). We, therefore, asked if LNd6 and the 5th LNv display similar patterns of synaptic connectivity. Indeed, these two neurons displayed significant overlap in their strong synaptic connectivity, both for synaptic inputs and targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>). Thus, LNd6 and the 5th LNv are more alike in their patterns of strong synaptic connectivity than they are to other lateral neuron subtypes in addition to sharing neuropeptide expression and coupling mode with the PDF expressing s-LNvs.</p><p>The patterns of strong clock neuron connectivity within the hemibrain led us to hypothesize that the recognized functional subtypes, M (PDF-positive s-LNvs), E1 (LNd4 and LNd5), E2 (LNd6 and 5th LNv), and E3 (LNd1, LNd2, and LNd3) display distinct patterns of synaptic connectivity. To test this hypothesis, we expanded our analysis to include both strong and medium strength synaptic connections, which together account for the vast majority of connections made by the identified clock neurons within the hemibrain dataset. To examine affinities between individual identified clock neurons in our expanded consideration of connectivity, we used the Jaccard index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>), a coefficient of similarity between two sets that ranges between zero and one, the former value indicating no overlapping synaptic partners and latter indicating complete overlap (see Methods). Jaccard indices for both synaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and outputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) provide strong evidence that the LN classes can be divided into four connectomic groups: The four PDF positive s-LNvs (M group; Figure 6), two of the Cry-positive LNds (LNd4 and LNd5; E1 group; Figure 7), LNd6 and the 5th LNv (E2 group; Figure 8 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), and the Cry- negative LNds (LNd1, LNd2, and LNd3; E3 Group; Figure 9), conforming to the functional divisions hypothesized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yao and Shafer, 2014</xref>.</p><p>These functional LN divisions also have different numbers of synaptic connections and different ratios of input to output synapses. The M group displays the smallest number of synapses, E3 an intermediate number, and E1 and E2 form roughly twice the number of connections displayed by E3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The M and E1 groups also appear distinct from the E2 and E3 groups in the balance of output to input synapses. Though all the identified LNs form more synaptic outputs than inputs, output synapses in the M and E1 groups make up a larger proportion of total synaptic connections when compared to the E2 and E3 groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Thus, the connectomic subgroups that emerged from our analysis of strong synaptic connectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>) are further supported by the combined analysis of strong and medium strength connectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>) and conform to previously hypothesized functional and cellular subgroups.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The functional/connectomic subgroups of LN clock cells display distinct synaptic output pathways</title><p>In animals, the brain’s endogenous central circadian clock drives myriad behavioral, physiological, and endocrine rhythms. Synaptic connections between the central clock network and neurons outside the timekeeping network are thought to mediate daily signals from the circadian system to the neural centers responsible for driving daily physiological and behavioral changes. Though specific output pathways linking the clock to specific endocrine and sleep control centers have been previously described in the fly (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">King and Sehgal, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shafer and Keene, 2021</xref>), there is still a great deal to be learned about circadian output signaling. For example, do the various functional groups of clock neurons converge on the same synaptic targets to shape the timing of the same daily outputs, as was recently described for arousal promoting pathways linking the LNs to dopaminergic neurons modulating the ellipsoid body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liang et al., 2019</xref>)? Alternatively, do functional clock cell subgroups generally synapse onto distinct neural targets to produce uniquely phased outputs of different behavioral, physiological, and endocrine rhythms, as recently described for sleep modulating dorsal clock neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lamaze et al., 2018</xref>)?

As expected, the M, E1, E2, and E3 subgroups differ significantly in terms of the brain areas where the majority of their neurites form chemical synapses. Though the M and E subgroups form output synapses within both the superior lateral protocerebrum (SLP) and superior medial protocerebrum (SMP), the M subgroups form the majority of their output synapses within the SLP, whereas the E groups form the majority of their output synapses within the SMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). Though all seven E cells terminate largely within these two neuropils, they fall, once again, into three classes with regard to their neuropil innervation. For example, E1 forms more output synapses on cells of the anterior ventrolateral protocerebrum (AVLP) than E2 or E3, E2 forms more synapses within the accessory medulla than do E1 or E3, and E3 forms little to no synapses on neurons associated with either of these neuropils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Neuropils innervated by M and E cells.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>).

The sixth strong shared output is an SMP-associated neuron named SMP232-R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The SLP-316-R neurons strongly resemble DN1ps currently missing from the hemibrain annotation, which sends ventral projections alongside the dorsal projections of M cells and were named ventral-contralateral DN1ps by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lamaze et al., 2018</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Thus, all the strong and shared output targets of the M group project back to the clock neuron network, thereby implicating them as nodes within the clock neuron network, either as currently unidentified clock-containing neurons or non-clock-containing neurons. The M group appears to be unique in the extent to which its strong shared synaptic targets reenter the clock neuron network, with only half or fewer of strong E1, E2, or E3 targets recurring to the clock network in this fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Strong shared outputs of M cells.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) The six cells that are strong shared outputs of the four M cells involve three different neuronal types (SPL316-R, SLP403-R, and SMP232-R).

The hemibrain represents a single hemisphere of the central brain and therefore does not contain all connections from the clock neuron cell bodies it contains. Several classes of clock neurons, including the large LNvs, the 5th LNv, the LNds, and DN1ps, project across the midline and form connections in the contralateral hemisphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Helfrich-Förster et al., 2007b</xref>). Many of these connections are expected to reside outside of the hemibrain volume. Our estimates of inter-clock connectivity will therefore not include these contralateral connections. Furthermore, recent work suggests that electrical synapses within the clock neuron network likely contribute to circadian timekeeping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ramakrishnan and Sheeba, 2021</xref>), but these are not visible in the hemibrain dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, neuropeptides can be released non-synaptically (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yasuyama and Meinertzhagen, 2010</xref>), act over long distances, and such paracrine signaling likely contributes to circadian timekeeping in the brain (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maywood et al., 2011</xref>). The connectomic analysis presented here does not include such peptidergic connectivity. Thus, our analysis underestimates connectivity. In addition, clock neuron classes undergo daily morphological changes that are most likely accompanied by changes in the number and locations of synaptic connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duhart et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fernández et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Petsakou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Song et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, the hemibrain represents only one timepoint, in the early morning, within a cycle of changing synaptic connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>). Finally, the hemibrain dataset represents a single female fly, whereas the vast majority of experiments on the neural basis of circadian timekeeping have employed male files. Thus, unexpected connectivity may be due to differences between the well-characterized clock neuron network of males and the less well-studied female network.</p><p>Though, we are focusing our analysis on the LN clock neuron classes, we have omitted the l-LNvs. We have done so because the synaptic outputs of the l-LNvs are thought to occur in the contralateral accessory medulla (AMe) and much of their synaptic inputs are thought to be located in regions of the medulla that are not included in the hemibrain volume (Helfrich-Forster, Yoshii, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Helfrich-Förster et al., 2007a</xref>). We note, in this context, that the l-LNvs do not appear to make significant contributions to endogenous circadian timekeeping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shafer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shafer and Taghert, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yang and Sehgal, 2001</xref>), which is the phenomenon we seek to illuminate here. Despite these limitations, the organizational principles uncovered in this study provide insights into clock network organization and are sure to generate a significant number of testable hypotheses regarding network function (see below).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Connectomic classes of LN clock neuron mirror previously proposed functional and molecular LN sub-groups</title><p>The lateral neuron classes are critical to maintain endogenous circadian rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Helfrich-Förster, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Renn et al., 1999</xref>). An examination of genetic mosaics suggested that, within the LNs, the PDF expressing LNvs drive the morning peak of daily activity, whereas PDF negative LNds and 5th LNv drive the evening peak, leading to the designation of the former neurons as ‘Morning (M) Cells’ and the latter as ‘Evening (E) Cells’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grima et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Stoleru et al., 2004</xref>).

Furthermore, the 5th LNv shares connectivity patterns, neuropeptide expression, and features of cellular anatomy with one of the Cry-expressing LNds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schubert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yao and Shafer, 2014</xref>). Our connectomic analysis further supports the conclusion that the 5th LNv is an LNd-like clock neuron that bears little resemblance, functionally or anatomically, to the PDF expressing s-LNvs.</p><p>Functional and anatomical analysis suggests that the LN neurons can be divided into four functional classes, M, E1, E2, and E3 and that the patterns of strong connectivity displayed by the LNs are in striking concordance with these divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yao and Shafer, 2014</xref>). Our connectomic analysis indicates that the functional differences characterizing these four groups of neurons appear to be written in the connectome: each receives a unique combination of strong synaptic inputs and, in turn, forms strong synaptic connections onto distinct postsynaptic targets. These results suggest that the functional subsets of LNs likely drive distinct behavioral and physiological outputs, rather than converging onto the same premotor, sleep, or endocrine centers.</p><p>In addition, our analysis supports the existence of an additional subgroup within the LNs, suggesting that the Cry-negative E3 class likely consists of two subgroups: LNd2 and LNd3, which share a large proportion of their strong synaptic inputs and outputs, and LNd1, which shares significantly fewer strong connections with the other two Cry-negative LNds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>). Placing LNd1 into its own LNd subgroup aligns our connectomic LN divisions with a recent transcriptomic analysis of the clock neuron network that divided the LNds into four clusters: The two sNPF and Cry expressing LNds (LNd4 and LNd5, i.e. E1), the single ITP and Cry expressing LNd (LNd6, i.e. the E2 LNd), two NPF expressing LNds lacking Cry expression, and a single Cry-negative LNd that lacks NPF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ma et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The M group forms very few synaptic connections with other identified clock neuron classes in the hemibrain dataset</title><p>The s-LNvs of the M group, though they form medium strength connections with one another, are almost completely isolated from the other identified clock neurons within the hemibrain dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2H</xref>). Though this picture may ultimately underestimate of inter-clock connectivity if the strong shared SLP targets of M output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) are determined to be the DN1ps currently missing from the annotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).

However, strong DN1p to s-LNv connections are lacking even if we consider the three strong M cell targets, the SLP316s, to be missing DN1ps, as these form synapses on DN1ps and LPNs, but not the M group. Remarkably, there are no synaptic connections between the M and E1 groups, the latter of which was differentiated from E2 by the tight coupling of E1 molecular clocks to those of the M group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yao and Shafer, 2014</xref>). Thus, the strong coupling of M and E1 may take place through non-synaptic connections, consistent with recent work suggesting that the M group mediates its influence over endogenous timekeeping via non-synaptic signaling mechanisms, most likely via the non-synaptic release of PDF peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fernández et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yasuyama and Meinertzhagen, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Compared to the other LN subgroups, the M group forms the smallest number of synaptic connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

E2 LNds also receive strong synaptic inputs from DN1as and DN1ps and form strong connections with one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reinhard et al., 2022a</xref>). This strong synaptic connectivity with other clock neurons may provide an explanation for the observation that the E2 group fails to synchronize its molecular clock with the M group when the clocks of the latter cells are slowed down, despite expressing the receptor for the M group’s major circadian output peptide PDF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yao and Shafer, 2014</xref>). Synaptic communication from non-M pacemakers may prevent E2 clocks from synchronizing with those of the M cells.</p><p>Like the strong shared synaptic targets of E1 LNds, the majority of E2 strong output targets do not synapse onto identified clock neurons. But, in contrast to E1, the minority of E2 targets that do form strong connections with identified clock neurons do so more broadly than clock recurrent E1 targets, forming strong synaptic connections onto the M group, E2, and the LPNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Though not as numerous as the synaptic partners of E1, E2 forms many more synaptic connections than either M or E3, and together E1 and E2 make up the bulk of synaptic output from the LN classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Thus, there appear to be two major circadian output conduits from the LN clock neurons within the hemibrain volume, one of which is tightly coupled to the M group and the other whose output is likely more strongly shaped by other clock neuron classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yao and Shafer, 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>The E3 group is characterized by a pattern of strong synaptic output that is distinct from E1 and E2 and is synaptically isolated from other identified clock neurons</title><p>The E3 LNds are distinct from the E1 and E2 groups, in that they form approximately half the number synaptic connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). While clearly distinct from E1 and E2, the E3 group displays some similarity to the M group with respect to its connectivity to identified clock neurons in the hemibrain, forming very few connections with other clock classes while being interconnected by medium strength connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Among the identified clock neurons in the hemibrain, the strong output targets of E3 make strong reciprocal connections back to E3, but not to other identified clock neuron classes, though they do form a few medium strength connections onto LPNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). This sets E3 clearly apart from the other LN groups, all of which have strong synaptic targets that form strong synapses onto other clock neuron classes (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6E</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>). Thus, the E3 group appears to be uniquely isolated from other identified clock neuron classes for both direct and indirect synaptic connectivity.</p><p>The E3 group is unique among the LN clock neurons by virtue of its lacking CRY and PdfR expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Im et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yoshii et al., 2008</xref>) and is therefore thought to be relatively isolated from both light/dark cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yoshii et al., 2010</xref>) and PDF released from the LNvs. Indeed, the E3 group entrains its molecular clocks more readily to environmental temperature cycles than to light cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yoshii et al., 2010</xref>) and does not synchronize with PDF expressing LNvs with slowed clocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yao and Shafer, 2014</xref>). A close examination of E3 output pathways and the extent to which they converge or fail to converge on endocrine, sleep, and premotor centers will offer important insights into how light and temperature are integrated by the circadian system to entrain to environmental cycles of both light and temperature, the latter of which lag behind the former in natural environments.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Neurons without endogenous molecular clocks are likely integral to the central circadian pacemaker network</title><p>The LN clock neuron classes are critical nodes of circadian timekeeping and are predicted to communicate directly with endocrine, sleep, and premotor centers to drive circadian outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cavey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">King and Sehgal, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Potdar and Sheeba, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shafer and Keene, 2021</xref>) and with other clock neuron classes to coordinate network timekeeping (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmad et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, the LN classes are assumed to synapse upon other clock neurons to promote an endogenous sense of time and upon non-clock neurons to mediate daily changes in physiology and behavior. Our analysis reveals the presence of a third type of LN clock output target, neurons that mediate connections between identified clock neurons (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B and C</xref>).</p><p>All four functional classes of LN (M, E1, E2, and E3) provide strong synaptic outputs onto neurons that, in turn, form strong synaptic connections onto identified clock neurons within the hemibrain volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6E, F</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>). In the case of E1 and E3 much of the strong output recurring to the clock neuron network is reciprocal. For example, the strong targets of E1 outputs preferentially form strong connections back onto E1 LNds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). For all four groups of LN, strong outputs recurring to the clock network form either strong or medium strength synapses on the LPNs, implicating this class as a particularly rich hub for polysynaptic inter-clock connectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6E</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reinhard et al., 2022a</xref>).</p><p>Most of the neurons forming strong but indirect connections between identified clock neurons bear no resemblance to known clock neurons and are unlikely therefore to express the molecular circadian clock (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B and C</xref>). This finding suggests the need to expand our conception of what constitutes the fly’s circadian clock network to include ‘non-clock’ neurons that provide strong synaptic connections between the neurons with endogenous molecular circadian clocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>). What role might such ‘inter-clock-neurons’ play within a circadian network? Networks underlying central pattern generators might offer clues.</p><p>Many central pattern generator networks consist of neurons both with and without endogenous pacemaking activity (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marder et al., 2005</xref>). In such networks, connections between pacemaker neurons and follower neurons profoundly shape the time-course of rhythmic outputs, increase the precision of the central pattern generator, and provide a means for adjusting the phasing of its outputs (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nadim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Purvis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Selverston and Miller, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Weaver et al., 2010</xref>). Given the distributed daily phases of neural activity displayed by the various classes of clock neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liang et al., 2016</xref>), the circadian pace-making network represents a central pattern generator, albeit a lumberingly slow one. We hypothesize that the ‘inter-clock neurons’ we've identified here (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B and C</xref>) play significant roles in the determination of the circadian system’s endogenous period, precision, and phasing of rhythmic outputs, much like the follower neurons of central pattern generators described above.</p><p>This testable hypothesis is just one of many that emerge from the comprehensive view of clock connectomics afforded by the hemibrain dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>).

neurons, the small ventral lateral neurons, and the dorsal lateral neurons. The study reveals high heterogeneity of the dorsal lateral neurons and the potential involvement of non-clock neurons that might act as inter-clock neurons. The manuscript will be of interest to chronobiologists and neuroscientists working on neuronal networks and it provides new insights into circadian clock network organization that may be of general value. The data analysis is rigorous, and the conclusions are justified by the data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79139.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Desplan</surname><given-names>Claude</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0190ak572</institution-id><institution>New York University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Helfrich-Förster</surname><given-names>Charlotte</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00fbnyb24</institution-id><institution>University of Würzburg</institution></institution-wrap><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.03.02.482743">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.02.482743v3">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

We ask you to take into consideration all the editorial suggestions from reviewer #1 and Reviewer #2 and make sure to help the reader with a complex paper.</p><p>The list of comments is long and extensive but will improve the paper significantly and should be feasible in a few weeks without further experiments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Although it is impossible to avoid abbreviations, these should be reduced to a minimum. For example, all words that are used less than 5 times should not be abbreviated (e.g., CPG). I also recommend talking about CRY-positive or CRY-negative clock neurons instead of CRY+ and CRY- clock neurons (the same applies for PDF-positive and -negative neurons).</p><p>In many figures, the lettering is too small, and/or gray letters are used instead of black ones. This makes reading very difficult. Similarly, many drawings of individual neurons are too small, and lines are too faint or too thin. This needs general improvement.

Indeed, subsequent papers from this lab just called it 5th LN.

It may be helpful to enlarge Figure 3D (perhaps even as an extra Figure) and not only include the synaptic connections between the 6 LNds in this figure but also add their neuropeptide/transmitter expression. In the text, it might help to combine the description of neuropeptide expression (lines 240-243) with neuropeptide/neurotransmitter expression (lines 253-258). Furthermore, it might help to mention PDF-receptor expression already earlier together with CRY-expression (lines 231-233).</p><p>I also wonder, why ITP as neuropeptide of the 5th LN is only mentioned here (line 243) not already earlier when the 5th LN was initially described.</p><p>Figure 3C: The green dots representing inter LNd contacts cannot be seen, even not when amplified to 200%.

Some of the clock neurons, including LNds, send axons in the dorsal brain that go through the midline and end in the other hemisphere (see papers from C Helfrich-Forster).

I found this paper hard to evaluate. It does not rely on newly obtained data, only on the analysis of existing information. I am not an expert in EM data analysis and do not know if the analysis employed here is particularly sophisticated. Even relatively simple analysis could in principle be OK if it leads to significant biological insight. In this case, there are some ideas that are proposed but are not tested, so it is difficult to know what the value of the paper will be in the future. I could see it being relevant for people in the circadian field, but the authors should convince us by experimentally testing at least one of the predictions generated by their analysis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79139.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Although it is impossible to avoid abbreviations, these should be reduced to a minimum.
