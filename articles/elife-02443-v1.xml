During DNA replication, nucleosomes are disrupted and re-assembled with newly synthesized histones and DNA. Despite much progress, it is still unclear why higher eukaryotes contain multiple core histone genes, how chromatin assembly is controlled, and how these processes are coordinated with cell cycle progression. We used a histone null mutation of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> to show that histone supply levels, provided by a defined number of transgenic histone genes, regulate the length of S phase during the cell cycle. Lack of de novo histone supply not only extends S phase, but also causes a cell cycle arrest during G2 phase, and thus prevents cells from entering mitosis. Our results suggest a novel cell cycle surveillance mechanism that monitors nucleosome assembly without involving the DNA repair pathways and exerts its effect via suppression of CDC25 phosphatase String expression.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02443.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02443.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02443.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>As a cell prepares to divide, it goes through four distinct stages. First, it grows in size (G1 phase); next it copies its entire DNA content (S phase); then it grows some more (G2 phase); and, last, it splits into two new cells (M phase).</p><p>During S phase, groups of histone proteins that normally stick together to tightly package the DNA are pulled apart in order to make the DNA accessible for copying. After the DNA has been duplicated, both copies of the DNA strand need to be repackaged. Therefore, after copying the DNA the cell rapidly reassembles the DNA–histone complexes (called nucleosomes), using a combination of old and newly synthesized histones to do so. A cell can adjust how quickly it copies DNA according to the availability of these histone proteins, which is important because copying DNA without the resources to package it could expose the DNA to damage.</p><p>Here, Günesdogan et al. investigate how a cell controls these processes using a mutant of the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> that completely lacks the genes required to make histones.

However, these cells can still copy all their DNA, despite being unable to package it, so the higher risk of making mistakes is not enough to stop S phase. In fact, indications suggest that DNA damage detection methods continue to work as normal in cells without histones: these cells can get all the way to the end of G2 phase without any problems.</p><p>To go one step further and start splitting in two, a cell needs to switch on another gene, called <italic>string</italic> in the fruit fly and CDC25 in vertebrates, which makes an enzyme required for the cell division process. Normal cells switch on <italic>string</italic> during G2 phase, but cells that lack histones do not—and therefore do not enter M phase. Günesdogan et al. show that turning on <italic>string</italic> by a genetic trick is sufficient to overcome this cell cycle arrest and drive the cells into M phase. <italic>String</italic> could therefore form part of a surveillance mechanism that blocks cell division if DNA–histone complexes are not assembled correctly.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02443.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02443.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>chromatin assembly</kwd><kwd>cell cycle control</kwd><kwd>histones</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Günesdogan</surname><given-names>Ufuk</given-names></name><name><surname>Herzig</surname><given-names>Alf</given-names></name><name><surname>Jäckle</surname><given-names>Herbert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001645</institution-id><institution>Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Günesdogan</surname><given-names>Ufuk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Marie Sklodowska-Curie fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Günesdogan</surname><given-names>Ufuk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Controlling cell cycle progression in a developing embryo directly depends on de novo histone supply and a specialized surveillance mechanism for nucleosome assembly.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chromatin assembly during DNA replication is crucial for the repackaging of newly synthesized DNA and for maintaining or erasing histone modifications. During this process, pre-existing or so-called parental histones are recycled and assembled into nucleosomes together with de novo synthesized histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alabert and Groth, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Annunziato, 2012</xref>). To compensate for the high demand of histone proteins during DNA replication, the canonical histones H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, which are encoded by multiple gene copies in higher eukaryotes, are highly and exclusively expressed in S phase of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marzluff et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The assembly of chromatin is mediated by an interplay of components of the DNA replication machinery and histone chaperones, which mediate the deposition of histones into nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alabert and Groth, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Annunziato, 2012</xref>). Apparently, the pace of DNA synthesis is tightly coupled to the assembly of newly synthesized DNA into chromatin. Multiple studies showed that the depletion of the histone chaperones Asf1 and CAF-1 results in a slow down of DNA synthesis during S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoek and Stillman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ye et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nabatiyan and Krude, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Groth et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Takami et al., 2007</xref>) preceding the accumulation of DNA damage in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoek and Stillman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ye et al., 2003</xref>). Also, diminishing histone supply during S phase through knock down of SLBP, which is required for histone mRNA stability and translation, decreases the rate of DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhao et al., 2004</xref>). A recent study that targeted SLBP together with FLASH, a factor that is required for histone mRNA transcription and processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barcaroli et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yang et al., 2009</xref>), revealed that replication fork progression depends on nucleosome assembly potentially through a mechanism based on a feedback from the histone chaperone CAF-1 to the replicative helicase and/or the unloading of PCNA from newly synthesized DNA upon nucleosome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Groth et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mejlvang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The coupling of replication fork progression and nucleosome assembly might compensate for short-term fluctuations in histone availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mejlvang et al., 2014</xref>). However, it is still unclear whether chromatin integrity is monitored after or during DNA replication. Genome integrity during S phase is governed by the ATR/Chk1 and ATM/Chk2 checkpoint mechanisms that sense replication stress and DNA damage, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bartek and Lukas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cimprich and Cortez, 2008</xref>). Lack of CAF-1 or Asf1 function leads to accumulation of DNA damage and activation of the ATM/Chk2 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoek and Stillman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ye et al., 2003</xref>). These findings led to the hypothesis that chromatin assembly is monitored indirectly through accumulation of DNA lesions in response to stalled replication forks. However, since these chaperones have multiple functions such as unwinding of DNA during replication, in DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaillard et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Green and Almouzni, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schöpf et al., 2012</xref>) as well as other nuclear processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Quivy et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Houlard et al., 2006</xref>). These multiple functions of these chaperones make it difficult to assess the direct effects of defective chromatin assembly.</p><p>Taking advantage of a histone null mutation in a higher eukaryote that recently became available in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Günesdogan et al., 2010</xref>), we directly addressed the requirement of canonical histone supply for DNA replication and cell cycle progression in a developing organism. By reintroducing a defined number of transgenic histone genes into the histone null mutant background, we show that the rate of DNA replication is coupled to the number of histone genes present in the genome and that histone supply is critical to coordinate S phase length with the developmental program. Surprisingly, cells that completely lacked de novo histone synthesis replicate DNA at a reduced rate, but complete S phase and arrest in cell cycle without accumulating DNA damage. This cell cycle arrest is mediated by suppressing the accumulation of transcripts encoding the CDC25 phosphatase String and provides evidence for a chromatin assembly surveillance mechanism that is independent of the known S phase checkpoints.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The histone null mutation in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, called <italic>Df(2L)His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup>, lacks all genes encoding the canonical histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Günesdogan et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>Df(2L)His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> homozygous mutant animals (hereafter referred to as <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutants) that are derived from heterozygous parents contain only maternal histone mRNA and proteins, which are sufficient to complete the first 14 cell division cycles of the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Günesdogan et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutant embryos arrest before the onset of mitosis in cycle 15 (M<sub>15</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Günesdogan et al., 2010</xref>). This highly uniform phenotype is likely due to the degradation of maternal histone mRNAs during the first G2 phase of embryogenesis in cell cycle 14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marzluff et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">O'Farrell et al., 1989</xref>) combined with the complete lack of zygotic histone gene expression during S phase of cell cycle 15 (S<sub>15</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Günesdogan et al., 2010</xref>). In order to verify that the lack of histone transcription also results in a diminished pool of histone proteins in S<sub>15</sub>, we compared the protein levels of histone H2B and H3 of wild type embryos that are in S<sub>15</sub> at 4–5 hr after egg laying (AEL) to sorted <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutant embryos that are still in S<sub>15</sub> at 5.5–6.5 hr AEL (see below and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Günesdogan et al., 2010</xref>) by quantitative Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). The approximate twofold reduction in the histone levels of <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutant embryos is consistent with the fact that these embryos lack synthesis of new histones in S<sub>15</sub> but still contain parental histones from chromatin that was assembled during cycle 14.

Consistent with this, we did not observe degradation of the mitotic Cyclin A or assembly of mitotic spindles in <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). To assess DNA replication in S<sub>15</sub>, we used BrdU incorporation assays to label newly synthesized DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The results show that most cells of <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutant embryos entered S<sub>15</sub>, but the spatial pattern of replicating cells was different from the highly stereotyped wild type pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>). In wild type embryos, about 5 hr AEL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,E</xref>), the ventral epidermal cells incorporated BrdU in S<sub>15</sub>, whereas the lateral cells entered G2<sub>15</sub> and stopped BrdU incorporation. Dorsal epidermal cells had already passed through M<sub>15</sub> and incorporated BrdU in S<sub>16</sub>. In contrast, the <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutant cells failed to reach G2<sub>15</sub> and the majority of the cells continued to incorporate BrdU at low levels in S<sub>15</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,F</xref>). To test whether the extended S phase of <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutant cells is caused by a reduced rate of DNA synthesis, we shortened the BrdU labelling pulses from 15 to 5 min. In wild type cells, BrdU incorporation was detectable during S<sub>15</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I–K</xref>), whereas in <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutant cells BrdU incorporation was detected only in a few cells with low Cyclin B levels indicating that they were still in early S<sub>15</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L–N</xref>). Notably, in <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutants ventral cells showed a uniform pattern and dorsal cells a punctuate pattern of BrdU incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,H</xref>), which is characteristic for the replication of euchromatin and heterochromatin in early and late S phase, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shermoen et al., 2010</xref>). Although we cannot exclude that the lack of histone synthesis in <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutants interfered with firing of individual origins, the results suggest that both early and late replication origins are activated in <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutants. In conclusion, the absence of de novo histone supply reduces the rate of DNA synthesis shortly after the initiation of DNA replication, resulting in an extended S phase in mutant cells.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02443.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title><italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutant cells extend S phase and slow down DNA synthesis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) Schematic models of Cyclin B accumulation and BrdU incorporation during the embryonic cell cycle (<bold>A</bold>) and its spatial control (<bold>B</bold>).

Wild type embryos and <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutant embryos accumulated phosphorylated GRP protein (pGRP) in response to UVC, showing that the checkpoint response is functional in the mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D</xref>). Without UVC treatment <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutant embryos did not display elevated pGRP levels as compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–H</xref>), which was also verified by Western blotting of extracts from sorted <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutant and wild type sibling embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). In addition, treatment of <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutant embryos with the ATR inhibitor VE-821 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Prevo et al., 2012</xref>) or the Chk1 inhibitor CHIR-124 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tse et al., 2007</xref>) did not result in a release of the cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3 fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplements 3 and 4</xref>). In addition to DSBs, replicative stress can induce phosphorylation of H2Av (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1K–P</xref>), either directly by ATR dependent phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ward and Chen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Joyce et al., 2011</xref>) or through interconversion of single-stranded DNA generated at stalled replication forks into DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cimprich and Cortez, 2008</xref>). Consistent with the notion that the DNA damage checkpoints are functional in <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutant embryos we found accumulation of γH2Av in UVC-treated embryos to levels well above the background levels detected in untreated <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutant embryos in late S<sub>15</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>).

Taken together, these results strongly suggest that <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutant cells complete DNA replication in S phase without inducing significant DNA damage or replication stress and that the cell cycle arrest at the G2/M transition in <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutant cells is not mediated by the conventional S phase checkpoints.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02443.013</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title><italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutant cells do not activate the ATR/Chk1 DNA damage checkpoint.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>D</bold>) Wild type and <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutant cells responded to UV irradiation (UVC) by phosphorylation of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Chk1 ortholog GRP, detected by a phosphospecific antibody for Chk1 (pChk1).

Mitotic progression in wild type embryos follows a stereotyped pattern characterized by (i) Cyclin B degradation and sister chromatid separation at the metaphase to anaphase transition, (ii) spindle elongation at the transition from anaphase-a into anaphase-b, (iii) the onset of chromatin decondensation in telophase, and eventually by (iv) cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6Q</xref>). The <italic>string</italic>-induced mitosis in <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutant embryos was normal up to the metaphase to anaphase transition. During anaphase-b and telophase, however, we observed lagging chromosomes or chromatin bridges in almost all of the cells (95.8%, n = 24).

Together, these data indicate that <italic>string</italic> transcription is indeed the limiting downstream factor that restricts cell cycle progression in the absence of de novo histone synthesis. In summary, our study shows that DNA replication and histone availability are tightly coupled. Lack of de novo histone synthesis causes a <italic>string</italic>-dependent cell cycle arrest in G2 phase, suggesting a novel chromatin assembly checkpoint monitoring chromatin integrity.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We used a recently generated null mutation for canonical histones to address the consequences of histone deprivation during metazoan development. In addition to canonical histones, eukaryotes express histone variants that can replace canonical histones in a specific genomic context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banaszynski et al., 2010</xref>). Our results show that these histone variants do not compensate for the lack of canonical histone synthesis with regard to chromatin assembly and cell cycle progression. This could be due to insufficient expression of variant histones from their endogenous promoters as it has been shown for the variant histone H3.3, which can fully replace its canonical counterpart, histone H3, but only if it is expressed from within a histone gene unit like the canonical histone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hödl and Basler, 2012</xref>). Alternatively, it could reflect structural divergence of the histone variants as in the case of His2Av (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">van Daal et al., 1988</xref>) and dBigH1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Perez-Montero et al., 2013</xref>). It will be interesting to test whether individual histone mutations, like a mutation in H2B which does not have a variant histone in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Talbert et al., 2012</xref>), will cause a similar cell cycle arrest as the histone null mutation <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup>.</p><p>Our results provide evidence that canonical histone supply directly affects the rate of DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L–N</xref>). This observation is in line with studies that targeted either histone chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoek and Stillman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ye et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nabatiyan and Krude, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Groth et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Takami et al., 2007</xref>) or histone mRNA through SLBP or FLASH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhao et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barcaroli et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mejlvang et al., 2014</xref>) to interfere with chromatin assembly in tissue culture cells. However, previous work on SLBP in multicellular organisms revealed pleiotropic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sullivan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lanzotti et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pettitt et al., 2002</xref>). Our data illustrate that an extension of the S phase duration caused by diminished histone supply allows a faithful completion of S phase and transition from G2 into M phase of the cell cycle. This S phase extension is likely to be caused by a direct effect of lowered histone availability on replication fork progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Groth et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mejlvang et al., 2014</xref>) and not by a lack of origin firing, although we cannot exclude this possibility completely. It was previously shown that postblastodermal development in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos proceeds largely uncoupled from progression through cell cycles 14–16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Edgar et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Meyer et al., 2002</xref>). Therefore, histone availability limits S phase duration and appears to be a critical link between cell division and development.</p><p>In the absence of de novo histone synthesis, we find that cells arrest in G2 phase of the cell cycle without activating the known ATM/Chk2 and ATR/Chk1 checkpoints. This observation is in contrast to previous studies on CAF-1, which found that cells arrest in S phase and accumulate DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoek and Stillman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ye et al., 2003</xref>). This discrepancy might in part be explained by the fact that histone chaperones also have a direct function in DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schöpf et al., 2012</xref>); and thus, in the presence of an intact DNA repair/chromatin assembly machinery in <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutants, DNA is replicated without the accumulation of damage, even when histone supply is restricted to the parental load of histones. Alternatively, the accumulation of DNA damage in histone chaperone-depleted cells might be the consequence of a prolonged replication slow down, since it was shown that neither ATM/Chk2 nor ATR/Chk1 are activated as an immediate consequence of histone deprivation but only after prolonged incubation times (&gt;48 hr) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mejlvang et al., 2014</xref>). Based on our DNA quantification experiments, we found that the bulk of DNA replication in <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutants is completed by about 2 hr after entry into S phase, which might differ from the timeframe required to develop significant DNA damage. Interestingly, we find that <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutant cells become TUNEL positive by about 6 hr after they enter S phase 15, which might reflect secondary DNA damage and/or cell death. Nevertheless, we found a moderate increase of γH2Av staining during late S phase in <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutant embryos. Our data indicate, however, that cells that resolved UVC-induced DNA damage, and therefore entered mitosis can do so with levels of γH2Av comparable to those we observe in <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutants. Thus, it is plausible that the slight increase in γH2Av in <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutants could result from incomplete turnover of γH2Av rather than directly reflect DNA damage that could activate the S phase checkpoints. Turnover of γH2Av was shown to require the Tip60 chromatin-remodelling complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kusch et al., 2004</xref>), which may be affected by the altered chromatin structure in <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutants. Alternatively, H2Av was recently shown to be phosphorylated independent of ATM/ATR by the chromosomal tandem kinase JIL-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Thomas et al., 2014</xref>), which may also be influenced by the changed chromatin topology in <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutants.</p><p>Both, the ATM/Chk2 and ATR/Chk1 checkpoints are known to act on CDC25 phosphatases by phosphorylation and protein destabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bartek and Lukas, 2007</xref>) and it was shown in <italic>Drosophila</italic> that <italic>string</italic> transcripts accumulate normally in embryos that suffered from DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Su et al., 2000</xref>). In contrast, we find that <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutant cells fail to accumulate <italic>string</italic> transcripts when arrested in G2. This finding was surprising since it was shown that the temporal and spatial expression pattern of <italic>string</italic> is essentially unchanged in embryos that are arrested in G2 by mutations in <italic>string</italic> or in mitotic Cyclins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Edgar et al., 1994</xref>). Thus, this difference is likely due to the failure of <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutant embryos to assemble chromatin, resulting in a diminished nucleosome density as shown by the presence of excess MNase hypersensitive DNA. Although we cannot rule out that the lower abundance of histone proteins itself directly contributes to the G2 arrest, this possibility seems unlikely since histone levels rapidly decrease in G2 cells where the chromatin assembly surveillance should act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marzluff et al., 2008</xref>). It remains unclear how the presence of unassembled chromatin is linked to the regulation of <italic>string</italic>, but the effect is specific, since <italic>string</italic> transcript accumulation is the only limiting factor to overcome the G2 arrest in <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup>-mutant embryos. The subsequent mitosis in <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutants is completed and cells enter into the next cell cycle. Given that <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutant cells enter mitosis with presumably about half of the nucleosomes present in wild type chromatin, the mitotic defects like lagging anaphase chromosomes appear surprisingly mild. These defects could reflect problems in loading of structural components that are required for chromosome condensation and sister chromatid cohesion, like Cohesins and Condensins, which are proposed to require contact to chromatin rather than naked DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bernard et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nonaka et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tada et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our results suggest that incomplete chromatin assembly is monitored by a novel surveillance mechanism that can block cell cycle progression at the G2/M transition in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.

We quantified the amount of mono-, di- and trinucleosomes for each time point and found that <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutant chromatin is digested significantly more efficient than control chromatin, resulting in a rapid generation of mononucleosomal DNA. Thus, these results indicate that nucleosome density is indeed affected in <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutant cells as reflected in an increased MNase sensitivity. We added this data into an extra figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>) in the text and as a supplementary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure1–figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) Western blot analysis to assess the histone content of HisC mutant cells</italic>.</p><p>We showed previously that <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutant embryos completely lack zygotic transcription of histone mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Günesdogan et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, only the pre-existing (parental) load of nucleosomes is available for chromatin assembly during S phase 15 in HisC mutant embryos, when in wild type zygotic transcription of histone genes commences. To show this, we performed quantitative Western blotting for histone H2B and H3, respectively, using protein lysates from sorted <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutant and wild type embryos. The results show that the histone protein content is about two-fold reduced in <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutant embryos. This result confirms that only parental histones are present in mutant embryos. We added this data into an extra figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) Assess nucleosome density in G2(15)</italic>.</p><p>As described above, we performed MNase experiments and Western blots to determine nucleosome density and histone protein content.</p><p><italic>4) To provide further experimental evidence that G2 arrest is not dependent on ATR/Chk1</italic>.</p><p>Mutations in <italic>grapes</italic> (<italic>grp</italic>), encoding the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog of Chk1, cause developmental defects before cell cycle 15. Thus, one cannot perform experiments to test the involvement of ATR/Chk1 in the cell cycle arrest observed in <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutant embryos by genetic means. As an alternative approach, we performed an immunofluorescence analysis using a phosphospecific antibody that detects phosphorylated and activated GRP protein. Irradiation of <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutant embryos and wild type sibling embryos with UV light, known to induce stress-dependent replication effects, showed detectable levels of phosphorylated GRP. Thus, the ATR/Chk1 checkpoint must be still functional in <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutant embryos. However, untreated <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutant embryos did not exhibit detectable levels of pGRP, which we confirmed by Western blot analysis. As suggested by the reviewers, we also treated <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutant embryos with an ATR inhibitor (VE-821) and Chk1 inhibitor (CHIR-124), respectively, which did not result in a release of the cell cycle arrest in <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutant embryos. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the lack of <italic>de novo</italic> histone supply does not induce replication stress thereby inducing the ATR/Chk1 checkpoint. We added these data in a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> of the manuscript and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1 fig5s2 fig5s3 fig5s4 fig5s5 fig5s6">Figure 5–figure supplements 1-6</xref>.</p><p><italic>5) Additional experiments strengthening String involvement are also highly encouraged</italic>.</p><p>We show that <italic>string</italic> expression is sufficient to overcome the cell cycle arrest in <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutant embryos. If <italic>string</italic> expression would lead to the entry into mitosis, with massively unrepaired or under-replicated DNA, thereby overwriting the still functional DNA damage checkpoints, severe defects in mitosis would be expected (that may even lead to a so called ‘mitotic catastrophe’). We have now carefully documented the mitotic progression in <italic>His</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> mutant cells upon expression of <italic>string</italic> and we found only minor mitotic defects.
