This ability relies on a circuit involving the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), as evidenced by the finding that humans and laboratory animals cannot infer value in several situations when OFC function is impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gallagher et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Izquierdo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McDannald et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Takahashi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">West et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gremel and Costa, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reber et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Howard et al., 2020</xref>). Model-based reasoning can be isolated in sensory preconditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brogden, 1939</xref>). During this task, subjects first learn an association between neutral or valueless stimuli. If one of these stimuli is thereafter paired with a biologically meaningful stimulus (e.g. food), presentation of the never-reward-paired preconditioned stimulus will produce a strong food-approach response. This demonstrates that subjects formed an associative model in which the preconditioned cue predicts the conditioned cue, which can subsequently be mobilized to produce a food-approach response when the preconditioned cue is presented. Because the preconditioned cue itself was never reinforced, this response to the preconditioned cue cannot be explained by model-free mechanisms. Preconditioned responding is reflective of the ability of subjects to infer value on-the-fly using knowledge about the associative structure of the information acquired during preconditioning.</p><p>Previous work from our lab has shown that the lateral OFC activity is necessary for inferring the value of never-reinforced sensory stimuli in the probe test at the end of sensory preconditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jones et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, subsequent single-unit recording showed that neural activity in the OFC reflects not only the value predictions in the final probe test, but also tracks acquisition of the sensory-sensory associations in the initial phase of training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sadacca et al., 2018</xref>). This result suggested a wider role for OFC in building associative models, independent of encoding of overt biological significance or value, the role often ascribed to this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kringelbach, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Padoa-Schioppa, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Levy and Glimcher, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Of course, single-unit recording is correlative and cannot demonstrate that OFC activity is necessary for proper acquisition of the sensory-sensory associations during preconditioning. The correlates could simply reflect activity in primary sensory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Engineer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garrido et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Headley and Weinberger, 2015</xref>) or other cortical areas that are necessary in the first phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Port et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Robinson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Robinson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fournier et al., 2020</xref>). If this is the case, then interference with processing in OFC during preconditioning should not affect responding to the preconditioned cue during the probe test. On the other hand, if the representations of the sensory-sensory associations formed in OFC in the initial phase contribute to building the model of the task used to infer value and drive responding in the probe test, then interference with processing in OFC during preconditioning should affect probe test responding, either directly impairing normal responding to the preconditioned cue, if responding in our task is entirely model-based as we have suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jones et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sadacca et al., 2018</xref>), or by making any responding insensitive to devaluation of the predicted food reward, if responding in the probe is partly maintained by transfer of cached value to the cue during conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Doll and Daw, 2016</xref>). Here we tested for such functional effects by training rats on a sensory preconditioning task nearly identical to those previously used by our lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jones et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sharpe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sadacca et al., 2018</xref>), optogenetically inactivating the lateral OFC during cue presentation in the preconditioning phase of training and adding an additional assessment of responding after devaluation at the end of the experiment. We found that interfering with processing in OFC during the preconditioning phase completely abolished responding to the preconditioned cue in the probe test after conditioning, responding that in controls was subsequently disrupted by devaluation of the expected food reward.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Orbitofrontal cortex activity is necessary for forming sensory associations</title><p>We tested whether the OFC has a causal role in learning about value-neutral associations acquired during sensory preconditioning.

One group, the NpHR experimental group (N = 21), received AAV5 containing halorhodopsin (NpHR) linked to a CamKIIα promoter. NpHR is a light gated chloride pump that induces neuronal hyperpolarization to allow real-time neuronal inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gradinaru et al., 2008</xref>). The other group of rats, the eYFP control group (N = 22), received the same virus but without the opsin. Both viruses contained eYFP for histological verification of successful transfection.

While performance in the final phase of this task is ultimately sensitive to OFC manipulations in both rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jones et al., 2012</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2020b</xref>), the development of neural correlates of neutral sensory associations in the initial phase of training suggested that OFC might not be restricted to encoding information once clear biological significance is established and instead could be more widely involved in representing structure among features of the environment, with value being just one of these features. Here we tested this question by optogenetically-inactivating the OFC during the initial phase of preconditioning, when correlates were previously observed, and we found that this manipulation also disrupted performance in the final phase of the task. These findings are consistent with the argument that the associative correlates we observed during preconditioning in our prior study are not simply downstream reflections of sensory or other cortical processing and instead must contribute to the construction of the model used to guide responding in the final probe test. These data are also in accord with the findings that OFC represents not only value, but also features of the environment such as trial type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lopatina et al., 2017</xref>), sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>), direction, and goal location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Feierstein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mainen and Kepecs, 2009</xref>).</p><p>These results come with several important considerations that are worth discussing. The first is whether OFC inhibition caused the rats to simply generalize between the preconditioned cues. In considering this possibility, we would first note that generalization or failure to treat these cues differently would be to some extent the final common outcome of disrupting the more detailed encoding of their identities and different associative relationships to reward that we argue is affected. For that reason, it is difficult to formally rule this out. However we believe that generalization as a primary cause is unlikely given the low overall levels of responding to these cues during the probe, relative to responses to the reward-paired cue. Additionally, responding to the two preconditioned cues in the experimental group was no different than responding to the preconditioned cue predicting reward in the control group. If generalization alone accounted for the results, we would expect higher levels of responding to both cues during the probe in the OFC-inhibited rats. There is also no evidence from other studies that the OFC is necessary for discriminating the sensory properties of cues; rats without OFC or in whom the OFC is inactivated perform well in a number of settings that require them to distinguish different cues to guide responding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schoenbaum et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boulougouris et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Takahashi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jones et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>A second consideration to discuss is the timing of our manipulation and its specificity. We inhibited OFC only during cue presentation, precisely when we previously observed single unit correlates of cue-cue encoding; our design did not include control conditions in which similar inhibition was done before or after the cues or during the intertrial intervals. Thus, while we can conclude that OFC must be online at the time the neural correlates were observed, we cannot conclude that it does not need to be online at any other time during the first phase. Although OFC can be inactivated briefly between trials without affecting OFC-dependent learning and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Takahashi et al., 2013</xref>), we would not be surprised if processing outside the strictly defined cue period – say immediately before or after – were also necessary for normal learning. Such a result would not invalidate what we have shown here, but it would show that learning is not fully completed during the external sensory events. While defining this critical period would be very interesting, it would require a succession of control groups that we did not deem practical (just after the cues, 20 s after the cues, 40 s after the cues, and so on).</p><p>A third consideration is whether the effect of optogenetic inhibition could reflect something other than the inhibition of the neural correlates demonstrated in our earlier study. While we know from our control group, that simply delivering light during the cue period is not sufficient, perhaps inhibiting OFC neurons during this period distracts the rats, because it is rewarding or punishing or for some other reason. If this were the case, then we would have expected to see an impact of this on learning and responding to these cues in the later periods of the task. We did not see any evidence of this. Further we know from a number of prior studies that brief periods of OFC inhibition, similar to that employed here, often have minimal or no effects on ongoing behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Takahashi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gardner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gardner et al., 2018</xref>). These results suggest this is not, by itself, rewarding, painful or otherwise distracting. Finally, it has been shown that lateral OFC inactivation is not sufficient to produce state-dependent learning, which provides very strong evidence that it does not create a tangible experience in and of itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Panayi and Killcross, 2014</xref>).</p><p>A final consideration is that all rats received food cup approach shaping prior to preconditioning. It is possible that this changes the salience of the conditioning chamber context and causes increased attention to the cues during preconditioning, which may facilitate learning. If this is the case, then one interpretation of the current findings would be that OFC is necessary for normal acquisition of the associations during preconditioning because it contributes to this boost in attention, perhaps secondary to a role in processing the value of the context, rather than contributing to the encoding itself. This idea would be consistent with results showing correlates of risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">O'Neill and Schultz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ogawa et al., 2013</xref>), uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">van Duuren et al., 2009</xref>) and salience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ogawa et al., 2013</xref>) in OFC neurons, as well as the finding that OFC value coding is attentionally gated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McGinty et al., 2016</xref>) and active in auditory oddball task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nguyen and Lin, 2014</xref>). However, while it is possible that inactivating OFC affected learning of the sensory-sensory associations by interfering with a primary role for OFC in supporting the context or even cue salience, it seems more parsimonious to us to propose that the role OFC plays in supporting salience is secondary to the associative learning role that OFC clearly supports. This idea is consistent with attentional models, both old and new, that link cue salience to associative strength – changes in cue associative strength drive changes in salience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mackintosh, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pearce and Hall, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haselgrove et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Esber and Haselgrove, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Of course, we do not intend to suggest that OFC is the only area that is necessary for this sort of value-neutral sensory learning. This is surely not the case. Indeed even when preconditioning is the readout, we know that interfering with several cortical areas including hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Port et al., 1987</xref>), retrosplenial cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Robinson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Robinson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fournier et al., 2020</xref>), and perirhinal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Holmes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wong et al., 2019</xref>) seems to impair the acquisition of sensory-sensory associations. While most cortical and subcortical areas encode variables relevant to predicting biologically-relevant outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Milad and Quirk, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burgos-Robles et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kennerley et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai and Padoa-Schioppa, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burgos-Robles et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Giustino et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Giustino et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Halladay et al., 2020</xref>), few studies look at whether the same areas track incidental sensory-sensory associations. Perhaps correlates like those observed in the OFC are ubiquitous; since the organism does not yet understand whether this information is useful it is encoded and is available for some time to enter into relationships reflecting the function of the area. This account would predict that other cortical areas (e.g. prelimbic, infralimbic, cingulate, retrosplenial) will likely also exhibit correlates of incidental sensory-sensory pairings, like OFC, yet unique single unit responses would not be apparent until the probe test, when subjects must infer specific information about the preconditioned cues based on new information acquired during conditioning. Indeed, fMRI correlates of cue-cue learning were observed in precentral gyrus, middle occipital gyrus, insula, and hippocampus in a human sensory preconditioning task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2020a</xref>), and single unit correlates also exist in nucleus accumbens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cerri et al., 2014</xref>). Along similar lines, OFC might contribute something to how the sensory-sensory associations are laid down that is necessary for their subsequent recall for use in the probe test, when it involves appetitive responding, while not being involved more generally in all forms of sensory associations. This could be assessed with fear conditioning.</p><p>Lastly we would note that while preconditioned responding has been shown as sensitive to extinction of the conditioned cue in fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rizley and Rescorla, 1972</xref>) as well as to aversive conditioning when the conditioned cue is a tastant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Blundell et al., 2003</xref>), sensitivity of the preconditioned response to devaluation of the reward predicted by the conditioned cue is novel. This result is important because, while it is conciliant with a mechanism whereby preconditioned responding reflects inference about food in the probe test, it is less consistent with other mechanisms whereby the preconditioned cue has been proposed to acquire value directly through so-called mediated learning in the conditioning phase. Such directly acquired value should leave residual responding that is resistant to devaluation. We did not see any evidence of this, consistent with prior work showing that preconditioned cues trained as we have done here do not acquire value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sharpe et al., 2017</xref>). The demonstration of the devaluation sensitivity of this response nicely supports our contention that its OFC-dependence, both here and in prior work, reflects the role of OFC in using the underlying associative model to infer the likely delivery of food.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Fifty-four adult male (n = 31) and female (n = 23) Long-Evans rats age three to four months weighing between 270–320 g during the time of experiments were individually housed and given ad libitum food and water except during behavioral training and testing.

One day prior to behavioral training rats were food restricted to 12 g (males) or 10 g (females) of standard rat chow per day, following each session. Rats were maintained on a 12 hr/12 hr light/dark cycle and tested during the light phase between 8:00 am and 12:00 pm five days per week. Experiments were performed at the National Institute on Drug Abuse Intramural Research Program, in accordance with NIH guidelines.

Auditory cues consisted of a pure tone, siren, 2 Hz clicker, and white noise, each calibrated to 70 dB.

Rats were infused with 1.0 μL of virus at a flow rate of 0.2 μL/minute, and injectors were subsequently left in place for five additional minutes to allow for diffusion of solution. Halorhodopsin (NpHR), a light gated chloride pump that induces neuronal hyperpolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gradinaru et al., 2008</xref>), was used for OFC inhibition.

NpHR rats received AAV5-CaMKIIα-eNpHR-eYFP (titer ~ 10<sup>12</sup>) (Gene Therapy Center, University of North Carolina Chapel Hill).

for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Michael Frank as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Sensory preconditioning has been a powerful behavioral tool for exploring how, when and where model based associative structures are stored in the brain. In the present experiment, a natural follow-up to a recent study by Sadacca et al., (2018), the authors explore a single outstanding issue relating to whether neural encoding of valueless associations at the time of preconditioning are actually necessary for subsequent associative value transfer to non-conditioned cues. The broader issue here is whether OFC is a specialized economic structure or whether it plays a more general role in linking information about outcomes to options. Here they use the temporal specificity of optogenetics, activating halorhodopsin to inhibit the activity of OFC neurons only when the two unconditioned cues are presented. They report that inhibition during this period abolishes subsequent responding to the unconditioned cue, indicating that OFC inhibition blocked cue-cue learning. A subsequent experiment using only the control animals, showed that devaluing the US was associated with reductions in responding confirming that model-based associations formed during sensory preconditioning are dependent on OFC.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This is an elegant albeit short report that will be of interest to many in the field but mostly as an important control to a larger body of work. There are, however, a couple of places where the manuscript could use some work, most notably in clarifying what the authors think the mechanisms of sensory preconditioning are and confounds relating to the design.</p><p>1) The authors only delivered laser light to inhibit OFC neurons during the 10 seconds where the two cues were presented together. This makes perfect sense as they were aiming to understand how disrupting OFC at this point impacts learning. A question then logically follows; is it the case that disrupting OFC for this length of time, irrespective of when during the preconditioning phase is sufficient to disrupt associative learning? Put simply, if 10 seconds of laser light was delivered during the ITI in the preconditioning phase, is this sufficient to disrupt learning/retention of the cue-cue associations? I'm not asking for an extra experiment here, but this should be acknowledged in the discussion as it speaks to the role of OFC in both learning AND/OR retention of cue-cue associations.</p><p>2) The discussion of attention in the learning of cue-cue value associations should be expanded as this is the key take away from the paper. Cues that the rats did not expect to be presented are likely learned about as they are attentionally salient. More of a discussion of the role of OFC in attentionally salient events and interaction with other areas feels more than a little appropriate here. For instance, OFC is known to be modulated during odd-ball tasks through input from the basal forebrain (Nguyen and Lin, 2014) and more recently work in primates has started to reveal that OFC encoding of value is attentionally gated (McGinty, et al., 2015). Similarly, how does this speak to learning models based on attention such as the Pearce-Hall model?</p><p>3) The paper is brief and relies on a small amount of data. From what I can tell, the key analysis is Figure 2C, which is described in subsection “Orbitofrontal cortex activity is necessary for forming sensory associations”. The thing I don't totally get is that the finding relies on a positive effect in the control condition and a null effect in the experimental condition (subsection “Orbitofrontal cortex activity is necessary for forming sensory associations”). Strictly speaking, this is invalid – the difference between significant and non-significant is not in itself significant (it can be and often is, but isn’t necessarily so, Nieuwenhuis, Forstmann and Wagenmakers, 2011). This is especially important to address because the control effect is marginally significant (p=0.046). Anyway, it looks like it probably is significant, but that ought to be reported. (Another reviewer during consultation surmised that you did do this analysis but they weren't quite sure &quot;It looks like they have computed the interaction term and reported it 'however, there was a significant cue x group interaction (F(1,41)=4.57, p=0.04).'&quot;.</p><p>4) The second issue is that a disruption of effect, while it does demonstrate causality, has multiple possible interpretations. It could be that the optogenetic effect is, like, super-distracting, or causes a headache or something, and that causes the animal to get distracted and not do very well on the task. There are probably ways to deal with this concern, like showing other things that aren't disrupted. But in this case, I want to see that because we don't want to assume causality from any abolition of effect.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59998.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This is an elegant albeit short report that will be of interest to many in the field but mostly as an important control to a larger body of work.

In response to this feedback, we have added considerable discussion of caveats, experimental design, elaboration on statistics, and expanded discussion of psychological processes that could mediate sensory preconditioning. We have also made minor changes to improve clarity – namely a change in the Title and added description of the experimental and control groups. In addition to this we have softened some of the language to reflect that it is now more established that OFC is not only engaged in value-guided learning and behavior, as a reviewer noted. Below we give our point-by-point responses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The authors only delivered laser light to inhibit OFC neurons during the 10 seconds where the two cues were presented together.

Although we realize the ITI control is typical, we did not include it in the current study because we did not believe it was necessary. Briefly there are several reasons we felt this way. For starters, as the reviewers note, we chose our time period based on the identification of very specific neural correlates; the most direct way to disrupt these is to inactivate during these correlates. While it is straightforward to propose that inactivating in other time periods should not have any effect if our hypothesis is correct, it seems to us that this is not really correct. That is, inactivating in other periods – say right before or after the cues? – might also affect consolidation or other processes required for the learning. Yet this result would not invalidate the importance of our positive result from inhibition during the cue period. For this reason, we felt it was not critical to testing our hypothesis.</p><p>We also viewed the standard middle-of-the-ITI inhibition as a relatively trivial negative control in this particular situation, since the ITIs are several minutes long, and we already know from other studies that similar short periods of inactivation of OFC can be conducted without affecting learning and behavior. For example, in a Pavlovian over-expectation task we showed that inactivation during a period where OFC showed key neural correlates affected learning and behavior, whereas inactivation a couple of minutes later in the ITI did not.</p><p>Nevertheless, we realize that this concern will be shared by other readers, so we have added the below to the Discussion section to better explain the rationale behind this aspect of our experimental design:</p><p>“A second consideration to discuss is the timing of our manipulation and its specificity. We inhibited OFC only during cue presentation, precisely when we previously observed single unit correlates of cue-cue encoding; our design did not include control conditions in which similar inhibition was done before or after the cues or during the intertrial intervals. Thus, while we can conclude that OFC must be online at the time the neural correlates were observed, we cannot conclude that it does not need to be online at any other time during the first phase. Although OFC can be inactivated briefly between trials without affecting OFC-dependent learning and behavior (Takahashi et al., 2013), we would not be surprised if processing outside the strictly defined cue period – say immediately before or after – were also necessary for normal learning. Such a result would not invalidate what we have shown here, but it would show that learning is not fully completed during the external sensory events. While defining this critical period would be very interesting, it would require a succession of control groups that we did not deem practical (just after the cues, 20s after the cues, 40s after the cues, and so on).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The discussion of attention in the learning of cue-cue value associations should be expanded as this is the key take away from the paper. Cues that the rats did not expect to be presented are likely learned about as they are attentionally salient. More of a discussion of the role of OFC in attentionally salient events and interaction with other areas feels more than a little appropriate here. For instance, OFC is known to be modulated during odd-ball tasks through input from the basal forebrain (Nguyen and Lin, 2014) and more recently work in primates has started to reveal that OFC encoding of value is attentionally gated (McGinty, et al., 2015). Similarly, how does this speak to learning models based on attention such as the Pearce-Hall model?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this is a potentially important point, and we have expanded our Discussion section to try to address it more fully. As we note in the below, we recognize the evidence that the OFC is involved in and perhaps contributes to cue salience. However while we cannot rule disruption of this function out as the primary cause of our effect, it seems more parsimonious to us to propose that any such function is secondary to the associative learning role that OFC performs, as evidenced in the neural correlates that normally occur contemporaneous with our period of inhibition. This idea is consistent with ideas from Mackintosh as well as the Esber-Haselgrove successor to the Pearce-Hall and Mackintosh models, which proposes that cue salience varies with associative strength. Thus, our current results could be related to the role of OFC in regulating cue salience, but we would suggest it is because OFC is important for learning the sensory-sensory associations, not the other way around.</p><p>“A final consideration is that all rats received food cup approach shaping prior to preconditioning. It is possible that this changes the salience of the conditioning chamber context and causes increased attention to the cues during preconditioning, which may facilitate learning. If this is the case, then one interpretation of the current findings would be that OFC is necessary for normal acquisition of the associations during preconditioning because it contributes to this boost in attention, perhaps secondary to a role in processing the value of the context, rather than contributing to the encoding itself. This idea would be consistent with results showing correlates of risk (O'Neill and Schultz, 2010; Ogawa et al., 2013), uncertainty (van Duuren et al., 2009) and salience (Ogawa et al., 2013) in OFC neurons, as well as the finding that OFC value coding is attentionally gated (McGinty et al., 2016) and active in auditory oddball task (Nguyen and Lin, 2014). However while it is possible that inactivating OFC affected learning of the sensory-sensory associations by interfering with a primary role for OFC in supporting the context or even cue salience, it seems more parsimonious to us to propose that the role OFC plays in supporting salience is secondary to the associative learning role that OFC clearly supports. This idea is consistent with attentional models, both old and new, that link cue salience to associative strength – changes in cue associative strength drive changes in salience (Mackintosh, 1975; Pearce and Hall, 1980; Haselgrove et al., 2010; Esber and Haselgrove, 2011).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The paper is brief and relies on a small amount of data. From what I can tell, the key analysis is Figure 2C, which is described in subsection “Orbitofrontal cortex activity is necessary for forming sensory associations”. The thing I don't totally get is that the finding relies on a positive effect in the control condition and a null effect in the experimental condition (subsection “Orbitofrontal cortex activity is necessary for forming sensory associations”). Strictly speaking, this is invalid – the difference between significant and non-significant is not in itself significant (it can be and often is, but isn’t necessarily so, Nieuwenhuis, Forstmann, and Wagenmakers, 2011). This is especially important to address because the control effect is marginally significant (p=0.046). Anyway, it looks like it probably is significant, but that ought to be reported. (Another reviewer during consultation surmised that you did do this analysis but they weren't quite sure &quot;It looks like they have computed the interaction term and reported it 'however, there was a significant cue x group interaction (F(1,41)=4.57, p=0.04).'&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We regret that we did not make it clearer that we do report the interaction, as the reviewers surmised. The text has been updated to reflect this:</p><p>“There was a significant cue x group interaction (F<sub>(1,41)</sub>=4.57, <italic>p</italic>=0.04); ergo, the effect of cue during the probe test (A-C) did depend on group (YFP control – NpHR OFC inhibition)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The second issue is that a disruption of effect, while it does demonstrate causality, has multiple possible interpretations. It could be that the optogenetic effect is, like, super-distracting, or causes a headache or something, and that causes the animal to get distracted and not do very well on the task. There are probably ways to deal with this concern, like showing other things that aren't disrupted. But in this case, I want to see that because we don't want to assume causality from any abolition of effect.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this issue but feel it is mitigated by several findings: (1) Identical stimulation in both lateral and medial OFC had no effect on economic choice behavior in our lab. These citations have been added. (2) If the stimulation was painful/aversive, then it would be expected to impair reward learning about these cues, since light occurred during each cue presentation. We observed intact reward conditioning in phase 2, and there was no difference between groups. We also did not see any effect of group during preconditioning when light was delivered. (3) Inactivation of lateral OFC is not sufficient to produce state-dependent learning. These have been added to the Discussion section:</p><p>“A third consideration is whether the effect of optogenetic inhibition could reflect something other than the inhibition of the neural correlates demonstrated in our earlier study. While we know from our control group, that simply delivering light during the cue period is not sufficient, perhaps inhibiting OFC neurons during this period distracts the rats, because it is rewarding or punishing or for some other reason. If this were the case, then we would have expected to see an impact of this on learning and responding to these cues in the later periods of the task. We did not see any evidence of this. Further we know from a number of prior studies that brief periods of OFC inhibition, similar to that employed here, often have minimal or no effects on ongoing behavior (Takahashi et al., 2013; Gardner et al., 2017; Gardner et al., 2018). These results suggest this is not, by itself, rewarding, painful or otherwise distracting. Finally, it has been shown that lateral OFC inactivation is not sufficient to produce state-dependent learning, which provides very strong evidence that it does not create a tangible experience in and of itself (Panayi and Killcross, 2014).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
