Apical protrusion formation of nascent HCs and planar polarity signaling are both important for the Rock and Roll.

The specific pattern for each organ is generated by individual cells or cell types acquiring a defined position before differentiating, which requires a cascade of signaling and fate determination events. However, the molecular mechanisms that link the sequential developmental events from regional patterning to subsequent differentiation are often illusive because of tissue complexity and the long time-span involved in organ formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Edlund and Jessell, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dasen and Jessell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sanes and Yamagata, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Delgado and Lim, 2017</xref>). The neuromast of the lateral line system in zebrafish offers an advantage in this regard since it is a simple organ that develops quickly, yet its function is entirely dependent on the cellular organization of its hair cells (HCs), thus making this organ conducive for deciphering how a rudimentary tissue transitions to a functional unit molecularly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chitnis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ghysen and Dambly-Chaudière, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ghysen and Dambly-Chaudière, 2007</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic of bidirectional hair cell (HC) establishment in the zebrafish neuromast.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The lateral line system in zebrafish showing the top view of an anterior-posterior (A-P) and dorsal-ventral (D-V) neuromast, based on their hair bundle orientation.

(<bold>B</bold>) An approximate developmental time-line of HC formation in zebrafish neuromast. A HC precursor (gray) divides to form two daughter HCs, which roll to exchange positions with each other 50% of the time before differentiating into mature HCs with opposite hair bundle orientation.

(<bold>C</bold>) Emx2, which is important for establishing the bidirectional HC pattern, can be expressed early in the HC precursors, which could affect the HC rearrangement (scenario 1) or later during hair bundle establishment after HCs are formed (scenario 2). A combination of both scenarios is also possible (not shown). Black dots represent the position of the kinocilium.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-60432-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Each neuromast detects water flow in two directions. This property is dependent on the orientation of the stereociliary bundle (also known as the hair bundle) erected on the apical surface of its HC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The hair bundle consists of a number of stereocilia arranged in a staircase pattern that are tethered to the kinocilium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kindt et al., 2012</xref>). Deflection of the hair bundle toward its kinocilium opens the mechanotransduction channels on the tips of the stereocilia and results in activation of the HC, whereas deflection of the hair bundle away from its kinocilium results in HC inactivation. Thus, hair bundles in neuromasts are bidirectionally oriented, aligned along either the anterior-posterior (A-P) or dorsal-ventral (D-V) axis of the body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Flock and Wersäll, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">López-Schier et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism for generating the bidirectional orientation pattern of HCs in the neuromast is not clear but it is attributed to a HC rearrangement process that involves lateral inhibition mediated by Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jacobo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kozak et al., 2020</xref>). As a HC precursor divides to form two daughter HCs in the neuromast, they undergo rearrangement and switch positions with each other approximately 50% of the time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wibowo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mirkovic et al., 2012</xref>), prior to differentiation and hair bundle establishment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Despite the fact that not all HC pairs undergo rearrangement, daughter HCs with hair bundle pointing toward the posterior (A→P) are always located in the anterior position of an A-P neuromast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">López-Schier et al., 2004</xref>). Likewise, HCs with hair bundles that point ventrally (D→V) are located dorsally in a D-V neuromast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The hypothesis that HC rearrangement is required for HCs to acquire their positions within a neuromast, though attractive, has not been tested experimentally.</p><p>Previously, we showed that the bidirectionally oriented HCs within a neuromast is dependent on the transcription factor Emx2. Emx2 is expressed in only one of the siblings within a HC pair (A→P or D→V HCs), in which the hair bundle is oriented at approximately 180° opposite from the Emx2-negative HCs. As a result, the two sibling HCs show opposite hair bundle orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ji et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>Emx2</italic> loss of function (LOF) results in neuromasts with unidirectional hair bundles, P→A and V→D in A-P and D-V neuromasts, respectively. In contrast, e<italic>mx2</italic> gain of function (GOF) neuromasts show only hair bundles in A→P or D→V direction. These results indicate that Emx2 is necessary and sufficient to change hair bundle orientation pattern. However, the timing and mechanism of Emx2’s requirement in this process are not clear. For example, Emx2 could be activated early in the HC precursor stage prior to HC formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kozak et al., 2020</xref>) and be involved in HCs’ positional acquisition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, scenario 1). Alternatively, it could be activated only in one of the sibling HCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jacobo et al., 2019</xref>) and generates the opposite hair bundle orientation after HCs acquired their positions (scenario 2). Either scenario could generate two sibling HCs with opposite bundle orientation pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The implication of the role and regulation of Emx2 under each scenario, however, is different. In the former case, Emx2 needs to be downregulated in one of the sibling HCs, whereas in the latter, Emx2 is preferentially activated in one of the sibling HCs to mediate the opposite hair bundle orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These two scenarios are not mutually exclusive and a combination of the two scenarios is possible as well.</p><p>To distinguish between the two scenarios illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, we identified the onset of Emx2 expression using single-cell RNA seq (scRNA-seq) and investigated HC rearrangement in <italic>emx2</italic> GOF and LOF mutants. We found that the HC rearrangement process could be divided into two phases, a Rock phase, when two sibling HCs rock against each other, and a Roll phase, when HCs switch positions with each other. We also tracked the Emx2-positive HCs during the Rock and Roll process using an <italic>emx2</italic> reporter fish, in which <italic>Gfp</italic> is knocked into the <italic>emx2</italic> locus. Our results show that <italic>emx2</italic> transcripts are detectable as HC precursors transition to nascent HCs and Emx2 functions in the Rock and Roll process prior to hair bundle establishment. Emx2 facilitates the Rock and Roll process by regulating apical protrusion formation of the nascent HCs without impairing the final position of HCs within the neuromast. Thus, we concluded that Emx2’s key function is to change hair bundle orientation within HCs. Blocking apical protrusion with microtubule inhibitor, nocodazole, or the lack of a core planar cell polarity (cPCP) protein, Van gogh like 2 (Vangl2), affected the Rock and Roll process and positional acquisition of HCs. These results indicate that both apical protrusion formation of nascent HCs and the cPCP pathway are essential for HCs to acquire their proper locations to generate the bidirectional orientation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>emx2</italic> transcription initiates during precursor to daughter HCs transition</title><p>To address the role of Emx2 in neuromast HCs, we first investigated the onset of Emx2 expression in the developing neuromast. Emx2 immunoreactivity was first detected in immature HCs before hair bundles are polarized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, #3) and not in HC precursors or nascent HCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, #1 and #2), similar to a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jacobo et al., 2019</xref>). However, immunostaining may not be sensitive enough to detect onset of <italic>emx2</italic> transcription. Indeed, a recent study demonstrated enriched Emx2 transcripts and immunoreactivity in HC precursors using immunostaining, in situ hybridization, and scRNA-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kozak et al., 2020</xref>). These results imply that the downregulation of Emx2 in one of the nascent HCs generated the asymmetry within a pair of HCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To validate these results, we investigated <italic>emx2</italic> transcription within the neuromast HC lineage by analyzing our existing scRNA-seq data (not published previously) generated from fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of neuromast HCs using <italic>myo6:ribotag-Gfp</italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Matern et al., 2018</xref>) at four dpf (days post fertilization).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Emx2 immunostaining in wild-type (WT) (<italic>myo6b:actb1-Gfp</italic>) neuromasts.</title><p>(<bold>A and D</bold>) Merged image of DAPI, (<bold>B and E</bold>) β-actin-GFP, and (<bold>C and F</bold>) anti-Emx2 staining of neuromasts.

Consistent with the DPT analysis, the nascent HC cluster showed significantly higher number of <italic>emx2</italic> read-counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) and percentages of <italic>emx2</italic>-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) than other clusters. Taken together, our scRNA-seq results showed that, similar to previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kozak et al., 2020</xref>), <italic>emx2</italic> transcripts were found within the HC lineage except we found that the transcripts initiate as HCs transitioned from precursors to nascent HCs rather than peaking early in the precursor cell population as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kozak et al., 2020</xref>). The difference between these results is not clear and may be attributed to the difference in the age of the larvae and the number of HCs analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The HC rearrangement process is regulated by Emx2</title><p>The detection of <italic>emx2</italic> transcripts as HC precursors transition to nascent HCs coincides with the reported timing of HC rearrangement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wibowo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mirkovic et al., 2012</xref>).

The reduction in the number of Gfp-positive cells and their mis-localization in the posterior region of the neuromast were no longer evident in larvae from F3 generation. This is most likely due to the reduced ectopic Emx2 expression (based on reporter mCherry expression) in the F3 generation, resulting from reduction in copies of the transgene from chromosomal segregation during cell divisions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

First, based on our scRNA-seq analysis and live-imaging of <italic>emx2:Gfp</italic> reporter activity in control fish, we pinned <italic>emx2</italic> expression to the nascent HC stage well ahead of hair bundle establishment. These expression results support the notion that Emx2 is involved in positional acquisition of HCs. Additionally, the HC rearrangement process, Rock and Roll, was affected in both <italic>emx2</italic> loss- and gain-of-function mutants, thus providing the phenotypic evidence that supports the early onset of <italic>emx2</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). However, our live-imaging results of <italic>emx2:Gfp</italic> HCs in <italic>emx2<sup>Gfp/-</sup></italic> neuromasts unequivocally demonstrated that the lack of Emx2 did not affect HCs’ ability to acquire their respective positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Since Emx2 does not confer positional information to HCs in the neuromast, we inferred that Emx2 mediates the bidirectional hair bundle pattern by changing the position where the hair bundle should be established within the HC. This effect of Emx2 on hair bundle establishment in neuromast HCs is most likely similar to utricular HCs in the mouse inner ear, which requires the heterotrimeric G proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The fact that Emx2 is not required for positional acquisition of HCs raised the question of how Emx2 regulates Rock and Roll. Our results showed that Emx2 regulates Rock and Roll by changing the shape of its nascent HCs, namely by reducing or delaying the apical protrusion formation of its nascent HCs. This delay in protrusion formation was only transient since all mature HCs ultimately formed apical protrusions at the vertex of the neuromast. In <italic>emx2</italic> LOF neuromasts, in which the apical protrusion was robust, HCs appeared to acquire their designated locations quicker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, shorter Rock and Roll duration). In contrast, in <italic>emx2</italic> GOF neuromasts, HCs lacked a clear protrusion and the duration of the Roll phase was longer than controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) and sometimes HCs were mispositioned (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Extrapolating from the Rock and Roll and the 3-D rendering results, we postulate that the lack of apical protrusion from nascent HCs affected a stable attachment at the apical surface of the neuromast resulting in a longer duration of roll and occasional mispositioning of HCs. We further propose that in a normal neuromast, the apical protrusion of the Emx2-negative HC within a HC pair allows it to anchor at the vertex of the neuromast, whereas the non-anchored Emx2-positive HC is guided by the protruded HC for the positional exchange. Thus, the Emx2-negative HC is more important for the normal HC rearrangement process. We concluded that Emx2 functions to delay the apical protrusion of its HC, which contributes to the asymmetry between the two sibling HCs and facilitates the Rock and Roll process. Furthermore, Emx2’s role in regulation of the Rock and Roll is independent of its role in hair bundle establishment since in F3 generation of <italic>emx2</italic> GOF neuromasts, HC positions are mostly normal but the bidirectional hair bundle-pattern is perturbed with most bundles pointing in the A→P orientation.</p><p>Our live-imaging results of <italic>emx2:Gfp</italic>/+ reporter fish showing that the phenomenon of Roll or No Roll being consistent with the need or lack thereof to reposition the nascent Emx2-positive cell provided the direct evidence that HCs acquire their proper locations within the neuromast via the cell rearrangement process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Additionally, the hypothesis that apical protrusion formation in nascent HCs is important for Rock and Roll was further supported by the nocodazole results. The recovery of apical protrusion formation after nocodazole removal was correlated with the positional exchange of sibling HCs and correct positional acquisition, whereas failure to form an apical protrusion after drug removal resulted in the absence of roll movements and subsequent mispositioning of HCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Model of positional acquisition of nascent hair cells (HCs) in the neuromast.</title><p>Unlike scenarios 1 and 2 illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, our results show a model in which an end-stage HC precursor before division expresses low levels of <italic>emx2</italic> (light pink). After the precursor divided, Notch signaling mediated through the Notch ligand (green color) and Notch1a receptor (red color) generates asymmetry between the two sibling HCs. This asymmetry results in stochastic specification of anterior (PIa) and posterior (PIp) positional identity (PI) to sibling HCs, which includes regulation of <italic>emx2</italic> expression. Thus, an <italic>emx2</italic>-positive, Pla-HC formed at the posterior position undergoes positional exchange with its sibling Plp HC, whereaswhen an <italic>emx2</italic>-positive, Pla-HC formed in the anterior position, the two sibling HCs do not exchange positions. In addition to the delay in apical protrusion mediated by Emx2, the Rock and Roll is also regulated by the intercellular core planar cell polarity (cPCP) pathway (asterisk).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-60432-fig10-v2.tif"/></fig><p>What is the underlying mechanism for nascent HCs to acquire their positions within the neuromast since Emx2 is not involved? Accumulating evidence suggests that lateral inhibition via Notch signaling is important. In <italic>notch1a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants, all HCs are Emx2 positive with A→P hair bundle orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jacobo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kozak et al., 2020</xref>). Consistently, constitutive expression of the Notch intracellular domain results in neuromasts with more P→A HCs that are Emx2 negative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jacobo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kozak et al., 2020</xref>). More importantly, nascent HC pairs fail to undergo rearrangement in <italic>notch1a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Erzberger et al., 2020</xref>). Together, these results suggest that Notch signaling confers asymmetry and positional identity (PI) of sibling HCs, which mediates the Rock and Roll (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). This asymmetry includes differential regulation of <italic>emx2</italic>, upregulating <italic>emx2</italic> in the HC with anterior identity (Pla) and inhibiting/blocking <italic>emx2</italic> expression in the HC with posterior identity (Plp), which also contributes to the Rock and Roll.</p><p>Taking together the Notch results and our detection of high <italic>emx2</italic> expression at the nascent HC stage (Figure 3) suggest that the Notch signaling is functioning intercellularly between two sibling HCs. However, if Emx2 is indeed enriched in HC precursors as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kozak et al., 2020</xref>), then the mechanism of Notch signaling on regulating Emx2 would be different and will require the downregulation of <italic>emx2 </italic>in one of the sibling HCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Since expression of Emx2 in both daughter HCs was not observed with immunostaining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kozak et al., 2020</xref>) or with <italic>emx2:gfp</italic> reporter, such downregulation may be quick and may involve asymmetric segregation of Notch determinants during precursor cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Coumailleau et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kressmann et al., 2015</xref>). </p><p>In addition to the Notch signaling, our results indicate that the cPCP pathway is also required for the Rock and Roll process. Emx2 and cPCP are independently regulated and <italic>vangl2</italic> is epistatic to <italic>emx2</italic> in hair bundle establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ji et al., 2018</xref>). However, the cPCP pathway appears to function on multiple levels to generate the bidirectional HC pattern during neuromast development. For example, the cPCP pathway is important for HC precursor division since the axis of precursor division is affected in <italic>vangl2<sup>m209</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mirkovic et al., 2012</xref>). Second, HC pairs that did not undergo roll movements in <italic>vangl2<sup>m209</sup></italic> neuromast do show similar percentages of HCs that were mispositioned as HCs that rolled (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). It is not clear if the mispositioned HCs in the No Roll pairs were caused by the failure of HCs to undergo the Roll phase or the cPCP’s effects in the axis of precursor division or other functions indirectly affected both the Roll and No Roll HC pairs equally. Despite the possibility that the cPCP could function on multiple levels, the analyses of <italic>vangl2<sup>m209</sup></italic> mutants in <italic>emx2:Gfp</italic>/+ reporter background indicates that abnormal Rock and Roll results in HC mispositioning.</p><p>What is the source of cPCP signaling for the HCs? Vangl2 appears to be expressed predominantly in HCs and not supporting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mirkovic et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jacobo et al., 2019</xref>). Since the alignment of supporting cells is not affected in <italic>vangl2<sup>m209</sup></italic> neuromast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Navajas Acedo et al., 2019</xref>), it is likely that the intercellular signaling is occurring among sibling or neighboring HCs.</p><p>In summary, the sequential molecular events that give rise to a functional neuromast unit with bidirectional sensitivity to water flow is emerging. First, the Notch signaling imparts asymmetry between two nascent HCs, which brings the respective Emx2-positive and -negative HCs into position via the Rock and Roll process. While notch-mediated Emx2 is only one of the factors that facilitate this rearrangement process by creating asymmetry between the shape of the two sibling HCs, Emx2’s major function is later, in establishing hair bundle orientation and neuronal selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ji et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, cPCP proteins provide the intercellular signaling cues to maintain hair bundle alignment of HCs within the neuromast.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials

The template DNA was linearized by XbaI and purified using a QIAprep purification column (Qiagen) and 500–1000 ng linearized template was used to synthesize capped RNA using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE T3 kit (Life Technologies) and precipitated using 5 M LiCl and diluted to 500 ng/µl.</p><p>The donor plasmid for targeted reporter gene integration was constructed by assembling donor sequences into pKHR4 vectors (provided by Dr. Hoshijima). eGFP was flanked with left and right homologous arms of approximately 1.0 kb of <italic>emx2</italic> genomic sequences upstream and downstream of the integration site, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Column-purified donor plasmid DNA was further purified to remove all traces of RNase activity by phenol/chloroform extraction, chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation with sodium acetate. Plasmid DNA was dissolved in nuclease-free water, quantified, diluted to 500 ng/μl, and stored at −20°C. Prior to injection into one-cell stage zebrafish embryos, 500 ng of donor plasmid DNA was digested with <italic>I-SceI</italic> enzyme.

Standard quality control steps were used to filter noisy and unreliable cells. Notably, cells with the following descriptions were excluded from the pool: (1) less than 400 unique genes, (2) more than 2500 unique genes, (3) more than 10,000 UMI, and (4) more than 5% mitochondrial genes (indicator of cellular stress). Genes found in at least three cells were included in the analysis. After processing for quality control, 2882 cells were used for subsequent analyses. We followed the basic library size normalization to counts per million and the gene expression matrix was log-transformed before processing for principal component analysis (PCA). Following dimensional reduction, Louvain clustering was applied testing a range of vaules (0.2–2.0 in 0.2 increments) for the resolution.

Approximately one to six neuromasts per animal were sequentially imaged with an automatic stage positioner. Neuromasts containing one to three pairs of mature HCs only were selected for time-lapse recording and samples were imaged using a 63X/NA1.4 oil-immersion objective lens on a spinning-disk confocal system (Ultraview, Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA) or a Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope.

Based on the cell tracking data of nascent HCs undergoing the rearrangement, we determined the duration of the Rock and Roll phases using the following criteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A’</xref>). The initiation of Rock phase was defined as the time immediately after the HC precursor divided. The line drawn between the center of the two HCs at the end of precursor cell division was considered as the horizontal axis, regardless of the position of the precursor within the neuromast. The angle of displacement of the two nascent HCs was within 30° in either direction of this horizontal axis during the Rock phase. When the angle displacement between the two HCs was greater than 30° and continued to increase, it was considered as the beginning of the Roll phase and the end of the Rock phase. When the two HCs rotated 180° to switch positions and the cell–cell contact between the two HCs intersected with the horizontal axis, it was considered as the end of the Roll phase.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Immunofluorescence and phalloidin staining</title><p>For immunostaining, 2.5–5.0 dpf zebrafish larvae were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 3.5 hr at 4°C.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: David W Raible (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript by Ohta and colleagues describes the development of lateral line hair cells and the cellular rearrangements that organize hair cells that will eventually extend oppositely oriented stereociliary bundles so that they are aptly positioned on the anterior or the posterior side of the neuromast. Since the transcription factor Emx2 regulates the orientation of the polarized stereociliary bundle it is hypothesized that Emx2 may similarly regulate hair cell rearrangement. The authors find that Emx2 regulates the development of aspects of hair cell morphology that influence rearrangements but does not appear to regulate the process directly. While all three reviewers found the topic of interest, they all agreed that more work was necessary to convincingly make the points. The necessary revisions are nicely described in the individual reviews, which we hope will be helpful in revising the paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Ohta and colleagues deals with the role of the transcription factor Emx2 in organizing the bidirectional polarity of hair cells of the zebrafish neuromasts. Previous reports by the authors have identified Emx2 as responsible of the establishment of stereociliary bundle orientation in the vertebrate (mouse, chick, zebrafish) inner ear and zebrafish neuromasts. A recent report from Lopez-Schier lab suggests that the cell rearrangement process of nascent hair cell sibling cells to position them in the neuromast might be coupled with differential Emx2 expression to ensure their correct position within the neuromast. In this manuscript, the authors try to follow this question of whether Emx2 is required for sibling cell rearrangement and thus cell positioning or, alternatively, regulates bundle orientation as it does in the inner ear. For this, the authors generate a zebrafish reporter line of Emx2 to follow the expression of Emx2 during the rotation process and they also analyse cell rotation in Emx2 Lof and Gof embryos through life imaging. The authors conclude that while the rotation process is modified in Lof and Gof embryos (duration, phases), Emx2 does not impair the rotation process and thus not determine the position of sibling cells. Live imaging also allowed the authors to see differences in apical protrusions of Emx2-positive and Emx2-negative cells.</p><p>The manuscript is well performed and digs into an interesting question but fails short in their analysis of Emx2 function and whether the rotation of siblings has any meaningful role.</p><p>In general, the manuscript could improve the Introduction and Discussion text to discuss the different scenarios for <italic>emx2</italic> role, role of the rotation, apical protrusion, downstream players of <italic>emx2</italic> for bundle orientation.</p><p>1) By live imaging, the authors describe the % of cells performing cell rearrangement ( 57%) and the percentage that do not (43%) and separate this process into a rock phase and a roll phase (inversion). The authors find that when Emx2 is not expressed (in -/-) or overexpressed, there are differences in the time spent in each phase but cell rearrangement still happens. One would assume that if <italic>emx2</italic> differential expression makes cell´s to rearrange in order to segregate in space the ones positive Emx2 and the ones negative for Emx2 (as observed using the reporter line), no rearrangement would happen if the siblings are equal.</p><p>The authors find that in Lof and Gof embryos, cell rearrangement takes place. As a control it is necessary to show that in these conditions all cells are either positive or negative for Emx2. If still minor differences of Emx2 expression between siblings exist, cell rearrangement might not be blocked for this reason. Is Emx2 overexpression clearly affecting all cells, and Lof? It would be good to have a picture showing Emx2 immunoreactivity or ISH in <italic>emx2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> neuromasts and in Gof embryos.</p><p>In their previous published work (Jiang et al., 2017) they show Emx2 expression in Lof and Gof but at 4 dpf. In this case, I understand that the embryos are younger, at 2-3 dpf. Could the myo6 promoter driving Emx2 for Gof be milder at these stages?</p><p>Most probably the conclusion that Emx2 does not directly regulate cell rearrangement is correct but this additional control would improve the manuscript.</p><p>Another recent paper (Erzberger et al., 2020) has shown that cell rearrangement is impaired when siblings do not have differential activity of Notch pathway. Thus, being Emx2 downstream of Notch, the present results suggest that cell rearrangement mediated but Notch is driven by other downstream factors. The fact that probably Emx2 is not required for cell rearrangement but another factor is interesting.</p><p>2) The analysis with the reporter indicates that GFP appears when cells perform cell rearrangement and is always correlated with the final position cells adopts, if <italic>emx2</italic> positive are in posterior perform cell rearrangement, if are anterior located do not. In Gof, GFP cells can be found mislocated. This is a very nice result.</p><p>3) How the authors envisage that Emx2 regulates apical protrusions and cell shape changes? Can the authors affect apical protrusion formation to see if cell rotation is impaired?</p><p>4) Previously, the authors indicated that in zebrafish utricule and cristae, <italic>emx2</italic> is also involved in hair bundle polarity. I wonder if there a cell rearrangement between siblings also takes place as in the neuromasts. Live imaging in zebrafish inner ear could help to assess whether <italic>emx2</italic> role in the rock and roll process and cell shape is specific of neuromasts organization or has a wider role. Several manuscripts have been published in relation to the cell rearrangement process in the neuromasts and the mechanisms behind it, however, its biological implications if is very particular of this system, might be of low relevance. I think it is more relevant to explore deeply how <italic>emx2</italic> changes bundle orientation.</p><p>5) The authors perform scRNA-seq to trace the <italic>emx2</italic> expressing cells and establish the early expression of this transcription factor. Their analysis does not differ from the scRNAseq analysis and trajectory plot recently published in Kozak et al. and thus as it is presently, it does not add new information. I suggest eliminating this part or, if kept, use it to expand the analysis and perform functional experiments with putative downstream factors present in <italic>emx2</italic> expressing cells that could regulate sterociliary bundle orientation. A deeper study of the implications of <italic>emx2</italic> activity in bundle reorientation would make this manuscript more solid.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Here, the authors find that Emx2 regulates the development of aspects of hair cell morphology that influence rearrangements but does not appear to regulate the process directly. The work is largely descriptive and does not reveal a mechanistic or transcriptional link between Emx2 and hair cell morphology nor does it consider the contribution of other signaling pathways such as PCP signaling which also controls stereociliary bundle orientation in the neuromast. For these reasons it seems an minor advance and is currently not comparable to other articles published in this journal.</p><p>1) It is not clear when hair cell rearrangements occur relative to the formation and polarization of the stereociliary bundle. Are these concurrent or sequential events?</p><p>2) PCP signaling regulates a potentially analogous cellular rotation during ommatidia development in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye. PCP signaling is also essential in the neuromast to align the hair cell stereociliary bundles along a common axis. Thus it seems worthwhile to evaluate how (or if) the Rock and Roll dynamics are altered in PCP mutants.</p><p>3) The authors consistently use verbs such as “reverses” and “changes” to describe Emx2's function in establishing stereociliary bundle orientation in Emx2-positive hair cells. As written this suggests that the stereociliary bundles are actively rotating to assume an new orientation in this population of cells. However there is no evidence in the literature documenting rotation of the nascent bundle. Instead the bundle forms adjacent to the kinocilium and bundle orientation is established by translocation of the kinocilium to the opposite side of Emx2-positive cells that it does in Emx2-negative cells. This point may appear semantic but is actually quite important to keep clear in this context since the process described in the text is also a rotational event.</p><p>4) Sentence starting &quot;Therefore we investigated our existing sc-RNAseq data…&quot; contains a reference to Matern et al. As structured this sentence suggest that “our existing sc-RNAseq data” is that data previously published by Matern et al. yet there is no author overlap. I suspect that the reference is for the fish line and not the RNAseq data and this should be clarified.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Ohta et al. describe roles for <italic>emx2</italic> in the development of hair cell polarity. They analyze the cell movements linked to the development of polar orientation in pairs of differentiating hair cells under both gain of function and loss of function conditions. They also describe an <italic>emx2</italic> GFP knock-in that they use to monitor onset of expression in the context of precursor division and cell rearrangement. In the absence of <italic>emx2</italic> function GFP+ cells still end up in the usual anterior position. The findings largely support analysis of Kozak et al., 2020, who observed that <italic>emx2</italic> transcripts are found in half of the hair cells in <italic>emx2</italic> mutants. The main difference in the models is that Kozak posits that <italic>emx2</italic> expression is initiated in the precursor and then downregulated in one daughter after division. The key finding in the current work is that <italic>emx2</italic>-driven GFP arises in only one daughter of the hair cell precursor: it is detectable in the posterior cell of the pair before the onset of repositioning (roll) movements or in the anterior cell when roll movements do not occur. It is therefore the initiation not the downregulation of <italic>emx2</italic> that results in asymmetry. To test whether the cell movements that promote asymmetry are altered, Ohta et al. examine changes in rearrangements in <italic>emx2</italic> GOF and LOF conditions. They find some differences in the frequency and duration of movements, but since cell positions are largely resolved conclude that <italic>emx2</italic> plays some role in regulating movements but is not necessary to do so. Rather it regulates bundle polarity in cells independently of cell movement.</p><p>1) The authors state that <italic>emx2</italic> does not determine the ultimate positions of hair cells. Indeed the loss of function data support these conclusions, that is GFP+ cells are all anterior in these mutants. However in GOF transgenics some GFP+ cells are now posterior, suggesting that <italic>emx2</italic> overexpression can indeed alter cell positioning. Is this correct and if so, it should be discussed.</p><p>2) The analysis of apical processes is unconvincing. The authors do not have the resolution to accurately measure individual apical processes. It therefore becomes difficult to know what the difference are with gain and loss of <italic>emx2</italic> expression. It is not clear that there are differences in morphology or in timing of protrusion. These conclusions would require additional measurements.</p><p>3) The conclusion based on scRNAseq data differs somewhat from that of Kozak et al. in terms of the relative timing of <italic>atoh1a</italic> and <italic>emx2</italic> expression. Pseudotime analysis is sensitive to a number of parameters that can give different results. A more nuanced analysis than a pseudotime heatmap is needed to resolve this issue, for example a differential expression test and associated statistics. Alternatively an analysis of expression in situ might address this question.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60432.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The manuscript by Ohta and colleagues deals with the role of the transcription factor Emx2 in organizing the bidirectional polarity of hair cells of the zebrafish neuromasts.

Even though Emx2 is one of the factors regulated by the Notch signaling pathway, our results showed that Emx2 itself, though facilitates the rearrangement process, is not the main determinant of this process.</p><p>Nevertheless, we agreed that including the immunostaining results for <italic>Emx2</italic> KO and GOF at 2 dpf is a good control (see Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and subsection “The HC rearrangement process is regulated by Emx2”). The hair bundle orientation phenotype in <italic>Emx2</italic> KO and F1 generation of the GOF neuromasts at 2 dpf are fully penetrant. The levels of Emx2 among GOF HCs are indeed different, as indicated by all or none endogenous Emx2 immunoreactivity between sibling HCs (anti-Emx2 staining) even though their ectopic Emx2 expression is ubiquitous (based on mCherry expression). Although we cannot preclude the possibility that the Rock and Roll in the <italic>Emx2</italic> GOF neuromast can be caused by the differential levels of Emx2 between two sibling HCs, it is very clear that Emx2 is not detected in the KO mutants at 2 dpf and HC rearrangement still occurs. Therefore, we think the differences in the levels of Emx2 between two sibling HCs is unlikely to drive the Rock and Roll process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another recent paper (Erzberger et al., 2020) has shown that cell rearrangement is impaired when siblings do not have differential activity of Notch pathway.

The fact that probably Emx2 is not required for cell rearrangement but another factor is interesting.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer too. While Notch regulates Emx2 expression, which confers hair bundle orientation, other downstream factor(s) of Notch is mediating the HC rearrangement. Furthermore, our added <italic>trilobite</italic> mutant analyses indicate that the rearrangement is also dependent on intercellular signaling via the core PCP proteins (see results of Figure 9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The analysis with the reporter indicates that GFP appears when cells perform cell rearrangement and is always correlated with the final position cells adopts, if emx2 positive are in posterior perform cell rearrangement, if are anterior located do not.

The <italic>Emx2</italic> reporter fish that we generated allowed us to distinguish which HC within a pair is destined to be in the anterior position. Using this tool, we have further demonstrated that both disruption of microtubules and loss of cPCP signaling affect positional acquisition of nascent HCs (see Figures 7-9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) How the authors envisage that Emx2 regulates apical protrusions and cell shape changes? Can the authors affect apical protrusion formation to see if cell rotation is impaired?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raised a good question. We addressed this question by blocking protrusion formation with transient nocodazole treatment, which blocks microtubule polymerization. Our results showed that introducing nocodazole immediately after the precursor cell divided caused the loss of the apical protrusion. Removal of nocodazole after 90 min of treatment, resulted in the recovery of protrusion after 12 min and this protrusion was followed by HC rearrangement. In contrast, HCs treated with prolong nocodazole for 150 min did not recover protrusion formation and consequently no protrusion was evident and some HCs were mispositioned. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that apical protrusion is important for the cell rearrangement process to occur (see Results section).</p><p>We don’t know how Emx2 regulates the apical protrusion. Based on existing evidence that Emx2 regulates symmetric and asymmetric cell divisions in the brain, basal body positioning in the HCs as well as delaying apical protrusion in nascent zebrafish HCs, we speculate that effectors of Emx2 may involve either centrioles/basal body or microtubules or both, since they seem to be the commonality among the effects of Emx2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Previously, the authors indicated that in zebrafish utricule and cristae, emx2 is also involved in hair bundle polarity. I wonder if there a cell rearrangement between siblings also takes place as in the neuromasts. Live imaging in zebrafish inner ear could help to assess whether emx2 role in the rock and roll process and cell shape is specific of neuromasts organization or has a wider role.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raised an interesting point. We now know that HC rearrangement observed in zebrafish neuromasts is important for HCs to acquire its proper location and to generate the bidirectional hair bundle pattern within the neuromast. Assuming the role of Emx2 in the utricle is conserved among fish, chicken and mice, our existing results in the mouse utricle indicates that HCs across the line of polarity reversal in the inner ear are born on different days during development (Jiang et al., 2017). Therefore, it is highly unlikely that HCs will rearrange across this border. Additionally, we also showed that <italic>Emx2</italic> is activated in the mouse utricle at least three days ahead of HC formation (Tona and Wu, <italic>eLife</italic> 2020). Therefore, if Emx2 has a similar role in establishing its domain via cell rearrangement in the utricle as in the neuromast, it is likely to occur earlier during patterning of the sensory epithelium rather than the HCs per se. To address this question, it will require a different set of tools and imaging techniques, which are beyond the scope of our current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Several manuscripts have been published in relation to the cell rearrangement process in the neuromasts and the mechanisms behind it, however, its biological implications if is very particular of this system, might be of low relevance. I think it is more relevant to explore deeply how emx2 changes bundle orientation.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, HC rearrangement in neuromast has been described by two different labs 8 years ago, but the hypothesis that this process is directly involved in the positional acquisition of HCs has never been demonstrated. Here, using <italic>emx2</italic>-reporter line, we provided the proof that the HC rearrangement process is required for HCs to establish their positions. While our experiments in exploring the downstream effectors of Emx2 in mediating hair bundle orientation are ongoing, we felt it was equally important, if not more, to determine whether emx2 mediates HC positions, since positional acquisition precedes hair bundle establishment and specific HC positions alone could generate the bidirectional hair bundle pattern.</p><p>Furthermore, we respectfully disagree that if HC rearrangement is unique to the neuromast, it thus undermines the biological significance of the phenomenon. We feel any mechanism deployed in positional acquisition should be of importance in developmental biology since positional identity is fundamental to the organization and differentiation of most tissues. The zebrafish neuromast has a lot to offer as a model system in this regard since this organ is simple and easily accessible. It develops quickly and its functionally-relevant structure, the bidirectional HC orientation, is easily scorable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors perform scRNA-seq to trace the emx2 expressing cells and establish the early expression of this transcription factor. Their analysis does not differ from the scRNAseq analysis and trajectory plot recently published in Kozak et al. and thus as it is presently, it does not add new information. I suggest eliminating this part or, if kept, use it to expand the analysis and perform functional experiments with putative downstream factors present in emx2 expressing cells that could regulate sterociliary bundle orientation. A deeper study of the implications of emx2 activity in bundle reorientation would make this manuscript more solid.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not making the impetus and the implication of the seemingly subtle differences between our scRNAseq results and previously published results. We have now modified our Introduction and Discussion for clarification.</p><p>I think the reviewer would agree with us that pinpointing the onset of <italic>Emx2</italic> expression within the neuromast is an important piece of information for pursuing the role of Emx2 in establishing bidirectional HC pattern. Pinpointing the onset of Emx2 expression better than the immunostaining results was the reason for generating the <italic>emx2:Gfp</italic> reporter fish. Based on the <italic>emx2-Gfp</italic> reporter results, <italic>emx2</italic> is activated in one of the nascent HCs shortly after precursor cell division (Figure 3) and these results are consistent with the Rock and Roll phenotypes observed in the <italic>emx2</italic> mutants (Figure 4). Nevertheless, the recent paper by Kozak et al. (2020) earlier this year showed robust Emx2 immunostaining in the HC precursors. The onset of Emx2 expression in the precursor cells, if true, could totally change how Emx2 might be regulated in the HCs (see Discussion section) and also raise the question whether the emx2:Gfp reporter is sensitive enough.</p><p>Although neither we nor the Hudspeth’s lab (Jacobo et al., 2019) have observed Emx2 immunoreactivities in HC precursors using the same commercial source of antibody and the identity of the Emx2-positive precursor was not validated, Kozak et al. also showed the presence of <italic>emx2</italic> transcripts in the precursor cells using a sensitive in situ hybridization technique and scRNA seq approach. In the pursue of downstream effectors of Emx2, we had generated similar scRNA-seq results using 10x Genomics. While the hunt for downstream effectors of Emx2 is ongoing, results of Kozak et al. prompted us to analyze our scRNAseq results for onset of Emx2 expression by following closely the analysis conducted by Kozak et al. using SCANPY and the criteria they applied to their dataset. Our analyses showed that results of the two datasets are very similar except our results showed that the onset of <italic>emx2</italic> corresponds to the time when precursors transition to nascent HCs rather than being highly expressed in the precursor cells. This nascent HC population, however, is absent in the Kozak dataset. It is not clear whether the absence of nascent HC population in their dataset is due to age of the fish collected (7dpf in their study versus 4 dpf in ours) and/or the total numbers of HCs (1240 HCs in their study versus 4000 in ours), which will require further investigation. Nevertheless, our results of scRNA-seq, <italic>emx2:Gfp</italic> reporter activity and Emx2 mutant phenotypes are all consistent with each other supporting a role of Emx2 functioning at the nascent HC stage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Here, the authors find that Emx2 regulates the development of aspects of hair cell morphology that influence rearrangements but does not appear to regulate the process directly. The work is largely descriptive and does not reveal a mechanistic or transcriptional link between Emx2 and hair cell morphology nor does it consider the contribution of other signaling pathways such as PCP signaling which also controls stereociliary bundle orientation in the neuromast. For these reasons it seems an minor advance and is currently not comparable to other articles published in this journal.</p></disp-quote><p>The research advance of this manuscript over the initial observation that emx2 is necessary and sufficient to establish the bidirectional pattern in zebrafish neuromast (Tao et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2017) is to address how Emx2 generates the bidirectional orientation pattern in the neuromast. Since sibling HCs in the neuromast can undergo rearrangement before differentiating into HCs of opposite bundle orientation, it is highly possible that Emx2 may not be mediating hair bundle orientation in HCs but their positions within the neuromast. While searching for downstream effectors of Emx2 is ongoing, we felt this is an equally important question to tackle.</p><p>Furthermore, per reviewer’s request, we have now added additional results in this revision pertaining to the role of the core PCP pathway in HC rearrangement (see detail responses below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) It is not clear when hair cell rearrangements occur relative to the formation and polarization of the stereociliary bundle. Are these concurrent or sequential events?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, these are sequential events. Nascent HCs undergo rearrangement shortly after the HC precursor divided but hair bundle formation is not apparent until HCs start to differentiate. We have revised our Introduction as well as Figure 1 to clarify this important point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) PCP signaling regulates a potentially analogous cellular rotation during ommatidia development in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye. PCP signaling is also essential in the neuromast to align the hair cell stereociliary bundles along a common axis. Thus it seems worthwhile to evaluate how (or if) the Rock and Roll dynamics are altered in PCP mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>The Rock and Roll dynamics in the <italic>vangl</italic> mutants, <italic>trilobite</italic>, has been described by the Hudspeth group (Mirkovic et al., 2012). Hair bundles are misoriented in <italic>trilobite</italic> neuromasts and the HC rearrangement process was described to stall or undergo multiple rolls, which extends the duration of the rearrangement. However, it was not clear whether the abnormal Rock and Roll described in these mutants directly caused HC mispositioning. Using <italic>Emx2-Gfp</italic> reporter fish, we showed that the positions of HCs after Rock and Roll were abnormal in <italic>trilobite</italic> (Figure 9), supporting the hypothesis that cell rearrangement is important for HCs to acquire their proper positions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors consistently use verbs such as “reverses” and “changes” to describe Emx2's function in establishing stereociliary bundle orientation in Emx2-positive hair cells. As written this suggests that the stereociliary bundles are actively rotating to assume an new orientation in this population of cells. However there is no evidence in the literature documenting rotation of the nascent bundle. Instead the bundle forms adjacent to the kinocilium and bundle orientation is established by translocation of the kinocilium to the opposite side of Emx2-positive cells that it does in Emx2-negative cells. This point may appear semantic but is actually quite important to keep clear in this context since the process described in the text is also a rotational event.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this oversight. The wording has been corrected in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Sentence starting &quot;Therefore we investigated our existing sc-RNAseq data…&quot; contains a reference to Matern et al. As structured this sentence suggest that “our existing sc-RNAseq data” is that data previously published by Matern et al. yet there is no author overlap. I suspect that the reference is for the fish line and not the RNAseq data and this should be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>This sentence has been clarified.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Ohta et al. describe roles for emx2 in the development of hair cell polarity. They analyze the cell movements linked to the development of polar orientation in pairs of differentiating hair cells under both gain of function and loss of function conditions. They also describe an emx2 GFP knock-in that they use to monitor onset of expression in the context of precursor division and cell rearrangement. In the absence of emx2 function GFP+ cells still end up in the usual anterior position. The findings largely support analysis of Kozak et al., 2020, who observed that emx2 transcripts are found in half of the hair cells in emx2 mutants. The main difference in the models is that Kozak posits that emx2 expression is initiated in the precursor and then downregulated in one daughter after division. The key finding in the current work is that emx2-driven GFP arises in only one daughter of the hair cell precursor: it is detectable in the posterior cell of the pair before the onset of repositioning (roll) movements or in the anterior cell when roll movements do not occur. It is therefore the initiation not the downregulation of emx2 that results in asymmetry. To test whether the cell movements that promote asymmetry are altered, Ohta et al. examine changes in rearrangements in emx2 GOF and LOF conditions. They find some differences in the frequency and duration of movements, but since cell positions are largely resolved conclude that emx2 plays some role in regulating movements but is not necessary to do so. Rather it regulates bundle polarity in cells independently of cell movement.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the concise summary of our results. Notably, the distinction between initiation versus downregulation of emx2, which we did not clarify well in the previous submission and is now better illustrated in the revised manuscript (see Figure 1C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The authors state that emx2 does not determine the ultimate positions of hair cells. Indeed the loss of function data support these conclusions, that is GFP+ cells are all anterior in these mutants. However in GOF transgenics some GFP+ cells are now posterior, suggesting that emx2 overexpression can indeed alter cell positioning. Is this correct and if so, it should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>This point has been elaborated in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The analysis of apical processes is unconvincing. The authors do not have the resolution to accurately measure individual apical processes. It therefore becomes difficult to know what the difference are with gain and loss of emx2 expression. It is not clear that there are differences in morphology or in timing of protrusion. These conclusions would require additional measurements.</p></disp-quote><p>We have refined our 3-D rendering by increasing the number of the polygons generated for rendering. The results are improved (see Figure 6). Additionally, we have quantified the intensity of the GFP signals in individual apical protrusions using ImageJ Fiji plug in. This quantification and detailed description of the analysis are now included in Figure 6—figure supplement 1 and the Materials and method section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The conclusion based on scRNAseq data differs somewhat from that of Kozak et al. in terms of the relative timing of atoh1a and emx2 expression. Pseudotime analysis is sensitive to a number of parameters that can give different results. A more nuanced analysis than a pseudotime heatmap is needed to resolve this issue, for example a differential expression test and associated statistics. Alternatively an analysis of expression in situ might address this question.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that pseudotime analysis is sensitive to the parameters being applied, even though we have tried to adhere as closely to the clustering parameters described by Kozak et al. as possible. To strengthen our results, we compared the number of <italic>emx2</italic> read counts and percentages of Emx2-positive cells among the clusters. Our results showed that the nascent HC cluster showed significantly higher numbers for both parameters than other clusters, supporting our hypothesis that <italic>emx2</italic> transcripts are highest in the nascent HCs and not precursor cells.</p></body></sub-article></article>
