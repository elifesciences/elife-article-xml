Thus, the rates we published were 3 times lower than they should be. We have updated all figures and text to give rates per codon. This change affects the rates and the absolute number of adaptive mutations that were reported in the original manuscript, but the relationship between viruses and the conclusions about adaptive evolution do not change.</p><p>The corrected Figure 4 is shown here:</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83277-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The originally published Figure 4 is shown here for reference:</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83277-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We also noticed that the Figure 4 legend states that the points in the plot are red when they are, in fact, green.
