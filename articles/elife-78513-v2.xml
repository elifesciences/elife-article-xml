protein of SARS-CoV-2. We analyzed protein content and protein composition of ChAdOx1 nCov-19 and Ad26.COV2.S by biochemical methods and by mass spectrometry. Four out of four tested lots of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 contained significantly higher than expected levels of host cell proteins (HCPs) and of free viral proteins. The most abundant contaminating HCPs belonged to the heat-shock protein and cytoskeletal protein families. The HCP content exceeded the 400 ng specification limit per vaccine dose, as set by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for this vaccine, by at least 25-fold and the manufacturer’s batch-release data in some of the lots by several hundred-fold. In contrast, three tested lots of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine contained only very low amounts of HCPs. As shown for Ad26.COV2.S production of clinical grade adenovirus vaccines of high purity is feasible at an industrial scale. Correspondingly, purification procedures of the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine should be modified to remove protein impurities as good as possible. Our data also indicate that standard quality assays, as they are used in the manufacturing of proteins, have to be adapted for vectored vaccines.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>adenovirus</kwd><kwd>vaccine</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>process-related impurities</kwd><kwd>host cell proteins</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant &quot;Innovative Hochschule&quot; FKZ3IHS024D</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krutzke</surname><given-names>Lea</given-names></name><name><surname>Rösler</surname><given-names>Reinhild</given-names></name><name><surname>Allmendinger</surname><given-names>Ellen</given-names></name><name><surname>Engler</surname><given-names>Tatjana</given-names></name><name><surname>Wiese</surname><given-names>Sebastian</given-names></name><name><surname>Kochanek</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>German Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB1074</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krutzke</surname><given-names>Lea</given-names></name><name><surname>Rösler</surname><given-names>Reinhild</given-names></name><name><surname>Allmendinger</surname><given-names>Ellen</given-names></name><name><surname>Engler</surname><given-names>Tatjana</given-names></name><name><surname>Wiese</surname><given-names>Sebastian</given-names></name><name><surname>Kochanek</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Analysis of protein content and protein composition of the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine, but not of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine, indicated significantly higher than expected levels of host cell proteins (HCPs) and of free viral proteins.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Beside mRNA vaccines, adenoviral vector-based vaccines have turned out to be an essential mainstay of the vaccination campaign against COVID-19. The AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine (AZD1222, Vaxzevria, ChAdOx1 nCov-19 – short ChAdOx1) is based on Chimpanzee Adenovirus Y25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dicks et al., 2012</xref>) . The Johnson &amp; Johnson Ad26.COV2.S vaccine is based on Human Adenovirus type 26 (HAdV-D26) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bos et al., 2020</xref>). Both vaccines express the full-length Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. The ability of adenovirus-based vaccines to induce potent humoral and cellular immune responses and their overall safety record had made them strong candidates to successfully fight the COVID-19 pandemic. This has turned out true, with billions of adenovirus-based vaccine doses administered to vaccinees and with very low rates of serious adverse events observed. In the past, and before the COVID-19 pandemic, adenovirus-based vaccines have not been produced even close at the scale required to supply billions of doses. Thus, for all vaccines including for adenovirus-based vaccines scale-up of production processes in a very short period of time has been a significant challenge.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Protein impurities detected in the AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine</title><p>We initially analyzed three different lots of ChAdOx1 by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) followed by silver staining, comparing the staining pattern of the proteins with those of HAdV-C5-EGFP, an HAdV-C5-based adenovirus vector expressing EGFP, purified by CsCl ultracentrifugation. The vaccine is produced in human T-REx-293 cells to prevent expression of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein during vector production. The vaccine is then purified by a combination of filtration steps and anion-exchange chromatography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">European-Medicines-Agency, 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fedosyuk et al., 2019</xref>). Previously, it has been shown, that simian adenovirus vectors including ChAdOx1 can be purified at high yield and purity using such technology for purification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fedosyuk et al., 2019</xref>). To meet global needs and to enable commercial manufacturing of clinical grade material at a very large scale, some modifications and simplifications, respectively, had been introduced both into the upstream and downstream processes, as has been described in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Joe et al., 2022</xref>).

In lots ABV4678 and ABV7764 approximately 50% of detected proteins were of human origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p>Beside the expected structural viral proteins forming the virion (Hexon, Penton base, IIIa, Fiber, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, and others) also several nonstructural viral proteins were detected at high abundancy, although they are not part of the mature viral particle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). To the detected nonstructural viral proteins belong, for example, the 100K protein, a multifunctional scaffolding protein involved in the trimerization of Hexon, and the DNA-binding protein, which plays an essential role in the replication of the viral genome during infection. In lot ABV5811 nonstructural proteins represented 30% of detected adenoviral proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Since in the assembly process during virus propagation only a part of the available viral capsid proteins is used for particle formation, we assume that in the vaccine product also significant amounts of structural proteins were present as monomers, oligomers, or incomplete viral capsid assemblies. Not being part of the mature viral particle, both nonstructural viral proteins and nonencapsidated structural proteins are referred to as product-related impurities.</p><p>Peptides from more than 1000 different human proteins, derived from the human production cell line, were detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). They were derived from different cellular compartments including cytoplasm, nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and others. Relative amounts of human versus viral proteins were variable between lots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), as was already assumed based on the silver-stained gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Among the human proteins found in the vaccine and beside several cytoskeletal proteins including Vimentin, Tubulin, Actin, and Actinin, the group of heat-shock proteins (HSPs) and chaperones stood out in abundancy. Among the top abundant proteins, HSP 90-beta and HSP 90-alpha as cytosolic HSPs (9.5% and 4.3% of the total proteins, respectively) and three chaperones of the endoplasmic reticulum (transitional endoplasmic reticulum ATPase, Endoplasmin, and Calreticulin) were present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Proteins from Bos taurus from fetal calf serum used for growth of T-REx-293 producer cells, Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and T-Rex-293 cell-derived proteins (E1B from HAdV-C5, Tet-Repressor) were detected at low or negligible levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Lack of host cell proteins in the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine</title><p>A second approved adenoviral vaccine, based on HAdV-D26, is also purified using filtration and chromatography steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">European-Medicines-Agency, 2021b</xref>).

Note that on SDS–PAGE the stained protein band corresponding to Penton Base of HAdV-C5 (571 amino acids, predicted molecular weight [MW]: 63.4 kDa) has a slower migration behavior than expected, likely due to a flexible loop that is structurally disordered in HAdV-C5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Flatt et al., 2013</xref>) and known to be hypervariable in different adenovirus types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zubieta et al., 2005</xref>).

Compared to the manufacturer’s batch-release data the difference between actual and assumed HCP content, respectively, was even several hundred-fold in some of the lots. The substantial lot-to-lot variation in HCP content in a total of four tested samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) also indicated a lack of robustness of the process used for purification of the vaccine, a process, which recently has been described in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Joe et al., 2022</xref>). In contrast, in three tested lots of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine, contamination with HCPs was negligible, confirming that excellent purification of clinical grade adenovirus vaccines is possible at an industrial scale.</p><p>One can assume that the vast majority of the more than 1000 different proteins detected, most of which present at low abundancy, will not cause any adverse effects. We note that the most abundant proteins do not belong to the group of ‘high risk’ HCPs such as cytokines, proteases, and lipases, as they have been described in the context of protein therapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jones et al., 2021</xref>). Whether or not some of the detected human and/or viral protein contaminants might enhance early clinical vaccine reactions such as flu-like symptoms, very often observed within 1 or 2 days after intramuscular injection of vaccines, is a question that cannot be easily addressed.</p><p>There is a possibility that some of the proteins, in particular those with higher abundancy, might be more than inert bystanders. For example, extracellular HSPs are known to modulate innate and adaptive immune responses, can exacerbate preexisting inflammatory condition, have been associated with autoimmunity and can even become targets auf autoimmune responses themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Binder, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Routsias and Tzioufas, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tamura et al., 2016</xref>). They very efficiently initiate specific immune responses by receptor-mediated uptake of HSP–peptide complexes in antigen-presenting cells (APCs), mainly via CD91 and scavenger receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Binder, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Binder et al., 2000</xref>). Since the HSPs present in the vaccine are derived from T-REx-293 cells, in principle they could mediate the transfer to APCs of peptides derived from the 293 cell source, of autologous peptides from vaccinated individuals and also of viral proteins. Like many viruses, adenovirus has been reported to induce HSPs during amplification in production cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Santoro et al., 2010</xref>), likely to accommodate for a need in help by HSPs in the folding and production of large amounts of structural and nonstructural viral proteins and in virion assembly. Thus, virus infection-mediated induction of HSPs could explain the abundancy of HSPs in the vaccine product in case of insufficient purification.</p><p>Because HSPs are endowed with ATPase activity, we searched for and detected ATPase activity in ChAdOx1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>)<bold>,</bold> raising the possibility that local ADP generation in the ATP-rich skeletal muscle tissue after injection might contribute to activation of platelets following ADP receptor binding.</p><p>Shortly after receiving conditional marketing authorization in Europe, cases of thrombotic thrombocytopenia were observed, an unusual and, if untreated, often fatal syndrome of thrombosis of the cerebral venous sinuses and other large vessels together with low platelet counts. Occurring between 5 and 28 days after vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Othman et al., 2021</xref>), this syndrome, now coined vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) or thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, and related to autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Greinacher et al., 2017</xref>), was found to be linked to vaccination with ChAdOx1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, 2021</xref>), and has been described to be mediated by platelet-activating antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Greinacher et al., 2021a</xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Greinacher et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pavord et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schultz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Scully et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tiede et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wolf et al., 2021</xref>). Also Ad26.COV2.S has been linked to VITT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Muir et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, 2021</xref>), however at a lower frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, 2022</xref>). It has recently been speculated that impurities in ChAdOx1 could be causally involved in the pathogenesis of VITT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Greinacher et al., 2021a</xref>). Since VITT has been found associated with both ChAdOx1 and Ad26.COV2.S, at a lower frequency in the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, 2021</xref>), and because, according to our data, ChAdOx1 but not Ad26.COV2.S contained high amounts of human and free viral proteins, our findings support the notion that the protein impurities present in ChAdOx1 at least are not the primary trigger for the induction of VITT. Incidentally, PF4 itself was not found in our analyses as a contaminant. Whether the impurities might increase the likelihood and frequency of its occurrence in case of ChAdOx1, for example by serving as an inflammatory or immunological cofactor remains a possibility. Interestingly, epidemiologic studies have indicated that RNA vaccines are associated with thromboembolic events but not with VITT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, 2021</xref>). We speculate that differences in duration and/or levels of Spike protein expression, as to be expected in adenoviral vectors versus mRNA vaccines, might also be a relevant factor in the pathogenesis of VITT, as well as the secretion of the Spike protein due to aberrant splicing events, as recently observed with adenovirus-based vaccines, more so with ChAdOx1 than with Ad26.COV2.S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kowarz et al., 2022</xref>). However, it is important to stress that the frequency of severe thromboembolic events occurring after natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 is much higher than after vaccination with any of the vaccines in use including ChAdOx1 and Ad26.COV2.S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lau et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nopp et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>We also considered that intramuscular injection of contaminating free viral or nonviral proteins might influence the quality of the immune response and potentially affect activity and efficacy of the vaccine. In a pilot in vivo immunization experiment performed in mice, anti-Spike antibody and T-cell responses were not significantly altered following immunization with ChAdOx1 compared to an identical vector without HCP contamination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), suggesting that the protein impurities did not interfere with the induction of immune responses against the Spike antigen. However, we acknowledge that our study was limited by testing recognition of only a single T-cell epitope.</p><p>In the biopharmaceutical industry, the removal of HCPs from the biological product is a critical quality attribute, since residual HCPs pose a risk to patient safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vanderlaan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhu-Shimoni et al., 2014</xref>). The main risks generally discussed relate either to the biological activity of the contaminant, to effects of the impurities enhancing immune responses against the therapeutic protein (antidrug antibodies) or to inducing antibodies against the impurities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vanderlaan et al., 2018</xref>). These concerns are relevant as they have been observed clinically. Overall, problems with HCPs are rare events and classical protein biopharmaceuticals have an excellent safety record (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">de Zafra et al., 2015</xref>). In cases, in which problems have been observed, therapeutic proteins have been produced in heterologous (i.e., nonhuman) production systems such as <italic>E. coli</italic>, yeast, and Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">de Zafra et al., 2015</xref>). For example, antidrug antibodies were generated in patients against human growth hormone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vanderlaan et al., 2018</xref>), produced in <italic>E. coli</italic>, apparently due to a contaminating protein that had been missed by an unsuitable HCP assay. Another case, more closely related to the topic of this report, is bovine neonatal pancytopenia, a severe vaccine-induce alloimmune disease in young calves that is caused by alloreactive maternal antibodies present in the colostrum of cows that had been vaccinated against bovine viral diarrhea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kasonta et al., 2018</xref>). Bioprocess impurities in the vaccine, originating from the bovine i.e. autologous, production cell line, used for virus propagation and vaccine production, induced these alloreactive antibodies present in the colostrum of vaccinated cows that were directed to polymorphic bovine leukocyte antigen I (BoLA class I) alleles and became symptomatic in the offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kasonta et al., 2018</xref>). In principle, for biopharmaceuticals used in humans one can expect lower immune-related risks linked to HCP impurities when they are produced in human cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">de Zafra et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Guidance documents by the US Pharmacopeia (USP) and the European Pharmacopeia emphasize that HCP impurities should be as low as technically feasible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vanderlaan et al., 2018</xref>). For ‘classical’ biopharmaceuticals such as antibodies the allowable HCP content generally is in a range of 1–100 parts per million (1–100 ppm), corresponding to 1–100 ng HCP in 1 mg product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vanderlaan et al., 2018</xref>). The HCP content in more complex biotherapeutics such as viral vectors will be higher than in protein therapeutics, since production processes are more demanding. Therefore, HCP specifications are individually determined by the regulatory bodies. One of the likely reasons, why in the case of ChAdOx1 the specification limit of 400 ng HCP content per dose was largely exceeded (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), has to do with the assays used for HCP determination in the purified product. Standard assays to monitor removal of HCPs during production of biopharmaceuticals are enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vanderlaan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">European Directorate for the Quality of Medicine and Health Care, 2020</xref>), based on polyclonal antibodies isolated from larger animals, preferentially goat, sheep, and rabbit, after immunization with cell lysates or supernatants from the producer cell. For production of secreted recombinant proteins, such assays are a ‘workhorse’ in quality control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vanderlaan et al., 2018</xref>), routinely used and together with other methods to assure and document the absence of HCPs in the final product. The apparent lack of detection by the manufacturer of HSPs and cytoskeletal proteins in ChAdOx1 with an ELISA could be explained by the close to 100% homology at the protein level of HSPs and cytoskeletal proteins between human and sheep or goat, so that in immunized animals no or low-level antibodies against these protein classes were generated. Thereby, these proteins could be missed, if quality control was solely based on such a polyclonal ELISA, in particular, if it was not complemented by orthogonal analytical methods such as staining of protein gels, capillary electrophoresis, or mass spectrometry.</p><p>With the many different contaminant proteins detected in the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine the question imposes itself, whether or not (some of) the impurities might have long-term immune-related side effects in some of the vaccinees. In order to reduce potential risks as good as possible it will be necessary to reduce the level of contamination with process- and product-related impurities by an improved purification process. The establishment of robust assays for detection of HCPs can be complicated and time consuming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2009</xref>), in particular if processes for new and complex biopharmaceuticals have to be developed, time that maybe is not always available in times of a pandemic. However, the here reported identification of specific process- and product-related impurities in ChAdOx1 should guide and accelerate the next steps to improve purity and quality of this and similar vaccines in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Cells were washed once with buffer A, resuspended in 100 µl buffer A and analyzed by flow cytometry for APC/PE double-positive cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Analysis of antibody responses</title><p>Total spike-specific antibody titers were determined by ELISA. In brief: 100 µl of 0.5 µg/ml purified spike protein dissolved in coating buffer (0.04 M Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, 0.06 M Na<sub>2</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>, pH 9.6) was coated on Maxisorp ELISA plates overnight at 4°C. Upon blocking of wells for 1 hr at RT (Thermo Fisher, 37535), 100 µl murine plasma samples diluted in PBS (starting dilution: 1:20; 1:5 serial dilutions) was added and incubated for 2 hr at RT. Subsequent 100 µl HRP-labeled rabbit anti-mouse antibody was added (Sigma A9044-2ML; dilution 1:10.000) and incubated for 1 hr at RT. Chemiluminescence signals were induced by adding 100 µl TMB substrate (Thermo Fisher, N301) and stopped by addition of 100 µl 2 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. Signals were measured at 450 nm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Purification of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein</title><p>A CMV-promoter controlled SARS-CoV-2 Spike expression plasmid based on GenBank sequence YP_009724390.1 (modifications: deleted transmembrane domain, µ phosphatase signal peptide, C-terminal 8xHis-Tag, artificial trimerization domain, two proline insertions, deleted furin cleavage site, SV40 poly(A), codon-optimized for <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>) was used for transfection of CAP-T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fischer et al., 2012</xref>). 96 hr p.t. cells were separated and 30 ml of supernatant were concentrated to 250 µl using 100 kDa cutoff amicons (Millipore, UFC9100) by centrifugation for 5 hr at 4600 rpm. Concentrates were resuspended in buffer A (50 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 0.05% Tween20, 1× protease inhibitor, pH 8.0) and 100 µl Ni-NTA agarose beads (Qiagen, 30210) in a total volume of 2 ml and incubated overnight at 4°C, rotating. Using Poly-Prep Chromatography Columns (BioRad Laboratories, 7311550) beads were thoroughly washed and spike protein eluted with 500 µl buffer B (50 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 300 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole, 1× protease inhibitor, pH 8.0). The purity of isolated spike protein was confirmed by silver staining of proteins separated by SDS–PAGE.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical analysis of samples was performed using unpaired two-sample Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test with RStudio-software Version 4.0.0. p values ≤0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Supervision, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Supervision, Validation, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experiments were approved by the Animal Care Commission of the Government Baden-Wü;rttemberg.

Your article has been reviewed by 4 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by myself as a Reviewing Editor and Diane Harper as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Thomas Klimkait (Reviewer #1); Roland Wagner (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>We will not require further experiments, but you can see from the reviews that many questions arose throughout. Given the interest that the paper will garner, we ask you to address and clarify as many of these points as possible. In particular, please add a description of how these lots were chosen. Please also add as much detail as possible regarding what is known about the differences in the purification process of ChAdOx1 versus Ad26.COV2.S.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript provides strong evidence for a surprisingly high heterogeneity in protein content when comparing 3 preparations of a commercial vaccine preparation. The authors appropriately use widely used and standardised methods for the elucidation of the protein composition of several Aden-based vaccine preparations. After the somewhat unexpected finding of high protein contamination levels in ChAdOx1, they apply different ways to verify exceedingly high levels of contamination with host cell protein. As perplexing as a 70% contamination may sound, the authors plausibly discuss possible reasons for the massive under quantification.</p><p>It is highly astonishing that no response by authorities (EMA) or manufacturer (Astra) is found in the manuscript. To the reader, this indicates that those bodies either are not aware of the study data or that they did not respond. It might therefore be of high general interest to add a short statement to the discussion.</p><p>Overall, the study has been carefully designed and conducted, and the latter part including platelet-related ATPase experiments adds important detail to the discussion about potential product-induced side effects after vaccination.</p><p>The manuscript is clearly structured and the analyses are straightforward. The detailed discussion of a possible side-effect potential caused by contaminating cell proteins adds important information.</p><p>Also the information about why certain proteins, i.e. HSP could have been missed although present at extreme levels, provides very useful information for the non-expert audience.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is a simple study looking at the impurities of two widely used Covid-19 vaccines, ChAdOx1 and Ad26.COV2.S. The result that all four lots of ChAdOx1 analyzed contained impurities above the maximum allowable level was surprising and important.</p><p>1) I would like to see the authors include as much detail as possible regarding what is known about the differences in the purification process of ChAdOx1 versus Ad26.COV2.S. It would be tremendously helpful for the field to understand what part of the ChAdOx1 purification process is responsible for the high levels of impurities.</p><p>2) Why is the Penton base band for ChAdOx1 not visible in Figure 1 and Figure 3A?</p><p>3) I would have liked to have seen all of the analyses performed in Figure 3 to have been conducted on HAdV-C5-EGFP and on UUlm ChAdOx1.</p><p>To improve the usefulness of the manuscript, the authors should discuss in more detail the possible reasons for the high levels of impurities so that this can be avoided in the future.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The elimination of endogenously produced host cell proteins is one of the most challenging operations in guaranteeing the compliance of critical quality attributes in the production of biological drug substances. Realization of process robustness sufficient enough to consistently keep it at the highest standard is a time-consuming part of the process development. Hence, it is of utmost importance to have a very critical view of drugs that had been developed and produced under conditions of a propagating disease wave and an increasing political and social pressure.</p><p>Compromising the purity of a drug with host cell proteins is most probable when the product is produced by the biological system of a cell. This is especially the case for the vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection based on adenoviruses as vectors because the virus has to be produced by means of animal cells. Therefore, the authors investigated the two approved vaccines produced by AstraZeneca and Johnson and Johnson. The manuscript is clearly written and the methods used for analyzing the impurities are industrial standard methods used in the process development of therapeutic bioproducts. The authors have long-term expertise in adenovirus production and development. The conclusive results are highly reasonable.</p><p>Very important investigation and very important results that have to be published as fast as possible. The manuscript is clearly written and the methods used for analyzing the impurities are reliable standard methods used for identifying impurities in drug-producing bioprocesses. The conclusive results are highly reasonable and such that I recommend the manuscript for publication without reservations.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. I did not find a description of how these lots were chosen. Ie: I am guessing there are many lots out there and these three a random choice? (why only 3?). There are then statements like (line 319) 'ChAdOx1 but not Ad26.COV2.S contained high amounts of human and free viral proteins'. When I understand that one Ad26 contained less than 3 AZ. Some statistical comparison of a larger number of randomly sampled lots would seem appropriate?</p><p>2. The immunological analysis seems pretty superficial and also subject to type 2 error. Surely the statement should be 'responses to AZ were 3%, and to control 2%, although this was not significant (stating p-value and test, not currently stated)' (rather than ignoring difference). Same for spike binding antibodies. Similarly, the discussion pointed out a trend of high antibodies + T cells that was not significant. Overall this is a very superficial look at immune responses.</p><p>3. There is a lot of excessive speculation in the discussion. Eg:</p><p>a) Line 281: &quot;we assume….might enhance early clinical vaccine reactions&quot;.</p><p>b) Line 289 'might be more than inert bystanders…'</p><p>c) 296: 'transfer of peptides'.</p><p>d) 307 onwards: speculation on VIIT. Shouldn't this just say no PF4 was found…</p><p>e) Line 33 onwards – very little immune data, and the data they have suggests higher immunogenicity (but not significant).</p><p>f) Lines 341: They speculate on antibodies to the impurities. It is pretty easy to check – so not sure why speculation?</p><p>g) The speculation about the possible effects of contaminants cites reference 29 extensively (which looks at the impact of contaminants). My reading of this is that (i) most of the documented cases come from bacterial contaminants (that act as adjuvants). (ii) the major effect is immune responses that reduce the circulation time/effects of a drug. (iii) there seem few documented cases where this occurs, and none where there are autoimmune consequences?</p><p>h) (line 349) bovine neonatal pancytopenia (BNP): no citations provided, but also not clear it is relevant (ie: it needs a statement that no MHC molecules found in the vaccines, no evidence for alloreactivity, etc – so this does not seem relevant to the case at hand)</p><p>I feel it is written in a way to enhance speculation on the role of contaminants, whereas in fact there seems no plausible link with any side effect (and the most obvious mechanisms – such as contamination with PF4) can be eliminated by the study…</p><p>I think the manuscript would be greatly enhanced if the authors could:</p><p>1) to show clear evidence of whether there is a difference in contamination between this and other vaccines (esp JnJ). Eg: sufficient (randomly chosen) batches to show statistical significance (or a clear statement that based on 1 batch versus 3 this is purely anecdotal).</p><p>2) Before speculating on auto-antibodies etc, this should be directly examined (eg: look at antibodies from AZ / JnJ vaccinated and control individuals to cell lysate (western blot? Immunoprecipitation?). These are very easy. Also, make recombinant versions of the top 5 contaminants and see if antibodies to these are detectable in AZ vaccinated vs. control vs. JnJ vaccinated).</p><p>3) It should clearly state that although there is a theoretical risk potential contaminants could have an effect, no relevant examples are known in the literature (not my area – but going off reference 29) and no relevant proteins were found. Eg: no PF4 (relevant to HIIT), no MHC (relevant to bovine neonatal pancytopenia).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78513.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>We will not require further experiments, but you can see from the reviews that many questions arose throughout.
