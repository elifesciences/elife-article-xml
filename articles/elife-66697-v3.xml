<abstract>
<p>Polygenic adaptation is thought to be ubiquitous, yet remains poorly understood. Here, we model this process analytically, in the plausible setting of a highly polygenic, quantitative trait that experiences a sudden shift in the fitness optimum. We show how the mean phenotype changes over time, depending on the effect sizes of loci that contribute to variance in the trait, and characterize the allele dynamics at these loci. Notably, we describe the two phases of the allele dynamics: The first is a rapid phase, in which directional selection introduces small frequency differences between alleles whose effects are aligned with or opposed to the shift, ultimately leading to small differences in their probability of fixation during a second, longer phase, governed by stabilizing selection. As we discuss, key results should hold in more general settings and have important implications for efforts to identify the genetic basis of adaptation in humans and other species.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Many traits under natural selection are quantitative, highly heritable, and genetically complex, meaning that they take on continuous values, that a substantial fraction of the population variation in their values arises from genetic differences among individuals, and that this variation arises from small contributions at many segregating loci. It therefore stands to reason that the responses to changing selective pressures often involve adaptive changes in such traits, accomplished through changes to allele frequencies at the many loci that affect them. In other words, we should expect polygenic adaptation in complex, quantitative traits to be ubiquitous. This view traces back to the dawn of population and quantitative genetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wright, 1931</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fisher, 1958</xref>) and is supported by many lines of evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Walsh and Lynch, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sella and Barton, 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Notably, it is supported by studies of the response to directional, artificial selection on many traits in plants and animals in agriculture and in evolution experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Walsh and Lynch, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sella and Barton, 2019</xref>). In these settings, selected traits typically exhibit amazingly rapid and sustained adaptive changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Weber and Diggins, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barton and Keightley, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hill, 2016</xref>), which are readily explained by models in which the change is driven by small shifts in allele frequencies at numerous loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Weber and Diggins, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hill and Kirkpatrick, 2010</xref>), and inconsistent with models with few alleles of large effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barton and Keightley, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zhang and Hill, 2005</xref>). The potential importance of polygenic adaptation has also been highlighted by more recent efforts to elucidate the genetic basis of adaptation in humans. In the first decade after genome-wide polymorphism datasets became available, this quest was largely predicated on the monogenic model of a hard selective sweep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Voight et al., 2006</xref>), in which adaptation proceeds by the fixation of new or initially rare beneficial mutations of large effect (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Smith and Haigh, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kaplan et al., 1989</xref>). Subsequent analyses, however, echoed studies of artificial selection in indicating that hard sweeps were rare, at least over the past ∼500,000 years of human evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Coop et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hernandez et al., 2011</xref>). Yet humans plausibly adapted in myriad ways during this time period, and they definitely experienced substantial changes in selection pressures, notably during more recent expansions across the globe. These considerations refocused the quest for the genetic basis of human adaptation on polygenic adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pritchard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pritchard and Di Rienzo, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Findings from genome wide association studies (GWASs) in humans have been central to this research program. Statistical analyses of GWASs indicate that in humans, heritable variation in complex traits is highly polygenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Loh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boyle et al., 2017</xref>). For example, for many traits, estimates of the heritability contributed by chromosomes are approximately proportional to their length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shi et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that the contributing variants are numerous and roughly uniformly distributed across the genome. Such findings reinforced the view that adaptive changes to quantitative traits are likely to often be highly polygenic, but also implied that their identification would be difficult, as the changes to allele frequencies at individual loci may be minute. To overcome this limitation, recent studies pooled signatures of frequency changes over the hundreds to thousands of alleles that were found to be associated with an increase (or decrease) in a given trait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Turchin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berg and Coop, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Robinson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Field et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berg et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Edge and Coop, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Speidel et al., 2019</xref>). Initial studies suggest that polygenic adaptation has affected multiple human traits, but these conclusions have been called into question with the realization that the results are highly sensitive to systematic biases in GWASs, most notably due to population structure confounding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berg et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sohail et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Given that polygenic adaptation is plausibly ubiquitous, yet likely hard to identify, there is a clear need for a deep understanding of its behavior in populations and footprints in data. To date, theoretical work has primarily focused on two scenarios. The first is motivated by the observed responses to sustained artificial selection, modeled either as truncation selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Robertson, 1960</xref>) or as stabilizing selection, with the optimal phenotype moving at a constant rate in a given direction (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bürger and Lynch, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Bürger, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kopp and Hermisson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Matuszewski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jain and Devi, 2018</xref>). In natural populations, however, quantitative traits are unlikely to be subject to long-term continuous change in one direction. Instead, considerable evidence indicates that they are often subject to long-term stabilizing selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sella and Barton, 2019</xref>), with intermittent shifts of the optimum in different directions. The second scenario therefore assumes that a sudden change in the environment induces an instantaneous shift in the optimum of a trait under stabilizing selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lande, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barton and de Vladar, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">de Vladar and Barton, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jain and Stephan, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bod’ová et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jain and Stephan, 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stetter et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Thornton, 2019</xref>). Although more elaborate scenarios (where, for example, the optimum and/or strength of stabilizing selection vary frequently) are also possible, this simple scenario provides a sensible starting point for thinking about polygenic adaptation in nature, and is our focus here.</p>
<p>Although there has been considerable work on the adaptive response to an instantaneous change in optimal phenotype, our understanding of this process is still limited. Seminal work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lande, 1976</xref> described the change in the phenotypic mean assuming that phenotypes are normally distributed in the population and that the phenotypic variance remains constant over time. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barton and Turelli, 1986b</xref> derived recursions for the expected change to higher moments of the phenotypic distribution, and showed that when phenotypic variation arises from alleles with large effect sizes, which are strongly selected and rare, the response to selection introduces skew in the phenotypic distribution that can substantially affect the change in the phenotypic mean. Their recursions, however, are not generally tractable, and their analyses do not extend to the phenotypic response in more realistic cases, in which phenotypic variation arises from alleles with a wide range of effect sizes. Moreover, with GWASs now enabling us, at least in principle, to learn about the genetic basis of the phenotypic response, we would like to understand the allele dynamics that underlie it.</p>
<p>Several studies have tackled this problem using simulations (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stetter et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Thornton, 2019</xref>). Although illustrative of the dynamics, it is unclear how to generalize their results, given (necessarily) arbitrary choices about multiple parameters and the complexity of these dynamics. In turn, elegant analytical work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">de Vladar and Barton, 2014</xref> and extensions by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jain and Stephan, 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jain and Stephan, 2017b</xref> afford a general understanding of the allele dynamics in models with an infinite population size. These dynamics, however, are shaped by features of mutation-selection balance that are specific to infinite populations. Notably, they strongly depend on the frequency of alleles prior to the shift in optimum following deterministically from their effect size, and on the critical effect size at which this frequency transitions from being dominated by selection to being dominated by mutation. In real (finite) populations, the frequencies of alleles whose selection effects are sufficiently small to be dominated by mutation will be shaped by genetic drift; more generally, variation in allele frequencies due to genetic drift will crucially affect the allele response to selection (see below). Thus, we still lack a solid understanding of the allele dynamic underlying polygenic adaptation in natural populations, notably in humans.</p>
<p>Here, we follow previous work in considering the phenotypic and allelic responses of highly polygenic traits after a sudden change in optimal phenotype, but we do so in finite populations and employ a combination of analytic and simulation approaches to characterize how the responses vary across a broad range of evolutionary parameters.</p>

<title>Model</title>
<p>We build upon the standard model for the evolution of a highly polygenic, quantitative trait subject to stabilizing selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wright, 1935b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Robertson, 1956b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Turelli, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Keightley and Hill, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Johnson and Barton, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Simons et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sella and Barton, 2019</xref>). An individual’s phenotype is represented by the value of a continuous trait, which follows from its genotype by the standard additive model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Falconer, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lynch and Walsh, 1998</xref>). Namely, we assume that the number of genomic sites affecting the trait (i.e. the target size) is very large, <inline-formula>

We follow previous work modeling this balance in making several plausible assumptions about parameter ranges (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Simons et al., 2018</xref>), which ensure that genetic variation in the trait is highly polygenic, and subject to effective but not catastrophically strong selection.

<p>We compare our analytical results to three kinds of simulations, which differ in their simplifying assumptions and computational tractability (see Section 2 of <italic>Appendix 3</italic> for further detail). The first realizes the full model described above; it is run for a burn-in period of <inline-formula>

The second traces <italic>all alleles</italic> rather than individuals, assuming linkage equilibrium (rather than free recombination). Changes to allele frequencies every generation are modeled according to the Wright-Fisher process. These second simulations are also run with a burn-in period of <inline-formula>

</inline-formula> generations after. The third kind of simulation traces the trajectory of a <italic>single allele</italic> segregating at the time of the shift. To that end: (i) given the effect size of the allele, we sample initial minor allele frequencies from the closed form, equilibrium distributions (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ55">Equation A3-27</xref> in <italic>Appendix 3</italic>), using importance sampling based on the density of variance contributed by different minor allele frequencies (Section 3.1 of <italic>Appendix 3</italic>); and (ii) the trajectory of the mean phenotype of the population over time, on which the allele dynamics depend, is given as input, based on either an analytical approximation (see below) or on an average over simulations of the second kind. The <italic>single allele</italic> simulation is run until the focal allele fixes or goes extinct. Documented code for simulations can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/sellalab/PolygenicAdaptation1D">https://github.com/sellalab/PolygenicAdaptation1D</ext-link> (copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:bcd4da82713e95032cb3c692da7ca02a408b346c;origin=https://github.com/sellalab/PolygenicAdaptation1D;visit=swh:1:snp:8a5f29bfd0e7643fbfa5e3575f65abf5ec68b36d;anchor=swh:1:rev:35d0857272a3929bad9fad0856e90c24e032b5ff">swh:1:rev:35d0857272a3929bad9fad0856e90c24e032b5ff</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hayward and Sella, 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>In the main text, we use the simulations that afford the highest resolution in comparisons with analytical predictions, whereas in Section 2.2 of <italic>Appendix 3</italic> we validate our main results against simulations that realize the full model (at a lower resolution). Specifically, we compare most of the predictions about the allele dynamics with the results of <italic>single allele</italic> simulations, running 250,000 replicas for any given allele effect size and optimum shift size (see parameter choices below). The <italic>single allele</italic> simulations do not describe phenotypic change or the trajectories of mutations that arise after the shift in optimum, however. We therefore compare the predictions for these processes with the results of the <italic>all alleles</italic> simulations; in these simulations, we run 2500 replicas with any given set of parameters.</p>
<p>The simulations used in the main text correspond to the two qualitative phenotypic responses described below, which we refer to as the Lande and non-Lande (see <italic>Results</italic>). Specifically, we use the following simulation parameter values:</p>

Similar expressions were derived by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barton and Turelli, 1986b</xref> under the rare-alleles approximation and by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bürger, 1991</xref> under the assumption of a parabolic fitness function.</p>
<p>We rely on <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 3</xref> to describe the phenotypic response to selection. This response takes a simple form in the infinitesimal limit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Fisher, 1918</xref>) in which genetic variation at equilibrium arises from infinitely many segregating alleles with infinitesimally small effect sizes (see Section 8 of <italic>Appendix 3</italic> for details). In this limit, the equilibrium phenotypic distribution is Normal and it remains Normal with the same variance after the shift, because the change in mean phenotype is achieved by infinitesimally small changes to allele frequencies at infinitely many loci, with no change to the frequency distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lande, 1976</xref>, and Section 8 of <italic>Appendix 3</italic>).

<p>This solution was first derived by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lande, 1976</xref>, and in what follows, we refer to it as Lande’s solution or approximation. When genetic variance is dominated by loci with small and intermediate effect sizes (as defined below), the trait is highly polygenic, and the shift in optimum is not too large relative to the phenotypic standard deviation, changes to the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> central moments of the phenotypic distribution are small and the expected phenotypic response is well approximated by Lande’s solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig26">Appendix 3—figures 26</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig27">27</xref>).</p>

<title>The phenotypic response to a shift in optimal phenotype.</title>
<p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon of the two kinds of phenotypic response: (i) the Lande approximation, in which the mean approaches the new optimum exponentially with time and the phenotypic distribution maintains its shape; (ii) substantial deviations from Lande’s approximation, in which the mean approaches the new optimum rapidly at first, but during this time the phenotypic distribution becomes skewed, causing the mean’s approach to slow down dramatically, to a rate that is dictated by the decay of the 3<sup>rd</sup> central moment. (<bold>B</bold>) In both the Lande and non-Lande cases, the mean phenotype initially approaches the new optimum rapidly. This approach is described by Lande’s approximation, and is thus almost identical in the two cases (which is why only the Lande curve is visible). The simulation results were generated using the <italic>all alleles</italic> simulation with a shift of <inline-formula>

<p>More generally, given our assumptions that polygenicity is high and that the shift is not too large (see Section 6 of <italic>Appendix 3</italic>), the deviations from Lande’s approximation are usually small and their magnitude is determined by the distribution of allele effect sizes (see section on <italic>The allelic response in the equilibration phase</italic> and Section 6 of <italic>Appendix 3</italic>). Specifically, changes to the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> central moments of the phenotypic distribution are greater when alleles with large effects contribute markedly to genetic variance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig26">Appendix 3—figures 26</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig27">27</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barton and Turelli, 1986b</xref>). For some intuition, consider a pair of minor alleles with the same initial frequency and magnitude of effect, where the effect of one is aligned with the shift and the effect of the other opposes it. After the shift, directional selection increases the frequency of the aligned allele relative to that of the opposing one. The frequency increase of the aligned allele increases variance more than the frequency decrease of the opposing allele decreases it, resulting in a net increase to variance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barton and Turelli, 1986b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">de Vladar and Barton, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jain and Stephan, 2017a</xref>). The relative changes in frequency and thus the net increase in variance are greater for alleles with larger effects. Next consider the 3<sup>rd</sup> central moment. At equilibrium, the contributions of alleles with opposing effects to the 3<sup>rd</sup> central moment cancel out. After the shift, the frequency increase of aligned alleles relative to opposing ones introduces a non-zero 3<sup>rd</sup> central moment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Large effect alleles contribute substantially more to this 3<sup>rd</sup> central moment, plausibly because their individual contribution to the 3<sup>rd</sup> central moment at equilibrium is greater (see Section 3.3 of <italic>Appendix 3</italic> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig7">Appendix 3—figure 7B</xref>) and because they exhibit larger relative changes in frequency after the shift (see section on <italic>The allelic response in the rapid phase</italic> and Section 4 of <italic>Appendix 3</italic>). The same reasoning suggests that very large shifts in optima or low polygenicity could also lead to substantial changes to the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> central moments of the phenotypic distribution (Section 6 of <italic>Appendix 3</italic> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barton and Turelli, 1986b</xref>), but these cases violate our assumptions and are beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p>
<p>The increase in 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> central moments after the shift result in a phenotypic dynamic with two distinct phases. First, immediately after the shift, the mean phenotype rapidly approaches the new optimum, akin to the exponential approach in Lande’s approximation. In this case, however, genetic variance increases and thus the exponential rate of approach may increase, making the expected approach even faster (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 3</xref>). Shortly thereafter, when the mean phenotype nears the optimum, the decreasing distance and increasing 3<sup>rd</sup> central moment reach the point at which<disp-formula id="equ6">

<p>The two terms on the right-hand side of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 3</xref> then approximately cancel out, and the dynamic enters a second, prolonged phase, in which the approach to the optimum nearly grinds to a halt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). During this phase, the expected change in mean phenotype can be described in terms of a quasi-static approximation given by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ6">Equation 6</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig25">Appendix 3—figure 25</xref>). The rate of approaching the optimum is then largely determined by the rate at which the 3<sup>rd</sup> central moment decays. This roughly corresponds to the rate at which the allele frequency distribution equilibrates and mutation-selection-drift balance is restored around the new optimum (see section on <italic>Other properties of the equilibration process</italic>).</p>

</inline-formula>). This definition is somewhat arbitrary, as the transition between phases is gradual, but it roughly captures the change in allele dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig25">Appendix 3—figure 25</xref>). Moreover, our analysis is insensitive to this particular choice (we only use it in comparing analytic and simulation results for the rapid phase).</p>
<p>The change in mean phenotype during the rapid phase is driven by the differential effect of directional selection on minor alleles whose effects are aligned and opposed to the shift in optimum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Considering a pair of minor alleles with opposing effects of the same magnitude and the same initial frequency, selection increases the frequency of the aligned allele relative to the opposing one. By the end of the rapid phase, the frequency differences across all aligned and opposing alleles drive the mean phenotype close to the new optimum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Deviations from Lande’s approximation manifest as prolonged, weak directional selection during the equilibration phase, which further increases the expected frequency difference between aligned and opposing alleles. However, given that we are considering a highly polygenic trait, the expected frequency difference between a pair of opposing alleles will be small. This small difference causes aligned alleles to have a slightly greater probability of eventually fixing during the equilibration phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Over a period on the order of <inline-formula>

</inline-formula> generations (see below), the frequency differences between aligned and opposing alleles are replaced by a slight excess of fixed differences between them, and the equilibrium genetic architecture is restored around the new optimum. In the following sections, we describe these processes quantitatively: Specifically, we ask how the relative contribution of alleles to phenotypic change during the two phases depends on their effect size and initial frequency.</p>

<title>A cartoon of allele dynamics.</title>
<p>We divide the allele dynamics into rapid and equilibration phases, based on the rate of phenotypic change, and consider the trajectories of alleles with opposing effects of the same magnitude, which start at the same initial minor frequency. During the rapid phase, alleles whose effects align with the shift slightly increase in frequency relative to those with opposing effects. During the equilibration phase, this frequency difference can increase further and eventually leads aligned alleles to fix with slightly greater probabilities than opposing ones.</p>

<caption>
<title>The allelic response during the rapid phase.</title>
<p>(<bold>A</bold>) Alleles with moderate and large magnitudes make the greatest contribution to phenotypic change (per unit mutational input). The results of our linear approximation (derived in the main text) are compared with a more accurate nonlinear one (derived in Section 4.1.2 of <italic>Appendix 3</italic>) and with simulations. (<bold>B</bold>) The average MAF of aligned and opposing alleles at the end of the rapid phase decreases with effect size squared. (<bold>C</bold>) The expected frequency difference between pairs of opposing alleles is greatest for moderate effect sizes. In B and C, the results of the nonlinear approximation are compared with simulations. The simulation results in all panels were were generated using the <italic>single allele</italic> simulation, as detailed in <italic>Simulations and resources</italic>; error bars are not visible because they are smaller than the points.</p>

<graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-66697-fig4-v3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>When the polygenicity is low and/or the shift in optimum or effect sizes are large our linear approximation becomes less accurate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Specifically, minor alleles exhibit large relative changes in frequency such that substituting the initial MAF for the frequency in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ7">Equation 7</xref> for the 1<sup>st</sup> moment is inaccurate. In Section 4.1.2 of <italic>Appendix 3</italic> we derive a nonlinear approximation that is more accurate in these cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig9">Appendix 3—figures 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig10">10</xref>). Nonetheless, the qualitative behaviors we outlined remain intact.</p>

<title>The allelic response in the equilibration phase</title>
<p>Over the long run, the small frequency differences between opposite alleles that accrue during the rapid phase translate into small differences in their fixation probabilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In the non-Lande case, prolonged weak directional selection during the equilibration phase amplifies these differences in fixation probabilities. We approximate fixation probabilities in two steps. First, we model the effect of directional selection on frequency as an instantaneous, deterministic pulse. Second, we apply the diffusion approximation for the fixation probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ewens, 2004</xref>, Chapter 4), assuming stationary stabilizing selection (<inline-formula>
<mml:math id="inf123">
<mml:mrow>

<mml:mo>=</mml:mo>
<mml:mn>0</mml:mn>
</mml:mrow>
</mml:math>
</inline-formula>), genetic drift, and the initial frequency after the pulse. We further assume that the relative changes in allele frequencies due to directional selection are small, such that we can use approximations that are linear in this change; but in Section 5 of <italic>Appendix 3</italic>, we derive nonlinear approximations that relax this assumption.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3-5">
<title>The Lande case</title>
<p>When Lande’s approximation is accurate, directional selection is non-negligible only briefly after the shift. This justifies approximating its effects as if they were caused by an instantaneous pulse. It also suggests that mutations that arise after the shift in optimum contribute negligibly to phenotypic change, because when directional selection is non-negligible, few of them arise and their fixation probabilities are tiny (given that they start from an initial frequency of <inline-formula>

Simulation results were generated using the <italic>all alleles</italic> simulation for the non-Lande case (see section on <italic>Simulations and resources</italic>). Specifically, we calculated the relative contribution of alleles in each effect size bin (between the gray gridlines), by dividing the contribution of all fixations in the bin by the mutation rate per generation corresponding to that bin. In both Lande and non-Lande cases, long-term stabilizing selection diminishes the contribution of alleles with large effects (red arrows). In the non-Lande case, long-term, weak directional selection greatly amplifies the contribution of alleles with small and moderate effects (blue arrow).

<p>We can understand this turnover by considering the effects of stabilizing selection during the equilibration phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig2">Appendix 2—figure 2</xref>). As noted, stabilizing selection on the trait induces selection against minor alleles, which weakens as MAF increases and vanishes at MAF <inline-formula>

</inline-formula>. Now consider how it affects a pair of alleles with opposite, moderate or large effect. If their initial frequencies are very low, both alleles will have low MAFs at the end of the rapid phase. Consequently, they will both be strongly selected against during the equilibration phase and will almost certainly go extinct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig2">Appendix 2—figure 2</xref>). In the long run, their expected contribution to phenotypic adaptation is therefore diminished. In contrast, if the alleles’ initial MAF is sufficiently high, the relative increase in the aligned allele’s frequency by the end of the rapid phase causes it to be subject to substantially weaker selection than is the opposing allele. In the extreme in which the aligned allele has exceeded frequency <inline-formula>

</inline-formula>, the direction of selection on it is even reversed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig2">Appendix 2—figure 2</xref>). In such cases, the pair’s expected contribution to phenotypic adaptation will be amplified. This reasoning suggests that, for a given magnitude, there is a critical initial MAF such that the long-term contribution of alleles that start above it is amplified and the contribution of those that start below it is diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig3">Appendix 2—figure 3</xref>). This critical frequency is lower in the non-Lande case, because prolonged, weak directional selection amplifies the long-term contribution from alleles with any initial MAF.</p>
<p>The turnover among alleles with different magnitudes can be explained in similar terms. Alleles with large magnitudes almost always start from low MAF, because they are subject to strong stabilizing selection before the shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Consequently, they are highly unlikely to exceed the critical initial frequency and their expected long-term contribution to phenotypic adaptation is diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A</xref>). However, changes to the frequencies of these alleles skew the phenotypic distribution, leading to prolonged, weak directional selection that amplifies the long-term contribution of small and moderate effect alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In our linear approximation, this amplification will occur for allele magnitudes that satisfy <inline-formula>

For sufficiently large effect sizes, practically all fixations are caused by the shift and are of aligned alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we investigated the phenotypic and genetic adaptive response to selection on a highly polygenic quantitative trait in a simple yet highly relevant setting, in which a sudden change in environment shifts the trait’s optimal value. The phenotypic response to selection was previously studied by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lande, 1976</xref>. Assuming that phenotypes are normally distributed in the population, he predicted that after the shift the population’s mean phenotype will approach the new optimum exponentially, at a rate that is proportional to the additive genetic variance in the trait. The Normality assumption, however, was only shown to hold in an infinitesimal limit, in which the effect sizes of individual loci are infinitesimally small (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Turelli, 2017</xref> and Section 8 of <italic>Appendix 3</italic>). We found that when the trait is sufficiently polygenic and the shift in optimum is not too large (relative to genetic variance in the trait), Lande’s prediction is accurate so long as the genetic variance is dominated by loci with small and moderate effect sizes, which are defined based on the selection acting on them before the shift. When these conditions are violated, most notably when loci with large effects contribute markedly to genetic variance, the initial, rapid change in mean phenotype is followed by a pronounced quasi-static phase, governed by changes to the 3<sup>rd</sup> central moment of the phenotypic distribution, in which the mean phenotype takes much longer to catch up to the new optimum.</p>
<p>We also characterized the genetic basis of these adaptive phenotypic changes. The closest previous work assumed an infinite population size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">de Vladar and Barton, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jain and Stephan, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jain and Stephan, 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jain and Stephan, 2017b</xref>). As we show, relaxing this assumption leads to entirely different behavior. In infinite populations, small effect alleles, whose equilibrium frequencies are dominated by mutation and are held at <inline-formula>

</inline-formula> before the shift, make the greatest contribution to phenotypic change after the shift (see Introduction). In contrast, in most if not all real (finite) populations (with <inline-formula>

</inline-formula>, where <inline-formula>
<mml:math id="inf189">
<mml:mi>u</mml:mi>
</mml:math>
</inline-formula> is the mutation rate per site per generation), the frequencies of such small effect alleles are dominated by genetic drift rather than mutation. More generally, variation in allele frequencies due to genetic drift, which is absent in infinite populations, critically affects the allelic response to selection.</p>
<p>To study the allelic response, we divided it into two periods: a rapid phase, immediately after the shift, and a subsequent, prolonged equilibration phase. During the rapid phase, the population’s mean distance to the optimum is substantial and changes rapidly. Directional selection on the trait increases the frequency of minor alleles whose effects are aligned with the shift relative to minor alleles with opposing effects (given the same magnitude and initial frequency). By the end of the rapid phase, the cumulative effect of these frequency differences pushes the mean phenotype close to the new optimum, but because this effect is spread over myriad alleles, the frequency difference between any individual pair of opposing alleles is fairly small. Specifically, we found that an allele’s contribution to phenotypic change is proportional to its contribution to phenotypic variance before the shift, implying that alleles with moderate and large effect sizes make the greatest per site contributions to phenotypic change, while alleles with moderate effect sizes experience the greatest frequency changes. The expected frequency differences between opposing alleles is amplified by prolonged, weak directional selection during the subsequent equilibration phase, and this amplification is pronounced when the phenotypic approach to the new optimum deviates markedly from Lande’s approximation.</p>
<p>Over the long run, stabilizing selection on the trait and genetic drift transform these small frequency differences into a small excess of fixed aligned alleles relative to opposing ones, and cumulatively this excess moves the population mean all the way to the new optimum. This transformation process involves a massive turnover in the properties of the contributing alleles. Notably, the transient contributions of large effect alleles are supplanted by contributions of fixed moderate, and to a lesser extent, small effect alleles. In the non-Lande cases, the fixation of mutations that arise after the shift in optimum can also contribute substantially to long-term phenotypic adaptation. These processes take on the order of <inline-formula>

</inline-formula> generations, after which the equilibrium architecture of genetic variation around the new optimum is restored.</p>
<p>Our finding that large effect alleles almost never sweep to fixation appears at odds with the results of previous studies of similar models. These discrepancies are largely explained by earlier papers considering settings that violate our assumptions, notably about evolutionary parameter ranges. For instance, some studies assume that large effect alleles segregate at high frequencies before the shift in optimum (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Christodoulaki et al., 2019</xref>), which is presumably uncommon in natural populations and in any case, violates our assumption that the population is at mutation-selection-drift equilibrium before the shift. Other models implicitly consider quantitative traits of intermediate genetic complexity; while such traits likely exist, there are to our knowledge few well-established examples. Notably, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Thornton, 2019</xref> observes sweeps in cases in which the trait is not highly polygenic (violating our assumption that <inline-formula>

Relatedly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chevin and Hospital, 2008</xref> observe sweeps in cases in which a rare mutation of large effect contributes substantially to genetic variance, which violates our assumptions that genetic variation is highly polygenic and is not predominantly effectively neutral (i.e. that alleles with <inline-formula>

Although it remains to be seen, we believe that this architecture is much less common, given mounting evidence, reviewed in the <italic>Introduction</italic>, which suggests that traits are often highly polygenic, and other considerations, notably estimates of persistence time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Walsh and Lynch, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sella and Barton, 2019</xref>) and inferences based on human GWASs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Simons et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>), which indicate that quantitative genetic variation is not predominantly neutral.</p>
<p>Lastly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stetter et al., 2018</xref> considered a huge shift in the optimal trait value (e.g. of ∼90 phenotypic standard deviations), resulting in a massive drop in fitness (violating our assumption that <inline-formula>

</inline-formula>)—although shifts in optimum need not be that large to result in the fixations of some large effect alleles. While there are many examples of rapid and large environmental fluctuations, e.g., seasonal fluctuations or shifting weather systems, they occur on a much shorter time scale than fixation (although they might have some effect on genetic architecture; see below). In turn, little is known about the magnitude of shifts in optimal trait values over the time scales of large effect, beneficial fixations. While it seems plausible that moderate shifts, which fall within our assumed parameter ranges, are common, we cannot rule out that larger shifts are common as well. The response to such larger shifts is not covered by our analysis and clearly warrants further study.</p>
<p>Other factors that we have not considered may also affect polygenic adaptation. Most notable among them is pleiotropy. Given that quantitative genetic variation affecting one trait often affects many other traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bulik-Sullivan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pickrell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boyle et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sella and Barton, 2019</xref>), alleles that would have been positively selected because of their effect on the trait under directional selection may be selected against because of their adverse effects on other traits. Moreover, pleiotropy is known to affect the genetic architecture of a given trait at equilibrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Simons et al., 2018</xref>), which we have shown to shape the allelic response to selection on that trait. Pleiotropy is therefore likely to affect which alleles contribute to phenotypic change at the different phases of polygenic adaptation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Otto, 2004</xref>, for related considerations for genetically simple traits). Linkage disequilibrium (LD) may have an effect as well, perhaps most notably for minor alleles with large effects, which start at low frequencies and experience strong directional selection during the rapid phase. Before the shift, large effect alleles located in genomic regions with low recombination and high functional density are more likely to be in LD with, for example, alleles with countervailing effects on the focal trait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lande, 1975</xref>) or deleterious effects on other traits. If this were the case, then directional selection during the rapid phase might be effectively weaker, because it would act on extended haplotypes rather than on individual alleles.</p>
<p>In addition, the demography of a population, notably its size, and the selection pressures on quantitative traits are likely to change over a shorter time scale than it takes the genetic architecture of complex traits to equilibrate. When these changes occur over the <inline-formula>

</inline-formula> generations preceding a shift in optimal trait value, they may affect the genetic architecture of the trait and consequently its response to selection. Changes in population size influence the number of segregating sites affecting a trait and the distribution of their frequencies and contributions to variance, with more recent population sizes affecting strongly selected variation more than weakly selected variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lohmueller, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Simons et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Simons and Sella, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sella and Barton, 2019</xref>). The effects of varying selection will depend on the attributes of this variation in ways that await further study.</p>
<p>While the effects of all of these factors on the response to a shift in optimum warrant investigation, we expect the response to follow from the principles we outlined. Notably, we expect the short-term contribution of alleles to phenotypic change to be proportional to their contribution to variance before the shift, and their long-term contribution to arise from differences between the fixation probabilities of alleles with opposite effects, caused by the opposing effects of directional selection on their frequencies. Thus, while all these factors are likely to affect the response, we expect the main features of the dynamics we portrayed to remain largely intact. These features include the role of the 3<sup>rd</sup> central moment of the phenotypic distribution in slowing down phenotypic adaptation near the new optimum; the transient contribution of large effect alleles to phenotypic adaptation; and the long-term importance of alleles with moderate effects.</p>
<p>As polygenic adaptation in quantitative traits is likely ubiquitous, our conclusions have potentially important implications. One is that, contrary to adaptation mediated by selective sweeps of initially rare, large effect, beneficial alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Smith and Haigh, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kaplan et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Braverman et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hermisson and Pennings, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Coop and Ralph, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berg and Coop, 2015</xref>), polygenic adaptation might have minor effects on patterns of neutral diversity at any given point in time (but may affect temporal diversity patterns; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buffalo and Coop, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Buffalo and Coop, 2020</xref>). The effects of selected alleles on neutral diversity at linked loci follow from their trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barton, 2000</xref>). Our results indicate that directional selection on a highly polygenic trait introduces only small changes to allele frequencies at individual loci, which amount to minor perturbations to the allele trajectories expected under stabilizing selection at equilibrium (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chevin and Hospital, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Thornton, 2019</xref>). Indeed, alleles with large effects exhibit only small, transient changes. For those with more moderate effects, there is a modest, long-term excess of fixations of those alleles whose effects are aligned with the shift relative to those whose effects are opposed, accompanied by a small increase in the total number of fixations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The trajectories of the alleles that fix are largely driven by weak stabilizing selection and tend to be drawn out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Thus, our results indicate that the effects of polygenic adaptation on neutral diversity should be minor (other than perhaps for massive shifts in optimal trait values, as noted above).</p>
<p>In contrast, long-term stabilizing selection on quantitative traits likely has substantial effects on neutral diversity patterns. Specifically, selection against minor alleles induced by stabilizing selection may well be a major source of background selection and is expected to affect neutral diversity patterns in ways that are similar to those of background (purifying) selection from other selective origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Charlesworth et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hudson and Kaplan, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Santiago and Caballero, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">McVean and Charlesworth, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Another implication of our results pertains to the search for the genetic basis of human adaptation, as well as adaptation in other species. Efforts to uncover the identity of individual adaptive genetic changes on the human lineage were guided by the notion that their identity would offer insight into what ‘made us human’. Under the plausible assumption that many adaptive changes on the human lineage arose from selection on complex, quantitative traits, this approach may not be as informative as it appears (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pritchard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boyle et al., 2017</xref>). Our results indicate that after a shift in the optimal trait value, the number of fixations of alleles whose effects are aligned with the shift are typically nearly equal to the number of alleles that are opposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Moreover, the alleles that fix are a largely random draw from the vastly greater number of alleles that affect the trait, both in the sense of being those that happened to segregate at high MAFs at the onset of selection and because of the stochasticity of fixation. Thus, in this plausible scenario, it becomes meaningless to say that any given fixation was adaptive, and arguably uninteresting to focus on the particular subset of alleles that happened to reach fixation. In contrast, identifying the traits that experienced adaptive changes promises to provide important insights. Recent efforts to do so pool the signatures of frequency changes over many loci that were found to be associated with a given trait in GWAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Turchin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berg and Coop, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Robinson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Field et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berg et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Edge and Coop, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Speidel et al., 2019</xref>), an exciting approach that has also proven to be technically challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berg et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sohail et al., 2019</xref>). A better understanding of the process of polygenic adaptation should help to guide such efforts.</p>

</inline-formula>. Directional selection during the rapid phase increases the frequency of aligned alleles relative to those with opposing effects, and these frequency differences underlie short-term phenotypic adaptation. (<bold>A</bold>) The initial MAF of large effect alleles, even those in the 99.5<sup>th</sup> percentile, is sufficiently low such that both aligned and opposing alleles still have low MAFs at the end of the rapid phase. Consequently, they are both strongly selected against during the equilibration phase and almost certainly go extinct, thereby erasing their short-term contribution to phenotypic adaptation. (<bold>B</bold>) Moderate effect alleles start at much higher initial MAFs. In the extreme, this initial frequency is sufficiently high for directional selection during the rapid phase to push aligned alleles above frequency 1/2, thereby reversing the direction of (under-dominant) selection on them, but not on the opposing alleles, during the equilibration phase. Consequently, the expected contribution of moderate effect alleles with sufficiently high initial MAF to phenotypic adaptation is amplified during the equilibration phase.</p>

As we show in the main text, the assumption that the phenotype distribution is normally distributed can be violated in ways that affect the course of adaptation qualitatively, giving rise to the non-Lande case. Also, requiring that the mean distance from the optimum is very small can be restrictive.</p>
<p>We derive our basic equations without making the assumptions of a Normal phenotypic distribution or that the distance to the optimum is very small. Similar to previous work, we do not provide a rigorous treatment of the errors introduced by our approximations (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hayward, 2020</xref>, for such treatment). We therefore validate our main results against simulations of the full model (Section 2.2).</p>

In the non-Lande case, we estimate the mean distance by averaging over 2500 <italic>all alleles</italic> simulations with the same model parameters. During the equilibration phase, we average over the quasi-static approximation for the distance (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ6">Equation 6</xref> in the main text) rather than the distance itself, because the former is considerably less variable among simulations than the latter (Section 7.1 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig22">Appendix 3—figure 22A and B</xref>). <italic>Single allele</italic> simulations share sources of error with the <italic>all alleles</italic> simulations, in addition to potential errors arising from relying on the analytic approximation for the initial MAF and on the mean rather than on the actual (fluctuating) distance <inline-formula>

<p>We use the <italic>all alleles</italic> and <italic>single allele</italic> simulations throughout because they are considerably more computationally tractable, allowing us to obtain larger sample sizes and thus more precise comparisons with our analytic predictions.

Unfortunately, precise estimates of fixation probabilities of alleles with a particular effect size may require hundreds or thousands (or even orders of magnitude more, if the effect size is extremely rare) of <italic>full</italic> or <italic>all alleles</italic> simulations. This problem is overcome by the <italic>single allele</italic> simulations. For example, with the same parameters, running a <italic>single allele</italic> simulation for 1000 aligned and 1000 opposing alleles segregating at the time of the shift, with each of 13 different effect sizes (those used in many of the figures, e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig8">Appendix 3—figure 8</xref>) takes ∼10 hours on the same computational platform.</p>

The phenotypic variance before the shift is greater in the <italic>full model</italic> simulation than in our analytic approximation and <italic>all alleles</italic> simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig2">Appendix 3—figure 2A</xref>), plausibly because only the <italic>full model</italic> simulation incorporates the effect of the variance of the phenotypic background of a focal site (see Section 1.1). Specifically, the variance of the phenotypic background reduces the efficacy of stabilizing selection—akin to how environmental contributions to phenotypic variance effectively increase <inline-formula>

<p>The same effect plausibly accounts for most of the other small phenotypic differences between the <italic>full model</italic> and <italic>all alleles</italic> simulations. The short-term term phenotypic response is slightly faster in the <italic>full</italic> than in the <italic>all alleles</italic> simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig2">Appendix 3—figure 2E</xref>), because of the greater initial phenotypic variance in the full model. The increase in the 3<sup>rd</sup> phenotypic moment is smaller in the <italic>full</italic> than in the <italic>all alleles</italic> simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig2">Appendix 3—figure 2B</xref>), possibly because the greater initial phenotypic variance allows the same shift in mean phenotype to be achieved by smaller relative changes in allele frequency (e.g. <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ10">Equation 10</xref> in the main text). Lastly, the greater variance and smaller 3<sup>rd</sup> central moment in the <italic>full model</italic> simulations plausibly explain the smaller distance from the optimum during the equilibration phase in the <italic>full model</italic> relative to the <italic>all alleles</italic> simulations, seen both directly and in the quasi-static approximation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig2">Appendix 3—figure 2D and C</xref>). Small differences notwithstanding, the results of the <italic>full model</italic> simulations support all of our main results about the phenotypic dynamic.

<title>3. Allele dynamics under stabilizing selection</title>
<p>Understanding how stabilizing selection on the trait affects allele dynamics is crucial to characterizing the allelic response after a shift in the optimal trait value. Notably, the equilibrium allele dynamic under stabilizing selection shapes the genetic architecture of the trait (i.e., the joint distribution of phenotypic effect sizes and frequencies of alleles affecting the trait) prior to the shift and this genetic architecture shapes the short term allelic and phenotypic response to the shift. Also, after the rapid, initial response, when the mean phenotype is close to the new optimum but the genetic architecture is out of equilibrium, the longer-term allele dynamics are largely determined by the effects of stabilizing selection. Here we therefore describe the allele dynamics under stabilizing selection, both at and out of equilibrium.</p>
<p>The analysis of the effects of stabilizing selection is greatly aided by it being stationary. In particular, the first two moments of change in the frequency of an allele with effect size <inline-formula>

<p>The 3<sup>rd</sup> central moment of the phenotypic distribution also plays a central role in the response to selection. Notably, when alleles with large effects contribute markedly to genetic variance, the 3<sup>rd</sup> central moment increases substantially from zero shortly after the shift in optimum, and the long-term phenotypic response takes what we refer to as the &quot;non-Lande&quot; form (see the <italic>Phenotypic response</italic> section and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

<title>4.1. Approximate solutions for allele trajectories</title>
<p>Allele trajectories during the rapid phase are nearly deterministic, because it is too short for genetic drift to have a substantial effect. Further, deviations from Lande’s approximation for the distance of the mean phenotype have negligible effects (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig8">Appendix 3—figure 8D–F</xref>). We can therefore approximate these trajectories based on our expression for the first moment of change in allele frequency (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ29">Equation A3-1</xref>) and Lande’s approximation for the mean phenotype (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ5">Equation 5</xref> in the main text).

<caption>
<title>The nonlinear approximation accurately predicts average allele frequencies at the end of the rapid phase for a wide range of model parameters.</title>
<p>The simulation results were generated using the <italic>single allele</italic> simulation, as described in Section 2.1; errors are not visible because they are smaller than the points. The analytic predictions were based on the nonlinear approximations (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ68">Equations A3-40</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ76">A3-48</xref>) averaged over the initial MAF distribution (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ55">Equation A3-27</xref>) with the corresponding parameters. As expected, when polygenicity is lower and shifts are larger the expected changes to allele frequencies are greater (compare <bold>A</bold> with <bold>C</bold> and <bold>D</bold> with <bold>F</bold>). Perhaps less obvious, despite the fact that our nonlinear approximation relies on Lande’s approximation, it performs well even in the cases with non-Lande phenotypic dynamics (<bold>D–F</bold>).</p>

<title>4.2. Contribution to phenotypic change</title>
<p>Phenotypic adaptation after the shift in optimum arises from the increase in frequency of alleles whose effects align with the shift relative to those with opposite effects. Here, we generalize the steps that we took in the main text in order to approximate the allelic contributions to change in mean phenotype. We begin by considering a pair of alleles that are initially minor, with the same frequency, and that have opposite effects of the same magnitude. The frequency difference between them at time <inline-formula>

<p>When the rapid phase is longer, the contributions of large effect alleles substantially deviate from the linear approximation in one of two ways. First, when the shift in optimum is large, large effect alleles contribute more than predicted by the linear approximation, because the change in frequency of the aligned allele accelerates as its frequency increases. Second, when the shift is small, large effect alleles contribute less than predicted, because the linear approximation underestimates the reduction in the frequency of both aligned and opposite alleles caused by stabilizing selection. Both of these effects are captured by the nonlinear approximation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig10">Appendix 3—figure 10</xref>).</p>

<title>5. Allele dynamics during equilibration</title>
<p>In the long run, phenotypic adaptation transitions from being based on small frequency differences between alleles whose effects align with and oppose the shift in optimum to being based on small differences between the numbers of fixations of these opposite alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Here, we characterize the architecture of these long-term fixed differences. Specifically, we derive approximations for their relative contributions to phenotypic change as a function of allele magnitude and initial frequency (before the shift in optimum).</p>
<p>To this end, we approximate an allele’s probability of fixation in two steps. First, we model the effect of directional selection on frequency as an instantaneous, deterministic pulse. We assume that the pulse occurs immediately after the shift for alleles already present in the population, and immediately after introduction for mutations that occur after the shift. Second, we apply the diffusion approximation for the fixation probability, assuming stationary stabilizing selection and genetic drift and given the allele frequency immediately after the instantaneous pulse of directional selection.</p>
<p>We consider four approximations of increasing complexity, which differ in two of their assumptions. The first is whether the phenotypic approach to the new optimum is well approximated by Lande’s solution; we refer to the corresponding approximations as <italic>Lande</italic> and <italic>non-Lande</italic>. The second is whether the expected changes to allele frequency due to directional selection are sufficiently small that we can apply linear approximations in calculating these changes and their effects on fixation probabilities; we refer to the corresponding approximations as <italic>linear</italic> and <italic>nonlinear</italic> (the two <italic>linear</italic> approximations were also described in the main text). The derivations for changes to allele frequencies due to directional selection in the <italic>linear</italic> and <italic>nonlinear</italic> approximations are analogous to those of the corresponding approximations for the rapid phase. We consider each of the four approximations that follow from the combinations of these assumptions in turn.</p>

<title>5.1. The linear Lande approximation</title>
<p>The linear Lande approximation is the simplest and the one that we detail in the main text. Here, we briefly describe it for completeness and detail the conditions on model parameters under which we expect it to be accurate.</p>
<p>First, we approximate the change in allele frequency caused by directional selection. We use a deterministic approximation, which neglects the effects of drift, and in contrast to our approximations for the rapid phase, also neglects the effects of stabilizing selection. Under these simplifications, the change in allele frequency due to directional selection can be described by the ODE<disp-formula id="equ83">

</inline-formula> when <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ94">A3-66</xref> holds.</p>
<p>While we do not prove that our conditions are sufficient, we conjecture that they are, for the following reasons. First, in Sections 6 and 9 we illustrate by simulation that Lande’s approximation is accurate when condition <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ94">A3-66</xref> is met. Intuitively, when the bulk of variation has fairly small effect sizes, we expect little build-up of a 3<sup>rd</sup> central moment during the rapid phase (also see Section 3.3). When Lande’s approximation applies, directional selection has non-negligible effects for only a brief period after the shift in optimum (for <inline-formula>

</mml:mrow>
</mml:math>
</inline-formula> generations; see section on <italic>Allele dynamics</italic>). Consequently, these effects should be well approximated as an instantaneous pulse that neglects drift and stabilizing selection, whose effects manifest over longer timescales. Additionally, newly arising mutations should contribute negligibly to phenotypic change. This is because fairly few new mutations arise while directional selection is effective (i.e. during the rapid phase), and because the fixation probabilities (let alone the difference in fixation probabilities between new mutations with opposing effects) of those that do are minute, given that they start from an initial frequency of <inline-formula>

<p>Second, we require that our first order approximations for the change in allele frequency (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ85">Equation A3-57</xref>) and change in fixation probability (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ89">Equation A3-61</xref>) be accurate. With high polygenicity and a moderate shift, we expect the average contribution to phenotypic change per segregating allele to be small. Nevertheless, large effect alleles could experience changes in frequency that are large relative to their low initial frequencies, causing a substantial relative error in our linear instantaneous pulse approximation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ85">Equation A3-57</xref>). This reasoning provides some intuition for why condition <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ95">A3-67</xref> combines requirements on the extent of polygenicity, shift size, and effect size. In Section 5.3, we show why this particular combination is required.</p>

<p>The simulation results were generated using the <italic>single allele</italic> simulation, as described in Section 2.1; errors are often not visible because they are smaller than the points. The analytic predictions were based on the linear Lande (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ88">Equations A3-60</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ89">A3-61</xref>) and nonlinear Lande (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ88">Equations A3-60</xref>, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ112">A3-84</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ113">A3-85</xref>) approximations averaged over the initial MAF distribution (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ55">Equation A3-27</xref>) with the corresponding parameters. The nonlinear Lande approximation performs better than the linear Lande approximation for alleles with large and intermediate effects, especially when polygenicity is lower (see the golden shaded regions in <bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>). In the linear approximation, the change in fixation probability scales with <inline-formula>

As we describe in the main text, in this case, the phenotypic distribution develops a substantial 3<sup>rd</sup> central moment during the rapid phase, leading to a much slower approach to the new optimum afterwards. This results in prolonged weak directional selection that amplifies the difference in fixation probabilities between alleles with opposite effects present before the shift in optimum. In addition, despite it being weak, directional selection acts for so long (on the order of <inline-formula>

<p>Both the linear and nonlinear Lande approximation are fairly accurate for alleles with small effects. When polygenicity is low, the nonlinear Lande approximation is more accurate for alleles with intermediate effects (see the teal line in <bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>). Both approximations perform badly for large effect alleles when the polygenicity is low and the shift is large (the red box in <bold>A</bold>). However, in the Lande case, we expect very few alleles to have large effect sizes. The simulation results were generated using the <italic>single allele</italic> simulation, as described in Section 2.1; errors are often not visible because they are smaller than the points.

<p>In this case, the justification for the instantaneous pulse approximation is less obvious, because directional selection substantially affects allele frequencies over an extended period. Assuming that the pulse approximation is accurate nonetheless, the same reasoning that we employed for the linear Lande approximation suggests that our linear expansions are accurate when polygenicity is sufficiently high and the shift and allele magnitudes are not too large. However, given that directional selection acts for longer, we expect the condition on these quantities to be more stringent than for the linear Lande approximation. By analogy, we would conjecture that this condition becomes <inline-formula>

However, when polygenicity is low and/or the shift is large, it underestimates the fixation probabilities of both aligned and opposing intermediate effect alleles (see the golden shaded region in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig16">Appendix 3—figure 16</xref>).

<p>We expect the linear non-Lande approximation for new mutations to be accurate under more general conditions than it is for standing variation. First, consider our linear expansion of the fixation probability (e.g., <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ89">Equation A3-61</xref>), which is accurate when <inline-formula>

<p>where we have closed form expression for all parts of this expression. As we illustrate in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig19">Appendix 3—figure 19</xref>, the linear non-Lande approximation for this joint contribution is quite accurate provided high polygenicity and a moderate shift. However, when polygenicity is low and/or the shift is large, the linear approximation overestimates the contribution of intermediate effect alleles and underestimates the contribution of large effect alleles.</p>

<p>Both the linear and nonlinear approximations perform fairly well. However, when the polygenicity is low and the shift is large, the nonlinear approximation overestimates the proportion of the change in mean due to large effect standing variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig18">Appendix 3—figure 18</xref>) and therefore overestimates the proportion contribution coming from <italic>all</italic> large effect alleles (see the red box in <bold>A</bold>).

<title>5.3. The nonlinear Lande approximation</title>
<p>Our linear approximations become less accurate when directional selection causes large changes in allele frequencies, as expected when trait polygenicity is low, the shift is large (relative to the initial phenotypic standard deviation) or the magnitude of effect size is large (relative to <inline-formula>
<mml:math id="inf621">
<mml:mi>δ</mml:mi>
</mml:math>
</inline-formula>). Here, we develop a nonlinear Lande approximation that is more accurate than the linear one and we derive conditions under which the improvement is substantial.</p>
<p>Our derivation follows the same steps that we took in previous sections but without relying on linear expansions. First, we derive a nonlinear approximation for the effects of directional selection, once again assuming that they occur as an instantaneous pulse. To this end, we apply the same kind of nonlinear approximation that we used for the rapid phase (Section 4.1), but in this case we ignore the effects of stabilizing selection. By analogy to our derivation in Section 5.1, we express the change in frequency due to directional selection as<disp-formula id="equ112"> <label>(A3-84)</label>

In cases with intermediate polygenicity and large shifts or low polygenicity and intermediate to large shifts, we see that the nonlinear approximation becomes substantially more accurate for intermediate effect size alleles (when <inline-formula>

When polygenicity is low and both the shift and effects sizes are large, the nonlinear approximation can substantially overestimate the contribution to phenotypic adaptation (see the red box in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig15">Appendix 3—figure 15A</xref>), because many large effect alleles do not segregate long enough to feel the full integral effect of directional selection. However, when Lande’s approximation applies, we expect such large effect alleles to be scarce and contribute negligibly to polygenic adaptation.</p>

</inline-formula>). However, the linear and nonlinear non-Lande approximation perform comparably well for calculating the contribution to the change in mean phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig18">Appendix 3—figure 18</xref>), since the error in the linear approximation cancels out somewhat in calculating the <italic>difference</italic> in fixation probabilities of opposite alleles (which is what generates the change in mean). For large shifts and low polygenicity, the nonlinear approximation can even perform worse than the linear one, because it overestimates the proportion contribution coming from large effect alleles (see the red box in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig18">Appendix 3—figure 18</xref>); and, consequently, also underestimates the proportion coming from small and intermediate effect alleles. This is because the approximation does not account for the fact that large effect alleles tend to segregate for fewer generations than those with small and moderate effects, and therefore experience fewer effective generations of directional selection.</p>

<p>We provided this approximation for completeness, but as we noted in Section 5.2.2, we expect the linear non-Lande approximation for new mutations to be accurate for considerably wider parameter ranges than it is for standing variation, possibly for the entire range permitted by our conditions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table2">Appendix 1—table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>7. Variation over realizations of the adaptive response</title>
<p>Throughout the manuscript we focused on the mean values of summaries of the phenotypic and allele dynamics, setting aside variation around the mean over different realizations of the adaptive response. In order to provide a sense of the magnitude and impact of this variation, we present simulation results for the main summaries we have considered, where in the allelic case we compare our results with a simple analytic approximation. Overall, these analyses do not reveal unexpected behaviors that alter our qualitative understanding of the adaptive response.</p>

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig22">Appendix 3—figure 22</xref> shows the variation in our main summaries of the phenotypic distribution during the adaptive response.

This increase is greater for greater shifts and when allele magnitudes are greater (i.e., in the non-Lande case), plausibly because both factors increase the magnitude of perturbations to allele frequencies during the rapid phase. The variation then returns to the equilibrium level during the equilibration phase. Importantly, even during the rapid phase variation around the mean appears to be minor throughout the parameter range we consider.</p>

Similarly, variation in both the phenotypic variance and skewness are stable throughout the adaptive response and similar to their magnitude at equilibrium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig22">Appendix 3—figure 22C and D</xref>). Notably, the variation in phenotypic variance is negligibly small (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig22">Appendix 3—figure 22C</xref>), as we may have expected given that we are considering a highly polygenic trait. In the non-Lande cases in which the initial increase in skewness has a substantial impact on the dynamics, the variation in skewness is small relative to its peak values (e.g. in the case with the larger shift and medium polygenicity the peak in mean skewness is <inline-formula>

We focus on the contributions from standing variation at the time of the shift in optimum, setting aside contributions from new mutations (which per our analyses could be substantial only during the equilibration phase of the non-Lande case).</p>
<p>We model variation in allelic contributions from standing variation assuming that allele trajectories are independent of one another. Under this assumption (alongside our assumptions of infinite sites and that the number of newly arising mutations follows a Poisson distribution), we conjecture that the number of segregating sites before the shift is well approximated by a Poisson distribution (with expectation approximated by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ54">Equation A3-26</xref> with <inline-formula>

</inline-formula> defined in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ51">Equation A3-23</xref>). Consequently, the number of segregating sites with any subset of magnitudes and initial MAFs also follows a Poisson distribution. This part of the model is akin to the ‘Poisson Random Field’ approximation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sawyer and Hartl, 1992</xref>), and is supported by our simulations (specifically, estimates of the variance and mean of the number of segregating sites are approximately equal across bins of effect sizes and initial MAFs). We then assume that allele trajectories after the shift are also independent and follow the processes we have described for the rapid and equilibration phases. We derive analytic approximations along these lines below (Section 7.2.1).</p>
<p>These simple approximations do well at describing the variance of allelic contributions to polygenic adaptation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig23">Appendix 3—figures 23</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig24">24</xref>). They suggest and simulations confirm that the variance of contributions during the rapid phase increases with the size of the shift in optimal phenotype, but is insensitive to the extent of polygenicity, or equivalently, to the mutational input (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ139">Equation A3-111</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig23">Appendix 3—figure 23</xref>). In contrast, the variance in contributions in the equilibration phase increases linearly with the mutational input, but is insensitive to the size of the shift (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ147">Equation A3-119</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig24">Appendix 3—figure 24</xref>). Some intuition for these dependencies is provided below, alongside deriving the analytic approximation.</p>

<p>Some intuition for this insensitivity can be gleaned from considering the variance introduced by random genetic drift (the 3<sup>rd</sup> term in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ131">Equation A3-103</xref>).

</inline-formula>) and thus the variance in frequency of individual alleles (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ134">Equation A3-106</xref>). Doubling the number of segregating sites, however, also doubles the number of sites contributing to phenotypic change, where the two effects cancel each other out. Coming up with simple intuitions for the other two variance terms (due to variation in the number of sites, and in their effect sizes and initial MAFs) is more challenging.</p>
<p>
<bold>The variance in the equilibration phase.</bold> We model the variance of allelic contributions to phenotypic change during the equilibration phase assuming mutation-selection-drift equilibrium, thus neglecting the effect of the shift in optimum. The variance of allelic contributions during equilibration arises from the stochasticity of fixations. Our findings suggest that directional selection due to the shift in optimum typically introduces only small differences between the fixation probabilities of aligned and opposing alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and Section 5). These small differences are important because they result in a nonzero expectation of fixed allelic contributions, which underlies long-term phenotypic adaptation. However, under most conditions the differences in fixation probabilities have a negligible effect on the variance of fixed contributions, which could be sizable at equilibrium. Exceptions might occur when the changes to fixation probabilities introduced by the shift in optimum are large relative to the fixation probabilities without the shift (at equilibrium). Specifically, the fixation probabilities of alleles with low initial frequencies exhibit marked changes in the non-Lande case with large shifts, due to prolonged, weak directional selection during the equilibration phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig17">Appendix 3—figure 17</xref>); this potentially explains the deviation from our approximation in the corresponding cases in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig24">Appendix 3—figure 24B</xref>. Setting these cases aside, we expect a model that neglects the effects of the shift to do well at approximating the variance of fixed allelic contributions.</p>
<p>We consider the variance that arises from sites that are segregating at the time of the shift in optimum. Neglecting the effects of directional selection, the fixed contribution of an allele with magnitude <inline-formula>

</inline-formula> is the expected number of segregating sites in the bin, which scales linearly with the mutational input, whereas the expression in parenthesis is a summary of the equilibrium architecture that is independent of the mutational input. Thus, we find that variance of the fixed allelic contribution is approximately linear in the mutational input. This makes intuitive sense: if the variance is dominated by the stochasticity of fixation at equilibrium, then it should scale linearly with the number of sites that are segregating before the shift, and hence with the mutational input.</p>

<bold>Interpreting the density of variance per unit mutational input.</bold> When we considered the expected allelic contributions to phenotypic adaptation, we expressed our results in terms of the &quot;relative contributions&quot; of sites of a given magnitude and/or initial MAF, which are densities per unit mutational input. The contribution from any subset of alleles, given any choice of model parameters, can be expressed as a simple integral over these relative contributions. For example, given the relative contribution from sites with magnitude <inline-formula>

<p>Unfortunately, this property does not apply to the relative contributions to variance. Taking analogous integrals of the relative contribution to variance over a given range of magnitudes and/or effect sizes would underestimate the variance in contributions arising from this range, because it would fail to account for the variation in magnitudes and initial MAFs of segregating sites in this range. This can be seen, for example, by calculating the variance associated with a bin of effect sizes, <inline-formula>

<title>8. The infinitesimal limit and Lande’s approximation</title>
<p>In the section on the phenotypic response, we note that Lande’s approximation corresponds to the infinitesimal limit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Turelli, 2017</xref>). Here we elaborate on this assertion by deriving the allelic and phenotypic equations in the infinitesimal limit, and by illustrating how to obtain this limit in our model.</p>
<p>To this end, we assume that in our model the phenotypic distribution becomes Normal in the infinitesimal limit—in which the number of segregating loci affecting a trait goes to infinity while their effects goes to zero such that genetic variance in the trait remains finite. This is a subtle point. Fisher argued that the central limit theorem implies that the phenotypic distribution should always be Normal in the infinitesimal limit (assuming that environmental contributions are normally distributed; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Fisher, 1918</xref>). This argument is not always valid, however: even with free recombination, natural selection can introduce systematic associations between alleles at different loci, which could violate the assumption of independence in the central limit theorem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Turelli, 2017</xref>). Nonetheless, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Turelli and Barton, 1990</xref> argue (and rigorously showed in the absence of drift) that in the special case of a Gaussian fitness function, the dependence among loci disappears in the infinitesimal limit, and thus, that the central limit theorem applies. Given that we assume a Gaussian fitness function we will therefore assume that the phenotypic distribution becomes Normal in the infinitesimal limit.</p>

<title>8.1. The phenotypic equation in the infinitesimal limit</title>
<p>We derive the phenotypic equation following the same steps as in Section 1. We begin with the allelic equation.

<p>As expected, this coincides with the expected genetic variance under mutation-drift equilibrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chakraborty and Nei, 1982</xref>).</p>
<p>We note that the infinitesimal limit violates two of our model assumptions, but examining the rationale for these assumptions indicates that one of them can be relaxed and the other can be modified in a straightforward way. The first assumption that is violated is that the number of mutations per gamete per generation <inline-formula>

<mml:mi>U</mml:mi>
<mml:mo>≤</mml:mo>

</inline-formula>, which was vital in the derivation of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ29">Equation A3-1</xref> for the expected per generation change in allele frequency. In the infinitesimal limit, we derived <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ161">Equation A3-133</xref> in its stead, where to this end we assumed that the phenotype distribution is Normal but did not require the phenotypic variance to be small relative to the width of the fitness function. The second assumption that is violated is that a substantial proportion of incoming mutations are subject to effective selection at equilibrium, i.e., with <inline-formula>

<p>This paper is an impressive look at an important problem: understanding the genetic underpinnings of evolution acting on a quantitative trait. The authors analytically study the response to an abrupt shift in phenotypic optimum, in terms of both phenotype and genetic basis (how various alleles/loci contribute to this response). The basic assumptions are classic, but the methods and findings are new (especially the finite population effects) and well supported by clear analytical approximations and extensive simulation checks. The main finding is that the relative contribution of large vs moderate effect alleles changes substantially and predictably over a long-time period after the shift, even though the phenotypic changes are already undetectable over this period.</p>

<bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold>
</p>
<p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Polygenic adaptation after a sudden change in environment&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Peter L Ralph (Reviewer #1); Guillaume Martin (Reviewer #2).</p>
<p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p>
<p>Essential revisions:</p>
<p>The reviewers and I appreciated the impressive steps made in the analysis of this important model. The paper is a difficult read, but that mostly reflects the challenging area and the broad scope of the results. Most of our comments focus on how the clarity could be improved.</p>
<p>1) The reviewers have numerous suggestions on improving the clarity of the model. In particular, I think we all struggled with the parallel tracks throughout the paper.</p>
<p>There is enough new intuition from the Lande-style results that there's an argument for putting more of the technical results about the skewed distribution into the appendix. This would improve the readability of the paper, and I think would likely significantly broaden what the average <italic>eLife</italic> reader could take away from the paper. More technical readers will likely read the appendix anyway if it is clearly signposted from the main text. That said, I'm not going to force this move on you, and many of the suggested improvements to the manuscript could be made without this big change</p>
<p>2) In our post-review discussion one point that came through clearly is that we all struggled to keep track of which of the simulation frameworks was being used at various points in the paper. Please make sure this is clearer throughout the manuscript.</p>
<p>I apologize for the somewhat slow turn around I think everyone (especially myself) is currently struggling to get things done.</p>
<p>Finally, the Coop lab discussed the preprint paper as part of our journal club, everyone liked it and got a lot out of the paper. We needed some more background on why large effect mutations lead to a skewed distribution under selection. We also felt like the results about skew changing the rate of approach to the optimum could be explained more. One of the lab members came up with the following argument:</p>
<p>&quot;When the phenotypic mean is far below the optimum (1-D^2/V_S &lt; 0), the phenotypic distribution sits on a convex part of the Gaussian fitness function. There, the positive skew of the phenotypic distribution, by shifting variance away from the left tail (where it is inefficiently selected) towards the right tail (where it is efficiently selected), increases the average efficiency of selection and therefore the rate at which the mean moves towards the optimum.</p>
<p>The opposite is true when the phenotypic mean is nearer the optimum though still not very close (1 &gt;&gt; 1-D^2/V_S &gt; 0), because then the phenotypic distribution sits on a concave part of the fitness function.</p>
<p>Finally, when the phenotypic mean is just below the optimum, so that the phenotypic distribution straddles the optimum, positive skew shifts variance away from the left tail (where it is relatively efficiently selected in the &quot;correct&quot; direction) towards the right tail (where it is relatively efficiently selected in the &quot;incorrect&quot; direction), and thus retards selection on the mean.&quot;</p>
<p>I am not sure if this argument is fully correct/useful, but I wanted to send it along in case it helped. I do think a little more intuition on this point would be useful.</p>
<p>
<italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic>
</p>
<p>This paper tackles an old but definitely unsolved issue (at least in my opinion, and this opinion is supported by the review of the literature in the intro).</p>
<p>One main limit in existing treatments of this model of gaussian fitness landscape has been either to tackle non equilibrium, or finite populations. The approach here proposes a methodology to fill this gap on both accounts, so I think it is a new and important contribution to theoretical quantitative genetics.</p>
<p>As a theoretician, I appreciated the appendix, which could be made a bit clearer there and then but is overall flowing and easy to follow, especially when it comes to understanding where we are going. I also appreciated the many illustrative figures in the appendix to check various steps in the approximations by simulations, and as a way to explore a wide parameter range. Overall, the accuracy of the approximations in the various figures is very good. These approximations are not rigorously derived as a limit for some parameter being small etc., some approximations are plugged into others (eg the linear or non linear lande and non lande cases), but we get an intuition of the idea behind the approx., and we get quite many simulations to back it up. Of course a rigorous treatment or a dedicated simulation paper might help identify the exact parameter range of validity, but these would be articles of their own. As such the paper is clearly dense enough!</p>
<p>I suggest that the authors clarify/emphasize two main points for the reader in main text</p>
<p>– First that the phenotypic dynamics are overall correctly approximated by the lande model in the parameter range that was analysed. Indeed, the deviations are much smaller than the main trend in Figure 2 for ex. For the main part of observable phenotypic adaptation (ie until t1). What is lande or non lande here is not this phenotypic mean trajectory but rather its consequences in the longer term dynamics (if I got this right). That should be emphasized and maybe cases where the lande model is not accurate to begin with should be shown too in the simulations.</p>
<p>– Second, therefore, the main contribution of the paper is on (i) obtaining the lande equation without the lande assumptions, (maybe, my knowledge of the vast literature is not large enough to knpw if the various derivations differ that much) and (ii) deriving the longer term dynamics after t1 and especially the genetic basis resuts (relative contribution of alleles as a function of their effect size). It would be nice to pull that string a bit further and illustrate a GWAS or QTL prediction between a pop staying in the original state and a pop having evolved in the new environment, either before t1, or after t1. This is to me the main impact that these results will have and it is somewhat not pushed to its final biological conclusion. Or I missed it and then it must be better put forward.</p>
<p>The paper is very long, both main text and the appendix. I found both flowing though, and that we were guided well into this elaborate modelling exercise. I don't know if this length will be a problematic criterion, that is for the editor to judge.</p>
<p>It was not always easy to know which type of simulations were used for each figure and check. The top check being the true individual based simulations of course. Maybe a table (sup info) dedicated to that would help clarify this without having to go back to methods to know which method is what.</p>
<p>In the intro maybe a link to other models mixing diffusion equation and deterministic pheno models would be nice, I am not sure I saw a reference to the stochastic house of cards approx. and its 'offspring' or to the zhang and hill methods I think.</p>

<p>We appreciate the importance of simplifying the presentation as much as possible, but have a good reason for keeping the deviations from Lande’s approximation in the main text. While these deviations typically have small effects on the phenotypic response (given our assumptions on model parameters), they have a qualitative impact on the allelic response, which is crucial to understanding the turnover in the genetic basis of adaptation over the longer term (during the equilibration phase). The impact of deviation from Lande’s approximation, notably of the third moment of the phenotypic distribution, on the long-term allelic response is quantified by the composite-parameter <inline-formula>
<mml:math id="sa2m1">
<mml:mstyle displaystyle="false" scriptlevel="0">

</mml:math>
</inline-formula> (defined in Equation 22). C=0 <italic>only in the infinitesimal limit</italic> (see the new Appendix 3, Section 8). In any realistic case, with a finite number of segregating alleles with nonzero phenotypic effects, C&gt;0; what we call Lande cases are just those in which C&lt;&lt;1. As the second reviewer suggested, we modified the text to make these points clearer. Specifically:</p>
<p>1) In the section on the <italic>phenotypic response,</italic> we now state that phenotypic deviations are typically small in the parameter ranges we consider. First, we say that (L 278):</p>
<p>“More generally, given our assumptions that polygenicity is high and that the shift is not too large (see Section 6 of Appendix 3) the deviations from Lande's approximation are usually small and their magnitude is determined by the distribution of allele effect sizes (see section on <italic>the allelic response in the rapid phase</italic> and Section 6 of Appendix 3)”,</p>
<p>and later in the same section, we add that (L 298):</p>
<p>“The same reasoning suggests that very large shifts in optima or low polygenicity could also lead to substantial changes to the 2nd and 3rd central moments of the phenotypic distribution (Section 6 of Appendix 3 and Barton and Turelli, 1987), but these cases violate our assumptions and are beyond the scope of this manuscript.”</p>
<p>2) After we define C (Equation 22 in <italic>the allelic response in the equilibration phase</italic>), we added a paragraph to explain its importance for the allele and phenotypic dynamics, and describe when the deviations from Lande’s approximation might become substantial (L 485):</p>
<p>“When alleles with larger effects contribute substantially to the variance at equilibrium (and <inline-formula>
<mml:math id="sa2m2">
<mml:mi id="a4142f96-0682-4305-bca7-287221650f13">C</mml:mi>
</mml:math>
</inline-formula> is appreciable), Lande's approximation becomes inaccurate. The prevalence of large effect alleles leads to a quasi-static decay of the mean distance from the new optimum, <inline-formula>
<mml:math id="sa2m3">
<mml:mi id="d30b3852-3bb8-4d93-a850-bd9ee3c4f592">D</mml:mi>
</mml:math>
</inline-formula>, during the equilibration phase (Figure 2D and the section on the <italic>phenotypic response</italic>). For the distance during the equilibration phase, and therefore for the deviations from Lande's phenotypic approximation to be substantial, would require that C&gt;&gt;1 (see Section 6 of Appendix 3), which implies that the vast majority (e.g., &gt; 90%) of the genetic variance at equilibrium arises from alleles with large effect sizes, say with a<sup>2</sup>&gt;&gt;4 (see Figure 5A and Equation 22). Even a small distance <inline-formula>
<mml:math id="sa2m4">
<mml:mi id="b5b2397d-b95e-4b5a-a54b-64d986ffd7b4">D</mml:mi>
</mml:math>
</inline-formula> during the equilibration phase, however, would result in prolonged, weak directional selection that could markedly amplify the difference in fixation probabilities between opposite alleles. Our linear Lande approximation does not account for this amplification, and it could therefore greatly underestimate the total long-term allelic contribution.”</p>
<p>3) In Appendix 3 Section 6, we demonstrate that given our assumptions on model parameters, the deviations from Lande’s approximation will be substantial only if C&gt;&gt;1.</p>

<p>We made several changes to clarify our use of simulations.</p>
<p>In the section on <italic>simulations and resources</italic> in the main text, we added the following to clarify when and why we use each type of simulation (L. 220): “In the main text, we use the simulations that afford the highest resolution in comparisons with analytical predictions, whereas in Section 2.2 of Appendix 3 we validate our main results against simulations that realize the full model (at a lower resolution). Specifically, we compare most of the predictions about the allele dynamics with the results of <italic>single allele</italic> simulations, running 250,000 replicas for any given allele effect size and optimum shift size (see parameter choices below). The <italic>single allele</italic> simulations do not describe phenotypic change or the trajectories of mutations that arise after the shift in optimum, however. We therefore compare the predictions for these processes with the results of the <italic>all alleles</italic> simulations; in these simulations, we run 2,500 replicas with any given set of parameters.”</p>
<p>We have also added a bullet-point description of the simulation parameters used in the main text (L. 229): “The simulations used in the main text correspond to the two qualitative phenotypic responses described below, which we refer to as the Lande and non-Lande (see <italic>results</italic>). Specifically, we use the following simulation parameter values:</p>

<p>In figure captions, we state which of the simulation types we used and refer the reader to the description in the <italic>simulations and resources</italic> section.</p>
<p>In Appendix 3, we moved up the section on simulations such that it appears early on (as Section 2) and before the figures in which simulations are used. We also added a bullet-point description (similar to the one in the main text) of the simulation parameters used in the Appendix (L. 942-964).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I apologize for the somewhat slow turn around I think everyone (especially myself) is currently struggling to get things done.</p>
<p>Finally, the Coop lab discussed the preprint paper as part of our journal club, everyone liked it and got a lot out of the paper. We needed some more background on why large effect mutations lead to a skewed distribution under selection. We also felt like the results about skew changing the rate of approach to the optimum could be explained more. One of the lab members came up with the following argument:</p>
<p>&quot;When the phenotypic mean is far below the optimum (1-D^2/V_S &lt; 0), the phenotypic distribution sits on a convex part of the Gaussian fitness function. There, the positive skew of the phenotypic distribution, by shifting variance away from the left tail (where it is inefficiently selected) towards the right tail (where it is efficiently selected), increases the average efficiency of selection and therefore the rate at which the mean moves towards the optimum.</p>
<p>The opposite is true when the phenotypic mean is nearer the optimum though still not very close (1 &gt;&gt; 1-D^2/V_S &gt; 0), because then the phenotypic distribution sits on a concave part of the fitness function.</p>
<p>Finally, when the phenotypic mean is just below the optimum, so that the phenotypic distribution straddles the optimum, positive skew shifts variance away from the left tail (where it is relatively efficiently selected in the &quot;correct&quot; direction) towards the right tail (where it is relatively efficiently selected in the &quot;incorrect&quot; direction), and thus retards selection on the mean.&quot;</p>
<p>I am not sure if this argument is fully correct/useful, but I wanted to send it along in case it helped. I do think a little more intuition on this point would be useful.</p>

<p>We agree with this explanation and have a similar one in Appendix 3 Section 1.2 (L 885-896), where we derive the phenotypic equation. We do not discuss the case in which <inline-formula>

<p>We did, however, add some intuition about the main terms of the phenotypic equation after it first appears (L. 251): “The 1<sup>st</sup> term on the right-hand side reflects selection to reduce the distance between the mean phenotype and the new optimum, which is proportional to this distance and to the additive genetic variance (Lande, 1976).

<p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p>
<p>This paper tackles an old but definitely unsolved issue (at least in my opinion, and this opinion is supported by the review of the literature in the intro).</p>
<p>One main limit in existing treatments of this model of gaussian fitness landscape has been either to tackle non equilibrium, or finite populations. The approach here proposes a methodology to fill this gap on both accounts, so I think it is a new and important contribution to theoretical quantitative genetics.</p>
<p>As a theoretician, I appreciated the appendix, which could be made a bit clearer there and then but is overall flowing and easy to follow, especially when it comes to understanding where we are going. I also appreciated the many illustrative figures in the appendix to check various steps in the approximations by simulations, and as a way to explore a wide parameter range. Overall, the accuracy of the approximations in the various figures is very good. These approximations are not rigorously derived as a limit for some parameter being small etc., some approximations are plugged into others (eg the linear or non linear lande and non lande cases), but we get an intuition of the idea behind the approx., and we get quite many simulations to back it up. Of course, a rigorous treatment or a dedicated simulation paper might help identify the exact parameter range of validity, but these would be articles of their own. As such the paper is clearly dense enough!</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you kindly. We greatly appreciate the careful reading of the paper and helpful comments on the pdf, especially on the many technical results in Appendix 3!</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I suggest that the authors clarify/emphasize two main points for the reader in main text</p>
<p>– First that the phenotypic dynamics are overall correctly approximated by the lande model in the parameter range that was analysed. Indeed, the deviations are much smaller than the main trend in Figure 2 for ex. For the main part of observable phenotypic adaptation (ie until t1). What is lande or non lande here is not this phenotypic mean trajectory but rather its consequences in the longer term dynamics (if I got this right). That should be emphasized and maybe cases where the lande model is not accurate to begin with should be shown too in the simulations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Great points! We heeded the reviewer’s advice.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>– Second, therefore, the main contribution of the paper is on (i) obtaining the lande equation without the lande assumptions, (maybe, my knowledge of the vast literature is not large enough to knpw if the various derivations differ that much) and (ii) deriving the longer term dynamics after t1 and especially the genetic basis resuts (relative contribution of alleles as a function of their effect size). It would be nice to pull that string a bit further and illustrate a GWAS or QTL prediction between a pop staying in the original state and a pop having evolved in the new environment, either before t1, or after t1. This is to me the main impact that these results will have and it is somewhat not pushed to its final biological conclusion. Or I missed it and then it must be better put forward.</p>

<p>Scope of Lande’s approximation. As far as we know, this is the first time that Lande’s equation has been derived without making Lande’s assumptions (see new <italic>Appendix 3</italic> Section 8). When the number of loci and their effects are finite there is always some deviations from Lande’s approximation; however, as we discuss and illustrate in the section on the <italic>phenotypic response</italic> (L 272-284), Lande’s approximation works well for a wide range of parameters.</p>
<p>Relatedly, in the annotated pdf you asked us for a citation for our allelic and phenotypic equations (Equations 1 and 2 in Appendix 3); to the best of our knowledge, these equations are new. Specifically, in the case of a Gaussian fitness function, which we have considered, Barton and Turelli (1987) derive approximations based on the assumption that the distance of the mean from the optimum is far smaller than the width of the fitness function, i.e., that <inline-formula>

<p>Predictions for genetic differentiation between populations. We actually do provide predictions for population differentiation with and without changes in environment, although they are phrased in slightly different terms. Notably, Figure 7 shows these predictions over the long-term (also see L. 587-598 in the same section). In brief, we find that the shift would typically result in a slight excess of fixations of alleles that are aligned with the shift relative to opposing ones (Figure 7B), and a slight increase in the total number of fixations compared to the case without the change in environment (Figure 7C). In the <italic>discussion</italic>, we also consider the implications of this finding to the question of identifying adaptive changes (L. 724-765). The short-term behavior is summarized in Figure 4 and Appendix 3-figures 8-11, relating the changes in frequency with effect size and initial frequency. Doubtless, more can be done.</p>

<p>In the intro maybe a link to other models mixing diffusion equation and deterministic pheno models would be nice, I am not sure I saw a reference to the stochastic house of cards approx. and its 'offspring' or to the zhang and hill methods I think.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Having looked up the papers we thought the reviewer is alluding to, we remain unclear about what they mean by “other models mixing diffusion equation and deterministic pheno models” or more generally, how their methods and questions relate to our analysis. Specifically, we looked at Burger, Wagner and Stettinger (1989) and at Zhang and Hill (2002) Pleiotropic Model of Maintenance of Quantitative Genetic Variation at Mutation-selection Balance and (2003) Multivariate Stabilizing Selection and Pleiotropy in the Maintenance of Quantitative Variation; it is of course possible that the reviewer had other papers in mind.</p>
<p>Our reading of the house of cards approximations, for example, suggests that they are primarily concerned with the maintenance of quantitative genetic variation at equilibrium under explicit or apparent stabilizing selection. They typically rely on three assumptions: (1) A continuum of possible alleles at a <italic>fixed</italic> number of loci (in contrast, we use a bi-allelic, infinite sites model). (2) That selection at each locus dominates over mutation (we implicitly make the same assumption by using an infinite-sites model). (3) That all alleles have <inline-formula>

</inline-formula>. We do not make this last assumption, which is important because weakly and moderately selected alleles are plausibly common, and they play a crucial role in the allelic adaptive response (and in genetic variance, actually).</p>
<p>Our reading of Burger, Wagner and Stettinger (1989) and Zhang and Hill (2003) suggests that stochastic house of cards approximations of phenotypic variance are typically derived using a diffusion approximation, under assumptions 1-3. Importantly, we didn’t see how the stochastic house of cards type papers mixed deterministic and stochastic methods. It is nonetheless possible that we missed something, as this literature is vast and complex!</p>
