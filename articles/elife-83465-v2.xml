Several collagens have been proposed to influence Aβ aggregate formation, yet their role in clearance is unknown. To investigate the potential role of collagens in forming and clearance of extracellular aggregates in vivo, we created a transgenic <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> strain that expresses and secretes human Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>. This secreted Aβ forms aggregates in two distinct places within the extracellular matrix. In a screen for extracellular human Aβ aggregation regulators, we identified different collagens to ameliorate or potentiate Aβ aggregation. We show that a disintegrin and metalloprotease a disintegrin and metalloprotease 2 (ADM-2), an ortholog of ADAM9, reduces the load of extracellular Aβ aggregates. ADM-2 is required and sufficient to remove the extracellular Aβ aggregates. Thus, we provide in vivo evidence of collagens essential for aggregate formation and metalloprotease participating in extracellular Aβ aggregate removal.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Alzheimer's disease</kwd><kwd>amyloid beta</kwd><kwd>aggregation</kwd><kwd>ADAM9</kwd><kwd>TIMP</kwd><kwd>collagen</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PP00P3_163898</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ewald</surname><given-names>Collin Yvès</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>190072</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jongsma</surname><given-names>Elisabeth</given-names></name><name><surname>Goyala</surname><given-names>Anita</given-names></name><name><surname>Ewald</surname><given-names>Collin Yvès</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> model that secretes human amyloid beta forms aggregates in the extracellular matrix, which are removed by activation of extracellular matrix dynamics.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) currently affects &gt;1 in 9 people above 65 years of age (11.2%) in the USA and is the seventh cause of death worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alzheimer’s Association, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mortality and global health estimates, 2019</xref>). A hallmark of AD is the extracellular aggregation of amyloid beta (Aβ). Over the past decades, much knowledge has been gained on the production and removal of Aβ. Several mechanisms are involved in clearing Aβ from the brain, including enzymatic and non-enzymatic pathways. The non-enzymatic pathways include the continuous flow of the interstitial fluid into the cerebrospinal fluid followed by interstitial fluid drainage, phagocytosis by microglia or astrocytes, and receptor-mediated transport across the blood-brain barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elbert et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sagare et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tajbakhsh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). The enzymatic pathway involves several proteases, including matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), neprilysin, insulin-degrading enzymes, and glutamate carboxypeptidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nalivaeva et al., 2012</xref>). The extracellular protein heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) can block the clearance of Aβ. HSPGs are often found in Aβ depositions where they might block enzymatic degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gupta-Bansal et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Su et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">van Horssen et al., 2002</xref>). Moreover, while most HSPGs promote the uptake of Aβ through lipid rafts, uptake of Aβ through clathrin-mediated endocytosis is blocked when the HSPG (SDC3) binds to Aβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Letoha et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>One of the least understood observations is the consistent co-aggregation of specific collagens with Aβ plaques. Interestingly, the compaction of Aβ into plaques can be influenced by the expression of collagenous amyloid plaque components (CLACs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hashimoto et al., 2020</xref>). CLAC is a collagen type XXV a1 chain (COL25A1) cleavage product. COL25A1 overexpression can have detrimental effects in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tong et al., 2010</xref>). However, human genetic studies suggest a more complex interplay where certain single nucleotide polymorphisms in COL25A1 are associated with AD and others are, in contrast, associated with health effects in the elderly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Erikson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Forsell et al., 2010</xref>). Curiously, several other collagens have been found to have a protective role. Colocalizing with vascular amyloid at the basal lamina is collagen XVIII, an HSPG that reduces disease symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">van Horssen et al., 2002</xref>). Collagen VI was found at the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the basal lamina and can block the interaction between neurons and oligomers and help protect against neurotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ma et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, the basement lamina collagen IV was 55% upregulated in cerebral vessels when comparing AD to healthy subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Farkas et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kalaria and Pax, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nguyen et al., 2021</xref>). A positive correlation was reported between disease progression (Braak stage) and collagen IV deposition. With each group: control (Braak stage &lt;2), preclinical (Braak stage &gt;2, &lt;4), and AD patients (Braak stage &gt;4), an increase in collagen IV deposition was found per mm2 gray matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lepelletier et al., 2017</xref>). Collagen IV was shown to bind the amyloid precursor protein (APP), prevent Aβ fibril formation, and even disrupt preformed Aβ fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kiuchi et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kiuchi et al., 2002b</xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Narindrasorasak et al., 1995</xref>). Based on these collected studies, we hypothesized that the ECM may be more than a passive bystander and that its components hold the potential to influence disease progression.</p><p>To address this hypothesis, we set out to explore the mechanisms by which ECM components influence Aβ aggregate formation and clearance in vivo. However, a model monitoring this in vivo and non-invasively was missing. Therefore, we generated a novel transgenic <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> strain with inducible expression and secretion of human Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> tagged with super-folder GFP (sfGFP::Aβ). Furthermore, <italic>C. elegans</italic> is a suitable model to address this question. Several Alzheimer-related pathways are highly conserved between humans and <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Apostolakou et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ewald and Li, 2010</xref>). Moreover, the ECM components associated with AD have orthologs in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The <italic>C. elegans</italic> EMB-9 and LET-2 are collagen type IV, CLE-1 is collagen type XVIII, and COL-99 is collagen type XXV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Teuscher et al., 2019a</xref>). While EMB-9 and LET-2 localize to the basal lamina, CLE-1 and COL-99 localize to neurons.</p><p>Here, we show that upon induction, secreted sfGFP::Aβ is initially cleared by the excretory system, the gut, and the coelomocytes. However, Aβ is retained past 24 hr and forms non-mobile structures in the ECM. We identified collagens that can completely suppress Aβ aggregate formation. Moreover, we find modulators of the ECM, metalloproteases, to assist in the removal of extracellular Aβ aggregates. We demonstrate that one of these metalloproteases, a disintegrin and metalloprotease 2 (ADM-2), is essential to remove Aβ aggregates. Taken together, this suggests that ECM composition is critical to allow Aβ aggregate formation, while dynamic regulation of the ECM through metalloproteases is key in Aβ aggregate clearance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generating an in vivo model for extracellular Aβ aggregates</title><p>An obstacle to studying the interaction of the ECM with Aβ aggregation and clearance is the lack of an in vivo model. Previous human Aβ expressing <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains failed to secrete Aβ and model intracellular Aβ toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ewald and Li, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Link, 1995</xref>). Therefore, we designed a genetic construct that secretes Aβ tagged with GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Expression of this construct was induced by heat shock under the control of the <italic>hsp-16.2</italic> promoter that drives expression in many tissues but predominantly in neurons and hypodermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bacaj and Shaham, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, the construct has a longer 3’ UTR targeting its mRNA for non-sense-mediated degradation to prevent the leakage of the <italic>hsp-16.2</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ewald et al., 2016</xref>). This allowed us to separate events scaled in time, for example, deposition versus removal of Aβ. We used sfGFP because it is more stable in the extracellular space than classical GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pédelacq et al., 2006</xref>). A spacer sequence was placed between the sfGFP and the Aβ to allow the comparably smaller-sized Aβ to move and interact freely to form aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). The full length of the Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> peptide is essential for its aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McColl et al., 2012</xref>). In our construct, Aβ is preceded by the sfGFP and spacer sequence, which prevents the truncation of the first few amino acids observed in many previous <italic>C. elegans</italic> Aβ models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McColl et al., 2009</xref>). As controls, we generated two constructs: one containing a non-aggregating version of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> (secreted sfGFP::Aβ(F20S, L35P)) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wurth et al., 2002</xref>), and the other control is the secreted sfGFP without Aβ fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Expression of secreted human amyloid beta (Aβ) tagged with super-folder GFP (sfGFP).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Genetic constructs used to generate transgenic <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains.

Only after heat shock in the transgenic LSD2104 sfGFP::Aβ <italic>C. elegans</italic>, a strong band below 55 kDa and a weaker band below are visible, which correspond to the expected sizes for our transgenic fusion protein of human Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> with sfGFP::Aβ of 44.6 kDa and cleaved one of 42.2 kDa in the anti-Aβ blot (top panel).

This Aβ localization changed over time. Initially, Aβ localized to neurons in the nerve ring, the gut, the canal cells, the excretory canal, the canal-associated neurons, and the uterus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). During the first 24 hr, most of the sfGFP::Aβ appeared diffuse. After 24 hr, we observed bright puncta localized to the pharyngeal cuticle, the coelomocytes, and the cuticle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). By western blotting using GFP or Aβ antibodies, we confirmed that these sfGFP::Aβ fluorescent puncta contain the human Aβ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Remarkably, these sfGFP::Aβ fluorescent puncta remained for an exceptionally long time at the cuticle, coelomocytes, and the uterus, up to 8 days after induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether this is due to the potential aggregation of Aβ, we followed sfGFP::Aβ intensity in a pulse-chase time course, including our two controls. After heat shock, all three strains showed similar time course trajectories for the induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, at the 24 hr time point where the sfGFP::Aβ was observed at the cuticle, the non-aggregating sfGFP::Aβ(F20S, L35P), and the sfGFP-only strains almost completely lost the GFP signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>). No localization to the cuticle was observed at this time point. Taken together, this suggests these sfGFP-linked Aβ were secreted and efficiently cleared from the extracellular spaces. At the same time, the retention at the cuticle after 24 hr was specific to Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> due to its ability to form aggregates. In search of mechanisms selectively affecting the aggregation-prone Aβ, all further interventions were assessed at 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Hence, we have generated a transgenic strain expressing and secreting aggregation-prone sfGFP::Aβ that, after initial clearance, is retained at the cuticle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>sfGFP::Aβ forms ‘flower’ and ‘moss’ patterns in the extracellular space</title><p>To characterize the potential sfGFP::Aβ aggregates in the extracellular space, we compared the non-aggregating sfGFP::Aβ(F20S, L35P) with the aggregation-prone sfGFP::Aβ. At 16 hr post-induction, the non-aggregating sfGFP::Aβ(F20S, L35P) formed a striped pattern, equally distributed along the body, reminiscent of the striped pattern of furrows on the cuticle. This signal was relatively weak and uniform, similar to the GFP-only strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> [intensity enhanced], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). By contrast, sfGFP::Aβ formed two types of bright structures, which we named ‘flower’ and ‘moss’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Interestingly, the ‘flower’ structures were exclusively found over the nematode’s dorsal and ventral sides, where muscle tissue underlies the hypodermis.

A small area within the image field was photobleached using a brief exposure to UV, quenching the GFP fluorescence. Free movement or transport of the fluorescently tagged protein should lead to an exchange of molecules between the bleached and unbleached area, resulting in a recovery of fluorescence in the bleached (dark) area over time. In the moss structure, no such recovery was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Even when one-half of a single moss structure was photobleached, there was no recovery in the bleached area, indicating no movement or exchange of molecules even within the structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Upon photobleaching, the flower structures turn completely dark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The surrounding, relatively low GFP intensity recovered rapidly (within seconds), but the flower structure remained dark. No recovery of signal inside the structure was observed; however, after 4 hr, some bright dots were observed on the edge of the flower structures, indicating potential growth or exchange of Aβ from outside the photobleached area. However, this was observed only at the border and not at the center of the flower structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), suggesting confinement on the upper and lower part of this structure as it would be ‘sandwiched’ between something. For both the flower and moss structures, the absence of fluorescence recovery for up to 4 hr confirmed that these structures are immobile, suggesting that these structures are aggregates.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Distinct aggregate patterns on the cuticular ECM</title><p>To determine where these structures localize, we used correlative light and electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mateos et al., 2018</xref>).

We identified 176 from 2368 screened genes to increase or decrease sfGFP::Aβ intensity in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). To prioritize hits, we categorized these candidate genes into four groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). In category 1, we grouped hits expected to affect sfGFP::Aβ, such as genes involved in protein homeostasis, chaperones, and protein degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Reassuringly, we identified 71 orthologs of AD implicated genes (category 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), suggesting the conservation of key molecular players relevant to human disease. We also identified interesting hits with less established relationships to AD, such as vesicle transport and vesicle fusion, as well as members of the SNARE complex (category 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). When interrogating these hits with follow-up experiments, the change in sfGFP::Aβ aggregation could be explained by alternative mechanisms, such as impaired secretion or endosome recycling. Lastly, in category 4, we found that the knockdown of MMP increased Aβ levels, whereas the knockdown of their inhibitors (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases [TIMP]) decreased the Aβ levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Furthermore, the knockdown of several individual collagens either increased or decreased sfGFP::Aβ fluorescence, which reinforced the idea of a potentially active role of ECM components in Aβ aggregation and Aβ aggregate removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Collagens implicated in Aβ aggregate formation</title><p>To determine the role of collagens in Aβ aggregation and Aβ aggregate removal, we examined flower and moss Aβ aggregates upon collagen knockdown.

By contrast, cuticular collagens <italic>dpy-3</italic> and <italic>col-89</italic> knockdown resulted in the complete absence of moss and flower Aβ aggregates, and <italic>col-8</italic>(RNAi) showed a marked reduction in Aβ aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). As previously reported, DPY-3 is required for furrow formation of the cuticle, and animals lacking DPY-3 show disturbance of cuticular organization combined with a shortened and thicker body shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sandhu et al., 2021</xref>). DPY-3 is expressed during early developmental stages, while COL-8 and COL-89 are expressed during the last larval stage L4. The aggregates may require a particular ECM composition or specific collagens to form aggregates, or the knockdown of some collagens triggers overall ECM remodeling aiding the removal of aggregates. To separate these possibilities, we compared the knockdown of these collagens starting at different time points: RNAi beginning at the first larval stage (L1) to RNAi starting at the last larval stage (L4). We found that DPY-3 was required from early development for aggregates to form but not at later stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). For COL-8 and COL-89, the effects of RNAi on intensity and aggregates were present when knocked down from the L4 stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>).

CLE-1 has been reported to be expressed in neurons and muscles and localizes predominantly around synapses and neuromuscular junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackley et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heljasvaara et al., 2017</xref>). Since RNAi is incompletely penetrant and less effective in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Asikainen et al., 2005</xref>), we used a mutant for this neuronal-expressed collagen.

The mScarlet-I fluorophore is situated at the cytoplasmic domain so as not to obstruct ADM-2 activity in the extracellular space. While the initial localization was the same as they are both induced by the same promoter, ADM-2::mScarlet-I did not colocalize with sfGFP::Aβ aggregates at 24 hr after induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This could be either due to the mScarlet tag being intracellular, that is, only membrane-bound ADM-2 was visible, or ADM-2 efficiently removed nearby sfGFP::Aβ. ADM-2 overexpression showed a trend toward a reduced count and intensity of both moss and flower aggregates at 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Thus, we propose the model that TIMP(CRI-2) inhibits ADAM (ADM-2) to either directly reduce Aβ aggregation or indirectly via ECM remodeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Aβ plaques are a hallmark of AD. Collagen is consistently found within these plaques, but a functional relation between Aβ and collagens has not been shown in vivo. We assessed the interaction between ECM components and regulators of ECM turnover for a potential mediating role in amyloid pathology, using novel <italic>C. elegans</italic> transgenic strains to express and secrete human Aβ, Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>. This Aβ was found to form two types of extracellular aggregates associated with underlying tissue type. Targeted genetic knockdown showed mediating effects on aggregation by several extracellular proteins, including collagens and metalloproteases. A complete absence of aggregation was observed for the knockdown of <italic>dpy-3</italic> and <italic>col-8</italic> collagens. From a selection of metalloproteases, ADM-2 were found to be most effective in reducing Aβ aggregation. We found overexpression of ADM-2 to be sufficient to remove extracellular Aβ aggregates in vivo. These findings support a potential active, mediating role for ECM components on Aβ aggregation.</p><p>Generally, metalloproteases are known for their function in mediating ECM remodeling by cleaving collagens. While some collagens are long-lived ECM components, ECM turnover allows for damage repair (wound healing) or in response to other tissue demands, such as exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ewald, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kritikaki et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xue and Jackson, 2015</xref>). In combination with the collagens we found, this could imply that ADM-2 assists in the removal of Aβ aggregates by remodeling the ECM. The collagen components that, when the expression is knocked down, suppress aggregate formation suggest that there are ECM composition requirements for aggregates to form. It is unclear if these specific collagens are required for direct interaction with Aβ before aggregate formation or if a more general structural composition within the ECM is required. However, these data support the concept that ECM dynamics are fundamental to Aβ aggregation, and ECM remodeling contributes to aggregate removal.</p><p>Another category identified in the RNAi screen bridges the extracellular and intracellular environments and involves clathrin-mediated endocytosis, the sorting endosome, and (targeted) vesicle secretion. In our screen, the knockdown of RAB-7 led to an abundant accumulation of small, bright green vesicles near the cuticle, while aggregates remained absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, members of the ESCRT complex, as well as SNAREs and sorting nexins, were indicated to alter the localization, accumulation, and aggregate formation of Aβ. Conceptually, ECM remodeling and vesicle uptake and secretion may serve a common purpose regarding dynamic ECM adaptations. In the process of ECM turnover, metalloproteases are actively cleaving ECM components such as collagens and fibronectins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shi and Sottile, 2011</xref>), and the resulting cleaved products are internalized via receptor-mediated phagocytosis and degraded in the lysosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arora et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, to secrete metalloproteases, newly synthesized collagens, or Aβ to the ECM, the sorting endosome and (vesicle) secretion pathways are in play (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2021</xref>). As such, these seemingly distinct mechanisms could all work together for the collective purpose of extracellular aggregate removal.</p><p>In recent work, ADM-2 overexpression was shown to lead to molting defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Joseph et al., 2021</xref>). To allow growth, the cuticle of <italic>C. elegans</italic> is shed and replaced by a new cuticle, secreted and deposited by hypodermal cells underneath the cuticle. Initiation of the molt requires the internalization of sterol hormones and activating a cascade of proteases to mediate the shedding of the old cuticle. As such, molting depends on ECM remodeling, in which ADM-2 plays an essential role. Interestingly, one of the potential targets of ADM-2 cleavage revealed in that work is LRP-1, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> low-density lipoprotein receptor orthologous to human LRP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Joseph et al., 2021</xref>). LRP-1 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is a membrane-bound receptor, which can sequester sterols from the extracellular environment, and when internalized together, these sterols can initiate molting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yochem et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>ADM-2 is suggested to cleave LRP-1 and release it from the membrane, then referred to as sLRP. Although this sLRP-1 can still capture sterols, they are not internalized, leading to incomplete shedding of the cuticle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Joseph et al., 2021</xref>). Genes involved in <italic>C. elegans</italic> molting that are a hit in our screen are <italic>dab-1, hgrs-1,</italic> and <italic>apl-1</italic>. DAB-1 is a cytoplasmic adaptor protein involved in endocytosis. Endocytosis of sterols is essential for molting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lažetić and Fay, 2017</xref>). HGRS-1 is a Vps27 ortholog, which recruits ESCRT machinery to endosomes. Inhibition of HGRS-1 leads to molting defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lažetić and Fay, 2017</xref>). Interestingly, HGRS-1 and ADM-2 colocalize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Joseph et al., 2021</xref>), which suggests they may be involved in similar pathways through direct interaction. Loss of APL-1, the APP ortholog, causes lethal defects upon shedding the cuticle, which is rescued by the expression of the extracellular part of APL-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hornsten et al., 2007</xref>). The association of multiple genes involved in the molting process with an increase in sfGFP::Aβ load and aggregate formation in adult <italic>C. elegans</italic> suggests that changes in ECM dynamics can influence amyloid aggregate load. However, the exact role of ADM-2 and its potential targets needs further refining.</p><p>The human ortholog of ADM-2, ADAM9, has been implicated in AD and is suggested to regulate the shedding of APP as an alpha-secretase, either indirectly by regulating ADAM10 or by functioning as an alpha-secretase itself, cleaving APP in a non-amyloidogenic manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Asai et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moss et al., 2011</xref>). The cleavage site for alpha-secretase is situated in the middle of the Aβ fragment, potentially allowing direct cleavage of Aβ peptides. Moreover, human ADAM9 can be alternatively spliced, losing its transmembrane and cellular domains, resulting in an extracellular, active enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hotoda et al., 2002</xref>). This could potentially be a way for ADM-2 to reach the Aβ aggregates in the cuticle. As an ortholog of ADAM9, ADM-2 could potentially cleave Aβ directly and, as such, assist in the removal of extracellular aggregates.</p><p>In conclusion, we established an in vivo model to trace Aβ aggregation in the ECM. Our findings suggest that activating ECM remodeling promotes aggregate removal and could become an important strategy to ameliorate AD disease progression.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strain handling</title><p>Preparation of NGM agar plates, feeding with OP50 <italic>Escherichia coli,</italic> and handling of <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains by picking as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stiernagle, 2006</xref>.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jeannie Chin as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Evandro Fei Fang (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Although the reviewers found that the current study is of interest, they all raise major concerns that need to be addressed.

In brief, we prepared <italic>C. elegans</italic> samples into soluble and insoluble fractions and used higher Urea concentrations to solubilize the ECM. The predicted cleavage based on human ADAM9 and APP (https://doi.org/10.1016/S0006-291X(02)02999-6, doi: 10.1074/jbc.M111.280495) is after amino acid 17 in Abeta(1-42), resulting in the cleaving-off of a 2.5 kDa fragment of our sfGFP::Aβ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>). By western blot, we detected these two predicted sizes of full-length sfGFP::Aβ (44.6 kDa) and cleaved sfGFP::Aβ (42.2 kDa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref>). In both wild type (N2) and sfGFP::Aβ(F20S, L35P) non-aggregation forming (AβΔ), we do not detect any GFP tagged Abeta, suggesting that we look at the aggregated and insoluble Abeta (potentially from the ECM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref>). The sfGFP::Aβ (Aβ) showed a similar ratio of full-length sfGFP::Aβ (44.6 kDa) and cleaved sfGFP::Aβ (42.2 kDa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref>, C). In cri-2 mutants (cri-2(gk314); sfGFP::Aβ (Aβ cri-2)), the cleaved Abeta is higher, consistent with the release of inhibition and higher activity of metalloproteases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref>, C). The adm-2 mutants (adm-2(ok1204); sfGFP::Aβ (Aβ adm-2), seem to have higher Abeta levels with a neglectable reduction in cleaved Abeta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref>, C). However, the double mutation cri-2; adm-2 (adm-2(ok1204); cri-2(gk314); sfGFP::Aβ (Aβ double) has higher Abeta levels, but the ratio of cleaved vs full-length is not higher as seen in single mutant cri-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref>, C), consistent with the model that CRI-2 inhibits ADM-2 function for cleaving Abeta and removal of aggregates levels.</p><p>Although we find this observation intriguing, to really prove this, further experiments are required, such as Mass-spec verification of fragments and generating an “adm-2-non-cleavable human Abeta”. For this, protocol development and other resources are required that are beyond the scope of this study but should be addressed in a new project. Therefore, we leave this tantalizing preliminary data here in the response letter and only propose this possibility in the discussion of a potential direct MoA for ADM-2.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>“The human ortholog of ADM-2, ADAM9, has been implicated in AD and is suggested to regulate the shedding of APP as an α-secretase, either indirectly by regulating ADAM10 or by functioning as an α-secretase itself, cleaving APP in a non-amyloidogenic manner (Asai et al., 2003; Moss et al., 2011). The cleavage site for α-secretase is situated in the middle of the Aβ fragment, potentially allowing direct cleavage of Aβ peptides. Moreover, human ADAM9 can be alternatively spliced, losing its transmembrane and cellular domains, resulting in an extracellular, active enzyme (Hotoda et al., 2002). This could potentially be a way for ADM-2 to reach the Aβ aggregates in the cuticle. As an ortholog of ADAM9, ADM-2 could potentially cleave Aβ directly and, as such, assist in the removal of extracellular aggregates.”</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Potential direct MoA for ADM-2 in Abeta cleavage.</title><p>(A) Amino acid sequence of human Abeta with predicted cleaved-off fragment (in red) after ADAM9 cleavage.

Based on previous findings from Joseph et al., 2021, we discuss this in two paragraphs in the discussion.</p><p>“In recent work, ADM-2 overexpression was shown to lead to molting defects (Joseph et al., 2021). To allow growth, the cuticle of <italic>C. elegans</italic> is shed and replaced by a new cuticle, secreted and deposited by hypodermal cells underneath the cuticle. Initiation of the molt requires the internalization of sterol hormones and activating a cascade of proteases to mediate the shedding of the old cuticle. As such, molting depends on ECM remodeling, in which ADM-2 plays an essential role. Interestingly, one of the potential targets of ADM-2 cleavage revealed in that work is LRP-1, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> low-density lipoprotein receptor orthologous to human LRP1 (Joseph et al., 2021). LRP-1 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is a membrane-bound receptor, which can sequester sterols from the extracellular environment, and when internalized together, these sterols can initiate molting (Yochem et al., 1999).</p><p>ADM-2 is suggested to cleave LRP-1 and release it from the membrane, then referred to as sLRP. Although this sLRP-1 can still capture sterols, they are not internalized, leading to incomplete shedding of the cuticle (Joseph et al., 2021). Genes involved in <italic>C. elegans</italic> molting that are a hit in our screen are dab-1, hgrs<sup>-1</sup>, and apl-1. DAB-1 is a cytoplasmic adaptor protein involved in endocytosis. Endocytosis of sterols is essential for molting (Lažetić and Fay, 2017). HGRS<sup>-1</sup> is a Vps27 ortholog, which recruits ESCRT machinery to endosomes. Inhibition of HGRS<sup>-1</sup> leads to molting defects (Lažetić and Fay, 2017). Interestingly, HGRS<sup>-1</sup> and ADM-2 colocalize (Joseph et al., 2021), which suggests they may be involved in similar pathways through direct interaction. Loss of APL-1, the APP ortholog, causes lethal defects upon shedding the cuticle, which is rescued by the expression of the extracellular part of APL-1 (Hornsten et al., 2007). The association of multiple genes involved in the molting process with an increase in sfGFP::Aβ load and aggregate formation in adult <italic>C. elegans</italic> suggests that changes in ECM dynamics can influence amyloid aggregate load. However, the exact role of ADM-2 and its potential targets needs further refining.”</p><p>To test this idea of indirect effects on Abeta aggregates levels by ECM changes, we rationalized to use of a red fluorescent tagged collagen marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). We crossed the LSD2104 sfGFP::Aβ strain with a CRISPR-inserted wormScartlet into cuticular collagen rol-6 (ROL-6::mScarlet, a generous gift from Cathy Savage-Dunn; https://doi.org/10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.75906). The cuticular collagen ROL-6::mScarlet appears beneath the sfGFP::Aβ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>), consistent with our confocal images where sfGFP::Aβ is sandwiched between the two cuticle layers. Next, we knock down several collagen hits from our screen that either increased or decreased sfGFP::Aβ levels, including col-119, col-136, and col-137 (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref>), dpy-7 (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig5">Author response image 5</xref>), col-146, col-147, col-153, col-164, and col-180 (not shown). We found that the knockdown of col-119, col-136, and col-137 cuticular collagens affects sfGFP::Aβ aggregates but not the ECM morphology represented by collagen ROL-6::mScarlet. By contrast, dpy-7 RNAi altered ECM morphology represented by collagen ROL-6::mScarlet and resulted in no extracellular sfGFP::Aβ aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig5">Author response image 5</xref>). These results indicate dependent and independent mechanisms of ECM changes on extracellular sfGFP::Aβ aggregates.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Collagen ROL-6::mScarlet.</title><p>Representative image of ROL-6::mScarlet pattern both underneath the muscle and hypodermal tissues.

The rationale was if ECM remodeling is required for sfGFP::Aβ aggregation formation or removal from the cuticle, then these pharmacological interventions should affect sfGFP::Aβ levels. We found that de novo collagen synthesis (BPY as a prolyl 4-hydroxylase inhibitor) reduced sfGFP::Aβ levels, whereas inhibiting collagen crosslinking (BAPN as a lysyl oxidase inhibitor) increased sfGFP::Aβ levels (see new Supporting Figure 4.1). Furthermore, blocking collagen degradation with MMP-inhibitor batimastat resulted in higher sfGFP::Aβ levels (Figure 5B). These data suggest that interfering with ECM remodeling might be functionally implicated in sfGFP::Aβ aggregation.</p><p>In summary, we depicted this direct and indirect MoA of ADM-2 as a hypothetical model in Figure 6G. We hope this clarifies the potential MoA of ADM-2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is unknown whether collagens escalation increases aggregate formation.</p></disp-quote><p>We are not sure what the reviewer means by collagen escalation (defined as an increase in the intensity or seriousness of something; an intensification). If collagen escalation refers to collagen dynamics or remodeling, then please see above “indirect MoA of ADM-2” the new pharmacological experiments with collagen biogenesis and stability inhibitors (shown in Supporting Figure 4.1). If escalation refers to higher collagen levels, then we would like to direct the attention to the batimastat experiments in Figure 5A-B. Batimastat is a broad-range metalloproteinase inhibitor, thereby blocking collagen degradation and essentially leading to “overexpression” or collagen intensification in the cuticle. With the batimastat inhibitor, we observed higher sfGFP::Aβ levels (Figure 5B). Whether and how transgenic overexpression of collagen directly would increase Abeta aggregation, we did not investigate for the following reasons. First, there are 180 collagens in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (DOI: 10.1016/j.mbplus.2018.11.001). We would need to generate a “screen” by either transgenic overexpression or using CRISPR activation (DOI:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2022.102085). Although this would be feasible, generating that many transgenic lines or sgRNA guides would be another Ph.D. project by itself. Second, we had shown that overexpression of collagen COL-120 increases the levels of other collagens (COL-10, COL-144, etc.) and also enzymes that remodel the ECM (doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.08.30.505802), suggesting the induction of broad ECM dynamics or turnover.</p><p>Taken together, this suggests that collagen dynamics or remodeling plays a role in Aβ aggregation levels in the ECM.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There is no direct evidence to prove that the GFP-positive aggregates do contain human Aβ. This can be achieved by methods including: Western blot to show aggregated Aβ, electron microscopy to observe Aβ fibrils, and immunostaining showing the colocalization between GFP fluorescence and human Aβ.</p></disp-quote><p>To provide evidence that the GFP-positive aggregates contain human Aβ, we performed Western blotting using GFP and human Aβ antibodies. Day 1 wild type (N2) and transgenic LSD2104 sfGFP::Aβ adults were heat-shocked to induce Aβ aggregates. 24 h later, when the remaining sfGFP::Aβ has formed aggregates in the cuticle, animals were harvested for protein isolation. Protein lysates were probed against Aβ [Anti-amyloid β peptide (MOAB-2) pan Antibody, clone 6C3 (Merck #MABN254)], and GFP [Anti-GFP (Roche #11814460001)] from three independent biological trials. Only after heat shock in the transgenic LSD2104 sfGFP::Aβ <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we observed a strong band below 55 kDa and a weaker band below, which correspond to the expected sizes for our transgenic fusion protein of human Abeta (1-42) with super-folder GFP (sfGFP::Aβ) of 44.6 kDa and cleaved one of 42.2 kDa in the anti-Aβ blot. These bands were also observed with the anti-GFP, as shown in Supporting Figure 1.1. Importantly, none of these bands were observed in wild type. This supports the idea that GFP aggregates contain human Aβ in our transgenic strain and that fluorescent sfGFP::Aβ can be used as a proxy for Aβ levels.</p><p>We incorporated this into the result section:</p><p>“By western blotting using GFP or Aβ antibodies, we confirmed that these sfGFP::Aβ fluorescent puncta contain the human Aβ (Supporting Figure 1.1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) More detailed mechanistic studies, as well as further characterization of the strain, is necessary (e.g., whether this strain shows impaired memory, the key feature of AD-using the well developed chemotaxis assay)</p></disp-quote><p>We performed a number of experiments to further characterize the sfGFP::Aβ strain.

The GFP_AB (LSD2104 sfGFP::Aβ) strain was shorter-lived as wild type N2. This could be due to the inherent leakiness at 20°C of hsp-16 promoter driving the sfGFP::Aβ expression (as reported for other transgenes and lifespan in Ewald et al., 2016 https://doi.org/10.1111/acel.12509). However, the single heat shock, which induced the sfGFP::Aβ, did not further shorten the lifespan of the transgenic LSD2104 strain.

The Chemotaxis Index (C.I.) was calculated as (the number of animals in test – the number of animals in control) divided by the total number of animals in the plate. Bar graph represents the chemotaxis index as the mean value of three independent trials for each condition. Error bars are SEM. 2-way Anova was performed for statistical analysis. We observed that sfGFP::Aβ transgenic animals had lower C.I. as compared to wild-type, which was not affected by heat-induced aggregate formation. Pre-conditioned animals, as expected, showed reduced C.I. in all conditions. This result suggests that aggregate formation did not affect the chemotaxis behavior towards benzaldehyde in neither naive nor pre-conditioned environments.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83465-sa2-fig11-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The concerns for the current manuscript are: (1) it remains unclear how ADM-2 removes extracellular aggregates.

This worm model may be very useful to the AD field. Addressing the below questions will improve the quality of the paper.</p><p>– While the major focus of this paper was on the elimination of Abeta plaques, it is important to give a summary on the multiple causes/risks of AD as elimination of Abeta plaques may not be sufficient to inhibit AD (the recent Abeta antibody by the Swedish company showing 28% reduction of memory loss via an Abeta antibody while significant side effects reported). Pathologies features like Tau tangles, defective mitophagy, senescence, and inflammation should be mentioned (PMID: 23254930; PMID: 30742114; PMID: 30936558 ). The authors may not necessarily have to test whether ADM-2 shows any direct/indirect/non-autonomous effects on Tau pathologies, defective mitophagy, senescence, and inflammation, it could be nice for them to discuss such things in the 'Discussion' section.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for taking the time and reading and evaluating our manuscript. We also highly appreciate the reviewer’s idea to determine the effects of ADM-2/ADAM9 on Tau pathology. From a disease modeling perspective, this would be the next step for a 2.0 Alzheimer’s disease model of <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Such a model has been recently established with neuronal expressing human Abeta and humanTau by Benbow et al., 2020 and many of the resulting pathologies were due to the action of Tau (doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddz319). We would expect similar indirect effects of extracellular Abeta in our model with intracellular Tau resulting pathologies. It could also be that the reason for Abeta aggregation in the ECM is to “safe-store” the Abeta and thus prevent toxicity via Tau. This asks for a proper side-by-side comparison and testing of the hypothesis in future work. We hope that providing our extracellular Abeta aggregation in the ECM model will allow many researchers in the field to go on to test their favorite hypotheses.</p><p>We did an extensive literature search to find any connection or evidence for ADAM9 to affect Tau pathology. Unfortunately, we were not able to find any evidence in the literature. Thus, this idea needs to be experimentally tested. We did not include this idea in the discussion since it is a completely new project, and evidence is lacking to make such a direct leap from the literature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Any evidence to validate that the sfGFP::Aβ strain expresses Abeta1-42, rather than Abeta3-42 (as happened in other Abeta strains before)?</p></disp-quote><p>We have not obtained any evidence to validate this for the following reasons that it seems unlikely to be the case. To experimentally prove this, we would need to run surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry like McColl et al., 2009 did (DOI: 10.1074/jbc.C109.028514). As McColl and colleagues have stated: “The likely cause is aberrant cleavage of the N-terminal signal peptide incorporated in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> transgene (Figure 1D).” (DOI: 10.1074/jbc.C109.028514). Given this, it seems unlikely that the first 3 amino acids would be missing since we, for this reason, preceded the super folder GFP the Aβ1-42 sequence.</p><p>We emphasized this in the text.</p><p>“A spacer sequence was placed between the sfGFP and the Aβ to allow the comparably smaller-sized Aβ to move and interact freely to form aggregates (Figure 1A, 1B). The full length of the Aβ1-42 peptide is essential for its aggregation (Mccoll et al., 2012). In our construct, Aβ is preceded by the sfGFP and spacer sequence, which prevents the truncation of the first few amino acids observed in many previous <italic>C. elegans</italic> Aβ models (McColl et al., 2009).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Did the single heat shock induction (33 C for 2 h) induce signalling pathways that may contribute to 'artificial effects' in Abeta clearance?</p></disp-quote><p>We assume that the single heat shock will induce small heat shock proteins, which peak after 8-12 hours and remain for at least 32 hours. We had previously characterized this heat shock response time course using TJ375 [Phsp-16.2::GFP] in microfluidics and western blotting with HSP-16.2 antibody (Figure 1 and Sup. Figure 1 in Verttti-Quintero et al., 2021 DOI: 10.1002/smll.202102145).</p><p>These small heat shock proteins probably help clear intracellular sfGFP::Aβ within the first 5 hours in many tissues, as we observed and illustrated in Figure 1D.</p><p>As we focus on extracellular Abeta aggregation, it is unknown whether secreted HSP90 or similar proteins would participate in extracellular Abeta aggregation or removal. In our screen, where we examined the Abeta aggregation in the ECM (cuticle), non of the heat-shock response family member showed a significant impact on cuticular-localized sfGFP::Aβ fluorescent levels.</p><p>We had knockdown hsp-1, hsp-70, hsp-4, hsp-90, hsp-110, hsp-12.3, hsp-12.6, hsp-60, hsp-75, hsp-6, hsp-16.2, and hsf-1 (Supporting File 1). Only knockdown of hsp-110/HSPA4,1 resulted in higher sfGFP::Aβ fluorescent levels (Figure 3C), suggesting minor involvement of the heat shock response pathway. However, we had not tested whether hsp-110 affects sfGFP::Aβ aggregation or removal. Thus, although we can not formally exclude it, it seems that the heat shock response pathway has a minor or no role in sfGFP::Aβ removal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– As AD pathologies are primarily in the brain region, a good worm model should also mimic this feature to enable a higher likelihood of data interpretation from worms to humans.
