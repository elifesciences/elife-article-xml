conditions. In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> vernalization depends on the cold-induced epigenetic silencing of the floral repressor locus <italic>FLC</italic>. Extensive natural variation in vernalization response is associated with <italic>A. thaliana</italic> accessions collected from different geographical regions. Here, we analyse natural variation for vernalization temperature requirement in accessions, including those from the northern limit of the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> range. Vernalization required temperatures above 0°C and was still relatively effective at 14°C in all the accessions. The different accessions had characteristic vernalization temperature profiles. One Northern Swedish accession showed maximum vernalization at 8°C, both at the level of flowering time and <italic>FLC</italic> chromatin silencing. Historical temperature records predicted all accessions would vernalize in autumn in N. Sweden, a prediction we validated in field transplantation experiments. The vernalization response of the different accessions was monitored over three intervals in the field and found to match that when the average field temperature was given as a constant condition. The vernalization temperature range of 0–14°C meant all accessions fully vernalized before snowfall in N. Sweden. These findings have important implications for understanding the molecular basis of adaptation and for predicting the consequences of climate change on flowering time.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06620.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06620.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06620.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Plants are not able to move around and so they need to be able to adapt their growth and development to seasonal changes in their environment. For example, prolonged exposure to cold temperatures during winter can prime some plants to flower when temperatures increase in the spring—a process called vernalization. In these plants, extended periods of cold temperatures lead to lower activity of a gene called <italic>FLC</italic>, which normally inhibits flowering.</p><p>In the plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, vernalization requires several months of exposure to temperatures between 0–6°C. Recently, <italic>A. thaliana</italic> plants from southern Europe were found to vary in the temperature requirements for vernalization, responding to temperatures higher than 6°C. This suggested that plants from northern Europe might vernalize preferentially at lower temperatures. Here, Duncan et al. compared vernalization in a collection of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> plants (or ‘accessions’) sampled from different regions of Sweden and the UK.</p><p>The experiments show that all the accessions needed temperatures above 0°C to vernalize and that vernalization still worked relatively well at temperatures as high as 14°C. The optimal temperature range for vernalization differed between the accessions, but plants from more northern areas did not necessarily vernalize at lower temperatures. For example, for one particular accession from northern Sweden, the temperature that is optimum for vernalization was 8°C, a notably higher temperature than expected.</p><p>Historical local climate records suggested that this accession would vernalize before the first snowfall of the winter in North Sweden. Duncan et al. confirmed this proposal with field experiments. Plants were grown in natural field sites in September and then moved into a greenhouse. The experiments show that the plants complete vernalization by November, which strongly suggests that FLC is silenced during autumn rather than during winter, as previously thought. This changed temperature response is due, in part, to a small number of tiny genetic differences in regions of the <italic>FLC</italic> gene that do not code for protein.</p><p>These findings have important implications for future studies of vernalization and flowering time, and for understanding how plants will adapt to on going and future climate change. The next step is to understand what causes these changed temperature responses at a molecular level, which should enable selective breeding for flowering and harvest date in a range of crops.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06620.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06620.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>vernalization</kwd><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>adaptation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An adaptation to extreme winter has involved a shift to autumn temperature monitoring.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The sessile nature of plants necessitates that they modulate most aspects of their growth and development in response to external conditions. One aspect of this is the alignment of developmental transitions with seasonal cues. A major seasonal cue is temperature and plants have evolved the ability to integrate daily fluctuations in external temperature in order to monitor long-term trends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aikawa et al., 2010</xref>). Exposure to weeks of cold temperature accelerates the transition to flowering in a process called vernalization. In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> vernalization involves the quantitative epigenetic silencing of <italic>FLC</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Michaels and Amasino, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Sheldon et al., 1999</xref>). Cold exposure promotes a cell-autonomous epigenetic switch at <italic>FLC</italic> in an increasing proportion of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angel et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">2015</xref>). This epigenetic switching mechanism requires a Polycomb complex associated with PHD proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">De Lucia et al., 2008</xref>), including the cold-induced VIN3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Sung and Amasino, 2004</xref>). This enables activation of <italic>FT</italic>, is a potent activator of flowering in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Searle et al., 2006</xref>). At a standard vernalization temperature of 5°C, the length of cold required to achieve complete epigenetic silencing varies between <italic>A. thaliana</italic> accessions and this maps to non-coding cis polymorphisms in <italic>FLC</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coustham et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Li et al., 2014</xref>)<italic>.</italic> Accessions collected from northerly latitudes typically require longer vernalization, for example, the accession Lov-1 originates from near the northerly limit of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> range in Lövvik, North Sweden (62.5°N) and requires three months of vernalization to fully accelerate flowering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Shindo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coustham et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Effective temperature ranges for vernalization have been determined empirically for different plant species, many of which have been incorporated into chilling unit models that are widely used in agriculture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Byrne and Bacon, 1992</xref>). A genetically informed photothermal model for flowering in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> has assumed that vernalization occurs when daytime hourly temperatures are higher than 0°C and lower than 6°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Wilczek et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chew et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2014</xref>). However, accessions from southern Europe have been found to vernalize at constant temperatures significantly higher than 6°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Wollenberg and Amasino, 2012</xref>), suggesting that accessions from northerly latitudes might vernalize most efficiently at relatively low temperatures. Here, we show this is not the case and find that vernalization in a range of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> accessions is most effective across a relatively high temperature range with the N. Swedish accession Lov-1, showing maximal vernalization at 8°C. We show that vernalization is complete before snowfall in N. Sweden with the plants flowering immediately upon snowmelt. Vernalization responsiveness in the field matched that when the average monthly temperature was given as constant conditions. Our work has important implications for modeling flowering time and predicting the impact of climate change.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>In order to investigate natural variation for vernalization temperature requirement in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> accessions we selected several genotypes that represent most of the major <italic>FLC</italic> haplotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Li et al., 2014</xref>): Lov-1 (Lövvik, N. Sweden—latitude 62.5°N), Var2-6 (Vårhallen, S. Sweden—latitude 55.58°N), Ull2-5 (Ullstorp, S. Sweden—latitude 56.06°N), Edi-0 (Edinburgh, UK—latitude 55.95°N) and the reference Columbia line containing <italic>FRIGIDA</italic> (Col <italic>FRI</italic><sup>Sf2</sup>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Michaels and Amasino, 1999</xref>]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). All genotypes were vernalized for varying periods at different constant temperatures between 0°C and 14°C and the efficiency of vernalization assayed by determining flowering time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-E</xref>). All the genotypes showed limited vernalization after 4 and 6 weeks exposure to 0°C and vernalized more efficiently at all other temperatures. Col <italic>FRI</italic><sup>Sf2</sup> and Edi-0 were most effectively vernalized after 4, 6 or 12 weeks at 2°C, 5°C and 8°C and still vernalized relatively efficiently at 12°C and 14°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>). Even after 2 weeks of cold at 2°C and 8°C the flowering of Col <italic>FRI</italic><sup>Sf2</sup> plants was similar, so lack of any difference was not due to vernalization being close to saturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Ull2-5 showed similar temperature sensitivity to Col <italic>FRI</italic><sup>Sf2</sup> and Edi-0, but required 12 weeks for vernalization to be fully effective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In contrast, Lov-1 and Var2-6 plants showed a differential response to temperature with 2 and 12°C less effective than 5 and 8°C after 6-weeks vernalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and E</xref>). For Lov-1 the only temperature that resulted in flowering after 4 weeks exposure was 8°C and although the enhanced effect of this temperature diminished over time, 8°C consistently resulted in the most effective vernalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Thus, the different accessions show distinct temperature profiles for vernalization and all require temperatures higher than 0°C.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06620.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Vernalization responses at a range of constant temperatures.</title><p>Days to flower were recorded for five genotypes after 0 (crosses), 4 (red squares), 6 (blue triangles) and 12 (green circles) weeks vernalization at a range of temperatures, <italic>n</italic> ≥ 10.

In contrast to Col <italic>FRI</italic><sup>Sf2</sup>, the Lov-1 allele re-activated after 30 days in the warm after vernalization at all the tested temperatures. However, the degree of re-activation was lowest after vernalization at 8°C, consistent with vernalization being most effective at this temperature. Similarly, 6 weeks vernalization at 8°C resulted in lower <italic>FLC</italic> re-activation post-cold and higher levels of <italic>FT</italic> induction than 5°C, with similar <italic>VIN3</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>).

Swedish accession was surprising given that flower buds appeared within 2 weeks of the snowmelt on native <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> at the N. Swedish Lövvik site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This early flowering may limit herbivory and help in the competition for nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kawagoe and Kudoh, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiyama and Agren, 2012</xref>). A long-term (&gt;5 year study) of the natural populations at several N. Swedish sites throughout the High Coast region, showed most populations behaved as winter annuals with germination occurring predominantly in August and September with no spring germination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). The rapid flowering after snowmelt suggests that vernalization must have occurred before the end of November given the recurrent snow cover and low temperatures at the Lövvik site over the winter months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Hourly climate data collected near Lövvik between 1st August (the earliest germination date observed for natural populations) until snow cover between 2008 and 2013 show an average air temperature of ~8°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Analysis of national data (1st August—30th November) also revealed an overall average autumn daily average temperature of 8.86°C between 1961 and 2008 (SD = 0.63) with over 86% of days falling within the range identified as being effective for Lov-1 vernalization, (0°C, 15°C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>). The agreement of average autumn temperatures with the effective vernalization temperatures identified for the Lov-1 reinforced the view that epigenetic silencing of <italic>FLC</italic> would occur before snowfall.</p><p>We tested the hypothesis of a seasonal shift in the timing of vernalization in N. Sweden by setting up field experiments close to the Lövvik site in autumn 2011 and 2012 (locations shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Seedlings were transplanted into the field at the beginning of September and then transferred to a warmed greenhouse at three time points during autumn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5A</xref>).

We therefore compared vernalization response in the different transplant intervals with vernalization in constant temperatures equivalent to the average temperature of the field conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). The different genotypes showed temporal differences in vernalization responsiveness over the three transplant periods in the field. Remarkably, vernalization responsiveness was very similar when the average field temperature was given as a constant temperature, with each genotype showing a different overall profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Indeed, the match is remarkable given the daily oscillations in temperature especially in the transplant 1 period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5A</xref>). How plants integrate these fluctuating temperatures over such long timescales is an important area for future molecular dissection.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06620.018</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Prediction of vernalization response under field conditions.</title><p>Days to flower recorded after the three transplants during field experiments in 2011 and 2012 are shown in grey.

Sweden generally have much lower seed dormancy requirement than those from further south (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Debieu et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, the low seed dormancy of Lov-1 would enable germination to occur early enough to exploit the whole of the N. Swedish autumn for vernalization. The increased seed dormancy of S. Swedish accessions (e.g., Ull2-5) is likely to delay germination leading to the necessity for vernalization in some years to extend into winter in S. Sweden. It is interesting to speculate that the reduced effectiveness of temperatures below 5°C for other Swedish accessions Lov-1 and Var2-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,E</xref>) could prevent premature vernalization occurring during unseasonal cool periods in early autumn. Our data also show that the (0°C, 6°C) temperature range widely used to estimate vernalization in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Wilczek et al., 2009</xref>) would only predict partial vernalization of later flowering accessions during our field experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Our data suggest that raising the upper threshold temperature to 15°C would improve estimates of vernalization progress for later flowering accessions under natural field conditions.</p><p>In summary, we have employed a combination of molecular and ecological approaches to connect temperature-induced molecular changes at <italic>FLC</italic> with ecologically significant effects in the field. We show that growth at the northern limit of the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> species range has involved a seasonal shift in the timing of vernalization. Perhaps as a response to selection in these extreme conditions one N. Swedish accession, Lov-1, shows a more distinct vernalization temperature optimum that matches the average historical temperature for August-November in that geographical region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Early germination enables vernalization to complete before snowfall and allows flowering to occur directly after snowmelt when the photoperiod and ambient temperatures increase. Rises in global temperature have already reduced vernalization periods to an extent that has impacted the phenology of a range of plant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fitter and Fitter, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cook et al., 2012</xref>).

Based on our discussions, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The manuscript was seen by two reviewers, one of whom had reviewed the previous version. The work addresses the question whether accessions of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> complete vernalization at different times relative to the height of winter, as a consequence of adaptation to geographic differences in winter temperatures and winter duration. A model presented in many reviews is that vernalization equates exposure to winter-like temperature, and thus is completed only in spring. It is, however, unclear how rigorously this has been tested before. A previous paper by Wollenberg and Amasino reported that flowering of some Spanish accessions is accelerated by transient exposure to quite high vernalization temperatures, and Méndez-Vigo et al. have hypothesized that “mild and moderately cold winters activate the vernalization pathway to promote flowering in winter” (of Spanish accessions).</p><p>Both reviewers agreed that there are two major conclusions from the present manuscript one can be confident about: (i) Vernalization of Lov-1 is essentially completed in late fall, prior to cover by snow, such that the plants are already competent to flower as soon as snow melts later in the spring, and (ii) the optimal vernalization temperature for Lov-1 seems to be in the 5-8 degree range.</p><p>Based on logic alone, it seems likely that this vernalization behavior has to be common in places with regular and consistent snow cover. An interesting question is how vernalization behavior differs in other regions. Knowledge of this is essential in order to support the claim that there is a “seasonal shift in timing of vernalization as an adaptation to extreme winter”. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> seems to nicely demonstrate that a few other accessions are also vernalized when sown in fall and transferred to a greenhouse in November. To conclusively answer the question that you set out to answer, one would, however, need to conduct similar experiments at other locales, since it is not clear when <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> is vernalized at more Southern locations.</p><p>Both reviewers had also similar general concerns regarding the role of FLC in the observed behavior:</p><p>1) The behavior of near isogenic introgression lines indicated that the FLC locus contributes to this flowering behavior, but there are clearly additional factors, as the FLC region even in conjunction with another linked region on chr 5 has a much weaker effect on flowering than what was observed with Lov-1 itself. The conclusion “that the changed vernalization temperature response if Lov-1 involves a complex interaction between FLC and gene products at linked loci” is certainly not incorrect, but it does not provide the whole story.</p><p>2) Following on from this line of arguments, why did you use NIL-1, which contains the undesired downstream region, in your field experiments, rather than NIL-2, which apparently only contains FLC from Lov-1? This would seem to complicate the interpretation of the genetic evidence, especially because this downstream region appears to contribute a 13-20 day delay in flowering time. Depending on which NIL is used as the denominator, this is either a 30% or a 60% delay. Your comments on this region in your presentation of the results were not entirely convincing, and the choice of NIL-1 for the field experiment appears somewhat unfortunate.</p><p>[Editors’ note: a previous version of this study was rejected after peer review, but the authors submitted for reconsideration. The previous decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled “Seasonal shift in timing of vernalization as an adaptation to extreme winter” for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your full submission has been evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior editor) and two other peer reviewers, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers. We regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication.</p><p>You have studied the potential ecological significance of a northern Swedish allele (Lov-1) of the FLC gene of Arabidopsis thaliana by integrating molecular genetics, field observations, meteorological data and field-greenhouse ecological experiments. A surprising observation is that vernalization is already completed during fall at a rather higher temperature of about 8°C, which enables very rapid flowering opening after snow melt. This is a potentially exciting new insight because vernalization has been typically considered to occur during winter to prevent early flowering. What is lacking, however, is a demonstration that these prior assumptions were justified, and that the Lov-1 allele has indeed a different vernalization temperature optimum in addition to its different vernalization length requirement. What impressed the reviewers most was the very clever idea to take plants grown at natural field sites into the greenhouse, in order to test their vernalization status. This nicely confirms that Lov-1 needs longer vernalization than the reference strain, although this is perhaps difficult to interpret because the reference strain flowers so much more quickly anyway.</p><p>From a series of elegant experiments in your lab, it was known that natural lines of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> differ in their requirements for length of vernalization treatment, and that much of that variation maps to the FLC gene itself. In this paper, you have asked whether there are also different temperature optima for vernalization. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, you contrast a line with the FLC standard allele, Col FRI-Sf2, with the Lov-1 line. You find that in both lines 2, 5, or 8°C are more effective for vernalization than temperatures below or above. The critical question is whether there are differences between the two lines at 12 and 14°C. Because the effect of vernalization on flowering of the reference line is much smaller than for Lov-1, the reviewers were unconvinced of this claim. Not only was there no proper statistical treatment, but it is even unclear whether this can be resolved by statistics, because it would be rather arbitrary how one defines vernalization response, i.e., as absolute difference in flowering, relative acceleration of flowering etc. More importantly, the reviewers agreed that these experiments mostly confirmed that Lov-1 needs to be vernalized much longer than Col FRI-Sf2 rather than that the results demonstrated a different temperature optimum. That there is perhaps less of a difference between the different temperature regimens than claimed can also be deduced from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. If one of the lines has a temperature optimum at 2-8°C, it would seem to be Col FRI-Sf2, not Lov-1, where 12°C seems to be more effective in reducing FLC expression than in Col FRI-Sf2. The H3K27me3 data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> are more in support of differential temperature effects, but the differences between 5 and 8°C for Lov-1 are not reflected in obvious differences in flowering behavior, so the results are equivocal.</p><p>In the end, the reviewers remained unconvinced that there is evidence for “a changed temperature integration mechanism involving FLC epigenetic silencing (that) has led to a phenological shift in vernalization timing”. For such a conclusion, one would need to have seen similar experiments at other sites, with lines that supposedly have different temperature optima (and preferentially similar vernalization length requirement, because it seems that length and temperature effects are difficult to disentangle).</p><p>Major issues of the manuscript to be addressed include:</p><p>1) There are a few issues regarding the paragraph: “Hourly air temperature data collected near Lövvik from 1st August until snow cover in 2008, 2009 and 2013 revealed mean average autumn temperatures close to the 8°C; the optimal Lov-1 constant vernalization temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). National climate records showed the longer-term (1961 to 2008) average daily temperature in that seasonal period was 8.86°C (SD = 0.63) with 86% of average daily temperatures shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> within the range identified to be effective for vernalization of Lov-1 seedlings. Together these data raised the possibility that the change in thermal sensitivity of vernalization was an adaptation beneficial for reproductive success in northern Sweden.”</p><p>1-1) Why was the average started from 1st August? Depends on the day of start, the average until snow cover can be arbitrary changed. I guess authors could show ecological argument or data, such as the germination timing in the locality.</p><p>1-2) Why does mean average temperature matters? While the lab experiment was conducted in constant 8°C, the natural temperature would fluctuate in each day. Rather than daily average, it is possible that the coldest temperature may matter, or hours lower than a certain threshold temperature may matter (model by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aikawa et al. 2010</xref>), or whatever. I would propose either (1) defend the usage of daily average temperature (2) show experimental data supporting the significance daily temperature fluctuation, or (3) remove the argument (importantly abstract) of the coincidence between lab experiment and natural condition, although it would weaken the paper.</p><p>1-3) Describe the detailed data of the national climate records. Does it provide only average daily temperature?

The conclusion “that the changed vernalization temperature response if Lov-1 involves a complex interaction between FLC and gene products at linked loci” is certainly not incorrect, but it does not provide the whole story</italic>.</p><p><italic>2) Following on from this line of arguments, why did you use NIL-1, which contains the undesired downstream region, in your field experiments, rather than NIL-2, which apparently only contains FLC from Lov-1? This would seem to complicate the interpretation of the genetic evidence, especially because this downstream region appears to contribute a 13-20 day delay in flowering time. Depending on which NIL is used as the denominator, this is either a 30% or a 60% delay. Your comments on this region in your presentation of the results were not entirely convincing, and the choice of NIL-1 for the field experiment appears somewhat unfortunate</italic>.</p><p>In light of the reviewer’s comments we have undertaken field studies to establish a lack spring germination in Northern Sweden, and included data from additional genotypes to show that despite different vernalization temperature profiles, all accessions vernalize during autumn in Northern Sweden.</p><p>This reinforces our central conclusion that there is a shift in the timing of vernalization as an adaptation to extreme winters.

We realized that in our attempt to simplify the story we chose not to include results that in hindsight would have helped convince the reviewers of our conclusions. We have therefore rewritten the manuscript including all these additional data.</p><p><italic>You have studied the potential ecological significance of a northern Swedish allele (Lov-1) of the FLC gene of Arabidopsis thaliana by integrating molecular genetics, field observations, meteorological data and field-greenhouse ecological experiments. A surprising observation is that vernalization is already completed during fall at a rather higher temperature of about 8°C, which enables very rapid flowering opening after snow melt. This is a potentially exciting new insight because vernalization has been typically considered to occur during winter to prevent early flowering</italic>.</p><p>We are particularly pleased that the reviewers recognized the importance of this finding. The view that vernalization occurs during winter is engrained in the thinking of the plant community and determines experimental strategy, inputs to modeling phenology and interpretations of field experiments.</p><p><italic>What is lacking, however, is a demonstration that these prior assumptions were justified, and that the Lov-1 allele has indeed a different vernalization temperature optimum in addition to its different vernalization length requirement</italic>.</p><p>In our previous submission we had chosen to present two extreme strategies. We realize now that our attempt to keep things simple had led to confusion. In our new submission we now include other accessions and so can clearly show that length of cold period can be separated from the vernalization temperature optimum. We also demonstrate that our prior assumption of winter vernalization can be justified by showing that current phenological model parameters underestimate vernalization progress in natural field conditions.</p><p><italic>What impressed the reviewers most was the very clever idea to take plants grown at natural field sites into the greenhouse, in order to test their vernalization status. This nicely confirms that Lov-1 needs longer vernalization than the reference strain, although this is perhaps difficult to interpret because the reference strain flowers so much more quickly anyway</italic>.</p><p>The addition of data from other accessions, particularly Ull2-5, will hopefully convince the reviewers that rapid flowering and temperature optimum are separable.</p><p><italic>From a series of elegant experiments in your lab, it was known that natural lines of</italic> Arabidopsis thaliana <italic>differ in their requirements for length of vernalization treatment, and that much of that variation maps to the FLC gene itself. In this paper, you have asked whether there are also different temperature optima for vernalization. In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1A</italic></xref><italic>, you contrast a line with the FLC standard allele, Col FRI-Sf2, with the Lov-1 line. You find that in both lines 2, 5, or 8°C are more effective for vernalization than temperatures below or above. The critical question is whether there are differences between the two lines at 12 and 14°C. Because the effect of vernalization on flowering of the reference line is much smaller than for Lov-1, the reviewers were unconvinced of this claim</italic>.</p><p>Indeed we found both Swedish accessions vernalize slightly better at 12 than 14<sup>°</sup>C, with Edi-0 and Col <italic>FRI</italic><sup>Sf2</sup> vernalizing equally efficiency at both temperatures. However, we do not find a functional significance for this difference in the field experiments, so do not consider it a critical issue. What does appear to influence field behaviour is the differential response between 2 and 5/8<sup>o</sup>C. We have also included experiments on a short vernalization of Col <italic>FRI</italic><sup>Sf2</sup> that demonstrate that partial vernalization of this faster flowering line does not reveal a differential temperature effect between 2 and 8<sup>°</sup>C.</p><p><italic>Not only was there no proper statistical treatment, but it is even unclear whether this can be resolved by statistics, because it would be rather arbitrary how one defines vernalization response, i.e., as absolute difference in flowering, relative acceleration of flowering etc. More importantly, the reviewers agreed that these experiments mostly confirmed that Lov-1 needs to be vernalized much longer than Col FRI-Sf2 rather than that the results demonstrated a different temperature optimum. That there is perhaps less of a difference between the different temperature regimens than claimed can also be deduced from</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1B</italic></xref>.</p><p>We have now used 4 week treated rather than 6 week cold treated plants for the analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. These show a significant difference in the temperature-dependent re-activation of <italic>FLC</italic> transcription 30 days after transfer to warm. This difference in re-activation does translate into flowering time differences.</p><p><italic>If one of the lines has a temperature optimum at 2-8°C, it would seem to be Col FRI-Sf2, not Lov-1, where 12°C seems to be more effective in reducing FLC expression than in Col FRI-Sf2</italic>.</p><p>We have plotted absolute expression values in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> rather than normalized to NV to demonstrate that 12<sup>°</sup>C is not more effective in Lov-1 than Col <italic>FRI</italic><sup>Sf2</sup>.</p><p><italic>The H3K27me3 data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1C</italic></xref> <italic>are more in support of differential temperature effects, but the differences between 5 and 8°C for Lov-1 are not reflected in obvious differences in flowering behavior, so the results are equivocal</italic>.</p><p>We hope that the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure1B</xref> convinces the reviewer that the chromatin differences are reflected in changed expression. We have also added the ChIP data at 14<sup>°</sup>C and statistical test results that strengthen the view of an 8<sup>°</sup>C optimum.</p><p><italic>In the end, the reviewers remained unconvinced that there is evidence for “a changed temperature integration mechanism involving FLC epigenetic silencing (that) has led to a phenological shift in vernalization timing”. For such a conclusion, one would need to have seen similar experiments at other sites, with lines that supposedly have different temperature optima (and preferentially similar vernalization length requirement, because it seems that length and temperature effects are difficult to disentangle)</italic>.</p><p>We have extensively edited the whole manuscript to more accurately describe our major findings:</p><p>- Vernalization in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> accessions, including one from the northern limit of the range, is inefficient at 0<sup>°</sup>C but still effective at 14<sup>°</sup>C;</p><p>- Current vernalization threshold parameters in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> flowering models only predict a partial response for Lov-1 before winter, but we present field results validating our prediction that vernalization completes during autumn in N.

Together these data raised the possibility that the change in thermal sensitivity of vernalization was an adaptation beneficial for reproductive success in northern Sweden</italic>.<italic>”</italic></p><p><italic>1-1) Why was the average started from 1st August? Depends on the day of start, the average until snow cover can be arbitrary changed. I guess authors could show ecological argument or data, such as the germination timing in the locality</italic>.</p><p>The 1<sup>st</sup> of August was used as the starting date for temperature data as this coincided with the observed germination time.</p><p><italic>1-2) Why does mean average temperature matters? While the lab experiment was conducted in constant 8°C, the natural temperature would fluctuate in each day. Rather than daily average, it is possible that the coldest temperature may matter, or hours lower than a certain threshold temperature may matter (model by</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1"><italic>Aikawa et al. 2010</italic></xref><italic>), or whatever. I would propose either (1) defend the usage of daily average temperature (2) show experimental data supporting the significance daily temperature fluctuation, or (3) remove the argument (importantly abstract) of the coincidence between lab experiment and natural condition, although it would weaken the paper</italic>.</p><p>We looked at average daily temperatures because this is a common method used in agriculture to determine the minimum quantity of cold required by a crop to ensure synchronous flowering and maximum yield. We also considered long-term average temperature because a long 6 week integration period was reported to contribute to the epigenetic repression of <italic>A. halleri</italic> under field conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aikawa et al. 2010</xref>).
