kinase in vertebrates, is critical for canonical NF-κB activation. Here, we report that human IKK2 not only phosphorylates substrate serine residues and autophosphorylates its own activation loop, but also autophosphorylates at a tyrosine residue proximal to the active site and is, therefore, a dual-specificity kinase. We observed that mutation of Y169, an autophosphorylatable tyrosine located at the DFG +1 (DLG in IKK1/α and 2) position, to phenylalanine renders IKK2 incapable of catalyzing phosphorylation at S32 within its IκBα substrate. We also observed that mutation of the phylogenetically conserved ATP-contacting residue K44 in IKK2 to methionine converts IKK2 to an enzyme that no longer catalyzes specific phosphorylation of IκBα at S32 or S36, but rather directs phosphorylation of IκBα at other residues. Lastly, we report evidence of a phospho-relay from autophosphorylated IKK2 to IκBα in the presence of ADP. These observations suggest an unusual evolution of IKK2, in which autophosphorylation of tyrosine(s) in the activation loop and the conserved ATP-contacting K44 residue provide its signal-responsive substrate specificity and ensure fidelity during NF-κB activation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>protein kinase</kwd><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>signal transduction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009053</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust DBt India Alliance</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IA/I/15/1/501852</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Polley</surname><given-names>Smarajit</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001411</institution-id><institution>Indian Council of Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BMI/11(55)2022</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chaudhuri</surname><given-names>Ankur</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH AI163327</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ghosh</surname><given-names>Gourisankar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RSG-08-287-01-GMC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huxford</surname><given-names>Tom</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

One such example is the action of Inhibitor of κB Kinase-complex (IKK-complex), which is composed of two catalytic subunits, IKK1 (also known as IKKα) and IKK2 (or IKKβ), and an essential regulatory scaffolding protein, NEMO (IKKγ). IKK-complex precisely triggers induction of NF-κB family transcription factors in metazoans in response to inflammatory or pathogenic signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hoffmann and Baltimore, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">DiDonato et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rothwarf et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zandi et al., 1997</xref>). In resting cells, the activity of IKK2 is maintained at a low basal level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ghosh and Karin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Häcker and Karin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hinz and Scheidereit, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). In response to inflammatory or pathogenic signaling cues, the IKK2 subunit becomes activated via phosphorylation at two serine residues within its activation loop and subsequently phosphorylates two critical serine residues (S32 and S36) near the N-terminus of IκBα (Inhibitor of NF-κB α), marking the inhibitor protein for ubiquitin-dependent 26 <italic>S</italic> proteasome-mediated degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Signal-responsive phosphorylation of IκBα refers to phosphorylation of its S32 and S36 residues by the IKK activity. Degradation of IκBα liberates NF-κB, which then translocates to the nucleus to execute its gene expression program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hayden and Ghosh, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hinz and Scheidereit, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Karin and Ben-Neriah, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Scheidereit, 2006</xref>). Mutation of IκBα residues S32 and S36 to phospho-ablative alanine converts it into a super-repressor of NF-κB that is incapable of being degraded in response to NF-κB signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lin et al., 1995</xref>), highlighting the need for exquisite specificity of IKK2 in phosphorylating these two serines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">DiDonato et al., 1997</xref>). The IKK2 subunit fails to phosphorylate IκBα when S32 and S36 are mutated even to threonine, another phosphorylatable residue. Despite its critical role in the regulation of NF-κB via high-fidelity phosphorylation specificity toward IκBα, IKK2 behaves with functional pleiotropy toward other substrates and in other contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antonia et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schröfelbauer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schröfelbauer and Hoffmann, 2011</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Autophosphorylation of IKK2 at hitherto uncharacterized sites.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic of the IKK-complex (pre- and post-stimulation) showing binding of NEMO helping activation of IKK as well as channelizing its recognition of substrate IκBα.

As mentioned previously, the hitherto enigmatic activation of IKK2 from its inactive state is manifested in the phosphorylation status of two serine residues, S177 and S181 (S176 and S180 for IKK1), located within the activation loop (AL) of the KD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huse and Kuriyan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Polley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Xu et al., 2011</xref>). Phospho-mimetic substitution of these two serines to glutamates (S177E, S181E; henceforth EE) renders IKK2 constitutively active. It has been demonstrated that the upstream kinase TAK1 primes IKK2 through phosphorylation at S177, leading to its autophosphorylation at S181 and full activation in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Alternatively, it has also been shown that increased oligomerization upon association with NEMO and linear or Lys63-linked poly-ubiquitin chains, or due to a high concentration of IKK2, enables <italic>trans</italic> autophosphorylation of IKK2 at S177 and S181 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Du et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ea et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Polley et al., 2013</xref>). NEMO appears not only to aid in the activation of the IKK complex, but also to direct IKK activity toward IκBα bound to NF-κB (NF-κB:IκBα complex; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schröfelbauer et al., 2012</xref>). The SDD of IKK2 and the C-terminal segment (residues 410–756, collectively) are also required for specific phosphorylation of IκBα at S32 and S36. A shortened version of IKK2 with deletion of these regions failed to retain the above-mentioned exquisite specificity of IKK2 but phosphorylated IκBα at serine and threonine residues within its C-terminal PEST (residues 281–302) region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shaul et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, this C-terminal PEST region of IκBα, which is rich in proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine residues, is phosphorylated in vivo by other kinases that are not capable of phosphorylating IκBα at S32 and S36 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barroga et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tergaonkar et al., 2003</xref>). Despite its central role in the regulation of transcription factor NF-κB, the connection or interdependence of IκBα phosphorylation at the PEST region and the signal-responsive S32/S36 sites remains elusive.</p><p>In this study, we employed structure-based biochemical and cell-based experimental approaches to explore the basis of IKK2 specificity toward S32/S36 of IκBα that is required for rapid induction of NF-κB transcriptional activity in response to canonical signaling. Biochemical analysis of catalytically competent IKK2 revealed that it is capable of autophosphorylation at tyrosine residues in addition to autophosphorylation of its own serines or phosphorylation of serines in its substrate IκBα. Therefore, IKK2 is a dual-specificity protein kinase. IKK2 tyrosine autophosphorylation depends upon prior phosphorylation of activation loop S177/S181 and plays a significant role in phosphorylation of signal-responsive S32/S36 of IκBα. The phosphorylation of IκBα at S32 was severely compromised upon substitution of Y169 of IKK2 to a phospho-ablative phenylalanine. Additionally, signal-responsive phosphorylation of IκBα upon TNF-α treatment in MEF cells reconstituted with IKK2-Y169F was severely diminished in comparison to wild type IKK2 (IKK2-WT). We also observed that an IKK2 bearing the K44M mutation resulted in a loss of S177 and S181 as well as tyrosine autophosphorylation activities and consequent loss of S32/S36 phosphorylation in IκBα, confirming a critical function of this lysine residue. Interestingly, phosphorylation of residues within the C-terminal PEST region of IκBα was retained in IKK2-K44M. Finally, we observed an intriguing activity of IKK2, when fully autophosphorylated at its serine and tyrosine residues, to phosphorylate IκBα in the absence of an exogenous supply of ATP, if ADP is present in the reaction. This result suggests the possibility of a unique, and likely transient, autophosphorylated form of IKK2 that can serve to relay phosphoryl group(s) specifically to S32/S36 of IκBα. Such a mechanism contrasts with the conventional transfer of γ-phosphate groups directly from ATP to the substrate observed in eukaryotic protein kinases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>IKK2 undergoes autophosphorylation at uncharacterized sites</title><p>Signal-induced phosphorylation of activation loop residues Ser177 and Ser181 is the hallmark signature of IKK2 catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In contrast, hyperphosphorylation of other serine residues located within the flexible C-terminal region of IKK2, spanning amino acids 701–756 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), has been reported to down-regulate IKK2 activity in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Delhase et al., 1999</xref>). Ectopically overexpressed IKK2 has been observed to autophosphorylate the two serines of the activation loop in trans even in the absence of an activating physiological signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Polley et al., 2013</xref>). We observed that purified recombinant full-length IKK2 is autophosphorylated when incubated with ATP in the absence of NEMO in a time-dependent manner, and likely at multiple sites as indicated by the diffuse nature of the slower migrating phospho-IKK2 band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The autophosphorylated IKK2 produced a sharper band in the presence of NEMO – possibly reflecting enhanced specificity of phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, left panel) – although NEMO did not alter the efficiency of phosphorylation for its <italic>bona fide</italic> substrate IκBα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, right panel). An in vitro kinase assay with a K44M mutant of IKK2 that lacks both its autophosphorylation and IκBα phosphorylation activities along with the native sequence IKK2 using γ-<sup>32</sup>P-ATP confirmed that phosphorylation of IKK2 was self-catalyzed and not due to a spurious contaminating kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). K44 is an ATP-contacting residue that is conserved across STYKs, including IKK2, and its mutation to methionine typically reduces or eliminates kinase activity. An in vitro kinase assay showing inhibition of specific phosphorylation of S32/36 on IκBα and IKK2-autophosphorylation performed in the presence of an IKK-specific ATP-competitive inhibitor, Calbiochem Inhibitor VII, further validates that phosphorylation of IKK2 is due to its own activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In these experiments, the reaction mixtures of kinase and kinase:substrate were incubated with the inhibitor for 30 min prior to the addition of the phosphate donor, γ-<sup>32</sup>P-ATP or cold ATP.

The shortest construct, Δ664EE, which lacked the entire flexible C-terminal region (670-756), was subjected to limited proteolysis using trypsin to further eliminate flexible N- and C-terminal residues and subsequently purified for in vitro kinase assays. These deletion IKK2-EE constructs displayed both autophosphorylation and substrate IκBα phosphorylation activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The observed autophosphorylation of IKK2 lacking serines of the activation loop and the C-terminal segment suggested the existence of hitherto uncharacterized sites of autophosphorylation in IKK2.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Autophosphorylation of IKK2 reveals its dual specificity</title><p>We were intrigued as to whether the observed autophosphorylation activity of IKK2 might involve other residues in addition to the previously characterized serines, i.e., the possibility of IKK2 being a dual specificity kinase. Indeed, we observed by western blot with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies the unexpected de novo autophosphorylation of IKK2 at tyrosine residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, middle panel) in addition to the previously reported autophosphorylation of activation loop serines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, upper panel) when full-length native sequence IKK2 was incubated with Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP for various amounts of time. Increased autophosphorylation of activation loop S177 and S181 over time reflects nonhomogeneous and incomplete phosphorylation of activation loop S177 and S181 in the IKK2 obtained from recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells. To address the possibility of non-specificity by the pan-phosphotyrosine antibody (used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), we further performed the experiment with an alternate anti-phosphotyrosine specific antibody that confirmed detection of de novo tyrosine phosphorylation was independent of the source of the antibody used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). ATP-dependent tyrosine autophosphorylation was not observed in the presence of an IKK-specific inhibitor, Inhibitor VII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), and with the kinase inactivating IKK2 K44M mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Additionally, autophosphorylation assays performed in the presence of urea revealed tyrosine autophosphorylation to be undetectable at urea concentrations greater than 1 M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). More sensitive assays using γ-<sup>32</sup>P-ATP recapitulated elimination of pan-autophosphorylation and IκBα substrate phosphorylation of IKK2 above 1 M urea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These results demonstrate the dual specificity of recombinant IKK2 in phosphorylating serine residues on itself and on substrates, as well as tyrosine residues on itself. The fact that activities of IKK2 toward S32 and S36 of IκBα and its own tyrosine residue(s) were affected similarly by both general (AMPPNP and Staurosporine) and IKK-specific (MLN-120B, TPCA, Inhibitor VII; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>) kinase inhibitors indicates that both activities occur in the same active site. Using various truncated versions of IKK2, we further observed that the C-terminal NBD of IKK2 is not required for its autocatalytic dual specificity and in phosphorylating IκBα at S32 and S36 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) in vitro. Semi-quantitative assessment of phospho-Ser and phospho-Tyr residues on a constitutively active NBD-deficient IKK2 (IKK2Δ664EE) was performed by western blot with monoclonal anti-phosphoserine and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, which revealed de novo autophosphorylation at tyrosine residues but not at serines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

Interestingly, we observed a lack of phosphorylation of IκBα at S32 and S36 by IKK2 K44M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This suggests that IKK2 K44M phosphorylates IκBα at residues within its C-terminal PEST, consistent with the observed phosphorylation of IκBα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C &amp; D</xref>). Moreover, IKK2 K44M phosphorylated super-repressor IκBα S32A/S36A more efficiently than native sequence IκBα, in sharp contrast to IKK2 of native sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

This result might be indicative of increased internal motion despite phosphorylation-induced stabilization of IKK2 because of phosphorylation. The changes in total energy and RMSD values were consistent throughout the course of simulation, even though the magnitude was small. We observed distinct structural alteration within the KD upon phosphorylation at S177 and S181 or S177, S181, and Y169 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, models shown separately in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Analyses of the trajectory of RMSF values for the three states revealed different regions of the kinase domain with different RMSF values in different phosphorylated states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We observed that, while the glycine-rich loop and the αC-helix in p-IKK2 were positioned in a manner reminiscent of an active kinase, those in UnP and P-IKK2 were oriented differently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In fact, helix αC was found to be distorted in P-IKK2 in a manner that would make it unlikely to support canonical phosphotransfer from ATP. The activation loop in these three states adopted conformations distinct from each other. The activation loop in the UnP model was splayed out and moved closer to the tip of the C-lobe, whereas the activation loop in p-IKK2 and P-IKK2 moved inwards and adopted more compact conformations closer to the N-lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The formation of the proper R- and C-spines in p-IKK2 confirmed its active conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The p-IKK2 KD exhibited additional features consistent with an active kinase: a salt bridge between K44 and E61 (K72 and E91 in PKA, respectively), and the ‘DFG in’ conformation (although the sequence is DLG in IKK2). In addition, a dynamic cross-correlation matrix (DCCM) or contact map of each structure suggests that specific phosphorylation events render distinct allosteric changes to the kinase, even at locations distant from the phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>Next, we docked ATP onto IKK2 structures in all three states using LeDock and GOLD followed by rescoring with AutoDock Vina using the 0 ns (starting, S) and 200 ns (ending, E) structures of our MD simulation studies (see Materials and methods). The results indicated that ATP binding to P-IKK2 is relatively unfavorable (docking score in positive range) in both starting and ending structural models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>), whereas ATP binding to UnP-IKK2 and p-IKK2 is favorable. ADP binding is, however, favorable for all phosphorylated or unphosphorylated IKK2 structural models except for the starting conformation of P-IKK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). We also extracted 50 intermediate structures from a 10 ns MD simulation run and calculated their binding free energies (ΔG) using the MM-PBSA (Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area) method. We again observed that ATP binding for the P-IKK2 population is highly unfavorable in contrast to their high relative preference for ADP, whereas p-IKK2 displayed comparable preference for both ATP and ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>). In the ATP-docked structures, the ATP phosphate groups exhibited a pose (ΔG=–10.64 kcal/mol) very similar to that observed in the PKA structure (PDB ID: 1ATP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>), and the terminal phosphate was in close proximity to the Y169-OH, consistent with the likelihood of autophosphorylation at Y169 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Further analyses of the ATP-bound p-IKK2 structure confirmed that the presence of ATP enhanced the formation of the R- and C-spines, as observed in active forms of kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Superposition of the ATP from p-IKK2 on P-IKK2 indicated that narrowing of the canonical ATP-binding pocket in P-IKK2 may lead to rejection of ATP from the canonical binding pocket, triggered by severe clashes between the glycine-rich loop and ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). However, this does not exclude the possibility that P-IKK2 might interact with ATP through alternative binding modes. Furthermore, the R-spine in P-IKK2 exhibited a discontinuity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>), with M65 (L95 in PKA) located away from the other three conserved spine residues and from the glycine-rich loop.</p><p>Binding of ATP to p-IKK2 could lead to autophosphorylation at Y169, thus generating P-IKK2 bound to ADP. The superposition of ADP (from the docked complex of p-IKK2 and ADP, ΔG=–9.88 kCal/mol, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>) onto the P-IKK2 structure confirmed that while P-IKK2 is unable to accommodate ATP in a manner similar to that observed in experimentally determined kinase structures, it could accommodate ADP into the ATP-binding cleft comfortably (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). The affinities of ATP and ADP for p-IKK2 appear comparable as indicated by their respective binding energy/docking score values, like in other kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Becher et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, the cellular concentrations of ATP vs ADP could play an important role in kinase activity. We speculate that ADP-bound P-IKK2, containing various and perhaps transiently phosphorylated groups within the activation loop and in close proximity to the active site, could act as an intermediate to relay phosphates back to ATP or to substrates.</p><p>These observations of IKK2 structural propensities hint at the possibility of residues within the flexible activation loop undergoing context-sensitive autophosphorylation and possibly rendering IKK2 with novel phospho-transfer activities distinct from the conventional direct transfer of γ-phosphate from ATP to substrate.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Freshly autophosphorylated IKK2 phosphorylates IκBα even in the absence of ATP</title><p>We observed phosphorylation of tyrosine residue(s) only upon ATP treatment of purified IKK2 proteins, hinting at the likelihood of efficient cellular phosphotyrosine phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eckhart et al., 1979</xref>).

It is unclear if the month-long period of crystallization at 18–20°C contributed to the loss of the generally very stable phosphotyrosine residues. This raises the intriguing possibility that phosphotyrosine residue(s) in IKK2 might somehow serve as a transient sink of phosphate for its eventual transfer to ADP or serines in the IκBα substrate. To investigate this hypothesis, we first incubated purified IKK2 with limiting amounts of radiolabeled γ-<sup>32</sup>P-ATP for autophosphorylation and subsequently removed unreacted ATP via two passes through desalting spin columns (40 kDa MWCO). The nucleotide-free autophosphorylated IKK2 (P-IKK2) was then incubated with substrate IκBα either in the absence or with the fresh addition of unlabeled ATP/ADP. Resolution of the reaction mixture on an SDS-PAGE and subsequent autoradiography indicated transfer of radiolabeled phosphate to IκBα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), which was significantly enhanced in the presence of cold ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Addition of excess cold ATP did not reduce the extent of IκBα phosphorylation, strongly suggesting the transfer of <sup>32</sup>P-phosphate from <sup>32</sup>P-IKK2 to IκBα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and consistent with an IKK2-mediated phosphate relay mechanism.

P-IKK2 eluted at SEC fractions corresponding to MW between 670 and 158 kDa, much earlier than free ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This P-IKK2 was incubated with IκBα substrate either in the presence or absence of ADP for varying time periods. A similar reaction was set up in the presence of ATP instead of ADP as a positive control. We observed, by western blot with sequence-specific anti-phosphoserine antibody, efficient phosphorylation of IκBα S32 and S36 residues in the presence of ADP (10 and 50 μM) but not in its absence. As anticipated, a robust phosphorylation of IκBα was observed in the presence of 50 μM ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). The very low-level detection of IκBα phosphorylation by radioactive assay in the absence of ADP and complete lack of signal in the cold immunoblotting assay (compare lanes marked with vertical arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and E</xref>) may indicate higher sensitivity of the radioactive assay.

This suggests that diverse adenine nucleotides prompt phosphotransfer by the kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

IKK2, a kinase central to inflammation, phosphorylates serine residues of its primary substrate IκBα using γ-phosphate of ATP. In this study, we report several intriguing structural and biochemical properties of IKK2 that contribute to its substrate phosphorylation specificity and efficiency: (1) dual-specificity of IKK2 that entails autophosphorylation of its own tyrosine residues, in addition to known autophosphorylation of activation loop serines; (2) loss of specificity, but retention of diminished catalytic activity, upon disruption of a universally conserved salt bridge mediated by K44 in IKK2; and (3) relay of phosphate to substrate IκBα from autophosphorylated IKK2 (P-IKK2).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Dual specificity of IKK2</title><p>Our present analyses of IKK2 revealed a surprising property wherein IKK2 phosphorylated at activation loop serines S177/S181 could be further autophosphorylated by ATP at multiple sites, including at least one of its tyrosine residues, yielding a hyper-phosphorylated form (P-IKK2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This defines IKK2 as an autocatalytic dual-specificity kinase rather than simply a prototypical Ser/Thr kinase. Several members of the Ser/Thr kinase family have been reported to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation, and it appears that many of these kinases employ diverse strategies for phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhattacharyya et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ge et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lochhead, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lochhead et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lochhead et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sugiyama et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tigno-Aranjuez et al., 2010</xref>).

In contrast, histidine kinases found in prokaryotes and in some simple eukaryotes employ a mechanism in which the γ-phosphate of ATP is transferred first to an aspartate residue on a response regulator (RR) substrate through an internal phosphohistidine intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Borkovich and Simon, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gao and Stock, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hunter, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kalagiri and Hunter, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Laub et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Robbins et al., 1993</xref>). Surprisingly, the hyper-phosphorylated P-IKK2 appears to display an ability to transfer phosphate(s) to substrate IκBα in the presence of ADP without requiring an exogenous supply of fresh ATP – hinting at the possibility of IKK2 acting as a phosphate sink capable of relaying phosphate from the phosphoenzyme intermediate to the substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and E</xref>). Since this phosphotransfer to S32 and S36 of IκBα is observed with autophosphorylated, constitutively active IKK2 EE, the transferred phosphates are unlikely to derive from phosphorylated S177 or S181. Phosphorylated Y169, on the other hand, could be a suitable candidate to act as an intermediate and a source of transferable phosphate due to its conducive location at the DFG +1 (DLG in IKK2) position. Y169 seems particularly fit for this role as it is the only active site-proximal residue prominently autophosphorylated within the activation loop of IKK2 (Figure S3A). Tyrosine at this position is unique only to IKK1 and IKK2 and the plant kinase SNRK1 and is absent even in close mammalian orthologs such as IKKε and TBK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Larabi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tu et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, a study has implicated the role of DFG +1 residue in differentiating kinase specificity toward Ser versus Thr residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). These observations hint at the possibility of Y169 being involved in phosphorylation selectivity of IκBα substrate. We observed a role for Y169 in phosphorylating S32 of IκBα using both in vitro and ex vivo experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F &amp; G</xref>); however, our data does not confirm if Y169 phosphorylation is the sole contributor to specific signal-responsive phosphorylation of IκBα. It is noteworthy that an S32I mutant of IκBα containing the phosphoablative mutation at S32 is associated with ectodermal dysplasia and T-cell immunodeficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Courtois et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mooster et al., 2015</xref>). Autophosphorylation in the kinase domain has been observed to regulate function in other kinases as well, for example autophosphorylation at T220 greatly influenced both the activity and substrate specificity of CK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cullati et al., 2022</xref>). So far, IKK2 appears to be the only other metazoan protein kinase that derives its substrate specificity through the formation of a phosphoenzyme intermediate apart from MHCK of <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> (an atypical eukaryotic protein kinase; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ye et al., 2010</xref>). The transfer of phosphate from Tyr169 to Ser32 of IκBα represents an intriguing and unprecedented mechanism among metazoan protein kinases. We propose a possible explanation for the process: the hydroxyl group of Tyr169 is optimally positioned to readily accept the γ-phosphate from ATP at the expense of minimal energy in the presence or absence of the substrate IκBα. This relay of phosphate – from ATP to Tyr169 to Ser32 – might offer a more energetically favorable pathway than a direct transfer of phosphate from ATP to the substrate. Another intriguing feature of phosphorelay in IKK2 is its dependence on ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B &amp; E</xref>), which the generic kinase inhibitor AMPPNP (unhydrolyzable ATP analogue) failed to inhibit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Taken together, we surmise that ADP or AMPPNP might act as an ATP surrogate in helping IKK2 adopt a conformational state commensurate with selective phosphorylation of S32 and S36 in IκBα. A similar phenomenon is reported for IRE1, where ADP was found to be a potent stimulator of its ribonuclease activity, and AMPPNP was also reported as a somewhat effective potentiator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sidrauski and Walter, 1997</xref>). We speculate that Ser32 cannot be efficiently phosphorylated by p-IKK2:ATP due to a deliberate chemical mismatch of the hydroxyl group of Ser32 within the active site. However, it aligns well with the P-IKK2:ADP intermediate. Indirect supporting evidence, as described above, underscores the existence of a unique phosphotransfer mechanism; however, detailed structural, biochemical, and MD simulations studies are necessary to validate this model.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Signaling specificity and digital activation</title><p>The amplitude, duration, and kinetics of IKK activity correlate with the strength of input signal, level of IκBα degradation, and NF-κB activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Behar and Hoffmann, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheong et al., 2006</xref>). This digital (all-or-none) activation profile of NF-κB appears to be due to rapid activation and inactivation of IKK2. The primary target of IKK2 is IκBα, which underlies the rapid activation of NF-κB, although multiple other substrates are targeted in vivo. This digital activation profile may be intrinsically linked to the phosphorelay process. The selection of specific IκBα residues for phosphorylation is unclear, although NEMO is reported to have a direct role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schröfelbauer et al., 2012</xref>). We observe that P-IKK2 transfers phosphate(s) efficiently and specifically to S32 and S36 of IκBα, but not to other phosphorylatable sites, such as the serine and threonine residues within the IκBα C-terminal PEST region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5B, E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A</xref>). We surmise that the transiency of various phosphorylated residues in P-IKK2 could underlie the activation-inactivation event during signal response. In this context, it will be worth investigating if functional regulation of IKK2 involves properties analogous to that of the two-component histidine kinase-effector systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhate et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lamarche et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Laub and Goulian, 2007</xref>). It is noteworthy that phosphate transfer directly from phosphohistidine is energetically far more favorable than from phosphotyrosine, except in enzymatic processes. The phosphotransfer from P-IKK2 to IκBα investigated and reported herein reflects a single turnover event in the absence of the phosphate donor, ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Not every phosphorylated residue over the long span of P-IKK2 is expected to have the ability to transfer its phosphate to IκBα and additionally, the P-IKK2 likely represents a pool with a non-homogeneous distribution of phosphorylated residues. This could be a reason for the observance of the sub-stoichiometric phospho-relay.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>The K44-conserved salt bridge is a determinant of specificity but not activity</title><p>We also observe a critical role of K44 in autophosphorylation of IKK2 and specific phosphorylation of S32 and S36 in IκBα. Interestingly, the IKK2 K44M mutant retained its non-specific kinase activity toward the C-terminal PEST region of IκBα. Along these lines, an engineered monomeric version of IKK2 (lacking its NBD and major portions of its SDD) was observed to retain specificity for the N-terminal serines of IκBα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hauenstein et al., 2014</xref>), whereas a smaller version of IKK2 with only the KD and ULD lacked S32 and S36 specificity but retained the ability to phosphorylate IκBα within its C-terminal PEST region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shaul et al., 2008</xref>). It is possible that a particular structural state of IKK2 or its interaction with a partner protein could direct IKK2 to phosphorylate specific sites within different substrates.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>It is intriguing how the activation of NF-κB, through unique phosphorylation events catalyzed by IKK2, appears to be regulated by a complex and multi-layered fail-safe mechanism. In the absence of upstream signals, the IKK complex is unable to phosphorylate Ser 32/36 of IκBα efficiently, thereby keeping a check on the aberrant and untimely activation of NF-κB. Upon encountering proinflammatory cues, cells need to activate NF-κB immediately, efficiently, and specifically, that is IKK needs to be activated and phosphorylate Ser 32/36 of IκBα. NEMO warrants IKK activation and ensures that the IKK complex specifically chooses IκBα from a large pool of substrates of IKK2. IKK2 is designed in such a manner that it phosphorylates itself at an activation loop tyrosine when activated, such that phosphate group(s) can be relayed directly to Ser32/36 of IκBα with great fidelity, thus leaving little chance of a misconstrued signaling event thereby confirming NF-κB activation. Our discovery of an intriguing phosphotransfer reaction that helps accomplish the desired specificity could present the beginning of a new aspect in eukaryotic cell signaling by EPKs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Immortalized MEF cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated bovine calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and L-glutamine (1%) at 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 37 °C. Authenticity of MEF cells was carefully assessed by observing their characteristic spindle shape morphology and their conformity to 3T3 fibroblasts, and by observing contact inhibition properties. The cells were also routinely assessed for the presence/absence of IKK1 and IKK2, and IκBα degradation dynamics in response to mouse TNFα treatment using immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Polley et al., 2016</xref>). Cells were tested negative for mycoplasma contamination. Mycoplasma contamination/infection leads to the degradation of IκBα protein and NF-κB activation even in the absence of any known external signaling cues (i.e. control untreated cells) and thus is easily recognized and could be further tested. In summary, cells were carefully maintained as adherent monolayer cultures using the 3T3 protocol, and cells not conforming to ideal phenotypic or functional NF-κB signaling characteristics were discarded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>IKK2 (WT and other constructs)</title><p>Full-length human IKK2 cDNA was a gift from the laboratory of M.

For the site-directed mutagenesis, all substitutions of the mutants, namely IKK2 AA, IKK2 Y169F, and IKK2 K44M, were performed within the pFastBac HTB vector harboring FL IKK2 WT. Wild-type and mutant IKK2 proteins were purified following a published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Polley et al., 2013</xref>). Sf9 cells (Gibco Sf9 cells in Sf-900 III SFM) at a density of 1.5–2 million/ml were infected with a high titer viral stock (generally stage P3 or beyond) at a ratio (usually around 1:100) optimized for a high expression level through a pilot experiment and cultured for 48–60 hr upon infection. Cells were harvested and lysed by sonication in a buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 10% Glycerol, 5 mM β-Mercaptoethanol (β-ME), 10 mM Imidazole, 20 mM β-glycerophosphate, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, and 1 X Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (PIC, Sigma). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 x <italic>g</italic> for 45 min at 4 °C and incubated with Ni-NTA agarose resin (QAGEN, catalogue number: 30230) pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer for 2 hr at 4 °C. The resin was subsequently washed with lysis buffer containing 30 mM Imidazole. Protein was eluted with lysis buffer containing 250 mM Imidazole. Protein fractions were analyzed on SDS-PAGE, pooled together, concentrated, and either flash frozen or subjected to size-exclusion chromatography on Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL (Cytiva) column equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0/25 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 200 mM NaCl, 10% Glycerol and 2 mM DTT.

The resulting protein mix was then loaded onto the SEC as described above. To prepare autophosphorylated IKK2, the fractions with the desired purity level were treated with 0.5–1 mM of ATP, 10 mM of MgCl<sub>2</sub> and phosphatase inhibitors and the reaction mixture was incubated at 27 °C for 1 hr. Resulting reaction mixture was concentrated in a YM30-concentrator and loaded onto a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column. Elution fractions of the size-exclusion chromatography were analyzed on an SDS-PAGE, and peak fractions of desired quality were pooled together and concentrated using a YM30 Centriprep (Millipore) or Centricon devices (Millipore) depending upon the volume of the sample, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>IκBα (WT, mutant and other constructs)</title><p>Full-length human IκBα was subcloned into the <italic>BamHI</italic> and <italic>SalI</italic> restriction sites of the pET24d vector such that it is in frame with the N-terminal hexa-histidine tag followed by a TEV-protease cleavage site. All substitutions for each mutation, namely S32A/E and S36A/E, as well as S32A,S36A were made through site-directed mutagenesis performed within the pGEX4T-2 vector harboring GST-IκBα (1-54) WT. His-tagged full-length and GST-tagged deletion (1-54) constructs of IκBα (both the wild-type and Ser32Ala, Ser36Ala, Ser32Glu, Ser36Glu, Ser32Ala,Ser36Ala single and double-mutant versions) were expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> Rosetta2 (DE3).

For radioactive assays, the gels were quickly stained and de-stained by Coomassie staining protocol to confirm loading equivalencies. Typically, the substrate band(s) were monitored for this purpose as kinase band(s) were not visible in quick Coomassie staining protocol. For radioactive kinase assays with the IKK2 K44M mutant, a higher amount of kinase was used (0.5–1 μg), and the kinase band was visible following the same staining/de-staining protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and S3E, Fig. S1A). The gels were subsequently dried and analyzed using Typhoon phosphor imager or by exposing them to Kodak films.

Phosphorylated tyrosine and serine residues were detected using monoclonal antibodies against phospho-tyrosine and phospho-serine. Specific phosphorylation on S32/S36 of IκBα was detected using a monoclonal antibody against IκBα phosphorylated at S32/36, and phosphorylation at the activation loop serines of IKK2 was detected using a monoclonal antibody against IKK2 phosphorylated at S177/S181.</p><p>For the assays with inhibitors, IKK2 or IKK2:IκBα were mixed with the respective inhibitors in the kinase assay buffer at concentrations indicated in the respective figures for 30 min at room temperature - prior to the addition of ATP or γ-P<sup>32</sup>-ATP.

From the resulting reaction mixture, 500 μl was loaded onto a Superdex 200 increase 10/300 GL (24 ml bed volume, Cytiva) SEC column to separate autophosphorylated FL IKK2WT from excess ATP. SEC was performed in buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM β-glycerophosphate, 10 mM NaF, 0.2 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub> and 2 mM DTT. The elution fractions containing phosphorylated IKK2 were incubated with FL IκBαWT in the presence of different concentrations of ATP or ADP at different time points (as mentioned in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) at 30 °C. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 4 X Laemmli SDS dye and heating at 95 °C for 5 min and prior to resolving on a 10% SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was performed using monoclonal antibodies against phospho-tyrosine and phospho Ser32/36 IκBα to detect phosphorylations. This assay was performed twice, and the representative figure is shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Molecular dynamics simulation</title><p>The kinase domain structure of IKK2 (PDB ID: 4E3C), spanning residues 16–310, was obtained from the PDB database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berman et al., 2000</xref>). We created unphosphorylated forms (at Ser177 &amp; Ser181) and two phosphorylated forms (phosphorylated at Ser177 &amp; Ser181 and at Tyr169 &amp; Ser177 &amp; Ser181) of IKK2 using UCSF CHIMERA software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>). These structures underwent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the GROMACSv2023.1 simulation package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2015</xref>), enabling a comparative analysis of their structural and energetic stability. The Charmm36 force field was applied to generate coordinates and topology files for the IKK2 structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huang and MacKerell, 2013</xref>). For simulation, a cubic box was defined and filled with TIP3 water molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jorgensen et al., 1983</xref>). Sodium and chloride ions were added to neutralize the three systems. The system underwent two-stage minimization using steepest-descent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nocedal and Wright, 1999</xref>) and conjugate-gradient algorithms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Straeter, 1971</xref>). Equilibration was carried out under NVT (constant particle number, volume, and temperature) and NPT (constant particle number, pressure, and temperature) conditions for 200 ps at 300 K and 1 atm pressure. MD simulations were conducted for 200 ns for each protein. To assess global structural changes, Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) analysis was employed, while Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF) analysis revealed the overall and local motion/flexibility of the proteins. The <italic>gmx_energy</italic> module was utilized to compute energy during simulation, and <italic>gmx_sasa</italic> was employed to determine the solvent accessible surface area (SASA) of the protein. To understand the correlations of the atomic motions in different regions, the dynamic cross-correlation analysis was carried out. The initial step of dynamic cross-correlation analysis was to construct the covariance matrix, which examines the linear relationship of atomic fluctuations for individual atomic pairs. The covariance matrix was calculated using the <italic>gmx_covar</italic> tool. Dynamic cross-correlation matrices (DCCM) were calculated from the C<sub>α</sub>-trace covariance matrix principal components. Results are displayed as color-coded, with a value of −1 indicating completely anti-correlated motions and a value of +1 indicating completely correlated motions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Molecular docking analysis</title><p>The initial (0th ns) and terminal (200th ns) structures from the simulations of unphosphorylated (UnP-IKK2), double phosphorylated (p-IKK2), and triple phosphorylated (P-IKK2) forms were subjected to molecular docking analysis using ATP and ADP as ligands, allowing for comparison of binding affinities. LeDock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu and Xu, 2019</xref>) and GOLD software were employed for ligand-protein docking. IKK2: ATP docking poses were compared with available kinase:ATP complexes, for example PKA: ATP complex (PDB ID: 1ATP) by calculating the ligand root mean square deviation (RMSD). The pose that resembled most with the pose found in PDB ID 1ATP was chosen for further analysis. Similarly, IKK2: ADP docking poses were also compared, where IRE1: ADP (PDB ID: 2RIO) complex was chosen for comparison, and the pose closest to that in PDB ID: 2RIO was chosen for further analysis. Finally, the best selected poses were rescored using AutoDock Vina to represent the predicted binding affinities.</p><p>For assessing the ability of P-IKK2 to accommodate ATP or ADP, the MD-simulation-derived P-IKK2 structure was superimposed on the p-IKK2 structure bound to ATP/ADP and compared as described.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Estimation of binding free energy</title><p>Following the identification of the best docking pose, another round of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was conducted using GROMACS for 10 ns. 50 intermediate complex structures were extracted from each simulation run.

This suggests that autophosphorylation is reflective of its known specific biological role in signal transduction. But I do not understand why &quot;these results strongly suggest that IKK2-autophosphorylation is critical for its substrate specificity&quot;. That statement would be supported by a mutant that no longer autophosphorylates, and as a result shows a loss of substrate specificity, i.e. phosphorylates non-specific residues more strongly. Is that the case? Maybe Darwech et al 2010 or Meyer et al 2013 showed this? Later figures seem to address this point, so maybe this conclusion should be stated later in the paper.</p><p>Page 10: mentions DFG+1 without proper introduction. The Chen et al 2014 paper appears to inform the author's interest in Y169 phosphorylation, or is just an additional interesting finding?

However, there is only a single timepoint and condition, which does not allow for a quantitative analysis. Furthermore, a positive control would make this experiment more compelling, and Y169F mutant should show that cold ATP quenching reduces the phosphorylation of IkBa.</p><p>Note after revision: I thank the authors for addressing these points.

The details are hard to see at the scale provided, but the fragment ions for pY188 and pY325 peptides are unconvincing. Phospho-Y169, on the other hand, is much more credible. In addition, the revision rebuttal clarifies that Y188 would be packed into a catalytically important core, and Y188F is likely to disrupt the fold. Taken together, it seems doubtful that Y188 is subject to any significant autophosphorylation, and presenting the Y188F data (and discussion) seems like a distraction.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s concerns on the identification of Y188 and Y325 as potential phosphosites. They have been omitted in the current version and relevant sections in the manuscript text and figures have been edited.</p></body></sub-article></article>
