Human somatic cells may contain up to seven histone H1 variants, although their functional heterogeneity is not fully understood. Here, we have profiled the differential nuclear distribution of the somatic H1 repertoire in human cells through imaging techniques including super-resolution microscopy. H1 variants exhibit characteristic distribution patterns in both interphase and mitosis. H1.2, H1.3, and H1.5 are universally enriched at the nuclear periphery in all cell lines analyzed and co-localize with compacted DNA. H1.0 shows a less pronounced peripheral localization, with apparent variability among different cell lines. On the other hand, H1.4 and H1X are distributed throughout the nucleus, being H1X universally enriched in high-GC regions and abundant in the nucleoli. Interestingly, H1.4 and H1.0 show a more peripheral distribution in cell lines lacking H1.3 and H1.5. The differential distribution patterns of H1 suggest specific functionalities in organizing lamina-associated domains or nucleolar activity, which is further supported by a distinct response of H1X or phosphorylated H1.4 to the inhibition of ribosomal DNA transcription. Moreover, H1 variants depletion affects chromatin structure in a variant-specific manner. Concretely, H1.2 knock-down, either alone or combined, triggers a global chromatin decompaction. Overall, imaging has allowed us to distinguish H1 variants distribution beyond the segregation in two groups denoted by previous ChIP-Seq determinations. Our results support H1 variants heterogeneity and suggest that variant-specific functionality can be shared between different cell types.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>histone H1</kwd><kwd>histone variants</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>heterochromatin</kwd><kwd>super-resolution imaging</kwd><kwd>nucleoli</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014440</institution-id><institution>Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PID2020-112783GB-C21/AEI/10.13039/501100011033</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jordan</surname><given-names>Albert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Imaging analysis confirms ChIP-Seq data on the distinct genomic distribution of histone H1 variants in AT-rich, nuclear peripheral regions (H1.2, H1.3, H1.5, H1.0) or GC-rich, throughout the nucleus (H1.4, H1X).</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The eukaryotic genome is organized in a functional and spatially segregated manner within the interphase nucleus. Nuclear architecture plays a crucial role in gene regulation and defining cellular identity. Early studies led to the classical view of a bipartite chromatin composition in which euchromatin is defined as active chromatin located at the nuclear center while heterochromatin corresponds to the more compact chromatin fraction, generally positioned at the nuclear periphery and surrounding the nucleoli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cremer and Cremer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jost et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Solovei et al., 2016</xref>). While heterochromatin correlates with late-replicating, low-GC chromatin, euchromatin is characterized by an early replication timing and high-GC content. This differential epigenetic landscape of the interphase nucleus can be also recapitulated by Giemsa bands (G-bands) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Serna-Pujol et al., 2021</xref>), which arise from the characteristic banding of metaphase chromosomes.</p><p>Chromatin organization involves several hierarchical levels, including chromosome territories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cremer and Cremer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Girelli et al., 2020</xref>), A (active) and B (inactive) compartments at the megabase level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009</xref>), topological associated domains (TADs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nora et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sexton et al., 2012</xref>), and chromatin loops. Moreover, chromatin segregation is facilitated by chromatin tethering to scaffolding structures. This anchorage originates nuclear environments referred as lamina-associated domains (LADs) or nucleolus-associated domains (NADs), which constitute heterochromatic regions anchored to the nuclear lamina and the nucleolus, respectively.</p><p>Human cells have 1000–1500 LADs that cover more than one-third of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guelen et al., 2008</xref>). LADs represent a well-known repressive environment, characterized by low gene density, low gene expression, and a great overlap with B compartment. LADs are enriched in repressive histone modifications, including H3K9me2, which is considered a conserved chromatin mark of LADs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Poleshko et al., 2019</xref>). While H3K9me2 plays a part in anchoring chromatin to the nuclear lamina, current data indicate that it is probably not a sufficient signal in mammals, as other anchoring mechanisms may exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harr et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kind et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The nucleolus is a membraneless structure where ribosome biogenesis and regulation occurs. Nucleoli also act as central chromatin organizers. Genomic regions positioned close to nucleolus are referred as NADs, which were firstly genome-wide identified in human using a biochemical purification of nucleoli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dillinger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Németh et al., 2010</xref>). NADs consist of mainly heterochromatic regions and an important overlap with LADs was found. Accordingly, some LADs have been found to stochastically reshuffled after mitosis and associate with nucleoli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kind et al., 2013</xref>). These observations suggest that the lamina and nucleolus could act as interchangeable scaffolds for heterochromatin positioning. More recently, the inclusion of HiC-based approaches has provided more accurate genome-wide NADs maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bersaglieri et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Peng et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Histone composition, including histone variants and their modifications, also plays a role in defining chromatin functionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martire and Banaszynski, 2020</xref>). In particular, linker histone H1 family is evolutionary diverse and human somatic cells may contain up to seven H1 variants (H1.1 to H1.5, H1.0, and H1X). Although H1 has classically been regarded as a general repressor, increasing evidence support H1 variants functional diversity in chromatin regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fyodorov et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Millán-Ariño et al., 2016</xref>). A compromised H1 content causes chromatin structural defects, evidenced both in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Serna-Pujol et al., 2022</xref>) and mice models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Geeven et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Willcockson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yusufova et al., 2021</xref>). Although in these scenarios multiple H1 variants depletion leads to chromatin decompaction, the contribution of individual H1 variants in maintaining chromatin structure has not been studied.</p><p>A long-standing enigma concerning H1 is whether its variants have a uniform distribution in different cell types or, conversely, display cell-line-specific binding patterns. The presumption that H1 variants are specifically distributed among different cell lines comes from combining various pieces of evidence from different publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Izzo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Millán-Ariño et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Torres et al., 2016</xref>). Nevertheless, no study has properly addressed the question up to date. Consequently, the absence of existing reports using standardized experimental and analytical workflows may lead to potential misinterpretation of the data. The only studies that performed a systematic analysis of different variants have been performed in a single-cell model and often used overexpression strategies. These include the analysis of H1.1–H1.5 using DamID in IMR-90 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Izzo et al., 2013</xref>), and a second report in which ChIP-Seq of endogenous H1.2 and H1X and the exogenous H1.0-HA and H1.4-HA was performed in T47D cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Millán-Ariño et al., 2014</xref>). Recently, we performed the first genome-wide analysis of six endogenous H1 variants in human cells, bypassing the everlasting limitation of mapping exogenous proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Serna-Pujol et al., 2022</xref> and in preparation for H1.3 data). In T47D cells, H1 variants are distributed in two large groups depending on the local GC content. H1.2, H1.3, H1.5, and H1.0 are enriched at low-GC regions and B compartment while H1.4 and H1X are more abundant within high-GC regions and A compartment. However, whether these distribution profiles are conserved among different cell types remains unknown.</p><p>H1 complement (i.e. H1 variants and its proportions present in a specific cell) is dynamic throughout differentiation and cancer and also varies between cell types. Whether these expression fluctuations translate into changes in distribution patterns has not been studied. The best-characterized example is H1.0, which accumulates during differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Terme et al., 2011</xref>) and whose expression is associated to a less aggressive phenotype of tumoral cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Torres et al., 2016</xref>). H1.0 has been described as a replacement histone, as it responds to a compromised H1 content. In breast cancer cells, combined depletion of H1.2 and H1.4 leads to H1.0 upregulation, although without significant redistribution alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Izquierdo-Bouldstridge et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Serna-Pujol et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we provide novel insights into the differential nuclear distribution of somatic H1 variants in human cells, through an imaging approach. Super-resolution microscopy in T47D cells shows that H1.2, H1.3, H1.5 and, to a lesser extent, H1.0, are enriched at the nuclear periphery and coincide more with more compacted DNA, as supported by super-resolution microscopy. Contrarywise, H1X and H1.4 are distributed throughout the nucleus with a significant H1X enrichment in nucleoli. Differential distribution patterns suggest concrete implications in genome functionality and translate into variant-specific functional consequences upon H1 depletion. Specifically, single or combined H1.2 depletion triggers a general chromatin decompaction, which is not observed when depleting H1.4 or H1X. Furthermore, we conducted the first systematic comparison of six somatic H1 variants in several human cell lines, including ChIP-Seq profiling of H1X in different cell types, which has only been mapped in T47D breast cancer cells up to date. Interestingly, certain H1 variants display universal distribution patterns, despite variations in H1 complement across cell lines. H1.2, H1.3, and H1.5 are consistently enriched at the nuclear periphery while H1X is more abundant at high-GC regions and present at nucleoli in all cell lines evaluated. We identified a recurring concomitant absence of H1.3 and H1.5, and this specific H1 complement is associated with a more peripheral distribution of H1.0 and H1.4 proteins, suggesting potential compensatory mechanisms between variants. Altogether, our study represents a comprehensive attempt to systematically characterize the repertoire of somatic H1 variants, their differential distribution in the human genome and their functional diversity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Histone H1 variants are differentially enriched toward the periphery of the interphase nucleus and at nucleoli</title><p>We have recently reported that H1 variants are differentially distributed into two main groups within the genome of T47D cells: H1.0, H1.2, H1.3, and H1.5 are enriched in low-GC regions while H1.4 and H1X are more abundant at high-GC regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Serna-Pujol et al., 2022</xref>) (hereafter referred as ‘low-GC’ or ‘high-GC’ H1 variants). However, how these variants are distributed along the nucleus, where chromatin is spatially arranged to regulate genome function, remains unknown. Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that different H1 variants exhibit unique nuclear patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). H1.2, H1.3, and H1.5 were observed to be enriched at the nuclear periphery, while H1.0 was distributed throughout the nucleus, with certain enrichment territories that tend to be peripheral. On the other hand, H1.4 and H1X were found to be homogeneously distributed throughout the nucleus, with the difference that H1X was particularly abundant in the nucleoli. H1.2, H1.3, H1.5, and H1.0 showed a coincident pattern with DNA staining one, suggesting an enrichment at more condensed-DNA nuclear areas, including but not limited to the nuclear periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, bottom panels). H1.4 profile only partially mimicked DNA pattern while H1X profile was opposite to that of DNA. Overall, these results are compatible with the classification of H1 variants into two differential groups, as previously suggested by ChIP-Seq analysis, as low-GC chromatin tends to be peripheral and coincides with late-replicating heterochromatin. Accordingly, co-immunostaining of H1 variants with HP1alpha denoted that low-GC H1s tend to better co-localize with this heterochromatin marker compared to high-GC H1 variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>H1 variants are differentially enriched toward the nuclear periphery in T47D cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Confocal immunofluorescence of H1 variants (green) and DNA staining (blue).

As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, four sections of an equivalent area and convergent to the nuclear center are created per each cell.

Each nucleus was automatically divided into four sections of equal area (as exemplified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and the percentage of H1 intensity present in each area was quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). H1.2, H1.3, and H1.5 showed a clear relationship with radiality, becoming increasingly abundant from the nuclear center to the periphery. Importantly, H1.0 was found to be most abundant at the two most peripheral percentiles. A different distribution was observed for H1.4, which was more equally distributed along A1–A4 sections, being more abundant at intermediate A2–A3 percentiles. H1X was gradually increasing toward the nucleus center. It is important to note that, in part, this gradual profile is due to the nucleolar H1X fraction, as nucleoli tend to be located at central nuclear positions and we are not excluding nucleoli from the analysis.</p><p>Differential H1 ‘radiality’ is related to the spatial organization of chromatin in the nucleus of mammalian cells and the concept of chromosomes territories. Chromosomes are not randomly positioned in the nucleus; gene-poor chromosomes are located at peripheral positions while gene-rich chromosomes tend to occupy central regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boyle et al., 2001</xref>). We computed H1 variants ChIP-Seq abundance at chromosomes reported to occupy different radial territories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and, supporting immunofluorescence quantification, we found that H1.2, H1.3, H1.5, and H1.0 were enriched at peripheral chromosomes over central ones. On the contrary, H1.4 and H1X were more abundant at chromosomes located in central positions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Super-resolution imaging shows that low-GC H1 variants co-localize with compacted DNA and do not overlap</title><p>We sought to extend the analysis to the super-resolution level.

Of note, DNA super-resolution imaging distinguishes between areas of densely packed DNA and areas with little or no DNA signal, compared to the typically blurred DNA signal resolved by confocal resolution. Consequently, the DNA we detected through SRRF imaging represents chromatin in a more condensed or closed state, relative to surrounding regions. H1.2, H1.3, H1.5, and H1.0 showed a higher degree of co-localization with DNA compared to H1.4 and H1X, with H1X showing the least co-localization. In summary, our super-resolution co-localization studies of H1 variants with DNA reinforced the differential nuclear patterns obtained at a conventional resolution. Moreover, SRRF imaging highlights that, although showing preferential relative enrichment to concrete nuclear regions, such as nuclear periphery or nucleoli, H1 variants are not restricted to those compartments.</p><p>To further characterize H1 variants patterns, we next studied how H1.0 co-localizes with the rest of H1 variants in single nucleolus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Preferential co-localization of H1.0 with H1.2/H1.3/H1.5 over H1.4 and H1X was evident at confocal resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>), suggesting that low-GC variants occupy similar nuclear territories and supporting ChIP-Seq profiling obtained when analyzing T47D cell population. However, at the super-resolution level all H1 variants co-localized poorly with H1.0, suggesting that they occupy different chromatin fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This observation could be underlying the principles of nucleosome composition and 3D chromatin organization. Considering the dissimilarities observed between the standard and super-resolution approaches, results suggest that, in single cells, at least in more closed regions where H1.0/H1.2/H1.3/H1.5 are more abundant, H1 variants are not occupying random positions in nearby nucleosomes. If that were the case, co-localization between the different ‘low-GC’ variants (versus ‘high-GC’ ones) would not be lost when improving resolution. Therefore, a compatible model with our results is that, in single cells, heterochromatic 3D nanodomains tend to be consistently marked by a certain H1 variant.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Attachment of H1 to mitotic chromosomes differs between variants</title><p>As H1 variants showed different nuclear patterns in interphasic cells, we studied whether these differential patterns were also observed through mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Co-immunostaining of replication-independent H1.0 and H1X was performed and their distribution through consecutive phases of mitosis was monitored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). H1.0 and H1X exhibited completely different distribution patterns. While H1.0 was anchored to mitotic chromosomes, H1X was not recruited to mitotic chromosomes and it accumulated to the perichromosomal region.</p><p>H1 variants highly enriched at nuclear periphery during interphase were co-examined with Lamin A along mitotic progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B–D</xref>). Since nuclear lamina is disassembled during mitosis, we wondered whether the positional information of H1-marked chromatin was maintained through mitosis. H1.3 and H1.5 showed similar distribution profiles throughout mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B, C</xref>). Both H1 variants persisted at mitotic chromatin, being specially enriched at the periphery of condensed chromosomes. Importantly, H1.3 and H1.5 layers re-associate with the forming nuclear lamina before mitotic exit. Instead, H1.2 signal was dispersed after prophase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>). H1.2 was re-detected at anaphase, when its peripheral enrichment was re-acquired, parallel to lamina re-assembly. These results suggest that radial position of H1.2-, H1.3-, and H1.5-marked chromatin is inherited through mitosis. These genomic regions are re-localized to the nuclear periphery following mitotic division and the nuclear lamina reassembles around H1.2-, H1.3-, or H1.5-associated chromatin.</p><p>The apparent absence of H1.2 (and H1.4, data not shown) at intermediate mitotic stages is striking. H1 proteins are highly phoshphorylated during mitosis, so we explored whether apparent mitotic absence was due to these H1 variants becoming highly post-translationally modified during mitosis, and the antibodies are not recognizing the H1-modified fraction. H1.2 phosphorylation of Threonine 165 (H1.2-pT165) and H1.4 phosphorylation of Threonine 146 (H1.4-pT146) were found to be highly increased in mitosis compared to interphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Thus, this confirms that H1.2 and H1.4 proteins are not absent at certain mitotic phases, but antibodies are unable to recognize their post-translationally modified state. Although these modifications are most prevalent in mitosis, they are also detected at interphase. Early-mitotic H1.2pT165 was found to be associated with condensed chromosomes, with maximum levels occurring at metaphase and drastically dropping down at later mitotic phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). These temporal dynamics coincide with the previously discussed lack of H1.2 detection at metaphase and the re-appearance of H1.2 signal at anaphase/telophase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Furthermore, H1.4-pT146 was also more enriched at early mitotic stages, but excluded from metaphasic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Instead, H1.4-pT146 was accumulated adjacent to chromosomes, in the perichromosomal layer, similar to what was observed for H1X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><p>Overall, analysis of H1 variants during mitosis indicates that the two H1 groups defined by ChIP-Seq analysis present distinct localization patterns through mitosis. While ‘low-GC’ H1s (whether phosphorylated or not) are associated with mitotic chromosomes, ‘high-GC’ variants (phosphorylated or not) are excluded from mitotic chromosomes and accumulate to the perichromosomal region. In addition, H1.3 and H1.5 are enriched toward the peripheral chromosome regions, in comparison to H1.0 or H1.2-pT165. In conclusion, imaging experiments support the differential distribution of H1 variants not only during interphase but also in mitotic cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>H1.2, H1.3, and H1.5 are enriched within LADs</title><p>Genome conformation is regulated by the tethering of chromatin to scaffold structures, such as the nuclear lamina or nucleolus.

To begin with, nucleolar H1X enrichment was found using alternative permeabilization methods (data not shown) and both nucleolar and non-nucleolar signals were drastically reduced upon specific H1X depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), confirming that nucleolar H1X enrichment is not an artifact. Co-immunostaining of H1X and the nucleolar marker Nucleophosmin (NPM1) confirmed that H1X was located inside nucleoli, with a tendency to form a ring-like layer adjacent to NPM1 on the inner side of nucleoli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E, F</xref>).</p><p>Nonetheless, H1X was not the only H1 variant present at nucleoli, as H1.2-pT165 and H1.4-pT146 were also present at nucleoli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B, C</xref>). While interphasic H1.2-pT165 was highly enriched within nucleoli, interphasic H1.4-pT146 was not restricted to nucleoli, as it was also detected within the rest of the nucleus, specially coinciding with DNA-free staining regions. H1.4-pT146 formed clusters of punctate nucleolar staining. These characteristic nucleolar dots seem to represent active ribosomal DNA (rDNA) transcription, resembling immunostaining patterns of active rDNA transcriptional machinery factors (i.e. UBF, RNApol I). A second interphasic H1.4-pT146 pattern was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>), with no nucleolar enrichment but speckled enrichment territories along the nucleus that overlap with regions with less DNA staining, that is, less condensed chromatin. This speckled staining could represent the localization of transcriptionally active chromatin near RNA splicing factories, as has been proposed before for H1.4-pS187, which display an analogous interphasic staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zheng et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Next, we tested whether the nucleolar localization of H1 variants depends on nucleolar integrity, by treating cells with the rDNA transcription inhibitor Actinomycin D (ActD). ActD treatment triggers large-scale structural reorganization of the nucleoli, with the migration of some nucleolar markers to the nucleolar-remnant periphery, forming the so-called nucleolar caps while other nucleolar proteins are translocated to nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burger et al., 2010</xref>). Each nucleolar cap represents UBF-loaded rDNA repeats from a single nucleolar organizer region (NOR). As expected, ActD treatment triggered a total translocation of NPM1 to nucleoplasm and alterations in DNA distribution were also evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). H1.4-pT146 was redistributed to the nucleolar caps, as it would be expected from active rRNA transcription machinery components. Nucleolar enrichment of H1.2-pT165 was completely lost upon ActD treatment, and it was not detected at nucleolar caps. However, the H1X characteristic nucleolar ring was still found in the remnant nucleoli of a considerable fraction of cells. Thus, H1X and phosphorylated H1.2 or H1.4 exhibit characteristic nucleolar patterns, basally and upon ActD treatment, that could reflect different functional involvements in nucleolar dynamics.</p><p>We further explored H1 variants relationship with nucleolar organization by analyzing ChIP-Seq H1 variants abundance within NADs. We used a recently published NADs mapping performed in HeLa cells, which identified 264 NADs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Peng et al., 2023</xref>). As NADs and LADs show a substantial overlap, we analyzed separately those regions defined exclusively as NAD or LAD and those that overlap (NAD/LAD), similar to the analysis performed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bersaglieri et al., 2022</xref>. ‘Low-GC’ H1 variants were enriched within both NADs and LADs, highlighting their presence within multiple repressive compartments in the nucleus. On the contrary, ‘high-GC’ H1 variants are depleted from both NADs and LADs repressive domains, compared to the A compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Still, H1X and H1.4 are more abundant at regions that are only classified as NADs (NADs only) than NAD/LAD genomic regions, contrary to low-GC H1s.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Single or combined H1.2 depletion leads to chromatin decompaction</title><p>Due to the intrinsic link of chromatin compartmentalization and genome structure and the differential H1 variants abundance within those compartments, we examined how H1 depletion affects chromatin organization. Using super-resolution imaging of DNA we were able to visualize the chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We performed super-resolution imaging of DNA under different H1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Multi-H1 knock-downs (KD; i.e. simultaneous depletion of H1.2 and H1.4, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Izquierdo-Bouldstridge et al., 2017</xref>) led to a general disruption of chromatin organization compared to control conditions. This disruption was also evident, albeit to a lesser extent, upon single depletion of H1.2. In contrast, single depletion of H1.4 or H1X did not appear to produce changes in chromatin architecture at the level studied. To quantify chromatin structural changes upon H1 depletion, we used DNA-free areas analysis, as reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Neguembor et al., 2021</xref>). This method relies on the fact that DNA signal accumulates in densely packed areas. This leads to the appearance of areas with no DNA signal or low-density DNA signal (referred to as DNA-free areas). Considering this, upon DNA decompaction, a decrease in the percentage of DNA-free areas is expected. We quantified DNA-free areas under the different H1 KD conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Thus, the percentage of DNA-free areas was strongly reduced upon multi-H1 KD, supporting DNA decompaction. Similarly, H1.2 depletion also led to a decreased percentage of DNA-free areas, although the reduction was minor compared to multi-H1 KD. Depletion of H1.4 or H1X did not lead to significant changes in % DNA-free areas. In conclusion, combined depletion of H1.2 and H1.4 but also single depletion of H1.2 have an impact on chromatin structure, leading to a general chromatin decompaction not seen when depleting other H1 variants.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Chromatin structural changes upon H1 depletion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative super-resolution radial fluctuation (SRRF) images of DNA staining in the different H1 knock-downs (KD) conditions indicated (multi-H1, H1.2, H1.4, and H1X Dox-inducible shRNAs).

Specifically, we consistently found a simultaneous lack of both H1.3 and H1.5 (i.e. HCT-116, HT-29, SK-MEL-173, and IGR-39). Interestingly, cell lines lacking H1.3 and H1.5 tend to have increased H1.0 levels compared to other cell lines tested. We also evaluated H1 variants mRNA expression levels by reverse-transcriptase-quantitative PCR (polymerase chain reaction) (RT-qPCR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). H1.2 was the most expressed at mRNA level in all cell lines. Simultaneous absence of H1.3 and H1.5 seen at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>) was also evident at the transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

Notably, H1.1 is not expressed basally in most cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). In summary, our analyses support that H1.3 and H1.5 could be repressed by DNA methylation in a subset of cell lines.</p><p>To evaluate differential and common distribution patterns of H1 variants among different cell lines, we performed immunofluorescence of six endogenous H1 variants in some of the cell lines in which we characterized H1 complement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B</xref>). Importantly, H1.2/H1.3/H1.5 were universally enriched at the nuclear periphery, as observed in T47D. H1.0 and H1.4 were distributed throughout the nucleus. Lastly, H1X was also distributed throughout the entire nucleus, but the intensity of its nucleolar enrichment was variable between cell lines. Importantly, similar profiles were observed in cell lines with a non-tumoral origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Nuclear distribution of H1 variants across multiple human cell lines.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunofluorescence analysis of H1 variants (green) with DNA staining (blue) in different cancer cell lines.

To do so, we performed H1 variants immunofluorescence in cell lines lacking H1.3 and H1.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In this subset of cell lines, H1.2 was also enriched at the nuclear periphery. Interestingly, H1.4 and H1.0 appeared to have a more peripheral distribution compared to cell lines expressing all H1 variants evaluated here. Indeed, we quantified H1.0 and H1.4 radial distribution (as exemplified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and confirmed that those cell lines with a compromised H1 repertoire presented a more peripheral distribution of both H1.4 and H1.0, compared to those cell lines expressing all H1 variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4A and B</xref>). These results suggest that H1.0 and H1.4 balance H1 content at the nuclear periphery when H1.3 and H1.5 are absent, indicating that H1 levels are important to maintain peripheral chromatin and, presumably, LADs.</p><p>We next focused our research on histone H1X. H1X was distributed throughout the whole nucleus in a punctuated pattern, with a variable nucleolar enrichment between different cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B</xref>). Co-immunostaining of H1X with the nucleolar marker NPM1 confirmed H1X nucleolar enrichment in both tumoral and non-tumoral cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Among the cell lines tested, T47D, MCF-7, SK-MEL-147, HCT-116, 293T, and IMR-90 showed the most prominent H1X nucleolar enrichment. Notably, in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, H1X formed a layer at the nucleolar rim, adjacent to NPM1, similar to what was observed in T47D cells. Nevertheless, it is essential to note that H1X was still present at nucleoli in all cell lines tested, making it the H1 variant most associated with nucleoli, where other H1 variants are underrepresented.</p><p>Non-nucleolar H1X coincides with less-stained DNA regions, suggesting their enrichment at less compact chromatin. To further study H1X distribution, we performed H1X ChIP-Seq in several of the cell lines analyzed (i.e. SK-MEL-147, MCF-7, SK-N-SH, HeLa, and HCT-116 and previously reported T47D). We used G-bands segmentation to compare the H1X ChIP-Seq abundance in the mentioned cell lines. H1X showed a strong correlation with %GC content in all cell lines, being highly enriched at high-GC G-bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Moreover, analysis demonstrates G-bands utility as epigenetic units to directly compare H1 variants binding profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Serna-Pujol et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, analysis of H1 variants distribution in different cell lines showed some universal features for certain variants. Concretely, H1.2, H1.3, and H1.5 are enriched toward the nuclear periphery in all cell lines tested. Interestingly, in cell lines lacking H1.3 and H1.5, H1.4 and H1.0 adopt a more peripheral distribution, suggesting a compensatory behavior. For its part, H1X is universally enriched at high-GC regions and is the only H1 variant with evident presence within the nucleoli, although H1X nucleolar enrichment is variable among cell lines.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Tethering of chromatin to scaffold structures, such as the nuclear lamina or the nucleolus, regulates genome conformation and ultimately, its function. Despite being highly abundant proteins in the nucleus, distribution of histone H1 variants within nuclear domains has not been explored. We have recently reported that H1 variants exhibit differential genomic distributions in T47D breast cancer cells. H1.0, H1.2, H1.3, and H1.5 are enriched at low-GC regions and B compartment while H1.4 and H1X are more abundant within high-GC and A compartment regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Serna-Pujol et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, a combined depletion of H1.2 and H1.4 leads to chromatin decompaction at the level of TADs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Serna-Pujol et al., 2022</xref>), demonstrating that H1 proteins are involved in maintaining genome structure. In this study, we profiled the differential nuclear distribution of six somatic H1 variants in T47D cells and other human cells lines, through imaging techniques, including super-resolution microscopy. We provide here the first systematic comparison of H1 variants distribution in multiple human cell lines.</p><p>In T47D cells, H1.2, H1.3, and H1.5 and to a lesser extent H1.0 are enriched toward nuclear periphery. On the other hand, H1X and H1.4 are distributed throughout the nucleus with H1X being highly enriched in nucleoli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Super-resolution imaging of H1 variants reinforced these differential profiles and revealed that H1.2/H1.3/H1.5/H1.0 coincide more with DNA pattern compared to H1.4 and H1X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), confirming their segregation in two groups denoted by ChIP-Seq data. Both immunofluorescence and ChIP-Seq are performed on fixed cells and H1 are known to be highly mobile proteins. Thus, although our results demonstrate this variant-specific preferential distribution, it is unlikely that H1 variants are unable to dynamically bind other chromatin types.</p><p>Emerging evidence from super-resolution microscopy indicates that nucleosomes are grouped in heterogenous nanodomains termed ‘clutches’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ricci et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, TADs represent structural chromatin folding units at the sub-megabase scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nora et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sexton et al., 2012</xref>). We have shown that H1 variants form spatially separated nanodomains throughout the nucleus, visualized as a ‘punctuate’ signal by super-resolution imaging, but with the aforementioned differential variant-specific local enrichments. Similarly, super-resolution imaging of core histone H2B also present this clustered pattern in human fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ricci et al., 2015</xref>). It is important to mention that nucleosome clutches were originally defined using STORM technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ricci et al., 2015</xref>), whose resolution is higher than the one achieved by SRRF. For that reason, we favor the idea that nanodomains formed by H1 variants would be more equivalent to TADs or sub-TADs rather than to nucleosome clutches. In fact, shifts on the ChIP-Seq H1 variants distribution tend to coincide with TAD borders and H1 variants are more homogenous within the same TAD than between TADs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Serna-Pujol et al., 2021</xref>). This observation also highlights the relationship between H1 distribution and the structural properties of chromatin.</p><p>By conventional immunofluorescence, preferential localization of H1.0 with other ‘low-GC’ H1 variants over H1.4/H1X was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, this preferential co-localization was not evidenced at the super-resolution level and all H1s co-localized similarly with H1.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This observation may suggest that domains spatially arranged at the 3D level are homogeneously marked by a certain H1 variant and not by random H1 variants. Nevertheless, in a cell population those nanodomains could be marked by different H1 variants. This could explain why at single-cell level we lost preferential co-localization of ‘low-GC’ H1s with H1.0 (compared to H1.4/H1X) while by ChIP-Seq data, mega-base domains of ‘low-GC’ H1 variants coincide. If those nanodomains were homogeneously marked by the same H1 variant in the cell population, we would observe differential enrichments between H1 variants belonging to the same GC cluster, even at the mega-base level. This apparent intra-population ambiguity may be indicating a structural role of ‘low-GC’ H1 variants and emphasizes the existing partial redundancy among certain H1 variants.</p><p>H1.2, H1.3, and H1.5 are highly enriched at the nuclear periphery in T47D cells but also in all cell lines analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A, B</xref>). Super-resolution microscopy revealed that these H1 variants form an adjacent layer to lamina and highly co-localize with H3K9me2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>). H3K9me2 is not only a universal component of LADs, but also it is indispensable for peripheral heterochromatin anchoring to the nuclear lamina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Poleshko et al., 2019</xref>). Universal H1.2, H1.3, and H1.5 enrichment at nuclear periphery directly point to these H1 variants as conserved components of LADs, as has been described for H3K9me2. Furthermore, these H1 variants could be postulated as potential orchestrating factors for chromatin tethering to the lamina. Proper chromatin–lamina interactions are crucial to maintain chromatin dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Briand and Collas, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chandra et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>). LADs detachment through Lamin B1 KO in human cells led to abnormal segregation of chromosome territories and A/B compartments, as well as global chromatin decompaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2022</xref>). Actually, we have shown that H1.2 depletion in T47D cells also led to a global chromatin decompaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Interactions between the nuclear lamina and LADs are disrupted at early stages of mitosis and re-established upon mitotic exit. In general, mitosis involves large structural reorganization of chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Imakaev et al., 2012</xref>) that is accompanied by eviction of multiple chromatin factors from DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Martínez-Balbás et al., 1995</xref>). On the other hand, factors that persist attached to chromatin, including multiple histone variants and histone modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang and Higgins, 2013</xref>), are suggested to act as spatial ‘bookmarks’. This is the case of H3K9me2, which is reported to safeguard positional information of LADs through mitosis, through a phospho-methyl switch (H3K9me2S10p) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Poleshko et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, we have found that interphasic ‘low-GC’ H1 variants persist more attached to chromatin during mitosis, compared to ‘high-GC’ ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>). Moreover, H1.3 and H1.5, which are highly associated to LADs in interphase, persist in the peripheral layer of mitotic chromosomes, showing an analogous profile to the one reported for H3K9me2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Poleshko et al., 2019</xref>). H1.2 attachment to mitotic chromatin is regulated by phosphorylation at early mitotic stages, but interestingly, H1.2 layer re-associates to the forming lamina upon mitotic exit. The strong similarities observed for H1.2, H1.3, and H1.5 with H3K9me2 in both interphase and mitosis suggest that these linker histones may also act as 3D positional ‘bookmarks’ of LADs.</p><p>We found that H1 variants may localize to nucleoli. Concretely, H1X and some phosphorylated H1s present different nucleolar distribution patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). H1X nucleolar enrichment has already been described in previous works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mayor et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stoldt et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, other histone variants have been found at nucleoli, including testis-restricted H1T linker histone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tani et al., 2016</xref>) or certain core histone variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jiang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Long et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pang et al., 2020</xref>). Importantly, nucleolar localization of H1X persists after inhibition of RNApol I by ActD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>), which was also reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stoldt et al., 2007</xref>). These observations might suggest a more structural role of H1X in nucleoli rather than a more functional or regulatory one. On the contrary, H1.2-pT165 and H1.4-pT146 seem to execute a functional role, as the nucleolar distribution of these post-translationally modified H1 variants depends on functional nucleoli, with H1.4-pT146 being presumably associated to RNA pol I active transcription. The nucleolus is a membraneless organelle formed through liquid–liquid phase separation driven by multivalent interactions of its components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lafontaine et al., 2021</xref>). Several molecular features are known drivers for phase separation, including highly intrinsically disordered regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shin and Brangwynne, 2017</xref>). Indeed, nucleolar proteome and specially proteins localized to the nucleolar rim are extremely disordered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stenström et al., 2020</xref>). We found that nucleolar H1X is enriched, although not limited, at the nucleolar rim, adjacent to the inner side of NPM1 layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Histone H1 proteins have a well-known highly disordered structure and have been shown to phase separate in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gibson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shakya et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Turner et al., 2018</xref>). However, the functional relevance of H1 variants as promotors of phase separation in living cells has not been explored.</p><p>Proteomic studies in four human cell lines demonstrated that almost 1/3 of the candidate H1.0-binding proteins localized to nucleolus and were related to nucleolar functionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kalashnikova et al., 2013</xref>). Remarkably, the experiments were performed by pull-down of exogenous, chimeric HaloTag-H1.0 protein. Importantly, direct H1.0 nucleolar localization or rRNA metabolism alterations upon H1.0 depletion were not reported. In contrast, our results show that H1.0 is depleted from nucleoli in all cell lines analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B</xref>). We also checked that H1.0 does not redistribute to nucleoli upon H1X depletion in T47D cells (data not shown). Nevertheless, we cannot discard that H1.0 interacts with nucleolus-related proteins, as it can be enriched at perinucleolar heterochromatin or NADs, as observed in T47D cells.</p><p>We have explored how H1 variants depletion affect chromatin structure through super-resolution imaging of DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In T47D cells, combined depletion of H1.2 and H1.4 (i.e. multi-H1 KD) caused a global chromatin decompaction. This is in agreement with previously generated ATAC-Seq experiments in these cells, which pointed to a genome-wide gain of chromatin accessibility. Accordingly, Hi-C data analysis in multi-H1 KD cells also showed more de-compacted TAD structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Serna-Pujol et al., 2022</xref>). In mice, multiple H1 variants deficiency has been also associated to chromatin decompaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Willcockson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yusufova et al., 2021</xref>). However, the differential contribution of individual H1 variants to chromatin structure has not been explored before. Interestingly, analysis of T47D single KDs revealed that single H1.2 depletion also led to chromatin decompaction, but not as pronounced as multi-H1 KD. On the contrary, single depletion of H1.4 or H1X did not cause a significant alteration of chromatin structure. These observations suggest that the structural defects cannot be explained just for the total H1 reduction. Indeed, both H1.2 and H1.4 proteins contribution to total H1 content is the same in T47D, estimated to be 23–24% in each case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sancho et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, H1 variant-specific functionality, related to their differential genomic distribution seems to play a role. These results could support the putative structural function of H1.2 (and maybe also for the rest of ‘low-GC’ variants). In multi-H1 KD cells, total H1 content is reduced ≈30% and chromatin decompaction is more drastic compared to single H1.2 depletion. Due to the fact that H1.2 and H1.4 occupy different genomic regions, the more drastic effects on decompaction in multi-H1 KD cells seem to be due, at least in part, to the additive depletion of two H1 variants with non-redundant functions. In the whole, super-resolution microscopy of DNA enables us to decipher global compaction changes upon several H1 KDs conditions and revealed that H1 variants have specific roles in shaping genome architecture. Moreover, both the total H1 reduction but also the H1 variant repertoire have an impact on the global chromatin compaction homeostasis.</p><p>H1 complement is known to be heterogeneous among cell types. We have observed that H1X is expressed in all cell lines tested, as it was previously reported with H1.2 and H1.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Millán-Ariño et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, the simultaneous lack of H1.3 and H1.5 is found recurrently and seems to be mediated by DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref>). On the contrary, whether H1 variants are universally distributed or display cell-type-specific patterns is not well understood. H1 variants are thought to be specifically distributed among different cell lines, but this presumption comes from combining various pieces of evidence from different publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Izzo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Millán-Ariño et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Torres et al., 2016</xref>). They mostly address the analysis of a single H1 variant in a particular model or cell line. Moreover, a comparative study of the distribution of a single H1 variant in different cell models has not been performed so far. In the whole, the direct comparison of these studies is biased by the different origin of the data and the varied methodologies used, which in many cases involve the over-expression of H1 variants.</p><p>We performed the first systematic analysis of six endogenous variants in different cancer cell lines. Our data unveil, for the first time, universal nuclear patterns exhibited by specific H1 variants. Immunofluorescence experiments revealed that H1.2, H1.3, and H1.5 are universally enriched toward nuclear periphery. H1.0 and H1.4 are distributed throughout the whole nucleus but they show a more peripheral distribution in a subset of cell lines lacking H1.3 and H1.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). H1X is also distributed throughout the whole nucleus in all cell lines tested with a variable relative nucleolar enrichment. H1.0 and H1.4 re-distribution when H1.3 and H1.5 proteins are absent contrast to the behavior observed in T47D multi-H1 KD. Upon multi-H1 KD, H1 variants distribution is overall robust, with no significant changes at the nuclear level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Serna-Pujol et al., 2022</xref>). These represent two different H1-compromised scenarios. In the first one, H1.3 and H1.5 silencing is intrinsically linked to the cell line identity. On the contrary, multi-H1 KD cells represent an inducible H1.2 and H1.4 depletion, abnormal in T47D cells. Our results suggest that compensatory mechanisms between different H1 variants, in terms of distribution, may be limited when perturbing H1 levels but achieved when H1 repertoire is ‘naturally’ compromised. Regarding the functional outcomes of H1-restriction, multi-H1 KD cells are characterized by a robust interferon response, triggered by the expression of repetitive elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Izquierdo-Bouldstridge et al., 2017</xref>). Notably, RT-qPCR experiments indicated that cells lacking H1.3 and H1.5 exhibit a high basal expression of the interferon signature and some repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>). Whether the concurrent loss of H1.3 and H1.5 represents an acquired adaptive mechanism in certain cancer cells, as well as the implications of the immune response triggered by H1 loss are interesting subjects for study.</p><p>In summary, our findings highlight the differential distribution of H1 variants within nuclear domains and their variant-specific role on chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Moreover, we showed that H1 variants present a potentially more uniform distribution among cell lines than previously anticipated, particularly for certain variants.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Summary of H1 variants expression and distribution specificities.</title><p>The table summarizes the main aspects of H1 variants expression (blue; top part) and distribution (green/orange; bottom part).

For each nucleus, a number of ROIs (200 × 200 px) were drawn as to cover all the nuclear area, excluding nucleolus. Per each ROI, auto-local thresholding using the Phansalkar filtering algorithm was applied to the Hoechst channel. Based on this filtering, percentage of DNA-free areas was calculated. Biological replicates of imaging experiments were performed and figures show representative cells. Number of cells used for quantification are indicated in the corresponding figure legends.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Histones extraction</title><p>For isolation of total histones, cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of hypotonic solution [10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM PMSF (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), 1 mM DTT (dithiothreitol)] and incubated on ice for 30 min. The nuclei were pelleted at 10,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4°C. Sulfuric acid (0.2 M) was added to the pellet to extract the histones on ice for 30 min. The solution was centrifuged at 16,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4°C. TCA (trichloroacetic acid) was added to the supernatant in order to precipitate histones. After &gt;1 hr ice-incubation precipitate was centrifuged (16,000 × <italic>g</italic> 10 min at 4°C). Precipitate was washed with acetone and finally resuspended in water. Protein concentration was determined by Micro BCA protein assay (Thermo Scientific) and immunoblot was performed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Immunoblot</title><p>Histone samples were exposed to sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (14%), transferred to a PVDF membrane, blocked with Odyssey blocking buffer (LI-COR Biosciences) or 5% non-fat milk for 1 hr, and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C as well as with secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorescence (IRDye 680 goat anti-rabbit IgG or IRDye 800 goat anti-mouse IgG, Li-Cor) for 1 hr at room temperature. Bands were visualized in an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor). Coomassie staining or histone H3/histone H4 immunoblotting were used as loading controls. H1 protein content was quantified from Coomassie staining of histone extracts using ImageJ software. H1 variants can be visualized in three consecutive bands (35–32 kDa, corresponding to H1.3 + H1.4 + H1.5, H1.2, and H1.0, respectively), as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A, C</xref>. H1X cannot be quantified from Coomassie staining. The relative intensity of each H1 band was corrected by H4 band (loading control) and expressed as a percentage of total H1 content.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Antibodies</title><p>Specific antibodies recognizing human H1 variants used for immunofluorescence, immunoblot, and ChIP-Seq were: anti-H1.0/H5 clone 3H9 (Millipore, 05-629-I), anti-H1.2 (abcam, ab4086), anti-H1.3 (abcam, ab203948), anti-H1.4 (Invitrogen, 702876), anti-H1.5 (Invitrogen, 711912), and anti-H1X (abcam, ab31972). Other antibodies used in immunofluorescence and/or immunoblot were: H1.2-pT165 (H1.2 phosphorylated in Thr-165; Millipore 06-1370), H1.4-pT146 (H1.4 phosphorylated in Thr-146; ab3596), Lamin A (ab8980), H3K9me2 (ab1220), NPM1 (ab10530), H3 (ab1791), H4 (ab10158), and HA (ab9110). For immunoblots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, H1.3 (ab24174) antibody was used. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>, H1.0 immunoblot was performed with H1.0 (ab11079) antibody. Of note, anti-H1.4pT146 immunogen was a synthetic peptide derived from within residues 100–200 of human H1.4, phosphorylated at T146. However, this antibody could also recognize phosphor-T146 in H1.2, H1.3 (both 88% sequence identity with immunogen). Importantly, source of H1 variants antibodies limit co-immunostaining studies. All H1 variants antibodies are raised in rabbit, except for H1.0 antibody, which is raised in mouse. Notably, performance and specificity of H1 variant antibodies have been extensively validated in our previous publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Serna-Pujol et al., 2022</xref>). However, some additional immunofluorescence validations are reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>RNA extraction and RT-qPCR</title><p>Total RNA was extracted using the High Pure RNA Isolation Kit (Roche). Then, cDNA was generated from 100 ng of RNA using the Superscript First Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). Gene products were analyzed by qPCR, using SYBR Green Master Mix (Invitrogen) and specific oligonucleotides in a QuantStudio 5 machine (Applied Biosystems). To determine the H1 variants expression contribution to total mRNA H1, each value was corrected by GAPDH and by the corresponding cell line genomic DNA amplification of each primer pair. Then, the relative expression of each H1 variant was expressed as a percentage of the total somatic H1 mRNA expression.

Genome-wide GC content, Giemsa bands (G-bands) coordinates at 850 bands per haploid sequence (bphs) resolution and chromosomes coordinates were obtained from the UCSC human genome database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Karolchik, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Navarro Gonzalez et al., 2021</xref>). G-bands were classified in eight groups as detailed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Serna-Pujol et al., 2021</xref>: G-positive (Gpos25 to Gpos100, according to its intensity in Giemsa staining), and G-negative (unstained), which were further divided into four groups according to their GC content (Gneg1 to Gneg4, from high to low-GC content). For Figures construction, a single ChIP-Seq replicate was used in each case, although analogous results were obtained with biological replicates included in the listed GEO accession numbers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Public data on H1 variants expression and H1 gene methylation</title><p>H1 variants expression data and gene methylation in the NCI-60 cell lines panel were available at CellMiner (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://discover.nci.nih.gov/cellminer/">https://discover.nci.nih.gov/cellminer/</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Reinhold et al., 2019</xref>).

The authors find that while some H1s have a universal distribution pattern, some display a preference for discrete regions within the nuclear landscape namely, the periphery, the center, or the nucleolus. They also show using that the various H1s within a cell did not colocalize significantly with each other, rather, they occupy discrete 'nanodomains' throughout the nucleus which is visualized as a punctate signal.</p><p>The authors present evidence towards a long-standing question in the field regarding the spatial distribution of the different H1 variants. Since reliable, specific antibodies toward the variants were unavailable, this question was unable to elicit a definitive answer.

The results support earlier work from chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments that revealed biases for active versus repressed states of chromatin. The previous studies provided some support for the subtle sequence variation found primarily within the C-terminus of histone H1 variants conferred preferences in the type of DNA (e.g. methylated DNA) or chromatin bound. The current study significantly strengthens that argument. Importantly, this was shown across multiple cell lines and reveals conserved properties of localization of histone H1 variants.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The strength of the manuscript is the combined use of quantitative analysis of indirect immunofluorescence and X-ChIP. The results generally support the polar organization of the genome and a corresponding distribution of histone H1 variants that reflect this polar organization. AT-rich chromatin is positioned near the lamina and is found to be enriched in H1.2, H1.3, and H1.5. H1.4 and H1.X were more biased towards the GC-rich intranuclear chromatin.</p><p>There is emerging functional evidence for variant-specific properties to histone H1 subtypes. This work provides an important building block in understanding how different histone H1 variants may have specific functional consequences. The histone H1 variant that is most abundant in most cell types, H1.2, was found to decrease the area of the immunofluorescent slice that was chromatin-free when depleted, suggesting a more important role in global chromatin organization.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>While histone H1 variants may show biases in their distributions, it is unlikely that these are more than biases. That is, it is unlikely that specific H1 variants are unable to bind to nucleosomes in regions where they are depleted. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments have demonstrated differences in binding affinity but the capacity to bind a range of chromatin structures, including highly acetylated chromatin, for histone H1 variants. Thus, it is critical in assessing this data to have accurate quantitative information on the relative abundance of the different histone variants amongst the cell lines tested here. The paper relies upon quantification by immunoblotting.</p><p>Another uncertainty in both the ChIP and immunofluorescence datasets is the accessibility of the epitope. This weakness is highlighted by the apparent loss of H1.2 and H1.4 in mitotic chromosomes that is revealed to be false by the detection of the phosphorylated species. The distributions relative to the surface of chromosomes in mitosis and the depletion of H1.2, H1.3, and H1.5 from the central regions of interphase nuclei reveals an unusual dissipation of the staining that is suggestive of antibody accessibility problems. The overall image quality of the immunofluorescence images is poor, further complicating analysis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.91306.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Salinas-Pena</surname><given-names>Monica</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Molecular Biology Institute of Barcelona (IBMB-CSIC)</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Barcelona</named-content></addr-line><country>Spain</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Rebollo</surname><given-names>Elena</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Instituto de Biología Molecular de Barcelona</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Barcelona</named-content></addr-line><country>Spain</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jordan</surname><given-names>Albert</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Molecular Biology Institute of Barcelona</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Barcelona</named-content></addr-line><country>Spain</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><p>We appreciate the insightful feedback provided by the editors and reviewers who have recognized the novelty of our study. We have mapped the spatial distribution of six endogenous somatic histone H1 variants within the nuclei of several human cell lines using specific antibodies, which strongly suggest functional differences between variants. We are submitting a revised version of the manuscript to accommodate the reviewers comments and recommendations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>(1) In Figure 1C, since H1.4 is uniformly distributed among the four sections (A1-A4), its levels are not expected to be significant among the four sections as depicted. Even the violin plots shown do not seem to be significantly different from each other. This requires an explanation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this reviewer that significant differences of H1.4 abundance within areas A1 to A4 seem to not exist, either looking at the images or the data violin plots, as discussed in the manuscript. Nonetheless, statistical testing gave this as significant, due to small differences and the elevated sample N of the analysis. It is clear that H1.4 does not show a relevant peripheral enrichment as shown for the other variants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) At the end, it would be better to include a figure panel depicting chart/table/pictorial representation, depicting the summary of the work done with respect to all the histone variants, as there are several histone H1 variants studied under different conditions and contexts.</p></disp-quote><p>A table summarizing the location and characteristics of the different H1 variants has been included in the manuscript (Figure 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) The authors may consider adding controls for the specificity of the antibodies used for the studies. While the antibodies used here are commercial, it does not guarantee the quality for immunofluorescence, especially considering their unreliability in the past. The authors may consider including peptide/ recombinant protein-based adsorption controls in addition to knockdown or knockout controls. Having these data will strengthen the exciting observations presented in this MS and significantly increase the impact of the presented findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We totally agree with the reviewers that the use of commercially available antibodies does not guarantee their quality and specificity. As this issue was crucial for our studies, we extensively assayed performance and specificity of the antibodies, using different approaches. The validations were shown in our previous publications where these antibodies where successfully used for ChIP-seq (Serna-Pujol et al. 2022 NAR 50:3892; Salinas-Pena et al. 2024 NAR doi 10.1093/nar/gkae014). In summary, performance of H1.0 (05-629l, Millipore), H1.2 (ab4086, abcam), H1.4 (702876; Invitrogen), H1.5 (711912, Invitrogen) and H1X (ab31972; abcam) antibodies was tested by Western-Blot, ChIP and proteomic analyses (all the results are included in Supplem. Figure 1 in Serna-Pujol et al. 2022 NAR 50:3892). Concretely, we tested specificity using inducible KDs for the depletion of each of the somatic H1 variants in T47D. We also checked that the antibodies did not recognize additional H1 variants using recombinant proteins or cell lines naturally lacking some of the variants. All the experiments confirmed that antibodies were variant-specific. In addition, when the corresponding epitope was absent, the antibodies did not gain new cross-reactivity with other variants. More recently, validation of the specificicity of the H1.3 antibody (ab203948) was performed following the same experimental approaches described for the rest of antibodies (Supplem. Figure 1 in Salinas-Pena et al. 2024 NAR doi 10.1093/nar/gkae014).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Histone H1 is overexpressed in several cancers. While the authors do not use an overexpression strategy, the cells used in this study are all cancer cell lines. The study would benefit greatly if some of the findings- primarily regarding the spatial distribution of the H1 were to reproduce in non-tumorigenic, diploid cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We have also studied and discussed the spatial distribution of H1 variants in nontumorogenic cell lines 293T and IMR-90, and we have added this in the revised manuscript (Figure 5D and Figure 5-figure supplement 3). The nuclear radiality of H1.4 in 293T cells is also shown (Figure 5-figure supplement 4A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>This is an interesting paper that provides convincing evidence of distinct distributions to individual histone H1 variants. There are several aspects of the study that leave me unconvinced that the study accurately captures histone H1 variant distributions.</p><p>(1) Antibody accessibility: (see PMID: 32505195). One means to address this is to express a fluorescent protein-tagged version of histone H1 and demonstrate that the antibody can detect that tagged version of histone H1 independent of its location in the nucleus. In general, these FP-tagged H1s show a much more even distribution than what is observed here. Of course, that could reflect artifacts related to the fusion or the expression of the exogenous construct. However, even if all of the above are true, this will test the ability of the antibodies to recognize their epitopes in different chromatin environments. The fluorescent protein tag enables unambiguous knowledge of the presence or absence of the H1 histone.</p></disp-quote><p>We have used cells expressing HA-tagged H1.0 variant and performed immunofluorescence with HA and H1.0 antibody to investigate co-localization, to test whether an H1 antibodiy recognize all the tagged protein in different chromatin environments or irrespective of its location in the nucleus. A very high correlation between the two antibodies has been found (Figure 1-figure supplement 1B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) At high concentrations, the fluorescence signal intensity can be quenched. For example, this is common with high-affinity histone H3 serine 10 phosphorylation antibodies in late interphase/prophase nuclei. The artifact can be minimized by serial dilution of the antibody and identifying the minimum usable concentration for immunofluorescence. While I am not certain that this is taking place here, the rate and manner that the intensity drops off from the periphery in the peripheral H1 variant distribution are very similar in appearance. There are biological explanations related to constraints on diffusion that one could imagine also explaining the data so I'm not stating that this must be an artefact. However, I am concerned that it might be. An improved staining may reveal the same result but more convincingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed immunofluorescence with serial dilutions of the H1.3 antibody to show that peripheral distribution was not due to fluorescence signal intensity quenching (Figure 1figure supplement 1A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Histone H1 is highly mobile and there is some concern that they could reorganize during the relatively long period of time that it takes to fully fix the cells for both ChIP and immunofluorescence.

We agree that more sophisticated mass spectrometrybased quantification is desirable and we are collaborating to do this using internal H1 peptide controls (Parallel Reaction Monitoring), but this is out of the scope of this manuscript as the observed patterns of distribution of H1 variants do not depend on mild differences in variants abundance. Only the absence of H1.3 and H1.5 in some cell lines alters the distribution of other variants.</p><p>Additional author responses to the Public Review comments made by some Reviewer:</p><p>(1) Respect to the functional significance of the results presented here, we want to stress that as a consequence of the differential distribution and abundance of H1 variants among cell types, depletion of different variants has different consequences. For example, H1.2 depletion but not others has a great impact on chromatin compaction. Besides, cell lines lacking H1.3/H1.5 expression present a basal up-regulation of some Interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) and particular repetive elements, as it was previously described upon induced depletion of H1.2/H1.4 in a breast cancer cell line or in pancreatic adenocarcinomas with lower levels of replication-dependent H1 variants (Izquierdo et al. 2017 NAR 45:11622). So, our results reinforce the existing link between H1 content and immune signature. We have added this data in the revised manuscript (Figure 5-figure supplement 5).</p><p>Moreover, we also analyzed the chromatin structural changes upon combined depletion of H1.2 and H1.4. Combined H1.2/H1.4 depletion triggers a global chromatin decompaction, which supports previous observations from ATAC-Seq and Hi-C experiments in these cells (Izquierdo et al. 2017 NAR 45:11622; Serna-Pujol et al. 2022 NAR 50:3892). Although H1 content is more compromised in these cells (30% total H1 reduction) compared to single H1 KDs, the phenotype observed could not be recapitulated when other H1 KD combinations, in which total H1 content was reduced similarly, were investigated (Izquierdo et al. 2017 NAR 45:11622), supporting that the deleterious defects were due to the non-redundant role of H1.2 and H1.4 proteins. Indeed, this manuscript supports this notion, as H1.2 and H1.4 show a different genomewide and nuclear distribution.</p><p>(2) Our immunofluorescence data, together with ChIP-seq data, do not discard binding of H1 variants to a great variety of chromatin, but show enrichment or preferential binding to certain regions or chromatin types. Our data on the interphase nuclei does not suggest at all any type of quenching or saturation. Obviously, detection with antibodies depends on epitope accessibility, just like all immunofluorescence data ever published, and we have acknowledged that post-translational modifications of H1 may occlude antibody accessibility as some phospho-H1 antibodies give distribution patterns different than total/unmodified H1 antibodies. Thus, we cannot exclude that specific modified-H1s exhibit particular distribution patterns that are not being recapitulated in our data. This represents another layer of complexity in H1 diversity and we agree that exploration of the repertoire of H1 PTMs and their functional roles are an interesting matter of study that needs to be addressed. Still, our data is highly relevant as it demonstrates for the first time the unique distribution patterns of H1 variants among multiple cell lines and it does not use overexpression of tagged H1 variants that in our experience may produce mislocalization of H1s.</p><p>(3) We do have investigated co-localization of H1 variants with HP1alpha protein and we have added this data in the revised version of this manuscript (Figure 1-figure supplement 1C-D).</p></body></sub-article></article>
