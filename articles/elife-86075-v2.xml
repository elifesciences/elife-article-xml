Reduced levels of Hap43 de-repress the expression of antioxidant genes and therefore alleviate the deleterious ROS derived from iron metabolism.

for the viability of virtually all organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrews, 2008</xref>). This transition metal acts as an enzyme cofactor, predominantly in electron transfer and catalysis, and therefore contributes to numerous metabolic processes, in particular energy generation, oxygen transport, and DNA synthesis. However, excess of iron is toxic and potentially fatal, primarily because reactive oxygen species (ROS), including hydroxyl radicals (OH<sup>·</sup>), superoxide (O2<sup>·</sup>), and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, are generated through the iron-catalyzed Haber-Weiss/Fenton reaction and causes cell damage and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pierre et al., 2002</xref>). The mammalian gut is considered as an iron-rich environment where large amounts of dietary iron (e.g. ~0.27 mM per day in humans) are regularly present in the colonic lumen and remain unabsorbed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miret et al., 2003</xref>). Interestingly, previous studies have found that the concentration of iron in feces of British adults regularly consumed a standard Western diet and of weaning infants fed with complementary foods could reached to an average value of 100 μg/g wet weight feces (~1.8 mM), and this level is actually much higher than the minimal concentration (~0.4 mM) required for intestinal bacterial species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lund et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lund et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pizarro et al., 1987</xref>). Hence, it is very likely that the increased level of unabsorbed iron would aggravate the status of oxidative stress in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, providing a detrimental impact on the growth of resident microbial commensals. Indeed, excessive ROS levels in this iron-replete niche were found to enhance cellular toxicity, reflected by oxidative damage to proteins, lipids, and DNA, and therefore restrict the growth and proliferation of colonized microorganisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dixon and Stockwell, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schieber and Chandel, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The potent redox capability of iron requires that microbes carefully respond to and regulate environmental iron levels and distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barber and Elde, 2015</xref>). Several examples of iron detoxification have been described in bacterial species. For example, both <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> developed effective iron efflux systems to decrease intracellular accumulation of free iron and prevent iron stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frawley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grass et al., 2005</xref>). Similarly, eukaryotic microbes like fungi also decreased the labile iron pool to prevent formation of deleterious hydroxyl radicals through the vacuolar and siderophore-mediated iron storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gupta and Outten, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Singh et al., 2007</xref>). However, studies investigating mechanisms employed by gut microbes to detoxify iron-mediated ROS production are relatively limited.</p><p><italic>Candida albicans</italic> is a major opportunistic fungal pathogen of humans, capable of causing mucosal diseases with substantial morbidity and life-threatening bloodstream infections in immunocompromised individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">da Silva Dantas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Noble and Johnson, 2007</xref>). Importantly, this fungus is also the most prevalent fungal species of the human microbiota and acts as a commensal to effectively colonize many host niches, particularly the GI tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kumamoto et al., 2020</xref>). Our previous studies have demonstrated that the acquisition and storage of iron in <italic>C. albicans</italic> were effectively regulated by a complex and effective regulatory circuit, which consists of three iron-responsive transcription regulators (Sfu1, Sef1, and Hap43) and plays reciprocal roles in regulating <italic>C. albicans</italic> commensalism and pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2011</xref>). Specifically, the GATA family transcription factor Sfu1 was found to downregulate the expression of iron acquisition genes, prevent toxicity in iron-replete conditions, and contribute to intestinal commensalism of <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Sef1 acts as the central iron regulator for the expression of iron uptake genes in low-iron conditions and surprisingly plays a dual role in regulating both intestinal commensalism and virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2011</xref>). The CCAAT-binding repressor Hap43 transcriptionally represses Sfu1 that therefore de-represses iron acquisition gene expression in iron-limited conditions, and evidence has shown that mutant lacking <italic>HAP43</italic> exhibits a defect in virulence, supporting its role in pathogenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hsu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Singh et al., 2011</xref>). Although the iron homeostasis regulatory circuit, as shown above, is essentially required for both commensalism and pathogenesis, the exact regulatory mode for each of the three factors and its application in driving the transition of <italic>C. albicans</italic> commensalism and pathogenicity remains largely unsolved.</p><p>The CCAAT-binding factor is a highly conserved heteromeric transcription factor that specifically binds to the 5′-CCAAT-3′ consensus elements within the promoters of numerous eukaryotic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kato, 2005</xref>). In mammals, three subunits, including NF-YA, NF-YB, and NF-YC, form an evolutionarily conserved nuclear factor Y (NY-F) complex that exhibits the DNA-binding capacity to the CCAAT box and plays a vital role in transcriptional regulation of genes involved in proliferation and apoptosis, cancer and tumor, stress responses, growth, and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dorn et al., 1987</xref>). A similar NF-Y-like (HAP) complex also exists in fungi like the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae,</italic> and interestingly, this complex is composed of four subunits, termed Hap2, Hap3, Hap4, and Hap5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Becker et al., 1991</xref>). Among them, the Hap2 (NF-YA-like), Hap3 (NF-YB-like), and Hap5 (NF-YC-like) subunits form a heterotrimeric complex that is competent for DNA binding, whereas the additional Hap4 subunit is an acidic protein and harbors the transcriptional activation domain necessary for transcriptional stimulation after interacting with the Hap2/Hap3/Hap5 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McNabb and Pinto, 2005</xref>). Interestingly, Hap4 is only present in fungi, and functional analyses in a variety of fungal species identified that homologs of Hap4, such as the <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> HapX, the <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> Php4, the <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> homolog HapX, and <italic>C. albicans</italic> Hap43 were found to play both positive or negative roles in regulating the transcriptional responses to iron deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jung et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Singh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Skrahina et al., 2017</xref>). Recently, there have been some progresses about the impact of Hap43 on the pathobiology of <italic>C. albicans</italic>. For example, Hap43 acts as a transcriptional repressor that is induced under low-iron conditions and required for iron-responsive transcriptional regulation and virulence since knocking out <italic>HAP43</italic> in <italic>C. albicans</italic> significantly upregulates the expression of genes involved in iron utilization under iron-limited conditions and attenuates virulence in a mouse model of disseminated candidiasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hsu et al., 2011</xref>). More importantly, genome-wide transcriptional profiling revealed that about 16% of the <italic>C. albicans</italic> ORFs were differentially regulated in a Hap43-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Singh et al., 2011</xref>), and we found that a majority of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are associated with oxidative stress and iron regulation, such as those involved in aerobic respiration, the respiratory electron transport chain, heme biosynthesis, and iron-sulfur cluster assembly, supporting the notion that Hap43 is one of the major iron-based redox sensors for <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells and contributes to the fine-tuned balance that adapts to different aspects of oxidative stress due to iron metabolism. Moreover, these data also raised a strong possibility that the regulatory function of Hap43 may be coupled to <italic>C. albicans</italic> commensalism by dealing with the cytotoxicity of ROS mainly generated in the iron-replete GI tract, in addition to its role in pathogenicity.</p><p>In this study, we sought to explore the underlying mechanism for a possible involvement of Hap43-dependent gene regulation in <italic>C. albicans</italic> gut commensalism, given that this commensal has to combat oxidative damage caused by excess iron content that is potentially detrimental for microbial cells.

Moreover, microarray analyses in <italic>C. albicans</italic> showed that for 286 upregulated genes in <italic>hap43</italic>Δ/Δ relative to the wild type under iron-limiting conditions, 7.7 and 4.5% are those associated with aerobic respiration and the respiratory electron transport chain, respectively, highlighting the importance of Hap43 in iron-dependent oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2011</xref>). These observations prompt us to hypothesize that Hap43 may play an important role in regulating gastrointestinal commensalism of <italic>C. albicans</italic>, possibly by sensing changes of the oxidative status in this specific niche. To test this hypothesis, we first evaluated the contribution of Hap43 to the commensal fitness of <italic>C. albicans</italic> in GI tract using a well-established mouse model of stable GI candidiasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2011</xref>). Groups of female C57BL/6 mice receiving a normal Fe diet (NFD) (180 mg/kg Fe of diet) were inoculated by gavage with 1:1 mixtures of the wild type (WT) and <italic>hap43Δ/Δ</italic> mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The relative abundance of each strain in fecal pellets was monitored by qPCR using strain-specific primers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). Surprisingly, we did not observe significant differences in persistence between the WT and mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To investigate whether the inoculated <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells were really exposed to a host environment with high ROS levels, we examined ROS production in the colon tissue sections using the oxidant-sensitive fluorophore dihydroethidium (DHE). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>, the oxidative red fluorescence was almost undetectable in the colon (NFD), suggestive of insufficient ROS production. We therefore considered a possibility that the negligible effect on ROS generation could be attributed to inadequate iron bioavailability in the gut. To test the possibility, we modified our animal model by changing the mouse diet from the normal chow to a high-Fe diet (HFD) (400 mg/kg Fe of diet) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mahalhal et al., 2018</xref>) since previous studies have shown that the amount of iron, which is about 2.2-fold higher than that in standard chow, is able to increase microbial exposure to iron without being overtly toxic to mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mahalhal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schwartz et al., 2019</xref>). As expected, a 3-day HFD caused a significant increase of iron level in mouse colon, as determined by Prussian blue iron staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In line with the elevated level of iron, we clearly observed a marked increase of ROS levels in mouse colon after a an HFD as detected by DHE showing an increase in fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). The iron-induced ROS production in the gut was further confirmed by examining the transcript level of <italic>DUOX2. DUOX2</italic> encodes the dual oxidase 2, a hydrogen-peroxide generator at the apical membrane of gastrointestinal epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Donkó et al., 2014</xref>). qRT-PCR results showed that mice fed the HFD had significant increase in <italic>DUOX2</italic> mRNA levels in the colon compared with mice on an NFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Finally, the hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) concentrations were determined in the mouse colon samples as an indicator of the level of oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We observed that treatment of mice with HFD significantly increased levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, indicating the induction of oxidative stress pathways in the colon tissues.

Deletion of the iron-responsive regulator Hap43 results in a beneficial effect on <italic>C. albicans</italic> colonization in the gut, making it highly possible that iron influences the expression of Hap43. Indeed, we found that by both qRT-PCR and immunoblotting, Hap43 in WT strain was significantly less expressed in iron-repleted (H) medium in comparison to the iron-depleted (L) medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Unexpectedly, immunoblot analysis of Hap43-Myc recovered from WT cells under iron replete vs. depleted condition identified an increase in the electrophoretic mobility of Hap43 in iron-replete medium compared to that under iron-depleted conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Interestingly, when WT cells expressing Myc-tagged Hap43 were pre-grown to mid-exponential phase (OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.4–0.5) under iron-depleted conditions and then transferred into the iron-repleted medium (YPD), we found that a rapid gel mobility of Hap43 can be visualized at early time (2 min) after medium change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We hypothesized that the shift in mobility on SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis that is characteristic of the Hap43-Myc proteins might result from post-translational modification, for example, a covalent phosphorylation event.

Immunoblotting analysis indicated that the mobility shifted form of Hap43-Myc reverted to the unshifted form if cell lysates were treated with lambda phosphatase, showing that the increased mobility induced by high iron was due to phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>High iron triggers Hap43 phosphorylation that is modulated by the protein kinase Ssn3.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) qRT-PCR analysis for <italic>HAP43</italic> mRNA in WT strain grown under iron-replete (H, high iron) or iron-depleted (L, low iron) conditions.

Clearly, Hap43-Myc levels in WT were reduced by approximately 50% after 30 min incubation and continued to decline over the course of incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, left panel). In comparison, abundance of Hap43-Myc in <italic>ssn3Δ/Δ</italic> mutant remained at a relatively high level during the treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, right panel). These data highly suggested that Ssn3 significantly contributes to the protein stability of Hap43 under high iron conditions.</p><p>In eukaryotic cells, lysosomal proteolysis and the ubiquitin-proteasome system represent two major protein degradation pathways mediating protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lecker et al., 2006</xref>). To clarify the exact proteolytic pathway implicated in Hap43 turnover under iron-replete conditions, we incubated cells with specific and selective inhibitors of the lysosome (Chloroquine) or the proteasome (MG132). Previous studies have shown that proteasome inhibitors such as MG132 are unable to penetrate WT yeast cells due to the impermeability of the cell wall or membrane, and therefore, mutant strains (e.g. <italic>erg6Δ</italic> and <italic>pdr5Δ</italic>) are required for experiments using the proteasome inhibitors since the mutant cells show increased drug permeability or reduced drug efflux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tumusiime et al., 2011</xref>). We adapted the same strategy for inhibiting the proteasome and lysosome in <italic>C. albicans</italic>. A copy of <italic>ERG6</italic> gene was deleted from the strain in which the sole Myc-tagged version of Hap43 was expressed under the control of the DOX-inducible promoter (TetO-Hap43-Myc/<italic>hap43Δ</italic>), and the resulting mutant strain was treated with or without MG132. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, treatment of mutant cells with 100 μM of MG132 for 30, 60, and 120 min significantly increased Hap43 protein levels compared with the untreated control. However, under the same experimental conditions, treating the cells with the lysosome inhibitor chloroquine had no effect on the decreased level of Hap43-Myc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Taken together, these data demonstrate that when <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells are grown under high iron conditions, the phosphorylated form of Hap43 is prone to be degraded through the proteasomal pathway.</p><p>To further verify this, we test a possibility of ubiquitination because this modification represents a common signal for proteasome-mediated protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hershko and Ciechanover, 1998</xref>). In both WT and <italic>ssn3Δ/Δ</italic> mutant strain backgrounds (a copy of <italic>HAP43</italic> was C-terminally tagged with Myc epitope), we created strains that an epitope-tagged 3xHA-ubiquitin under the control of the DOX-inducible promoter was co-expressed with the Myc-tagged version of Hap43 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). After a 6 hr induction using DOX (50 μg/ml), log-phase cells were collected and lysed, followed by immunoprecipitation of whole-cell extracts with anti-HA antibodies. Immunoblotting the precipitates with anti-Myc antibody revealed, as expected, a predominant band in WT but not <italic>ssn3Δ/Δ</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), indicating that only the phosphorylated form of Hap43-Myc was able to bind ubiquitin. In the other direction, Hap43 was fused C-terminally to a tandem affinity purification (TAP) tag in the WT strain (Hap43-TAP/Hap43) and lysates were immunoprecipitated with IgG beads to recover the TAP-tagged Hap43 and the precipitates were immunoblotted with K48 linkage-specific polyubiquitin antibodies, considering the fact that the polyubiquitin chains linked through K48 are the principal signal for targeting substrates to the proteasome for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Thrower et al., 2000</xref>). A reactive smear, characteristic of polyubiquitination, was associated with immunoprecipitated TAP-tagged Hap43 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Collectively, our data suggest that the Ssn3-modulated phosphorylation promotes protein degradation of Hap43 through a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. It has to be mentioned that recent studies in <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> obtained similar observations. Similar to Hap43, the <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> homologue HapX also undergoes post-translational modifications (ubiquitination, sumoylation, and phosphorylation) during iron-replete conditions and these post-translational regulations are important to control iron homeostasis in <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">López-Berges et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> HapX exhibits inverse regulatory activities by mediating repression or activation of vacuolar iron storage depending on the ambient iron availability, suggesting that HapX appears to be important for regulating both iron resistance and adaptation to iron starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gsaller et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>C. albicans</italic> Hap43, in stark contrast to HapX of <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>, appears to play only a minor role in mediating the adaption to iron excess, although this factor did act positively for the activation of iron uptake genes during iron starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Skrahina et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Identification of the Hap43 phosphorylation sites that signal its ubiquitination and degradation</title><p>Together with the aforementioned results that the iron-responsive regulator Hap43 is phosphorylated in <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells grown under iron-replete conditions, this observation prompts us to identify at which serine/threonine residues Hap43 is phosphorylated. First, we started with an in silico prediction by using the Kinasephos 2.0 server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://kinasephos2.mbc.nctu.tw/">http://kinasephos2.mbc.nctu.tw/</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wong et al., 2007</xref>), and this analysis predicted 12 putative serine/threonine phosphorylation sites within Hap43 of <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Moreover, Ssn3 of <italic>C. albicans</italic> is orthologous to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Srb10, a cyclin-dependent kinase subunit of the Cdk8 module of Mediator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Björklund and Gustafsson, 2005</xref>), and putative Cdk8-dependent phosphorylation sites identified to date are serine/threonine residues flanked by a proline 1–2 residues toward the C-terminus and/or by a proline 2–4 residues toward the N terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chi et al., 2001</xref>). We examined the Hap43 sequence and identified another 17 potential Ssn3 kinase phosphorylation sites that meet the criteria described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To experimentally confirm these in silico predictions, we generated amino acid substitution mutants in which the neutral amino acid alanine replaced serine/threonine at the predicted 12 putative phosphorylation sites to change the conserved phosphorylation motif in order to mimic the dephosphorylated state of Hap43. By use of the strain (TetO-Hap43-Myc/<italic>hap43Δ</italic>) described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, where the sole Hap43-Myc allele driven by the DOX-inducible promoter was expressed in the <italic>hap43Δ/Δ</italic> strain background, we successfully created seven mutants, each of which included one or two mutated S/T (to Ala) sites. Similarly, exponential-phase cells growing in iron-replete (YPD) medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml DOX were harvested, washed, and resuspended in fresh YPD medium, and whole-cell protein extracts were prepared at indicated time points or after 2 hr of incubation, and analyzed by western blotting for the phosphorylation status and overall level of Hap43. Intriguingly, we found that single or double mutation of the predicted phosphorylation sites had no change of the phosphorylation pattern and consequently still promoted protein degradation of Hap43 as the WT cells did (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>), indicating that phosphorylation of Hap43 should not occur in merely one or two residues.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The critical phosphorylation sites are essential for Hap43 stabilization.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of <italic>C. albicans</italic> Hap43.

An immunoblot with cell lysates from both WT (Hap43-Myc/<italic>hap43Δ</italic>) and <italic>HAP43</italic> mutant-29 (Hap43m29-Myc/<italic>hap43Δ</italic>) clearly revealed that the replacement of all 29S/T residues abolished the upward shift (phosphorylation) of Hap43-Myc band induced by high iron and as a result significantly increased the steady level of Hap43 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Among them, Hap43 truncating mutations (Δ400 and Δ504) give rise to almost similar levels as the full length of WT, whereas the mutation (Δ330) results in a suddenly dramatic increase of Hap43 level. These results strongly suggest that the region within residues 330–400 harbors the signal contributing the phosphorylation-dependent degradation of Hap43. To further verify this, we deleted the 36 residues (346–381 aa) of Hap43 in HAP43<sup>S337A</sup> strain (make sure there is no T or S left between 300-400aa) and generated a Hap43 truncation mutant (TetO-Hap43tr-Myc/<italic>hap43Δ</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Similar to the phenotypes observed in the <italic>HAP43</italic> mutant, deletion of the 36 amino acid residues also leads to increased level of the truncated form of Hap43 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) and abrogated the high iron-induced protein degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).

The Hap complex, which is composed of Hap2, Hap3, Hap5, and Hap43 in <italic>C. albicans</italic>, has been found to play a key role in connecting the iron acquisition to oxidative stress response by regulating the expression of oxidative stress genes (e.g. <italic>CAT1</italic>, <italic>SOD4</italic>, <italic>GRX5,</italic> and <italic>TRX1</italic>), those who have been known to be induced in the production of ROS under iron-overloaded conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chakravarti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mao and Chen, 2019</xref>).

Taken together, our data highly suggest that iron-induced Hap43 phosphorylation, followed by ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation, acts to protect <italic>C. albicans</italic> from ROS toxicity and thus promote its survival in GI tract, a niche normally considered as an iron-replete environment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Iron-induced phosphorylation and degradation of Hap43 leads to de-repression of antioxidant genes</title><p>ROS generation in actively growing cells occurs via Fenton reaction or as a by-product of mitochondrial respiration.

These findings are very informative and prompt us to examine whether the phosphorylation-dependent degradation of Hap43 may correlate with activation of antioxidant response.

We therefore ask whether the unphosphorylated form of Hap43, once located to the nucleus, has the DNA binding capacity. ChIP-qPCR assays were performed to investigate Hap43 binding to the promoter sequences containing CCAAT motifs in the selected antioxidant genes. As expected, the mutated or truncated Hap43 (Hap43tr or Hap43m29) significantly enriched in the promoter regions of the four target antioxidant genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>), which suggested a direct regulation of ROS detoxification in <italic>C. albicans</italic> by post-translational modification of Hap43.

However, studies have revealed that iron excess is able to promote the production of potentially harmful ROS through accelerating the Fenton reactions, causing deleterious cellular effects such as lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation and carbonylation, and DNA mutagenesis and destabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Galaris et al., 2019</xref>). The need to avoid oxidative damages is particularly acute in the case of human fungal pathogens like <italic>C. albicans</italic>, mainly because these microbes are often subjected to assault by ROS produced by iron metabolism, environmental competitors, or phagocytic cells during infections, as well as the endogenously produced ROS. Here, we discovered an uncharacterized detoxification strategy that <italic>C. albicans</italic> used to combat the toxic effects of ROS accumulation and promote its colonization in GI tract. Our data highly suggest that the iron-dependent global regulator Hap43, through a previously unknown post-translational modification mechanism, senses the iron status of the cell and negatively regulates the gene expression of antioxidant enzymes.</p><p>To combat the iron sequestration by host iron-binding proteins, commensal microbes such as <italic>C. albicans</italic> have concomitantly evolved elaborate mechanisms to acquire iron, which play an important role in enabling the fungus to survive phagocytosis and proliferate inside macrophages by utilizing their intracellular storages of iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nevitt and Thiele, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Seider et al., 2014</xref>). These iron-scavenging strategies could be summarized as the following categories: (1) the reductive iron uptake pathway requiring the cell-surface ferric reductases such as Fre7, Fre10, and Cfl1, and a high-affinity heterodimeric transport complex that consists of the multicopper ferroxidase Fet34 and the iron permease Ftr1; (2) the heme iron acquisition pathway involving the function of a conserved family of proteins, including Rbt5, Rbt51/Pga10, Pga7, and Csa2; and (3) the siderophore-mediated uptake pathway employing the Sit1/Arn1 transporter that is able to use xenosiderophores generated by gut or mucosa-colonizing microorganisms (bacteria or other fungi), although studies have shown that similar to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>C. albicans</italic> also does not synthesize its own siderophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Almeida et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bairwa et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, our previous studies demonstrated that <italic>C. albicans</italic> has developed a complex and effective regulatory circuit for iron acquisition and storage in host niches, and importantly, the circuit is composed of three iron-responsive transcription regulators Sfu1, Sef1, and Hap43 that control the expression of genes essential for iron uptake and utilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2011</xref>). Recent studies have indicated that Hap43 is required for their response to iron starvation by negatively regulating iron utilization genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blankenship and Mitchell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hsu et al., 2011</xref>); however, its role in fungal commensalism has never explored. Here, we identified an unexpected regulatory function of this iron-responsive transcription factor that in the iron-rich environment such as GI tract, Hap43 is subject to covalent post-translational modifications (phosphorylation and ubiquitination) leading to cytoplasm-nuclear relocation and proteasome-mediated protein degradation, which serve as a positive signal to de-repress the expression of antioxidant genes. Importantly, we provide sufficient evidence that this regulatory action of Hap43 is most effective in lowering cytotoxicity induced by iron-mediated ROS production and promotes <italic>C. albicans</italic> commensalism in GI tract. Studies from our group and others have put forward a conclusion that <italic>C. albicans</italic> is well equipped to gain access to and utilize iron from host during commensal growth and during both superficial and systemic infection, and evolves sophisticated mechanisms to sense and respond to the fluctuation of iron availability. Given both positive and negative roles for Hap43 in regulating iron homeostasis of <italic>C. albicans</italic>, it would be very interesting to explore the upstream effectors/mechanisms governing the regulatory activity of this transcription factor, for example, the signaling pathways that sense changes in the internal and external concentration of iron, in particular the upstream effectors/regulators that operate in this iron-associated signaling cascade and modulate the expression of Hap43 at transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational levels.</p><p>The host microenvironments differ markedly in the levels of key micronutrients such as iron. For example, the human GI tract is normally recognized as an iron-replete environment because the majority of dietary iron is not absorbed and hypoxia is a strong stimulus for iron absorption could be strongly stimulated by hypoxia and the acidic pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McCance and Widdowson, 1938</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miret et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sharp, 2010</xref>). Interestingly, intestinal absorption of essential trace metals such as iron was found to be highly variable, because the iron contents is strictively regulated by adaptation of the intestinal uptake to the needs of human body, which appear to be affected by a number of factors, including the chemical form, dietary constituents, and the body status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Diamond et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fuqua et al., 2012</xref>). As a consequence, this diversity might instead reflect the iron bioavailability for commensal microbes during their colonization across different regions of the GI tract. As a successful colonizer in GI tract, <italic>C. albicans</italic> may take advantage of the abovementioned mechanisms to obtain sufficient iron to support cellular proliferation and, on the other hand, to protect the fungal cells from iron-mediated toxicity, creating an iron-buffering system that ensures competitive growth of the fungal cells in the fluctuating environment of the GI tract. In addition, the intestinal microenvironment is characterized by variable oxygen levels, for example, the lumen is relatively anaerobic, whereas the region adjacent to the mucosal surface is a zone of relative oxygenation that is generated by diffusion from the microvilli capillary network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Marteyn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sharp, 2010</xref>). Apparently, <italic>C. albicans</italic> harbors distinct regulatory systems to sense changes in oxygen or iron availability and switch from a commensal to a pathogenic state, the process that is governed by different regulators. The molecular events underlying the intimate crosstalk between iron homeostasis and oxygen metabolism, which requires the activities of different or common effectors/regulators, will be the subject of much investigation in the future.</p><p>Protein phosphorylation has been found to affect an estimated one-third of all proteins and recognized as the most widely studied post-translational modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cohen, 2001</xref>). Changes in protein phosphorylation represent an important cell signaling mechanism that is frequently employed by cells to regulate the activities of transcription factors, for example, targeting for proteolytic degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Olsen et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, a close connection between the ubiquitin-proteasome system and transcriptional activation has been reported in a number of studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lipford and Deshaies, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Muratani and Tansey, 2003</xref>). Indeed, studies have shown that the post-translational modification such as the phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination and degradation is a highly conserved process across eukaryotes. For example, a powerful proteomic study in the budding yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> identified 466 proteins co-modified with ubiquitylation and phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Swaney et al., 2013</xref>). A variety of extracellular stimuli in mammalian cells cause the rapid phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and ultimately proteolytic degradation of IκB, resulting in cytoplasm-nuclear translocation of NF-κB and induction of gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ghosh and Dass, 2016</xref>). The same is the transcription factor SREBP1 that also undergoes phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Punga et al., 2006</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, phosphorylation of the calmodulin-binding transcription activator 3 (CAMTA3) was found to trigger its destabilization and nuclear export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>). Consistent with these observations, we described that under iron-replete conditions, the iron-responsive transcription factor Hap43 of <italic>C. albicans</italic> undergoes ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation upon a direct phosphorylation event modulated by Ssn3, a cyclin-dependent kinase previously known to have a similar activity on Ume6 degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lu et al., 2019</xref>). Although the regions associated with phosphorylation and ubiquitination of Hap43 have been identified in our work, the precise modification sites remain unclear, more likely due to the presence of multiple modification sites and technical challenges such as the detection of low abundant proteins like transcription factors.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that ROS production in GI tract could be triggered by different abiotic or biotic stimuli. For example, iron (II) complex was found to interact with bile acids and the K vitamins to generate free radicals in the colon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Valko et al., 2001</xref>). The host’s defense through phagocytes induces an ROS burst that is required for pathogen killing and for regulating pro-inflammatory signaling in phagocytic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">El-Benna et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, similar studies have demonstrated that the antifungal action of different classes of antifungal compounds such as amphotericin B, miconazole, and caspofungin is related with the induction of ROS formation in fungi, especially in <italic>Candida</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mello et al., 2011</xref>). Previous studies showed that miconazole-mediated fungicidal activity against <italic>C. albicans</italic> was significantly inhibited by the addition of antioxidant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kobayashi et al., 2002</xref>), and superoxide dismutase inhibitors enhanced the activity of miconazole against <italic>C. albicans</italic> biofilm cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bink et al., 2011</xref>). Our mouse model confirmed that an HFD (400 mg/kg Fe of diet) is sufficient to increase iron levels and ROS generation in mouse colon, which is consistent with previous observation that the same diet is able to increase ROS exposure without being overtly toxic to mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mahalhal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rishi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schwartz et al., 2019</xref>). A surprising observation from our mouse model is that a normal chow did not increase ROS levels of GI tract and had no effect on intestinal fitness of the mutant lacking Hap43, arguing that the function of this iron responsive regulator might be relevant to either poor diet, a gut disease associated with high levels of ROS, or transient increases in iron availability, or buffering transient increases in iron level to aid commensalism. The ability of <italic>C. albicans</italic> to adapt and respond to oxidative stress is critical for its survival and virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dantas et al., 2015</xref>). Accumulating evidence has suggested that <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells respond to oxidative stress from the host environment through diverse strategies such as detoxifying ROS, repairing oxidative damages, synthesizing antioxidants, and restoring redox homeostasis, and all of these actions involve the transcriptional induction of antioxidant genes encoding catalase (<italic>CAT1</italic>), superoxide dismutases (<italic>SOD</italic>), glutathione peroxidases (<italic>GPX</italic>), and components of the glutathione/glutaredoxin (<italic>GSH1, TTR1</italic>) and thioredoxin (<italic>TSA1, TRX1, TRR1</italic>) systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mao and Chen, 2019</xref>). Coincidently, the HAP complex, including the Hap31/Hap32/Hap43 subunits, was found to be crucial for the iron-dependent regulation of the oxidative stress response (OSR) in <italic>C. albicans</italic>, especially the activation or repression of OSR genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chakravarti et al., 2017</xref>), and our work also obtained similar results that post-translational modifications of Hap43 effectively modulate the transcription of antioxidant genes in response to iron-induced ROS. In iron-replete environments (e.g. host GI tract), Hap43 degradation leads to de-repression of antioxidant genes that enhances ROS detoxification and promotes the GI colonization of <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) form the first line of defense against ROS in living organisms. Meanwhile, SOD catalyzes the conversion of superoxide into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide and CAT metabolizes the reaction by which hydrogen peroxide is decomposed to oxygen and water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ren et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Van Breusegem et al., 2001</xref>). Our results suggested that both SOD and CAT may largely contribute to the resistance of <italic>HAP43</italic> mutants to iron-induced ROS, which is consistent with a previous study that <italic>C. albicans</italic> Hap43 is the sole Hap4-like subunit responsible for <italic>CAT1</italic> repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chakravarti et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Therapeutic strategies to tackle iron overload, by the use of iron chelators or antioxidants, have been explored as an adjunct in the treatment of fungal infections, particularly in salvage therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Reed et al., 2006</xref>). Some clinically approved iron-chelating drugs have been directly tested for inhibition of fungal pathogens, including <italic>Cryptococcus</italic>, <italic>Rhizopus</italic>, <italic>Candida,</italic> and <italic>Aspergillus</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Symeonidis, 2009</xref>). For example, treatment of deferasirox, an FDA-approved iron chelator, significantly decreased the salivary iron levels and <italic>C. albicans</italic> CFUs of tongue tissue in a murine OPC model, and ultimately relieves neutrophil-mediated inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Puri et al., 2019</xref>). Antioxidant therapy has gradually become popular among patients, largely because of its low cost, less adverse effects, and good treatment outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Trivedi and Jena, 2013</xref>). For example, both COX-2 inhibitors and telmisartan (TLM) are able to inhibit ROS-induced inflammation by upregulating the expression of <italic>GSH</italic> and <italic>GPX</italic> in IBD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tian et al., 2017</xref>). Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response induced by an infection (e.g. bacteria or fungi), leading to organ dysfunction and mortality. During sepsis, iron homeostasis becomes disrupted and an excess of ROS is generated, causing damage to tissues. This can be potentially suppressed using iron chelators that selectively bind iron to prevent its participation in ROS-associated inflammatory reactions. Given the importance of Hap43 degradation in ROS detoxification and <italic>C. albicans</italic> commensalism, it is plausible that iron chelator therapy by blocking the process of protein phosphorylation and degradation could be considered as an alternative therapeutic approach against invasive fungal infection. Our findings may deliver new clues for the development of innovative drugs to fight invasive fungal infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Media</title><p><italic>C. albicans</italic> strains were grown at 30°C in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto peptone, 2% glucose) or SD (0.67% yeast nitrogen base plus 2% dextrose) as ‘iron-replete’ medium. ‘Iron-depleted’ medium is YPD or SD supplemented with one of the specific iron chelators, 500 μM bathophenanthroline disulfonic acid (BPS).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Yu-Huan Tsai (Reviewer #1); Campbell Gourlay Gourlay (Reviewer #2); Sascha Brunke (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All three reviewers made a series of constructive suggestions that will improve the quality and clarity of your manuscript. In particular, please pay attention to reviewers' comments suggesting that some of the conclusions drawn in the manuscript require more experiments or rephrasing. We suggest that the authors rephrase these conclusions to the extend that they are supported by the findings.</p><p>2) There was consensus among reviewers that the experiment on the influence of iron in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> experiment was unclear and could be dropped.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this study, the authors provide the evidence that in <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, excess ROS brought by environmental iron would lead to degradation of the iron-responsive transcription regulator Hap43 dependent on multiple potential phosphorylation sites on this protein, which leads to de-repression of antioxidant genes directly repressed by Hap43. This newly identified molecular mechanism implicating the post-translational degradation of Hap43 in <italic>C. albicans</italic> may contribute to ROS detoxification and higher gut colonization of this fungal commensal.</p><p>The biochemical data regarding the implication of Hap43 phosphorylation in its degradation by applying the ssn3 kinase mutant and substitutions of all 29 potential phosphorylation sites are compelling and convincing. The results in Figure 5 also provide solid evidence to discuss the interplay between environmental iron and ROS in controlling Hap43 degradation. However, the data regarding the four phosphorylation sites in the short list are incomplete. For example, while the HAP43tr and HAP43m29 mutants show decreased growth in the presence of ROS due to their resistance to Hap43 degradation as expected, the HAP43m4 mutant does not have any detectable phenotype when growing with ROS. This is possibly due to potential implication of additional phosphorylation sites between the amino acid 400 to 504, as there was another drop between delta400 and delta504 in Hap43-Myc degradation screening assay in Figure 4C. Moreover, the authors claimed in the manuscript that the degradation of Hap43 depends on its ubiquitination, while the authors only showed the capacity of Hap43 to be ubiquitinated in the presence of ssn3. It is better to tone down the conclusion without further experimental evidence. Another potential misleading point is that the author described the shift of Hap43-Myc to a larger size in Western blots as &quot;a rapid gel mobility&quot; or &quot;an increase in the electrophoretic mobility&quot;. However, the shifted up is supposed to be due to a decrease in the electrophoretic mobility.</p><p>Concerning the animal experiments, the authors used two different models, mice and flies, to show the advantage of HAP43 deletion in the gut, although caution has to be exercised in interpreting the 2 to 3-fold difference in the advantage. Moreover, while the authors discussed that the high-Fe diet (HFD) would not be overtly toxic to mice, it is not clear whether HFD can induce <italic>C. albicans</italic> tissue infection during colonization. In line with this, in the fly infection model, <italic>C. albicans</italic> can cause extensive cell death short after ingestion (Glittenberg et al., 2011). The increased fitness of HAP43 KO mutant could be due to their higher resistance to tissue inflammation concerning ROS. While the title is still relevant in this notion, it is better not to only focus on gut commensalism but to expand the conclusion to the interaction between <italic>C. albicans</italic> and the gut, where infection might be involved.</p><p>Altogether, despite some overstatements in interpretation of the results, this finding provides a novel point of view discussing the potential damage brought by excess environmental iron, in contrast to the traditional view of taking iron as an important nutrient for microbes, when living in a host.</p><p>In general, if you have shortlisted the phosphorylation sites to the four demonstrated in Figure 4—figure supplement 5, would it be possible to show the results by HAP43m4 in the main text and move those with HAP43tru and HAPm29 to the supplement? In this case, it would be more convincing to include the experimental results in Figure 5G, 5H and 6 using HAP43m4. This would support the conclusion regarding the implication of Hap43 phosphorylation in its degradation.

The paper includes a detailed set of carefully conducted experiments in vitro and in vivo that show a mechanisms that links high iron levels to the management of reactive oxygen species levels in <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells. This mechanism provides a compelling argument for a strategy that will allow colonisation of the GI tract. The mechanism also represents a potential route to manage <italic>C. albicans</italic> colonisation of the GI tract, an issue that is increasingly linked to a number of gut disorders.</p><p>This is an excellent study that presents a novel mechanism that allows <italic>C. albicans</italic> to thrive in an iron rich environment such as the GI tract. It is an elegant study and I had very few issues with the data presented, which were compelling, well delivered and of very high quality. I do not believe that additional experiments are required as the paper does lead a significant advance in the field.</p><p>Some points to consider that I think would improve the paper are as follows:</p><p>Abstract – some grammatical errors are present, please review.</p><p>Importance – &quot;iron homeostasis is critical for creatures&quot;?? this does not read as a scientific statement, please adjust.</p><p>The importance summary requires revision to correct a number of many grammatical errors. It also does not really convey the importance of this research, why is it of interest?</p><p>Results – figure 1 – line 164 change &quot;neglectable&quot; to negligible.</p><p>The adjustment of diet to 400mg/Kg to ensure that Ros levels were increased needs to be properly discussed, as in a normal diet HAP43 was not required, the results are therefore relevant to either poor diet, a gut disease associated with high ROS or transient increases in iron associated, or is it that Hap43 is required to buffer transient increases in iron level to aid commensalism? Please include a discussion of this.</p><p>Figure 6 It was curious that TRR1 levels were not altered despite binding showing a significant increase, this should be discussed.</p><p>The discussion itself is rather brief, it would be useful to discuss how the iron may be absorbed by Candida cells as it does not have, as yet, identified siderophores. There is evidence for several iron uptake mechanisms and this should be mentioned. Although I do not suggest carrying out more experiments to expand the mechanism, presumably identifying the upstream mechanism would be the next step? and this should be discussed. It would also be important to discuss this mechanism within the context of the GI tract, which presumably has highly variable levels of iron. Is the system a buffer to ensure that the cells can remain competitive in the fluctuating environment of the GI tract for example? how would the system interplay with variable oxygen levels found in the GI tract?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this work, the authors show a role in gut colonization for the well-established regulator of <italic>Candida albicans</italic> iron homeostasis, Hap43. They link an increased ability of a Hap43 deletion mutant to colonize the gut of mice under a high-iron diet to the repressor role of Hap43 in oxidative stress response (and the iron-dependent Fenton reaction that creates such stress). They go on to show the interplay between posttranslational modification, localization, degradation and gene regulation by Hap43 in response to shifting iron levels.</p><p>Overall, there are some very interesting findings in this manuscript, and it definitely adds to our understanding of iron-dependent regulation in <italic>C. albicans</italic>. The set of experiments is rather comprehensive and supports the conclusions. It will certainly be of interest to scientists in the field of Candida and fungal pathogenesis in general, as well as those interested in the role of micronutrients in host-pathogen interactions.</p><p>Experiment-wise, I was fully convinced by the authors' systematic approach, and all the conclusions seem to be fully supported by the data.</p><p>My main concern is that some aspects are not as novel as depicted in the text (and the relevant literature is missing from the cited references). For example, the regulation of the oxidative stress response in dependence on iron (and especially Hap43) has been described in Chakravarti et al. (2016). This is implied, but not stated, in the beginning (around line 390), there citing a review instead. However, later (line 550) the text states that &quot;… we discovered the role of the transcription factor Hap43 in modulation of the transcription of antioxidant genes in response to iron&quot;. I believe this connection has been known before?</p><p>Similarly, while it was interesting to see multiple phosphorylation sites in Hap43, the observation of phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of Hap43 was not that surprising. Essentially the same has been shown before for its A. fumigatus homologue, HapX, complete with the role of the proteasome in this process (in the similarly uncited Lopez-Berges et al. (2021)). In the present manuscript, the authors show much more data, including the localization and the responsible kinase, but the data should be put into context of the Aspergillus HapX findings (e.g. with the non-phosphorylatable mutant tested there or the identical effect of MG132).</p><p>The connection to the diet is interesting, although a bit more critical discussion may be in order. How realistic are these conditions in the human colonization situation -- the Fe input is higher than the highest concentration given for human feces in the introduction? And why did the same effect of the Hap43 mutant occurs in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> model, although it does not seem to be especially iron-rich?</p><p>The sections on importance (and to some extent, the abstract) are in need of some proofreading/rewriting -- e.g. &quot;in the GI tract where is iron-replete environment&quot;, &quot;the mystery in iron-replete conditions of Hap43 has never been uncovered&quot; and so on. This is strikingly different to the rest of the text, which is quite easy to follow and rather well-written.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86075.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All three reviewers made a series of constructive suggestions that will improve the quality and clarity of your manuscript.

We analyzed the cellular localization of Hap43m4 through indirect immunofluorescence assay, expression levels of antioxidant genes by qPCR, and commensal fitness of Hap43m4 mutant in GI tract of mice. As shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6—figure supplement 2, we found that similar to both Hap43m29 and Hap43tr mutants, the Hap43m4 mutant generated by amino acid replacement of the four putative phosphorylation sites (S337/S355/S369/T381), also displayed nuclear relocation of Hap43 (Figure 6—figure supplement 2A), decreased expression of antioxidant genes (Figure 6—figure supplement 2B) and decreased commensal fitness in GI tract (Figure 5J).

The differences could be due to involvement of some other uncharacterized phosphorylation sites.

First, we set up a new experiment using our commensal model to test whether HFD could affect the intestinal colonization of <italic>C. albicans</italic>.

To visualize a clear mobility shift of phosphorylated Hap43-Myc protein in iron-replete medium compared to that under iron-depleted conditions (Figure 2B), we technically need to run the samples on SDS-PAGE gel for extremely long time because the protein size of Hap43-Myc is relatively big (~120 kDa). In Figure 3B, the changes of cellular localization of Hap43-Myc in WT and <italic>ssn3Δ/Δ</italic> mutant were analyzed and importantly, we still observed an apparent shift in the electrophoretic mobility of Hap43 in <italic>ssn3Δ/Δ</italic> mutant grown under high iron condition (left panel, lane 1 vs. 2; the shift was not as obvious as that in Figure 2B), although the protein samples were run on SDS-PAGE gel for a short period of time.</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that the classical Ras/cAMP/PKA signaling pathway is critically important for detecting environmental conditions and facilitating adaptation to nutrient availability in pathogenic fungi such as <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> and <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic>.

We therefore considered the possible involvement of this pathway that may contribute to Hap43 phosphorylation.

Unfortunately, we found that this pathway appears to be unnecessary for Hap43 phosphorylation and the kinase Tpk1 does not behave as Ssn3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2A</xref>).

The results from both Figure 3E and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 strongly support that the phosphorylated form of Hap43 is prone to be degraded through the proteasomal pathway but not lysosomal pathway, as we found that inhibition of the proteasomal pathway by MG132 treatment abrogates the degradation of Hap43 (Figure 3E), but it is not the case when the lysosomal pathway is blocked by chloroquine (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). So, the dynamic of Hap43-Myc degradation should not be the same when two different treatments were applied.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5C.

As described in the revised figure legends, overexpression of Hap43-Myc was induced under the control of a doxycycline (DOX) inducible promoter (TetO-Hap43-Myc).

The paper includes a detailed set of carefully conducted experiments in vitro and in vivo that show a mechanisms that links high iron levels to the management of reactive oxygen species levels in C. albicans cells. This mechanism provides a compelling argument for a strategy that will allow colonisation of the GI tract. The mechanism also represents a potential route to manage C. albicans colonisation of the GI tract, an issue that is increasingly linked to a number of gut disorders.</p><p>This is an excellent study that presents a novel mechanism that allows C. albicans to thrive in an iron rich environment such as the GI tract. It is an elegant study and I had very few issues with the data presented, which were compelling, well delivered and of very high quality. I do not believe that additional experiments are required as the paper does lead a significant advance in the field.</p></disp-quote><p>We are highly thankful to the reviewer for encouragement and positive affirmation given to our work reported in this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some points to consider that I think would improve the paper are as follows:</p><p>Abstract – some grammatical errors are present, please review.</p></disp-quote><p>We are very grateful for the reviewer’s comments on the manuscript.

Although I do not suggest carrying out more experiments to expand the mechanism, presumably identifying the upstream mechanism would be the next step? and this should be discussed. It would also be important to discuss this mechanism within the context of the GI tract, which presumably has highly variable levels of iron. Is the system a buffer to ensure that the cells can remain competitive in the fluctuating environment of the GI tract for example? how would the system interplay with variable oxygen levels found in the GI tract?</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely appreciate these valuable comments and suggestions, which helped up to improve the quality of the manuscript.

They link an increased ability of a Hap43 deletion mutant to colonize the gut of mice under a high-iron diet to the repressor role of Hap43 in oxidative stress response (and the iron-dependent Fenton reaction that creates such stress). They go on to show the interplay between posttranslational modification, localization, degradation and gene regulation by Hap43 in response to shifting iron levels.</p><p>Overall, there are some very interesting findings in this manuscript, and it definitely adds to our understanding of iron-dependent regulation in C. albicans. The set of experiments is rather comprehensive and supports the conclusions. It will certainly be of interest to scientists in the field of Candida and fungal pathogenesis in general, as well as those interested in the role of micronutrients in host-pathogen interactions.</p><p>Experiment-wise, I was fully convinced by the authors' systematic approach, and all the conclusions seem to be fully supported by the data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your affirmation of the content of our paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>My main concern is that some aspects are not as novel as depicted in the text (and the relevant literature is missing from the cited references). For example, the regulation of the oxidative stress response in dependence on iron (and especially Hap43) has been described in Chakravarti et al. (2016). This is implied, but not stated, in the beginning (around line 390), there citing a review instead. However, later (line 550) the text states that &quot;… we discovered the role of the transcription factor Hap43 in modulation of the transcription of antioxidant genes in response to iron&quot;. I believe this connection has been known before?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s critical points. Indeed, a previous study has identified that the CCAAT-binding complex (with the Hap31 or Hap32 subunits, with or without Hap43) is essential for the iron-dependent regulation of the oxidative stress response in <italic>C. albicans</italic> (Chakravarti <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017).

Essentially the same has been shown before for its A. fumigatus homologue, HapX, complete with the role of the proteasome in this process (in the similarly uncited Lopez-Berges et al. (2021)). In the present manuscript, the authors show much more data, including the localization and the responsible kinase, but the data should be put into context of the Aspergillus HapX findings (e.g. with the non-phosphorylatable mutant tested there or the identical effect of MG132).</p></disp-quote><p>Again, we sincerely apologize for not citing the important findings discovered in <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic>, which are summarized as follows. (1) Similar to Hap43, the <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> homologue HapX also undergoes post-translational modifications (ubiquitination, sumoylation and phosphorylation) during iron-replete conditions and these post-translational regulation is important to control iron homeostasis in <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> (Lopez-Berges <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021); (2) <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> HapX exhibits inverse regulatory activities by mediating repression or activation of vacuolar iron storage depending on the ambient iron availability, suggesting that HapX appears to be important for regulating both iron resistance and adaptation to iron starvation (Gsaller <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014); and (3) Interestingly, <italic>C. albicans</italic> Hap43, in stark contrast to HapX of <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>, appears to play only a minor role in mediating the adaption to iron excess, although this factor did act positively for the activation of iron uptake genes during iron starvation (Skrahina <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017).</p><p>We have added these supporting references in the revised manuscript.
