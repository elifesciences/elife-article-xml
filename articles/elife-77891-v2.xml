City trees—pillars of urban forests—improve our health, clean the air, store CO<sub>2</sub>, and cool local temperatures. Comparatively less is known about city tree communities as ecosystems, particularly regarding spatial composition, species diversity, tree health, and the abundance of introduced species. Here, we assembled and standardized a new dataset of <italic>N</italic> = 5,660,237 trees from 63 of the largest US cities with detailed information on location, health, species, and whether a species is introduced or naturally occurring (i.e., “native”). We further designed new tools to analyze spatial clustering and the abundance of introduced species. We show that trees significantly cluster by species in 98% of cities, potentially increasing pest vulnerability (even in species-diverse cities). Further, introduced species significantly homogenize tree communities across cities, while naturally occurring trees (i.e., “native” trees) comprise 0.51–87.4% (median = 45.6%) of city tree populations. Introduced species are more common in drier cities, and climate also shapes tree species diversity across urban forests. Parks have greater tree species diversity than urban settings. Compared to past work which focused on canopy cover and species richness, we show the importance of analyzing spatial composition and introduced species in urban ecosystems (and we develop new tools and datasets to do so). Future work could analyze city trees alongside sociodemographic variables or bird, insect, and plant diversity (e.g., from citizen-science initiatives). With these tools, we may evaluate existing city trees in new, nuanced ways and design future plantings to maximize resistance to pests and climate change. We depend on city trees.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Trees in towns and cities provide critical services to humans, animals and other living things.

Humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Willis and Petrokofsky, 2017</xref>) and other animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berthon et al., 2021</xref>) depend on urban forests, which are the woody and associated vegetation in and around dense human settlements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Konijnendijk et al., 2006</xref>). City tree communities, an essential component of urban forests, improve our cities in many ways. City trees boost mental and physical health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hartig and Kahn, 2016</xref>), capture and store carbon dioxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rowntree and Nowak, 1991</xref>), scrub toxic particulate matter from the air (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nowak et al., 2014</xref>), and cool local temperatures by about 0.83°C for every 10% increase in forest cover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kong et al., 2014</xref>). The financial benefits of having a tree-rich city—rather than a concrete jungle—are huge and well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McPherson et al., 2016</xref>). Tree inventories provide a wealth of useful data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cowett and Bassuk, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cowett and Bassuk, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Galle et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kendal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Love et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McPherson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ossola et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Richards, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Steenberg, 2018</xref>). Many studies underscore the importance of city plant life to humans, but comparatively fewer evaluate urban forests as potentially biodiverse ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvey, 2006</xref>). Through this ecological lens, it is important to understand species diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Behm, 2020</xref>), nativity status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tallamy, 2004</xref>), and spatial arrangements of city trees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Roman et al., 2018</xref>). In particular, we wanted to know whether local climatic conditions are associated with the species diversity of city tree communities, how species diversity was distributed in space within cities, and whether introduced tree species contribute to biotic homogenization among urban ecosystems.</p><p>Here, we assembled a dataset of <italic>N</italic> = 5,660,237 individual trees from 63 US cities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.2jm63xsrf">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.2jm63xsrf</ext-link>) with data on species, exact location, nativity status (naturally occurring vs. introduced), and standardized health (tree condition). We also developed tools to analyze the diversity, spatial structure, abundance of naturally occurring versus introduced trees, and overall condition of city tree communities. We demonstrate that these new tools provide a richer picture of city trees than relying on canopy cover and species count alone. For example, it is now possible for researchers to assess the spatial arrangement of trees by species (taking into consideration the underlying spatial structure of city streets)—a metric which, we show, is not dependent on tree species diversity and which may indicate vulnerability to pests such as Dutch Elm disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Laćan and McBride, 2008</xref>). Likewise, we show that the abundance of introduced trees varies greatly, even among cities with a high diversity of tree species; abundance of naturally occurring trees (i.e., “native” trees) is a useful proxy for an environment’s capacity to support diverse communities of birds, butterflies, and other animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burghardt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burghardt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tallamy, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, we make available a large new dataset of city trees, user-friendly tools to better analyze the ecosystem structure of city tree communities, and proof-of-concept analyses to demonstrate potential uses of the data. Through these technical and practical advances, we help to enable the design of rich, heterogenous ecosystems built around city trees.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A new dataset of more than 5 million city trees</title><p>First, we assembled and standardized a large dataset of <italic>N</italic> = 5,660,237 city trees to enable the analysis of urban forests’ ecosystem structure.

Each inventory was produced using different, city-specific methods: for example, some cities only reported a tree’s common name; some reported an address but no coordinates; some reported tree size in feet, some in meters; some scored tree health from 1 to 5 while others rated trees as ‘good’ or ‘poor’; very few cities reported whether each tree was an introduced species; etc. Therefore, we inspected metadata for all cities and communicated with urban officials to standardize column names, standardize metrics of tree health, and convert all units to metric (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode1">Source code 1</xref>; ‘Materials and methods’). We converted all common names to scientific and manually corrected misspellings in all species names (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode1">Source code 1</xref>, and ‘Materials and methods’, for full details). We manually coded all tree locations as being in a green space or in an urban environment to enable comparisons between location types.

Trees are generally healthier when they are smaller and/or in an urban setting rather than in parks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>), possibly because city arborists quickly remove unhealthy trees in densely populated areas where they pose a fall risk. Further work is needed on within-species trends.</p><p>Are city tree communities more similar to each other than we would expect based on geography and climate? Indeed, we found that introduced tree species drive similar species compositions between cities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), reflecting the phenomenon of ‘biotic homogenization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McKinney and Lockwood, 1999</xref>). Briefly, biotic homogenization occurs when species are introduced to new areas, reducing the distinctness between source and site of introduction. Unsurprisingly, environment is a significant driver of tree community similarity between cities, but this association is stronger for naturally occurring (rather than introduced) trees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>These data have been collected over many years by urban foresters, citizen scientists, consulting firms, and other interested parties; here, we could not evaluate each city’s accuracy at species identification and location determination. Likewise, we could not fully control for different sampling schemes and sampling efforts (but see ‘Materials and methods’). Future work could deploy tree experts to randomly resample trees in each city and compare the identification to that in our dataset.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Future analyses: socioeconomics, demographics, the physical environment, and citizen-science species identification</title><p>Beyond the analyses demonstrated above, our dataset could also be combined with social, economic, and physical variables for new analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Simple maps of species diversity in the Washington, DC area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B</xref>) show that high diversity qualitatively overlaps with high median household income (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In other words, not only do ‘trees grow on money’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schwarz et al., 2015</xref>), but they may be more diverse in richer areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pedlowski et al., 2002</xref>). Biodiverse green spaces improve mental health more than species-poor spaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wood et al., 2018</xref>) and likely have other synergistic benefits such as promoting more species diversity among birds and insects. Therefore, further analyses of city tree diversity by income, and other demographic factors, would be useful.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Future analyses could combine this city trees data with social, demographic, or physical variables (including income and urban heat islands).</title><p>Here, we plot different variables for Washington, DC, showing qualitative concordance between (<bold>A, B</bold>) measures of species diversity, (<bold>C</bold>) household income, and (<bold>D</bold>) the location of urban heat islands.

The dataset herein could be combined with many physical variables for new analyses of how tree diversity and species compositions relate to temperature, air quality, and more.</p><p>Researchers could also analyze this city trees dataset in combination with other species diversity datasets gathered by citizen scientists. Members of the public frequently use popular phone applications to identify and document the location of birds, plants, insects, and more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonnet et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chandler et al., 2017</xref>). Future work could analyze whether a diverse city tree community correlates with a more biodiverse community of insects, birds, and even non-tree plants. Likewise, an analysis could consider whether the abundance of naturally occurring trees correlates with other important measures of ecosystem health (such as insect abundance). Since citizen-science datasets typically include exact location, future work could assess these trends over fine scales (e.g., within particular parks or in bounded neighborhoods) as well as across cities.</p><p>It would be useful to perform more refined analyses of clustering. For example, what is the biological significance of variation in cluster size (as determined by the hdbscan clustering algorithms)? The size and arrangement of the clusters themselves may be useful metrics. How clustered should we expect trees to be in both wild and urban settings? That is, what are our are null expectations? Further, researchers could apply network theory to predict how pest species would proliferate through each of these cities depending on the spatial arrangement of pest-sensitive trees.</p><p>Our study follows other impressive efforts to integrate and make inference from large sets of street tree inventories (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kendal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Love et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ossola et al., 2020</xref>). We concentrated our data collection on inventories with fine-scale tree locations and within a geographic context where plant species have been thoroughly characterized as introduced or naturally occurring, which allowed us to introduce two new approaches to this endeavor. First, we could evaluate how street tree diversity is spatially clustered within cities. Second, we could assess the influence of introduced versus naturally occurring tree species on driving tree community similarity between cities. Further, we also standardized data on tree health and developed new tools for analyzing datasets of urban forests. We anticipate that many further analyses of street tree inventories are yet to come.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Humans consciously control urban ecosystems, in part by selecting and planting city trees.

We first searched the <bold>city name</bold> plus each of the following: <bold>street trees</bold>, <bold>city trees</bold>, <bold>tree inventory</bold>, <bold>urban forest</bold>, and <bold>urban canopy</bold> (all combinations totaled 20 searches per city, 10 each in Google and Google Datasets Search). We then read the first page of google results and the top 20 results from Google Datasets Search. If our search produced a city by the same name but in the wrong state, we redid the 20 searches adding the state name. If no data were found, we contacted a relevant state official via email or phone with an inquiry about their street tree inventory. Datasheets were received and transformed to CSV format (if they were not already in that format). We received data on street trees from 64 cities. One city, El Paso, had data only in summary format and was therefore excluded from analyses.</p><fig id="S1" position="anchor"><label>Scheme 1.</label><caption><title>Dataset search pipeline.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-77891-scheme1-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Data cleaning</title><p>All code is in the zipped folder <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode1">Source code 1</xref>. Before cleaning the data, we ensured that all reported trees for each city were located within the greater metropolitan area of the city (for certain inventories, many suburbs were reported—some within the greater metropolitan area, others not).</p><p>First, we renamed all columns in the received CSV sheets, referring to the metadata and according to our standardized definitions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). To harmonize tree health and condition data across different cities, we inspected metadata from the tree inventories and converted all numeric scores to a descriptive scale including ‘excellent’, ‘good’, ‘fair’, ‘poor’, ‘dead’, and ‘dead/dying’. Some cities included only three points on this scale (e.g., ‘good’, ‘poor’, ‘dead/dying’) while others included five (e.g., ‘excellent’, ‘good’, ‘fair’, ‘poor’, ‘dead’).</p><p>Second, we used <italic>pandas</italic> in Python (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McKinney, 2011</xref>) to correct typos, non-ASCII characters, variable spellings, date format, units used (we converted all units to metric), address issues, and common name format. In some cases, units were not specified for tree diameter at breast height (DBH) and tree height; we determined the units based on typical sizes for trees of a particular species. Wherever diameter was reported, we assumed it was DBH. We standardized health and condition data across cities, preserving the highest granularity available for each city. For our analysis, we converted this variable to a binary (see ‘Condition and health’). We created a column called ‘location_type’ to label whether a given tree was growing in the built environment or in green space. All of the changes we made, and decision points, are preserved in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode1">Source code 1</xref>.</p><p>Third, we checked the scientific names reported using <italic>gnr_resolve</italic> in the R library <italic>taxize</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chamberlain and Szöcs, 2013</xref>), with the option <italic>Best_match_only</italic> set to TRUE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode1">Source code 1</xref>). Through an iterative process, we manually checked the results and corrected typos in the scientific names until all names were either a perfect match (<italic>N</italic> = 1771 species) or partial match with threshold greater than 0.75 (<italic>N</italic> = 453 species). BGS manually reviewed all partial matches to ensure that they were the correct species name, and then we programmatically corrected these partial matches (e.g., <italic>Magnolia grandifolia</italic>—which is not a species name of a known tree—was corrected to <italic>Magnolia grandiflora</italic>, and <italic>Pheonix canariensus</italic> was corrected to its proper spelling of <italic>Phoenix canariensis</italic>). Because many of these tree inventories were crowd-sourced or generated in part through citizen science, such typos and misspellings are to be expected.</p><p>Some tree inventories reported species by common names only. Therefore, our fourth step in data cleaning was to convert common names to scientific names. We generated a lookup table by summarizing all pairings of common and scientific names in the inventories for which both were reported. We manually reviewed the common to scientific name pairings, confirming that all were correct. Then we programmatically assigned scientific names to all common names (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode1">Source code 1</xref>).</p><p>Fifth, we assigned “native status” to each tree through reference to the Biota of North America Project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kartesz, 2018</xref>), which has collected data on all native and non-native species occurrences throughout the US states.

To do so, we relied on the rarefaction/extrapolation methods developed by Chao and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chao and Jost, 2012</xref>) and implemented through the R software package <italic>iNext</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hsieh et al., 2016</xref>). In short, these methods use statistical rarefaction and/or extrapolation to generate comparable estimates of diversity across populations with different sampling efforts or population sizes, alongside confidence intervals for these diversity estimates. <italic>iNext</italic> performs these tasks for Hill numbers of orders <italic>q</italic> = 0, 1, and 2. We used two techniques in <italic>iNext</italic> to allow for comparisons across cities (and between parks and urban areas within cities). First, we generated asymptotic diversity estimates for each; second, we generated diversity estimates for a given standardized population size. For our diversity analyses, the standardized population size we used was 37,000 trees (the rounded median of all cities). For analyses of the diversity of naturally occurring trees, we used a standardized population size of 10,000 trees (the rounded median across cities). For comparisons of the diversity between park and urban areas in a city, we used the smaller of the two population sizes (park or urban). In all cases, we also recorded confidence estimates and plotted rarefaction/extrapolation curves (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>To control for variation in how uniformly trees were sampled across a city’s geographic range, we developed a procedure to score each city’s spatial coverage (see ‘Spatial structure’).</p><p>We identified the best-fitting model, and then repeated our analysis under six sensitivity conditions to control for differences in population size, sampling effort, spatial coverage, and sample coverage.

To do so, we first clustered all trees within each city using hierarchical density-based spatial clustering through the <italic>hdbscan</italic> library in Python (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McInnes et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>HDBSCAN</italic>, unlike typical methods such as ‘<italic>k</italic> nearest neighbors’, takes into account the underlying spatial structure of the dataset and allows the user to modify parameters in order to find biologically meaningful clusters. For city trees, which are often organized along grids or the underlying street layout of a city, this method can more meaningfully cluster trees than merely calculating the meters between trees and identifying nearest neighbors (which may be close as the crow flies but separated from each other by tall buildings). In particular, using the Manhattan metric rather than Euclidean metrics improves clustering analysis in cities (which tend to be organized along city blocks). For further discussion of why <italic>hbdscan</italic> is preferable to other clustering metrics, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berba, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Leland et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McInnes et al., 2017</xref>.</p><p>We converted latitude and longitude values within a city to their planar projection equivalents (in Universal Transverse Mercator [UTM]) using the <italic>from_latlon</italic> function in Python package <italic>UTM</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bieniek et al., 2016</xref>). In total, we had <italic>N</italic> = 59 cities with spatial information about their trees.</p><p>We then clustered all the trees in a given city using <italic>HDBSCAN</italic> with parameters min_cluster_size = 30, min_samples = 10, metric = ‘manhattan’, cluster_selection_epsilon = 0.0004, cluster_selection_method = ‘eom’; we arrived at these parameters through trial and error with a sample set of cities.</p><p>Once we had all trees in a city assigned to spatial clusters (or, for trees far from the clusters, notated as ‘noise’ and eliminated from further analysis), we used a bootstrapping method to quantify the degree of homogenization within spatial clusters. For each cluster of trees (e.g., a cluster of 120 trees in Pittsburgh, PA) we (1) calculated the observed effective species number; (2) we randomly resampled 120 trees from Pittsburgh’s entire 45,703-tree-dataset and calculated the effective species number of that random group of 120 trees; (3) we repeated step (2) 500 times; (4) we recorded the mean, median, and interquartile range of effective species counts from those 500 samples; and (5) we divided the expected effective species (median effective species count from all 500 samples) by the observed effective species count in the actual spatial cluster of 120 trees. The resulting value therefore quantifies the degree to which a spatial cluster is a random set of that city’s tree species (values close to 100%) or a nonrandom set of same-species clusters (values less than 100%).</p><p>Cities varied in how uniformly trees were sampled across a city’s geography. To control for this variation, we generated a ‘spatial coverage’ score using the following procedure. First, we divided each city into grid cells of 0.005° latitude by 0.005° longitude, excluding water features and truncating grid cells by the city’s borders, using the R packages rgdal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bivand et al., 2015</xref>) and raster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hijmans and Etten, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hijmans et al., 2013</xref>). Second, we counted the number of trees in each grid cell. Third, because some grid cells were smaller in terms of actual area (e.g., because some grid cells were located at the edge of a city, and because degrees do not translate consistently to m<sup>2</sup>), we calculated the adjusted number of trees per grid cell (raw number of trees × grid cell area/(maximum grid cell area)). Fourth, we calculated the percent of grid cells with no trees as well as the skew and kurtosis of adjusted number of trees in all occupied cells (using functions from R package <italic>moments</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Komsta and Novomestky, 2015</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Meredith Schuman as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In your revision, please respond point-by-point to these essential revisions agreed to in the consultative review process. The original reviews are also provided below for your reference.</p><p>1. Sample completeness and representativeness</p><p>The tree inventories varied significantly regarding the number of records (214-720,140 trees per city). The variation can be due to the actual variation of tree abundances in studied cities or incomplete or biased inventories. Please add a column in the meta data indicating the sampling effort or completeness and if there were any sampling bias in the case of incomplete samples. Please also add clarifications about sample completeness and representativeness in the main text.</p><p>2. If there are incomplete or biased samples, please assess how these would affect the validities of the analyses and conclusions, especially those related to α and β diversity.</p><p>a) Please note that effective species number (and other diversity indices) is dependent on sample coverage (i.e., proportions of species were sampled) and sample size (i.e., area or abundance), so that the comparisons of α diversity can be unsupported if the samples are incomplete, there are many rare species with few individuals in cities, or sampling efforts vary between common and rare species. In these cases, it is necessary to standardize biodiversity measures before comparisons on the basis of sample coverage or sample size, using rarefaction-extrapolation approaches developed by Anne Chao and colleagues (Chao and Jost. 2012. Ecology 93:2533-2547; Chao et al. 2014. Ecological Monographs 84:45-67.). We note that the analyses on the relationships between biodiversity and environment, which included log-transformed tree abundance as a covariate, did consider the dependence on sample size in a way. However, effective species number may not change with tree abundance in a log-linear way, and some other relevant analyses (e.g., comparisons between parks and urban settings) did not have proper standardization. It should also be noted that one city with a small sample size can have a high sample coverage, and sample standardization approaches suggested above originally developed for species-rich ecosystems (especially for those with many rare species) may not be completely suitable or necessary for city trees planted by humans, so if the authors have arguments for why the dependence of sample coverage or sample size do not apply for a particular question, please make that clarification.</p><p>b) If there are apparent sample biases or very low sample coverages, additional steps other than rarefaction-extrapolation analyses may be required, for example, performing sensitivity analyses by dropping unrepresentative samples.</p><p>3. More information about data processing is required to increase users' confidence in the quality of data. How did you derive locations from the address? How did you validate the location accuracy? How did you harmonize the health evaluation results from different investigators? How did you evaluate the reliability of the data set (e.g., species identification) gathered from different times by different investigators? It may be helpful to assign a quality label to each record based on specific standards.</p><p>4. Please clarify the relative strength and weakness of the new data relative to the Global Urban Tree Inventory developed by Ossola et al., (Global Ecology and Biogeography 2020: 29:1907-1914) and records in Global Biodiversity Information Facility.</p><p>5. Additional context/conceptual underpinning the clustering analysis would be great. How did the analyses find the biologically meaningful clusters and recognize that a tall building exists or not to separate trees? What can we infer from variation in the sizes of clusters?</p><p>6. Please note the differences in the definitions of several critical concepts used in the paper, including city tree vs. urban forest, biodiversity vs. species diversity vs. effective species number. They are relevant but not identical, so caution is needed when using them interchangeably.</p><p>7. Some supplemental tools did not work or contain instructions when downloaded in the way. The excel supplemental tools need directions on the form itself to make them usable.</p><p>8. Please clarify your research questions or objectives in the Introduction section.</p><p>9. Please avoid having a colon in the title.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Line 46-49. The first half of the sentence used city trees, while the second half used urban forests. These two terms are not equal unless the authors give their own definition of the urban forest.</p><p>Line 53-54. Same as above.</p><p>Line 58. Precise is not a suitable term since coordinates of trees in some cities were derived from addresses.</p><p>Line 64. What does &quot;a metric will depend on biodiversity&quot; mean? Do you mean species diversity? It is not equal to biodiversity.</p><p>Line 71. It is an overstatement that the authors take a first step toward enabling the design of rich, heterogeneous ecosystems built around urban forests. There are already some global and regional databases of urban tree species. Each has its own strengths.</p><p>Line 77. Here the authors stated that the database was compiled from street tree inventories. If this is true, they cannot use city trees or urban forests to refer to their collected data because street trees are only a small part of city trees or urban forests.</p><p>Line 97. The huge variance in the number of tree records in different inventories is problematic. It indicates that some inventories were incomplete, e.g., 214 trees in Phoenix, AZ. No meaningful comparison can be made without accounting for this problem. One cannot attribute the difference in findings to influencing factors or incomplete inventories. The authors can run a completeness analysis to sift out cities that did not have complete inventories before further analysis.</p><p>Line 117. Effective species count is for measuring diversity, not biodiversity. Please see the Lou Jost's website as listed in the paper (Line 369-370).</p><p>Line 210-211. What is the relationship between considering hardiness when selecting tree species and tree health metrics? The health metrics used by the authors are rather general, not designed specifically for measuring a tree specie's hardiness.</p><p>Line 256-259. The interpretation that heat islands are more common in species-poor areas of Washington, DC is a overstretch. There are so many confounding factors, including anthropogenetic heat sources, urban layout, and the tree cover as mentioned by the authors.</p><p>Line 271. The statement should be rephrased. The human can never exercise precise control of urban forests. Many biotic and abiotic factors that we cannot control impact urban forests. The climate factors discussed by the authors are a good example.</p><p>Line 313-356. Tree inventories can be generated using different sampling schemes, e.g., census or probability-based sampling methods. I assumed that the authors had the details in the supplementary files. However, it will help readers if the authors can briefly introduce how these different types of inventories were processed in the main text, especially on these incomplete tree inventories.</p><p>Line 360. Please explain why the resolution of 2.5 degrees was used. 2.5 degrees roughly equal 250 km. Probably no single US city has such a dimension. WorldClim data are available at resolutions as high as 30 arcseconds (~1 km). It may be more suitable for studies on a city scale.</p><p>Line 482. Please explain why use temperature &gt;95o F as the threshold value? The authors used land surface temperature derived from satellite data. It described the thermal patterns of urban surface, not urban heat island.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Not totally necessary, but may want to consider the using the terms &quot;introduced&quot; vs. &quot;naturally occurring&quot; species rather than “native” vs. “non-native”. There are some arguments from humanities folks about the history of the term native in colonialist narratives. Leaving it as is may distract from the very real biological argument that you are trying to make about the evolutionary history of locally interacting species leading to more interactions being supported by naturally occurring species than those that humans introduced more recently.</p><p>&quot;…validate these tools in comparison to past methods…&quot;- It is unclear to me from the text how validation was done.</p><p>Figure 4- what does the green line in the right panel of D represent- it isn't defined in the caption…</p><p>As also mentioned in the paper- you may want to consider specifying in your captions text etc that it is Shannon's effective species number you are using. Effective species can cover all hill numbers with q as a scaler (i.e. Simpson's effective species number is also an &quot;effective species count&quot;)</p><p>The excel supplemental tools need directions on the form itself to make them usable</p><p>Data S2-</p><p>– Some &quot;most_common_species&quot; are a genus instead (i.e Santa Rosa, Detroit). What is going on.</p><p>– 4 columns are all N/As- why are they included?</p><p>Data S6 tool doesn't work for me.

The original reviews are also provided below for your reference.</p><p>1. Sample completeness and representativeness</p><p>The tree inventories varied significantly regarding the number of records (214-720,140 trees per city). The variation can be due to the actual variation of tree abundances in studied cities or incomplete or biased inventories. Please add a column in the meta data indicating the sampling effort or completeness and if there were any sampling bias in the case of incomplete samples. Please also add clarifications about sample completeness and representativeness in the main text.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great point. We made two major changes (new analyses) and one minor change (new text clarifications) in response to this point. We further explain our changes in our response to your point #2 below.</p><p>First, we redid all of our diversity analyses using Chao et al’s methods of rarefaction and extrapolation in the R package <italic>iNext</italic>. This allowed us to add a column estimating sample completeness to our datasheet. We also redid the community comparison analysis (See response to #2 for further details).</p><p>Second, we designed a method to assess spatial coverage of each city as an indirect measure of sampling effort (as well as a direct measure of spatial completeness). By dividing each city into grid cells, counting the trees per unit area in each grid cell, we could then assign metrics of completeness (what percentage of grid cells were empty?) and bias (the skew and kurtosis of the numbers of trees in the occupied grid cells). Therefore, we re-ran our analyses with sensitivity measures whereby we excluded cities falling below 50% spatial completeness.</p><p>Compare Austin to Baltimore in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> as an example.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-77891-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Third, as a minor change, we added the following clarifying text to our manuscript:“For all analyses, when comparing diversity measures across different size scales, we applied rarefaction and extrapolation techniques using the R package <italic>iNext</italic> (See ‘Materials and methods’; Chao et al., 2015, 2014; Chao and Jost, 2012; Hsieh, Ma, and Chao, 2016) and performed sensitivity analyses excluding low-coverage cities.”</p><p>Finally, we added substantial new text to our Methods, new analyses, and new Supplementary files.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. If there are incomplete or biased samples, please assess how these would affect the validities of the analyses and conclusions, especially those related to α and β diversity.</p><p>a) Please note that effective species number (and other diversity indices) is dependent on sample coverage (i.e., proportions of species were sampled) and sample size (i.e., area or abundance), so that the comparisons of α diversity can be unsupported if the samples are incomplete, there are many rare species with few individuals in cities, or sampling efforts vary between common and rare species. In these cases, it is necessary to standardize biodiversity measures before comparisons on the basis of sample coverage or sample size, using rarefaction-extrapolation approaches developed by Anne Chao and colleagues (Chao and Jost. 2012. Ecology 93:2533-2547; Chao et al. 2014. Ecological Monographs 84:45-67.). We note that the analyses on the relationships between biodiversity and environment, which included log-transformed tree abundance as a covariate, did consider the dependence on sample size in a way. However, effective species number may not change with tree abundance in a log-linear way, and some other relevant analyses (e.g., comparisons between parks and urban settings) did not have proper standardization. It should also be noted that one city with a small sample size can have a high sample coverage, and sample standardization approaches suggested above originally developed for species-rich ecosystems (especially for those with many rare species) may not be completely suitable or necessary for city trees planted by humans, so if the authors have arguments for why the dependence of sample coverage or sample size do not apply for a particular question, please make that clarification.</p><p>b) If there are apparent sample biases or very low sample coverages, additional steps other than rarefaction-extrapolation analyses may be required, for example, performing sensitivity analyses by dropping unrepresentative samples.</p></disp-quote><p>We’re grateful for this detailed comment, because we implemented all of your suggestions and the paper is much stronger as a result.</p><p>First, we redid all of our diversity calculations applying Chao’s rarefaction and extrapolation techniques through the R package <italic>iNext</italic>.

Then, we ran this model under six sensitivity conditions, varying the independent variable and/or which cities we included based on completeness of their sample. Climate was still a significant correlate of diversity.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>First, with independent variable = effective species as calculated for a given population of 37,000 trees (&quot;effective species for a standardized population size&quot;);</p></list-item><list-item><p>Second, independent variable = the asymptotic estimate of the effective species number for that city as calculated using <italic>iNext</italic>;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Third, the raw effective species number;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Fourth, excluding cities with fewer than 10,000 trees;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Fifth, excluding cities with &lt;50% spatial coverage;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Sixth, excluding cities with &lt;0.995 sample coverage as calculated by <italic>iNext</italic>.</p></list-item></list><p>For the fourth, fifth, and sixth models, the independent variable was effective species for a standardized population size of 37,000 trees.</p><p>Third, we redid our comparisons of tree populations in parks versus those in urban areas.

We report the average comparison metrics.</p><p>Our new Methods text is copied here for your convenience:</p><p>“Throughout our analyses, it was necessary to control for different sample sizes (and different, but unknown, sampling efforts across cities). To do so, we relied on the rarefaction / extrapolation methods developed by Chao and colleagues (Chao et al., 2015, 2014; Chao and Jost, 2012) and implemented through the R software package <italic>iNext</italic> (Hsieh et al., 2016). In short, these methods use statistical rarefaction and/or extrapolation to generate comparable estimates of diversity across populations with different sampling efforts or population sizes, alongside confidence intervals for these diversity estimates. <italic>iNext</italic> performs these tasks for Hill numbers of orders q = 0, 1, and 2. We used two techniques in <italic>iNext</italic> to allow for comparisons across cities (and between parks and urban areas within cities). First, we generated asymptotic diversity estimates for each; second, we generated diversity estimates for a given standardized population size. For our diversity analyses, the standardized population size we used was 37,000 trees (the rounded median of all cities). For analyses of the diversity of native trees, we used a standardized population size of 10,000 trees. For comparisons of the diversity between park and urban areas in a city, we used the smaller of the two population sizes (park or urban). In all cases we also recorded confidence estimates, and plotted rarefaction/extrapolation curves (DataS_Rarefaction_Plots.zip).</p><p>To control for variation in how uniformly trees were sampled across a city’s geographic range, we developed a procedure to score each city’s spatial coverage (see section Spatial Structure below).</p><p>We identified the best-fitting model, and then repeated our analysis under six sensitivity conditions to control for differences in population size, sampling effort, spatial coverage, and sample coverage.

More information about data processing is required to increase users' confidence in the quality of data. How did you derive locations from the address? How did you validate the location accuracy? How did you harmonize the health evaluation results from different investigators?

Please clarify the relative strength and weakness of the new data relative to the Global Urban Tree Inventory developed by Ossola et al., (Global Ecology and Biogeography 2020: 29:1907-1914) and records in Global Biodiversity Information Facility.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for mentioning that excellent paper. Reviewer #2 noted that compared to the Ossola et al. (2020) paper, our dataset &quot;“added information on spatial location, nativity statuses, and tree health conditions besides occurrences. The new information expands data usability and saves valuable time for researchers. The authors also make the tools available so others can use them to process their own data sets.&quot;</p><p>We added the following discussion:</p><p>“Our study follows other impressive efforts to integrate and make inference from large sets of street tree inventories (e.g. Kendal et al. 2014, Ossola et al. 2020). Concentrating our data collection on inventories with fine-scale tree locations and within a geographic context where plant species have been thoroughly characterized as introduced or naturally-occurring allowed us to introduce two new approaches to this endeavor. First, we could evaluate how street tree diversity is spatially clustered within cities. Second, we could assess the influence of introduced versus naturally-occurring tree species on driving tree community similarity between cities. Further, we also standardized data on tree health and developed new tools for analyzing datasets of urban forests. We anticipate that many further analyses of street tree inventories are yet to come.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Additional context/conceptual underpinning the clustering analysis would be great. How did the analyses find the biologically meaningful clusters and recognize that a tall building exists or not to separate trees? What can we infer from variation in the sizes of clusters?</p></disp-quote><p>Compared to kmeans, and clustering methods that simply gather a point’s nearest neighbors regardless of the underlying spatial structure of the data, hdbscan takes into account the data’s underlying structure. It outperforms other clustering methods based on an intuitive understanding of what points should cluster together (see: https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/comparing_clustering_algorithms.html). For a basic explanation of HDBSCAN and why it works better than k-means, this blog post explains nicely: (https://towardsdatascience.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-hdbscan-and-density-based-clustering-5fd79329c1e8). Secondly, normally for clustering algorithms, we use the euclidean distance metric which measures distance like in a straight line. We used a manhattan distance algorithm which takes into account that cities are usually organized into blocks, so the distance between x and y are in right angles, rather than in a straight line (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). This leads to a more natural clustering that is suitable for cities.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-77891-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Our text now reads:“We wanted to quantify the degree to which trees were spatially clustered by species within a city (rather than randomly arranged). To do so, we first clustered all trees within each city using hierarchical density based spatial clustering through the <italic>hdbscan</italic> library in Python (McInnes et al., 2017). <italic>HDBSCAN</italic>, unlike typical methods such as “k nearest neighbors”, takes into account the underlying spatial structure of the dataset and allows the user to modify parameters in order to find biologically meaningful clusters. For city trees, which are often organized along grids or the underlying street layout of a city, this method can more meaningfully cluster trees than merely calculating the meters between trees and identifying nearest neighbors (which may be close as the crow flies but separated from each other by tall buildings). In particular, using the Manhattan metric rather than Euclidean metrics improves clustering analysis in cities (which tend to be organized along city blocks). For further discussion of why hbdscan is preferable to other clustering metrics, see (Berba, 2020; Leland McInnes et al., 2016; McInnes et al., 2017).”</p><p>As for what we can conclude from the size of the clusters, this is complicated and would be an appropriate study of future work. Therefore, we added the following text:</p><p>“Researchers could also use this dataset to perform more refined analysis of clustering. For example, what is the biological significance of variation in cluster size (as determined by the hdbscan clustering algorithms)? The size and arrangement of the clusters themselves may be useful metrics. How clustered should we expect trees to be in both wild and urban settings? That is, what our are null expectations? Further, researchers could apply network theory to predict how pest species would proliferate through each of these cities (depending on the spatial arrangement of pest-sensitive trees).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

As it stands, we feel that the caption is accurate, but please let us know if you would suggest wording changes to be more precise.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Not totally necessary, but may want to consider the using the terms &quot;introduced&quot; vs. &quot;naturally occurring&quot; species rather than “native” vs. “non-native”. There are some arguments from humanities folks about the history of the term native in colonialist narratives. Leaving it as is may distract from the very real biological argument that you are trying to make about the evolutionary history of locally interacting species leading to more interactions being supported by naturally occurring species than those that humans introduced more recently.</p></disp-quote><p>Good thinking. We have made this change throughout, clarifying in a few places that we are referring to what is traditionally called “native”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;…validate these tools in comparison to past methods…&quot;- It is unclear to me from the text how validation was done.</p></disp-quote><p>We changed this to read: “compare our results to findings based on past methods”, referring to how we find other axes of interest (e.g., spatial composition and effective species number) which are not captured in traditional tools (such as those that calculate maximum abundance of a single species, genus, and family).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4- what does the green line in the right panel of D represent- it isn't defined in the caption…</p></disp-quote><p>We added the following explanation: “In the right panel, the green line is the same as in the left panel to enable comparisons.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As also mentioned in the paper- you may want to consider specifying in your captions text etc that it is Shannon's effective species number you are using.

Define what classic abundance-based means. I think you mean the % of most common species which is I believe related to the Berger-Parker dominance Index. The confusion lies because for a community ecologist effective species number (i.e. exponent of Shannon's diversity) is a classic index that takes into account relative abundance as well as richness.</p></disp-quote><p>Good point- we shouldn’t use the word classic, since it is too general.

That confidence interval is a mathematical calculation based on the standard error and degrees of freedom (see code copied below from Source_Code_File_2). The confidence interval just mathematically represents error and is agnostic to the fact that in this case, the data we are dealing with is ratios.</p><p>Therefore, we agree with you that we need to think again about this result, and we decided on the following interpretation: in this case, that large confidence interval indicates that clustering results for Greensboro do not represent biological reality; therefore, we have cut this city from the analysis and added a note to the figure caption. The note to the Figure 3 caption reads:</p><p>“We excluded one city Greensboro, from the analysis due to insufficient sample size (10 clusters).”</p><p>Relatedly, we realized that we have 48 total cities for which we conducted a clustering analysis, so we changed “44 of 46” to “47 of 48” throughout as well as changed “trees significantly cluster by species in 96% of cities” to “98% of cities”.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Figure 3 caption</p></list-item><list-item><p>In-text, L256</p></list-item><list-item><p>Abstract, L51</p></list-item></list><p>Code to calculate confidence interval:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>n &lt;- length(ratio)</p></list-item><list-item><p>median_value &lt;- median(ratio)</p></list-item><list-item><p>standard_deviation &lt;- sd(ratio)</p></list-item><list-item><p>standard_error &lt;- standard_deviation / sqrt(n)</p></list-item><list-item><p>α = 0.05</p></list-item><list-item><p>degrees_of_freedom = n – 1</p></list-item><list-item><p>t_score = qt(p=α/2, df=degrees_of_freedom,lower.tail=F)</p></list-item><list-item><p>margin_error &lt;- t_score * standard_error</p></list-item><list-item><p>lower_CI &lt;- median_value – margin_error</p></list-item><list-item><p>upper_CI &lt;- median_value + margin_error</p></list-item></list><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.
