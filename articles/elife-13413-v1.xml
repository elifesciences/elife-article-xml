Here we investigate the mechanism for the channel's unusual regulation by external calcium, and rationalize this behavior to its specialized function. We report that the human PKD2-L1 selectivity filter is partially selective to calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) moving into the cell, but blocked by high internal Ca<sup>2+</sup>concentrations, a unique feature of this transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family member. Surprisingly, we find that the C-terminal EF-hands and coiled-coil domains do not contribute to PKD2-L1 Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced potentiation and inactivation. We propose a model in which prolonged channel activity results in calcium accumulation, triggering outward-moving Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions to block PKD2-L1 in a high-affinity interaction with the innermost acidic residue (D523) of the selectivity filter and subsequent long-term channel inactivation. This response rectifies Ca<sup>2+</sup> flow, enabling Ca<sup>2+</sup> to enter but not leave small compartments such as the cilium.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13413.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13413.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13413.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most of our cells have a single tiny-hair like structure called a primary cilium that projects outwards from the cell surface.

The four PKD1 members (PKD1, PKD1-L1, PKD1-L2, PKD1-L3) are large proteins (~1700–4300 amino acids) with 11 putative transmembrane segments (TM) and a large autocleaved N-terminal extracellular domain. In contrast, the three PKD2 members are often included in the TRP ion channel family because they have 6 TM domains and a putative selectivity filter loop between TM5 and TM6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ramsey et al., 2006</xref>). These include PKD2, (PC2, TRPP1; formerly TRPP2), PKD2-L1 (PC2-L1, TRPP2; formerly TRPP3) and PKD2-L2 (PC2-L2, TRPP3, formerly TRPP5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wu et al., 2010</xref>). Members of the PKD1 and PKD2-subfamilies are often reported to associate in the plasma membrane, although the nature of these complexes is not understood. PKD1 + PKD2 were purported to form mechanosensitive ion channels in the primary cilia of kidney collecting duct epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nauli and Zhou, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nauli et al., 2003</xref>), a hypothesis that has recently been challenged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DeCaen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Delling et al., 2016</xref>). In humans, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is associated with loss-of-function mutations in genes that encode for either PKD1 or PKD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wu and Somlo, 2000</xref>). Complete loss of either <italic>Pkd1</italic> or <italic>Pkd2</italic> in mice results in embryonic lethality with defects in formation of the kidney, pancreas and heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boulter et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kim et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wu et al., 2000</xref>). As in human ADPKD, adult <italic>Pkd2<sup>WS25/–</sup></italic> mice have kidney cysts, renal failure, and die early (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wu et al., 2000</xref>). PKD1-L1 + PKD2-L1 heteromers form a calcium channel complex in the primary cilia from embryonic fibroblasts and retinal pigmented epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DeCaen et al., 2013</xref>). Mice lacking <italic>Pkd2-L1</italic> exhibit a form of heterotaxy (intestinal malrotation) in ~50% of offspring, suggesting that the channel modulates the ciliary Sonic Hedgehog (SHh) pathway during early development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Delling et al., 2013</xref>). A putative PKD1-L3 + PKD2-L1 channel was reported in mouse taste buds and proposed to be the acid receptor required for sour taste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kawaguchi et al., 2010</xref>), but <italic>Pkd2-L1</italic> knockout mice do not appear to have a deficit in sour taste perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nelson et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Of all the members of the PKD family, we found that only PKD2-L1 forms a functional homotetrameric channel when heterologously expressed on the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DeCaen et al., 2013</xref>). Information about the physiological function of the endogenous homomeric PKD2-L1 is sparse. Emerging evidence suggests that single channel openings of homomeric PKD2-L1 channels are sufficiently large (&gt;100 pS) to generate action potentials in the medullo-spinal cerebrospinal fluid contacting neurons (CSF-cNs) located in the ependymal layer of the brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Orts-Del'Immagine et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Orts-Del'immagine et al., 2012</xref>). Since channels containing PKD2-L1 subunits are constitutively-active and calcium-permeant, dysregulation of their activity could lead to aberrant cytoplasmic calcium regulation, especially in smaller compartments such as the primary cilia of epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DeCaen et al., 2013</xref>), the dendritic bulb of cerebrospinal fluid-contacting neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Orts-Del'Immagine et al., 2014</xref>) and the apical processes of the type III taste receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ishimaru et al., 2010</xref>). Based on results using GCaMP3-targeted calcium sensors and current clamp recordings, primary cilia membranes were depolarized and had higher resting calcium concentrations (~ −20 mV, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>in</sub> ~700 nM) compared to the cell body (-50 mV, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>in</sub> &lt; 100 nM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Delling et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, the endogenous PKD1-L1 + PKD2-L1 channel complex inactivates in response to high cytoplasmic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] when measured directly from the primary cilium (IC<sub>50</sub> =540 nM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DeCaen et al., 2013</xref>). When measured through heterologous co-expression, the PKD1-L3 + PKD2-L1 channel was initially activated, then inactivated by extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (5–10 mM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2015</xref>), which was also observed when homomeric PKD2-L1 channels were expressed in in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 1999</xref>). It is unclear if calcium regulates the channels composed of PKD2-L1 directly or indirectly through an internal or external binding site.</p><p>Here we have taken the reductionist approach of measuring the PKD2-L1 homomeric channel in a heterologous system in order to understand its mechanism of calcium-dependent inactivation. We first confirm previous studies that PKD2-L1 is modestly voltage-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shimizu et al., 2009</xref>) and show that this voltage dependence is independent of any divalent ion blocking mechanism. We then demonstrate that PKD2-L1 inactivation is initiated by the accumulation of internal Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Surprisingly, we find that removal of the cytoplasmic EF-hands and coiled-coil motifs do not alter PKD2-L1 inactivation. We observe that Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions conduct inwardly through the selectivity filter of PKD2-L1, whereas outward Ca<sup>2+</sup> conductance blocks the channel, followed by long-term inactivation. This type of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependence appears to be unique to PKD2-L1 among TRP channels tested to date and is triggered by Ca<sup>2+</sup> coordination with D523 in the selectivity filter, which is also the site responsible for divalent metal and trivalent lanthanide metal block.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PKD2-L1 channels are voltage-dependent, even in the absence of divalent ions</title><p>The voltage dependence of murine PKD2-L1 (previously named TRPP2, now called TRPP1) was previously characterized under conditions of high (11 mM) internal magnesium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shimizu et al., 2009</xref>).

From a holding potential of 0 mV, we applied a +100 mV prepulse and then measured tail currents after immediate hyperpolarization to varying potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Plots of the instantaneous maximum tail currents (Max. I<sub>tail</sub>) were nearly linear (ohmic) at all potentials. However, the steady-state current (I<sub>ss</sub>) measured after the tail current decay outwardly rectified at potentials above +50 mV. At negative potentials PKD2-L1 appears to simply deactivate as estimated by the rate constants of tail current decay (τ = 20–60 ms, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1 B</xref>). In the on-cell configuration, the decay of ensemble-averaged single channel events closely matched macroscopic tail current decay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13413.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>PKD2-L1 channel deactivation is voltage-dependent.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram depicting symmetrical divalent free (DVF) conditions. (<bold>B</bold>) <italic>Top</italic>, voltage protocol used to generate tail currents.

However, single channel amplitudes appear to remain constant over the time course of the pulse, indicating a lack of fast (flicker) block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Also, replacing Na<sup>+</sup> by K<sup>+</sup> did not change the current amplitude or rate of decay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Although we cannot rule out a site that binds and blocks all inward monovalent cations, we argue that the most likely interpretation is that the channel simply deactivates after hyperpolarization (see Discussion). It is important to note that the onset of the PKD2-L1 tail current is very fast (&lt;120 μs, data not shown), without an obvious ‘hook’ to indicate overlapping activation and inactivation time courses as observed in delayed rectifying potassium channels (hERG and Kv3.1b) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Labro et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vandenberg et al., 2012</xref>). The tail currents of PKD2-L1 are unusual compared to other cation-nonselective TRP channels. For example, currents conducted by TRPM7 are ohmic and do not decay upon membrane hyperpolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). However, TRPM7 becomes outwardly rectifying when calcium is added to the external sodium solution (and, as is well-known for TRPM6/7, blocked by internal Mg<sup>2+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Topala et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2007</xref>), indicating that TRPM7 rectifies in the presence of a physiological level of extracellular calcium, and possibly other divalent ions.</p><p>Taken together, these data demonstrate that human PKD2-L1 channels are voltage-dependent, as previously described for the murine orthologue by Nilius and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shimizu et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, PKD2-L1 voltage dependence which is independent of cation block is likely shared between murine and human orthologs and may be a unique among the TRP family of ion channels. The following experiments focus on another unusual feature of PKD2-L1 we call ‘long-term inactivation’ which is dependent on the accumulation of internal calcium ions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>PKD2-L1 channels are blocked by Ca<sup>2+</sup> exiting the cell</title><p>High external Ca<sup>2+</sup> (10 mM) potentiates human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 1999</xref>) but not murine PKD2-L1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shimizu et al., 2009</xref>). To examine calcium’s modulation of the current under physiological Ca<sup>2+</sup> conditions, we expressed human PKD2-L1 and measured PKD2-L1 currents under voltage clamp in 2 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ex</sub>. As with high external calcium, PKD2-L1 current was initially potentiated but, interestingly, was then completely and apparently irreversibly inactivated over 8 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). During the voltage ramp, we observed a negative shift of E<sub>rev</sub> from 8 to 0 mV, reflecting a loss in the available calcium-permeable PKD2-L1 channels and/or a shift in the ion composition of the patched cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Similar shifts in equilibrium potentials due to accumulation of internal cations have been reported for cells overexpressing P<sub>2</sub>X<sub>2</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Since potentiation (4 min) and inactivation (8 min) were slow, we hypothesized that internal accumulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> could account for the delayed onset of both. We integrated the tail currents triggered by −60 mV repolarizations to estimate the number of calcium ions accumulating within the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,C</xref>). We found that Ca<sup>2+</sup> moving through PKD2-L1 saturates the internal calcium buffers (5 mM BAPTA and intrinsic) and accumulates to concentrations &gt;10 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The time course of BAPTA saturation by PKD2-L1-mediated increases in Ca<sup>2+</sup> occurs after 4 min, suggesting that internal calcium accumulation is responsible for channel inactivation.

When measuring the voltage dependence of the PKD2-L1 channel under physiological Ca<sup>2+</sup> conditions, we observed that PKD2-L1 channels exhibit a biphasic current-voltage relationship, in which the outward current decreases at potentials beyond the reversal potential for calcium (E<sub>Ca</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). By altering extracellular calcium ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ex</sub>), we noted that net nonselective outward current always declined positive to E<sub>Ca </sub>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Repetition of the protocol demonstrated that PKD2-L1 channels had completely inactivated; that is, PKD2-L1 currents could no longer be elicited during the recording period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This data suggests that outward PKD2-L1 currents were stably blocked and/or inactivated by outward moving Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions. We tested TRPM7, TRPV1, and TRPV3 for similar behavior and found that none of their outward currents exhibited this biphasic dependence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, TRPV1 data not shown). Comparing the PKD2-L1 outward current to the inward tail current elicited by repolarization to −60 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), we observed that the outward current was blocked, whereas the inward tail current remained relatively constant. These observations suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup> induced block and subsequent inactivation of all outward current, while inward flux was unimpeded. To examine this phenomenon, we used a voltage protocol designed to capture the rates of Ca<sup>2+</sup>- dependent block and inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). A series of voltage clamp steps 10–30 mV negative to E<sub>Ca</sub> were applied so that inward tail currents and outward currents were stable over time. Thus, inward Ca<sup>2+</sup> could permeate PKD2-L1 without blocking or inactivating the channel. Then, the depolarization step was increased to 28–42 mV more positive than E<sub>Ca</sub>, where the outward currents were immediately blocked by outwardly moving calcium ions. In contrast, tail currents triggered by repolarization to -60 mV were not immediately blocked, but progressively decreased after each depolarization positive to E<sub>Ca</sub>, indicating that the inward PKD2-L1 currents were not long-term- inactivated until after the outward current was blocked by Ca<sup>2+</sup>.

Thus, we sought to reduce the affinity for the Ca<sup>2+</sup> coordination sites within the selectivity filter to relieve the outward current block by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and thus reduce inactivation. We previously reported that the PKD2-L1 conductance could be abolished by double serine or alanine mutations, to Asp523 and Asp525 (D523S:D525S or D523A:D525A), whereas mutation of Asp530 (D530N) did not alter the conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DeCaen et al., 2013</xref>). We also tested individual alanine substitutions to either position (data not shown), which also abolished the PKD2-L1 conductance. These data suggest that residues D523 and D525 are critical positions within the PKD2-L1 selectivity filter. Since D523 is the most conserved residue among the PKD2 family members, we propose that it is essential for block, inactivation, and its modest Ca<sup>2+</sup> selectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Since asparagine (Asn, N) has a similar volume (≈ 11 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nauli and Zhou, 2004</xref>)) but its carboxamide side chain is not as electronegative as the carboxylate found in the native aspartate (Asp, D), we generated individual substitutions of Asn for D523 and D525. We found that at similar current densities, D523N mutant-associated currents did not inactivate over an 8 min time course, whereas D525N currents first potentiated and then inactivated similar to the Wt channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

Calcium binding proteins like calmodulin often bind to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeant ion channels and alter their function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ben-Johny et al., 2015</xref>). Calcium coordinating motifs within channel proteins, such as cytoplasmic EF-hands found in voltage gated Ca<sub>V</sub> channels, alter channel inactivation based on localized calcium accumulation. Here, we have shown a direct mechanism of calcium regulation of the PKD2-L1 channel, in which outward Ca<sup>2+</sup> binds in the selectivity filter and initiates inactivation of the channel. Calcium and other ions pass inwardly through the PKD2-L1 channel as long as the electrochemical gradient permits; when channel densities are high, this is sufficient to significantly shift internal ion concentrations as seen by the slowly shifting E<sub>rev</sub>. However, depolarizations above E<sub>Ca</sub> lead to channel block and inactivation (as proposed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the only reported ion channel with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent rectification due to pore block-inactivation, and so far is unique to PKD2-L1.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13413.018</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Proposed kinetic scheme of PKD2-L1 channel states and a hypothetical model of Ca<sup>2+</sup> coordination sites in the selectivity filter.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Calcium clamp of restricted spaces, such as primary cilia, by PKD2-L1.

Thus far, the proposed mechanism(s) by which Ca<sup>2+</sup> inhibits TRP channels are indirect, such as with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-depletion, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated kinases, phosphatases, and phospholipases, via both calmodulin-dependent and independent processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gordon-Shaag et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhu, 2005</xref>). We showed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> occupancy in the filter blocks the outward PKD2-L1 current and triggers its long-term inactivation. Although mutating the selectivity filter of TRPA1 (D918) can abolish extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent potentiation and inactivation, the effect of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> on these processes follows elevation of intracellular calcium and is proposed to operate through an indirect, unknown mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). For PKD2-L1, outward Ca<sup>2+</sup> current inactivates the channel after binding within the selectivity pore. Although we cannot rule out allosteric modulation by calmodulin or kinases during inactivation, involvement of the C-terminal EF-hand and coiled-coil are unlikely since no effect was observed on inactivation when these motifs were removed. Likewise, for the TRPA1 channel, removing the EF-hands did little to alter the onset of potentiation and inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). Our observations from our PKD2-L1 EF-hands truncation are in agreement with results from the PKD2-L1 splice variants expressed in the liver, where a naturally occurring C-terminal EF-hand truncation is found to have no effect on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2002</xref>). Thus if C-terminal modulation is involved, the location for binding of a modulator would have to be located above the oligomerization domain, which appears to be critical for PKD2-L1 function, as the trafficking of the Stop-588 mutant was the same as the full length channel.</p><p>We have shown that even potent (BAPTA, 5 mM) cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffers can be saturated when PKD2-L1 channels are overexpressed. Once occupied by outwardly moving calcium ions, the PKD2-L1 channels irreversibly inactivates in seconds (τ = 2.1 s). Thus our results explain the inactivation phenomenon observed in Chen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 1999</xref>) and describe a direct level of Ca<sup>2+</sup> feedback inhibition of the PKD2-L1 channel. Given that cytoplasmic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] ranges from 50 nM to as high as 10 µM (near mouths of channels), what is the physiological relevance of outward calcium current regulation in PKD2-L1 channels? Because of the cell’s large volume (typically 1–3 pL), it is unlikely that the concentration of calcium in the cytosol would ever reach sufficient concentrations to move outwardly through PKD2-L1 channel and trigger inactivation. However, because PKD2-L1 channels have large inward conductances (PKD2-L1: 120–150 pS and PKD1-L1 +PKD2-L1 = 86 pS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DeCaen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shimizu et al., 2009</xref>) with modest selectivity for Ca<sup>2+</sup> (P<sub>Ca</sub>/P<sub>Cs</sub> PKD2-L1 and PKD1-L1 +PKD2-L1 = 6–15) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DeCaen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shimizu et al., 2009</xref>), the expression of just a few channels (1–10) in small cellular compartments could result in large changes in local Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. For example, the homomeric PKD2-L1 is enriched in the membrane of the dendritic nob of CSF contacting neurons, which have small volumes (113 fL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Orts-Del'Immagine et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Orts-Del'Immagine et al., 2016</xref>). Here, PKD2-L1’s alkaline-pH-stimulated channel activity (P<sub>o</sub> = 0.02) would increase the dendritic nob cytoplasmic calcium by ≈ 22 μM per channel opening. In smaller compartments, like the primary cilium (0.5 fL), where roughly 30 heteromeric PKD1-L1 +PKD2-L1 channels are expressed, ATP stimulation (P<sub>o</sub> = 0.01) would increase the cilioplasmic calcium by ≈ 31 μM per channel opening. Thus, prolonged PKD2-L1 (or PKD1-L1 +PKD2-L1) channel openings could result in increases in cellular compartment [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] up to the external [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. Most important, we hypothesize that PKD2-L1 maintains Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in the 500 -700 nM range observed in primary cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nelson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wu et al., 2000</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, entering Ca<sup>2+</sup> transiently potentiates PKD2-L1 up to ~750 nM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>In</sub> - above this level, inhibition dominates. This behavior would serve as [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] clamp, a feedback mechanism that counteracts Ca<sup>2+</sup> loss via diffusion into the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). This mechanism would ensure that the primary cilium is a specialized calcium compartment, even though no calcium diffusion barrier exists between cilium and cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nelson et al., 2010</xref>). However, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchangers and intrinsic buffers present in each compartment are not known, limiting a more detailed interpretation of this mechanism.</p><p>We have established that D523 within the filter is responsible for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-selectivity as ions pass inward, and for block by Ca<sup>2+</sup> as it moves out of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6-figure supplement 1</xref>). Independent substitutions of the aspartate filter residues 523 and 525 with asparagine resulted in a significant reduction of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-selectivity, while independent alanine substitutions for either residue resulted in a non-conducting channel. Based on these observations we propose that this unique calcium conductance is achieved with two ion coordinating sites involving filter residues D523 and D525. We speculate that Ca<sup>2+</sup> unidirectional conductance is achieved by a ‘knock-on’ ionic interaction, where the outer residue (D525) coordinates Ca<sup>2+</sup> with weaker affinity than the inner residue (D523). In this model, the interaction of Ca<sup>2+</sup> with D523 is broken by repulsion by a second Ca<sup>2+</sup> occupying the outer D525. When the membrane potential is more depolarized than E<sub>Ca</sub>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> occupies the high-affinity binding site (D523). Since there is no inner Ca<sup>2+</sup> coordinating site to electrostatically ‘knock-off’ Ca<sup>2+</sup> from D523, it is not displaced from this site and outward current is blocked. Since Ca<sup>2+</sup> does not block the D523N channel, we propose that Ca<sup>2+</sup> is able to move in both directions in the mutant channel’s selectivity filter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). This effect can be explained by the loss of the high-affinity binding site within the innermost portion of the selectivity filter. Since D523 is conserved within the PKD2 family, it is possible that other members of PKD2 family may share this same unidirectional calcium conductance, although the selectivities of homomeric PKD2 and PKD2-L2 channels have yet to be defined.</p><p>We established that D523 is the metal binding site for divalent and trivalent ions within the selectivity filter of PKD2-L1. The potency (IC<sub>50</sub>) of PKD2-L1 block by Gd<sup>3+</sup> was shifted from 9 μM to greater than 1 mM in the D523N channel, which reflects a loss of affinity &gt;6.7 kcal/mol. Conversely, the D523N mutant conducts the smaller trivalent La<sup>3+</sup> at µM concentrations, whereas the Wt and D525N channels are blocked within this concentration range. These seeming incompatible observations are reminiscent of La<sup>3+</sup> anomalous mole fraction effects reported in Wt members of the TRPC family (C3, C4, C5 and C6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jung et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Strübing et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hofmann et al., 1999</xref>). Thus, whether trivalent and divalent metals permeate or block TRP channels is likely determined by the strength of their electrostatic interactions with acidic residues that line the selectivity filter.</p><p>A simple preliminary four state model of PKD2-L1 is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>. We have defined the resting state found at negative potentials prior to depolarization as the closed state (C), although PKD2-L1 has some of constitutive activity even at −100 mV (P<sub>O</sub> = 0.007). After depolarization, our analysis of macroscopic and single channel currents demonstrates that channel openings are transiently increased upon hyperpolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We proposed that these large, slowly decaying tail currents represent the population of channels transitioning from the open (O) to closed (C) state. The closed to open transition (K<sub>1</sub>) can be measured by the kinetics of the peak currents during membrane depolarization (&lt;10 mV). While it is possible that PKD2-L1 gating may have voltage dependent inactivation properties akin to some delayed rectifying potassium channels (I<sub>Kr</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Warmke and Ganetzky, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Trudeau et al., 1995</xref>), our experiments did not capture this kinetic property. Further biophysical characterization will be necessary to test this possibility. The PKD2-L1 channel opening (K<sub>1</sub>) and closure (K<sub>-1</sub>) are reversible and modestly voltage dependent, increasing 1.5x and 2.2x with 100 mV membrane potential shifts, respectively. Outwardly moving Ca<sup>2+</sup> rapidly block the open channel state (O<sub>block</sub>) and trigger a slower long-term inactivation process (K<sub>2</sub>). The rate of inactivation (K<sub>2</sub>) is dependent on outward Ca<sup>2+</sup> current and is irreversible on the time scale of the experiments. Interestingly, the enhanced onset of channel opening and closing found in the D523N mutant may be related to the lack of Ca<sup>2+</sup> selectivity and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation. These observations demonstrate that the rates of PKD2-L1 gating can be altered by mutating positions within the selectivity filter, suggesting that permeant ion coordinating sites are partly involved. This feature has precedence in BK channels, where permeant ions alter the opening and closing transitions but do not alter the calcium- or voltage-dependent activation pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Thompson and Begenisich, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Piskorowski and Aldrich, 2006</xref>). It is possible that PKD2-L1 pore blockade by outwardly moving Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion(s) are displaced by inwardly Na<sup>+</sup> current and a slow Ca<sup>2+</sup> unbinding process prolongs the time course of channel closure. That is, hyperpolarization helps clear Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions from the PKD2-L1 selectivity filter. This effect may be analogous to displacement of quaternary ammonium ion(s) by inward K<sup>+</sup> current conducted by K<sub>V</sub> channels found in the squid giant axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Armstrong, 1971</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Whole-cell voltage-clamp experiments</title><p>HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected with the mammalian cell expression plasmid pTracer CMV2 containing the human PKD2-L1 gene (isoform 1).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Aldrich as the Senior editor and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and another is Ramón Latorre.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript identifies the mechanism of Ca-dependent desensitization of a recently described cation channel, PKD2-L1. This channel, which is part of the TRP family, and is expressed in the cilia of kidney epithelial cells; its knockout in mice is embryonic lethal, and its dysfunction is associated with kidney disorders. When expressed in HEK cells, it produces ionic currents that are constitutively active but show a non-instantaneous outward rectification. With step depolarizations, the conductance increases over ~100 ms, and repolarization elicits large tail currents. Repeated ramps demonstrate that the channel is sequentially facilitated and then desensitized by Ca. Through a series of electrophysiological and molecular manipulations, the present experiments demonstrate that the desensitization but not facilitation phenomenon results from pore block by internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> trying to exit through the channel and interacting with D523 in the selectivity filter to block the channel.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers found the manuscript compelling. Primary questions had to do with (a) clarifying the interpretation of the mechanism, either by a more extensive Discussion accompanied by quantitative justifications and/or reanalysis to clarify the ambiguous points or by direct biophysical modeling (described in detail in points 1 and 2 below), (b) presentation of figures in a way to ensure that key data are all present in the main text (point 3 below), (c) revisiting the Ca permeability analysis (point 4 below (d) clarification of the single channel analysis (point 5 below). Please revise the manuscript accordingly.</p><p>Detailed explanation of essential revisions from reviewers' comments.</p><p>1) Results/<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: &quot;…the outward current was blocked, whereas the inward tail current remained relatively constant. These observations suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup> induced block and subsequent desensitization of all outward current, while inward flux was unimpeded.&quot; It is not clear to me how the block can be cumulative over repeated trials (steps here or ramps elsewhere) if inward current is unimpeded. This seems self-contradictory. The authors provide ample evidence that outwardly flowing Ca blocks the channel, but they do not state explicitly what happens to the bound Ca over time (upon repolarization). The data with the D523N mutant in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> shows that the lack of Ca block correlates with an extreme shortening of the long, broad tail current that characterizes the wild type. It therefore seems possible that the blocking Ca (in the wild type) is displaced by inwardly flowing ions, at least in a subset of channels, and a slow unbinding process prolongs the time course of the tail (as in displacement of quaternary ammonium ions by inward K tails in Armstrong 1971). It is hard to tell whether this idea is considered or favored or ruled out by the authors. In the Discussion there is a consideration of knock-on and knock-off, but I cannot tell whether it addresses this particular question. It would be helpful if the authors could more directly discuss (1) whether and how the bound Ca ever unbinds and (2) what might underlie the dramatic change in tail currents in the D523 mutant. Addressing these points could be done by rewriting and would not require any new experiments, (unless the authors thought of something worth testing).</p><p>2) The PKD2-L1 TRP ion channel is shown to be able to facilitate calcium influx but it is blocked by outgoing calcium ions. This unique feature of this channel is explained by a model with two calcium binding sites, illustrated on Figure 6—figure supplement 2. However, a quantitative explanation in terms of energy barriers or kinetic schemes would have enriched the paper.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—Figure supplement 1</xref> shows a very important experiment and should be moved to the main text, possibly as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>. In this figure, the investigators show strong evidence that outwardly-moving Ca<sup>2+</sup> elicited by depolarization to above Erev for Ca<sup>2+</sup> blocks the outward current. Panel B shows evidence that the outward movement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> desensitizes the channel. It would strengthen the paper if the authors could show that the occurrence of desensitization also depends on the Erev of Ca<sup>2+</sup> as in A.</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the authors estimate calcium levels in cells expressing PKD2-L1 transfected HEK cells and use this as evidence that calcium accumulation causes inactivation/desensitization of the channels. Whether this technique is valid was debated by the reviewers. One commented: &quot;the relative contribution of calcium influx to the total current cannot be simply calculated based on permeability ratios. This can only be calculated, as far as I know, by simultaneously measuring calcium levels with a calcium indicator a method pioneered by Neher and used most recently by Nilius on TRPA1 channels (Karashima et al., 2010). If you look at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> from Nilius Biophys J. 2010 Mar 3;98(5):773-83, you can see that using P<sub>Ca</sub> can lead to over or underestimates of fractional calcium entry by several fold in either direction, depending on the channel. Moreover, the authors do not consider the fact that the pipette serves as a large sink, reducing the rate of calcium accumulation. Thus, I think that this analysis is invalid and only weakens the paper.&quot; This reviewer added: &quot;I would also like to see the data that supports the assertion that the currents do not desensitize when the cells are loaded with 15 mM BAPTA/5 mM EGTA.&quot; Another commented: It is okay to equate permeabilities ratios with conductance ratios. However, the authors should consider the actual driving forces since (V<sub>m</sub>-V<sub>Na</sub>) is not equal to (V<sub>m</sub>-V<sub>Ca</sub>).&quot; The reviewers agreed that a better argument is made in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, which could be promoted to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, eliminating the current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>5) For the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, what evidence other than single channel amplitude is there that the channel shown is indeed a PKD2-L1 channel? Does it show the same voltage dependence as the whole cell current? Is it only observed in transfected cells? Also, I am not clear what voltage was applied across the membrane (i.e. experienced by the channel) – was this -50 mV? Or +80 mV?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Atypical calcium regulation of the PKD2-L1 polycystin ion channel&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Richard Aldrich as the Senior editor, a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance. We are willing to offer you one more opportunity to produce an acceptable version, so we ask that you pay particular attention to the detailed comments of the reviewers below:</p><p>The revisions to the manuscript are not altogether clear, either in the writing or the scientific presentation. Please re-examine some of the changes made and edit to make the material more accessible and/or well integrated into the manuscript. Specifically, reviewers had difficulty understanding (1) the first paragraph of the Results, in part owing to grammatical/linguistic errors, as well as the new first figure, esp. regarding the voltage-dependence and its relation to other literature and the rest of the paper and (2) the response to reviewers, esp. regarding the unbinding of Ca and the two Ca-bound states in the model.</p><p>The first main issue is that the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows the currents recorded in 0 divalents and presents the discovery or confirmation (it was not clear which) that this channel is voltage-dependent, even independent of divalents, which was not explicitly in the first version. As written, however, it is hard to follow, and the switch to studying divalent block is so abrupt as to be confusing. It is possible that this may be improved by clarifying some matters of nomenclature.</p><p>The second main issue is that the manuscript still shows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and states in the text that (with divalents) &quot;the outward current was blocked, whereas the inward tail current remained relatively constant. These observations suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup> induced block and subsequent inactivation of all outward current, while inward flux was unimpeded.&quot; The data indeed demonstrate that repeated steps to 180 mV can make the tail current desensitize, but it is still unclear how the outward current with steps above E<sub>Ca</sub> can get rid of all outward current (red traces) but still make big tails. If Ca is blocking the pore, where is the current coming from? The previous review asked about the unbinding of Ca, given the initial claim that inward current was unimpeded, and about whether the slow deactivation came from hooked tail currents with a slow rise. However, the rise times on tail currents were not addressed and neither is the profound difference in tail current deactivation times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding is described as irreversible (Results, second paragraph, Discussion, third and last paragraphs), but the model of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> has a Ca-bound open-blocked state as well as a Ca-bound inactivated state, which obliquely suggests that the tails do indeed come from knock-off and that inactivation is a separate transition, although no supporting analyses were included (although they may be present in the data). The idea of two Ca bound states is not addressed anywhere in the manuscript except in the last three sentences. It was not clear to all the reviewers that two states might exist and may likewise not be clear to readers. Please edit accordingly.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13413.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>The reviewers found the manuscript compelling.

Biophysical Journal, 1990; Frankenhaeuser &amp; Hodgkin, Journal of Physiology, 1956). When a non-selective channel with a large conductance (such as PKD2-L1) is overexpressed in a HEK cell, the internal cationic concentration is altered by accumulation of external cations during sustained activation. This effect was highlighted in a recent study examining the contribution of the pipette cationic reservoir during voltage clamp of HEK cells overexpressing P<sub>2</sub>X<sub>2</sub> channels using a rigorous mathematical model (Li, Swartz, Nature Neuroscience 2015). The authors find that internal cation conditions are controlled initially by pipette reservoir, but after repetitive or continuous stimulation of the P<sub>2</sub>X<sub>2</sub> channel the pipette had very little influence. The accumulation of bath internal cations (up to 100 mM) explains the observed collapse of the reversal potential, a phenomena which has also been reported in TRPV1, TRPA1, ASICs and TMEM16A channels.</p><p>While the equations in our present study to not account for ionic contributions by the pipette cation reservoir, the preceding evidence suggests that it is insignificant after continuous PKD2-L1 stimulation. A good point by the reviewer is that our study does not simultaneously measure free calcium. While having a Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporter (such as a dye) may have the benefit of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry estimates, the caveat is that it introduces an additional Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffer (and its Ca length constant) which complicates the free Ca<sup>2+</sup> calculation.</p><p>Thus we feel the analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> (previously <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) is a valid approximation (not a measurement) of the free Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation. We have adhered with the reviewer’s suggestion and substituted the Main text figure for the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> supplement (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>This reviewer added: &quot;I would also like to see the data that supports the assertion that the currents do not desensitize when the cells are loaded with 15 mM BAPTA/5 mM EGTA.&quot;</p><p>This was demonstrated over a ten minute time course in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (black traces). We have changed the text in the second paragraph of the Results section to be more clear.</p><p><italic>5) For the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, what evidence other than single channel amplitude is there that the channel shown is indeed a PKD2-L1 channel? Does it show the same voltage dependence as the whole cell current? Is it only observed in transfected cells? Also, I am not clear what voltage was applied across the membrane (i.e. experienced by the channel) – was this -50 mV? Or +80 mV?</italic></p><p>Good point. We have included a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>)which examines the kinetics of tail currents in response to hyperpolarization and the single channel’s sensitivity to dibucaine. We have described the results as follows:</p><p>“The identity of the conductance measured in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> as PKD2-L1 is supported by the fact that such a conductance (outward 198 pS, inward 121 pS) with is not measured from untransfected HEK-293T cells and that both the single channel conductance and macroscopic whole cell currents are blocked by dibucaine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).”</p><p>We have measured HEK currents thousands of times, have expressed almost all TRP channels in HEK cells in the past, and the properties of the observed current are only consistent with PKD2-L1. In previous work, we mutated its pore domain, knocked it down, knocked it out, and examined its temperature sensitivity, pressure sensitivity, and kinetics (DeCaen et al. 2013). The holding potential was 80 mV in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. We have removed the “≈-50 mV”- this was a typographical error.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Atypical calcium regulation of the PKD2-L1 polycystin ion channel&quot; for further consideration at eLife. Your revised article has been evaluated by Richard Aldrich (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance. We are willing to offer you one more opportunity to produce an acceptable version, so we ask that you pay particular attention to the detailed comments of the reviewers below:</italic> </p><p><italic>The revisions to the manuscript are not altogether clear, either in the writing or the scientific presentation. Please re-examine some of the changes made and edit to make the material more accessible and/or well integrated into the manuscript. Specifically, reviewers had difficulty understanding (1) the first paragraph of the Results, in part owing to grammatical/linguistic errors, as well as the new first figure, esp. regarding the voltage-dependence and its relation to other literature and the rest of the paper and (2) the response to reviewers, esp. regarding the unbinding of Ca and the two Ca-bound states in the model.</italic> </p><p><italic>The first main issue is that the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows the currents recorded in 0 divalents and presents the discovery or confirmation (it was not clear which) that this channel is voltage-dependent, even independent of divalents, which was not explicitly in the first version. As written, however, it is hard to follow, and the switch to studying divalent block is so abrupt as to be confusing. It is possible that this may be improved by clarifying some matters of nomenclature.</italic></p><p>Previously, the reviewers suggested that we add a model describing the PKD2-L1 channel states that would benefit this manuscript. In order to do so, we needed to test the voltage dependent states of the human isoform of PKD2-L1, which has become <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Although murine PKD2-L1’s (previously called TRPP3, now designated TRPP2 by IUPHAR) voltage dependence had been partially characterized, human PKD2-L1 had not. We have clarified the nomenclature, added references and discuss the murine PKD2-L1 findings to the first paragraph for greater context. We presented these results first in order to rule out divalent-dependent effects on voltage dependent gating so that outward Ca-dependent block and subsequent inactivation could be examined in the remainder of the manuscript. We’ve substantially rewritten this section and placed subheadings to help the reader.</p><p><italic>The second main issue is that the manuscript still shows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and states in the text that (with divalents) &quot;the outward current was blocked, whereas the inward tail current remained relatively constant. These observations suggest that</italic> Ca<sup>2+</sup> <italic>induced block and subsequent inactivation of all outward current, while inward flux was unimpeded.&quot; The data indeed demonstrate that repeated steps to 180 mV can make the tail current desensitize, but it is still unclear how the outward current with steps above E<sub>Ca</sub> can get rid of all outward current (red traces) but still make big tails. If Ca is blocking the pore, where is the current coming from?</italic> </p><p>It is important to note that the calcium block is unidirectional. Outward PKD2-L1 current is blocked by outwardly moving Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions at potentials greater than E<sub>Ca</sub>. This results in the loss of <underline>peak</underline> current during the depolarizing pulses (red traces) shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>. At potentials negative to E<sub>Ca</sub>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> does not move outwardly and peak currents are not blocked (black traces). Since Ca<sup>2+</sup> blocks PKD2-L1 current in the outward direction only, the inward tail current remains comparatively large unless the slow process (τ = 1.8-2.1 s) of inactivation is initiated by multiple depolarizations positive to E<sub>rev</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, C</xref>). We explain this unidirectional block by the relative affinities of the D523 and D525 for Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and hypothesize that this results from knock-on mechanisms in the inward, but not outward, direction.</p><p><italic>The previous review asked about the unbinding of Ca, given the initial claim that inward current was unimpeded, and about whether the slow deactivation came from hooked tail currents with a slow rise. However, the rise times on tail currents were not addressed and neither is the profound difference in tail current deactivation times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</italic></p><p>Thank you for clarifying your question. Currents from Kv3.1b (Labro et al. 2015) and Kv11 (as reviewed in Vandenberg et al. 2012) channels have ‘hooked tail currents’ with a slow rise time which increases from 1-10 ms over hyperpolarizing potentials. For PKD-L1, we do not see hooked tail currents. We expand the tail currents from Wt and mutant channels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> (Previously <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) to examine the rise time. From the expanding time scale, we can see that the rise time (time to peak) is within 120 μs and does not vary with membrane potential. Thus if PKD2-L1 has a fast inactivation kinetic, it is faster than we can voltage clamp the membrane. We have included a statement discussing the rise time of the tail in the second paragraph of the Results section. Note that speed of the maximum tail current is approaching the upper limit of the speed of the voltage clamp (on average 57 μs; with R<sub>s</sub> = 7.1 mΩ compensated at 60% and Cm = 13.4 pF).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13413.019</object-id><label>Author Response Image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13413.019">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13413.019</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-13413-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig></p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> (previously <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), the speed of deactivation (decay of tail currents) is highly variable at -60 mV for all the charge carriers tested. When the data is summarized, there is no statistical difference between the time courses of deactivation for charge carriers for each mutant. The deactivation tail current kinetics are slightly faster in presence of K<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> compared to sodium. The exemplars are representative of the data set.</p><p>Regarding the profound differences in tail current decay: If the reviewer is referring to the differences between the Wt and filter mutant deactivation, then yes, we agree there is a 20x difference between the Wt and D523N mutant. We propose that the increased deactivation might be due to the differences in the affinity of D523 for inwardly passing ions. Asparagine is less electronegative than glutamate, and we proposed that this substitution allows cations to move more rapidly though the filter than in Wt channels – thus the channel closes faster. This implies that channel deactivation can be influenced by ion occupancy. This hypothesis is discussed in the last paragraph of the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding is described as irreversible (Results, second paragraph, Discussion, third and last paragraphs), but the model of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> has a Ca-bound open-blocked state as well as a Ca-bound inactivated state, which obliquely suggests that the tails do indeed come from knock-off and that inactivation is a separate transition, although no supporting analyses were included (although they may be present in the data).</italic></p><p>Each of the lines below discusses the process of long-term <italic>inactivation</italic> (irreversible on the time scale of the recordings) and occurs after I<sub>Ca</sub> blockade. We cannot examine the kinetics between the blocked inactivated state and the long-term inactivated state.</p><p>“Under more physiological conditions ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> = 2 mM; ~100 nM free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, buffered with 5 mM BAPTA), we patch clamped PKD2-L1 expressing HEK293T cells, applied voltage ramps (-100 mV to +100 mV) and observed current potentiation followed by complete and apparently irreversible <underline>inactivation</underline> over an 8 min. time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> A, B).”</p><p>“Once occupied by outwardly moving calcium ions, the PKD2-L1 channels irreversibly <underline>inactivates</underline> in seconds (τ = 2.1 s).”</p><p>“Outwardly moving calcium ions rapidly block the open channel state (O<sub>block</sub>) and trigger a slower long-term <underline>inactivation</underline> process (K<sub>2</sub>).

It was not clear to all the reviewers that two states might exist and may likewise not be clear to readers.
