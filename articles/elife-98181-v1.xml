Activation of astrocytes is often accompanied by a glycolysis-dominant metabolic switch. However, the role and molecular mechanism of metabolic reprogramming in activation of astrocytes have not been clarified. Here, we found that PKM2, a rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, displayed nuclear translocation in astrocytes of EAE (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis) mice, an animal model of multiple sclerosis. Prevention of PKM2 nuclear import by DASA-58 significantly reduced the activation of mice primary astrocytes, which was observed by decreased proliferation, glycolysis and secretion of inflammatory cytokines. Most importantly, we identified the ubiquitination-mediated regulation of PKM2 nuclear import by ubiquitin ligase TRIM21. TRIM21 interacted with PKM2, promoted its nuclear translocation and stimulated its nuclear activity to phosphorylate STAT3, NF-κB and interact with c-myc. Further single-cell RNA sequencing and immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that TRIM21 expression was upregulated in astrocytes of EAE. TRIM21 overexpressing in mice primary astrocytes enhanced PKM2-dependent glycolysis and proliferation, which could be reversed by DASA-58. Moreover, intracerebroventricular injection of a lentiviral vector to knockdown TRIM21 in astrocytes or intraperitoneal injection of TEPP-46, which inhibit the nuclear translocation of PKM2, effectively decreased disease severity, CNS inflammation and demyelination in EAE. Collectively, our study provides novel insights into the pathological function of nuclear glycolytic enzyme PKM2 and ubiquitination-mediated regulatory mechanism that are involved in astrocyte activation. Targeting this axis may be a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of astrocyte-involved neurological disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Pyruvate kinase M2</kwd><kwd>astrocyte</kwd><kwd>TRIM21</kwd><kwd>experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis</kwd><kwd>ubiquitination</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82071348</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yan</surname><given-names>Yaping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100017596</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2023-JC-JQ-64</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yan</surname><given-names>Yaping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012226</institution-id><institution>Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GK202304034</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Yang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cell biology and animal model analysis in mice shows that molecules involved in glycolytic metabolism could potentially serve as therapeutic targets for the treatment of neurological diseases.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the CNS, which accounts for the leading cause of neurological disability in young adults. The hallmarks of this disease is varied and complex, ranging from astrocyte proliferation, microglia activation, neuroinflammation and damage to myelin sheaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kuhlmann et al., 2023</xref>). Accumulating evidence suggests the critical roles of neurons in MS pathology. However, with the deepening of research, local glia cells have been shown to potentiate inflammation and lead to neurodegeneration, among which astrocytes have attracted much attention with their diverse functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lee et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Astrocytes are the most abundant type of glia cells and provide physical, structural, and metabolic support for neurons. Astrocytes respond to CNS diseases through a process of activation that encompasses cell proliferation, morphological, molecular and functional modifications. This phenomenon, also termed reactive astrocyte or astrogliosis, results in loss of brain homeostatic functions and leads to the occurrence of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Verkhratsky et al., 2023</xref>). The presence of activated astrocytes which is evidenced by increased GFAP staining, was found before immune cell infiltration in MS and its animal model, EAE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Correale and Farez, 2015</xref>). Several lines of evidence bolster the conception that activated astrocytes are considered to be early events and contributors to lesion development in MS and EAE etiopathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">das Neves et al., 2021</xref>). With the accepted notion of astrocyte contributions to MS or EAE, mounting interest has been focused on dissecting how astrocytes are reactive.</p><p>Activated immune cells, like cancer cells, require higher biosynthetic and energy needs for immune response, proliferation, and survival. This involves reprogramming of their metabolic pathways. Proinflammatory immune cells, including reactive astrocytes, usually undergo a metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation to Warburg-type glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Vaupel and Multhoff, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Xiong et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, elevated level of aerobic glycolysis has been characterized in astrocyte of MS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afzal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nijland et al., 2015</xref>). Elevated glycolysis is crucial for sustaining astrocyte proliferation, the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and neurotrophic factors and subsequent neuronal loss in the CNS. As such, deciphering glycolysis-dominant metabolic switch in astrocytes is the basis for understanding astrogliosis and the development of neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">das Neves et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Xiong et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), a rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, is a key molecule that governs aerobic glycolysis. Low glycolytic enzyme activity of PKM2 promotes the conversion of pyruvate to lactate, which leads to aerobic glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lee et al., 2022</xref>). In the cytoplasm, PKM2 exists in tetrameric form and possesses high pyruvate kinase activity. Specifically, PKM2 can translocate to the nucleus in its dimeric form. With a low-glycolytic function, nuclear PKM2 can act as a protein kinase or transcriptional coactivator to regulate proliferation, inflammation, and metabolic reprogramming of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). The overexpression and nuclear translocation of PKM2 have been well documented in CNS disease. Moreover, nuclear PKM2 was upregulated in neutrophils and macrophages in patients with ischemic stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dhanesha et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2022a</xref>). Nuclear PKM2 in neurons was shown to promote neuronal loss in Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Traxler et al., 2022</xref>), suggesting that PKM2 is a key player in the development of neurological disease. Although previous studies have suggested that PKM2 could regulate astrocyte proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>), its potential function in astrocyte metabolic reprogramming and the upstream mechanisms underlying PKM2 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling are still elusive.</p><p>TRIM21 belongs to the TRIM protein family which possess the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. In addition to its well-recognized function in antiviral responses, emerging evidences have documented the multifaceted role of TRIM21 in cell cycle regulation, inflammation, and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2022a</xref>). Nevertheless, the precise mechanisms underlying the involvement of TRIM21 in CNS diseases remain largely unexplored.</p><p>In this report, we identified TRIM21 as the interacting protein of PKM2 and found that TRIM21 promoted the nuclear translocation of PKM2, thus contributing to astrocyte glycolysis and proliferation in EAE. Most importantly, we used the EAE model to demonstrate that targeting TRIM21-PKM2 axis alleviated the disease process. Our finding might help to understand the mechanism underlying astrocyte activation in neurological diseases and provide therapeutic target for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of PKM2 nuclear translocation in astrocytes during EAE</title><p>EAE is widely used as a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, which is typically induced by active immunization with different myelin-derived antigens along with adjuvants such as pertussis toxin (PTX). One widely used antigen is the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) <sub>35-55</sub> peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nitsch et al., 2021</xref>), which was adopted in our current studies. To investigate whether PKM2 repositioning or aberrant expression drives astrocyte dysfunction in EAE mice, we obtained tissue samples from the spinal cords of different phases of EAE and control mice. Initially, nuclear translocation of PKM2 was observed at the onset phase, which sustained to the peak and chronic phases of the disease. Compared to the cytoplasmic localization of PKM2 in control mice, the expression level and nuclear ratio of PKM2 was elevated in different phases of EAE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Supernatant of MOG<sub>35-55</sub>-stimulated splenocytes isolated from EAE mice were previously shown to elicit a T-cell response in the acute stage of EAE and are frequently used as an in vitro autoimmune model to investigate MS and EAE pathophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Du et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kozela et al., 2015</xref>). To validate the expression pattern of PKM2 in astrocytes in vitro, primary astrocytes were isolated and cultured with supernatants from MOG<sub>35-55</sub>-stimulated splenocytes (MOG<sub>sup</sub>) of EAE. Activated astrocytes were observed following co-culture with the above-mentioned supernatant, showing obviously increased expression of GFAP, a marker of reactive astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Consistently, compared to non-treated control astrocytes, MOG<sub>sup</sub>-stimulated astrocytes displayed significantly higher nuclear ratio and expression levels of PKM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

To explore the contribution of PKM2 nuclear translocation to the alternation of astrocyte metabolism and function, DASA-58, the inhibitor of PKM2 nuclear transport that favors its tetramerization was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Palsson-McDermott et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rao et al., 2022</xref>).

As expected, MOG<sub>sup</sub> stimulation, which mimics the autoimmune response in MS patients, induced an increase in the glycolytic activity of astrocytes, as evidenced by glucose consumption and lactate production. However, these effects were significantly counteracted by DASA-58 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). To further confirm these result, glycolysis-related enzymes and transcription factors including LDHA, PKM2 and c-myc were examined.

As nuclear PKM2 has been reported to interact with STAT3 and NF-κB, which are dominant signaling pathways involved in orchestrating cell proliferation, inflammation and glycolysis, we were curious to investigate whether nuclear PKM2 regulates the activation of these two pathways. The activation of STAT3 and NF-κB requires two critical steps: phosphorylation of key components, nuclear translocation and retention of STAT3 or p65/p50 subunits. MOGsup stimulation increased the phosphorylation of STAT3 and NF-κB pathways. As expected, DASA-58 pretreatment partially attenuated the phosphorylation of STAT3 and NF-κB pathways following MOG<sub>sup</sub> stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>).

Phosphorylation only contributes to the transient activation of STAT3 and NF-κB, and constant activation also requires the nuclear retention of STAT3 and p50/p65.

To illustrate underlying mechanism accounting for nuclear translocation of PKM2 in astrocytes, we sought to identify PKM2-interacting proteins. Here, unstimulated and MOG<sub>sup</sub>-stimulated primary astrocytes were subjected to PKM2 immunoprecipitation, followed by mass spectrometry. Several enzymes involved in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis including ENO1, ALDOA, MDH2, LDHA, and LDHC were identified to be interacted with PKM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Analysis of biological processes according to Gene Ontology (GO) terms confirmed that the binding proteins of PKM2 are enriched in metabolic processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Moreover, the results of KEGG and Wikipathway enrichment analysis indicate that PKM2-interacting proteins were enriched in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and NF-κB pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). Amongst these potential interacting proteins, the most attracting one is TRIM21, an E3 ligase involved in the process of ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Coincidentally, we previously reported the proinflammatory role of TRIM21 in keratinocytes by ubiquitylating the p50/p65 subunits of NF-κB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). We were curious to verify whether TRIM21 interacted with and regulated the subcellular localization of PKM2 in astrocytes. Molecular docking revealed a strong binding affinity between PKM2 and TRIM21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, left). TRIM21 is predicted to bound to PKM2 via hydrogen bonds between the amino acids of the two molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, right). By immunoprecipitation assays, we demonstrated the endogenous binding of PKM2 with TRIM21 in primary astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). To further confirm the results of PKM2-TRIM21 interaction, plasmids of Myc-tagged TRIM21 and Flag-tagged PKM2 were constructed. Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation with either Myc or Flag antibodies verified exogenous binding between PKM2 and TRIM21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref>). To map the binding domains between PKM2 and TRIM21, a series of truncation with deletion (Δ) of various domains of TRIM21 and PKM2 were constructed. The deletion of C-terminal PRY-SPRY domain abolished the binding between TRIM21 to PKM2, which indicated that PRY-SPRY domain of TRIM21 was responsible for the interaction with PKM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). However, the deletion of either N- or C-terminal of PKM2 did not affect the binding between TRIM21 to PKM2, indicating that AB domain (44–388 amino acids) of PKM2 might interact with TRIM21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Identification of interaction between E3 ligase TRIM21 and PKM2 in astrocytes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mass spectrometry (MS) showed the list of metabolic-related proteins that potentially interact with PKM2 in unstimulated (Ctl) and MOG<sub>sup</sub>-stimulated primary astrocytes.

We were curious to investigate whether TRIM21 is involved in this process. Notably, fractionation analysis revealed that overexpression of TRIM21 increased the nuclear accumulation of c-myc, STAT3 and p50/p65 subunits. Conversely, pretreatment with DASA-58, which abrogated the nuclear translocation of PKM2, diminished the nuclear retention of the aforementioned transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).

TEPP-46 is a selective allosteric activator for PKM2, showing little or no effect on other pyruvate isoforms. It promotes the tetramerization of PKM2, thereby diminishing its nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anastasiou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angiari et al., 2020</xref>).

Preferential metabolic switch toward aerobic glycolysis favors astrocyte transfer from ‘resting’ to ‘reactive’ state. Thus, deciphering the mechanism responsible for astrocyte metabolic switch in response to neurological disease will provide new insights and new therapeutic targets for CNS diseases. Previous studies have identified nuclear translocation of PKM2 in astrocytes following spinal cord injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>) and in a chronic inflammatory pain model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wei et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting PKM2’s regulatory role in aerobic glycolysis and proliferation. However, in EAE model of multiple sclerosis, whether astrocytes display PKM2 nuclear translocation and the causal mechanisms involved are still unclarified. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to document the nuclear translocation of PKM2 in astrocytes of EAE. Furthermore, we clarified a ubiquitination-mediated regulation of PKM2 nuclear transport. Specifically, we observed an increased expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM21 in astrocytes from EAE mice, which promotes the nuclear translocation of PKM2, thus enhancing astrocyte activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Schematic proposal of nuclear translocation of PKM2 in astrocytes of EAE.</title><p>In astrocyte of EAE mice, TRIM21 expression is upregulated.

Thus, TRIM21-PKM2 pathway exerts a potential role in activating astrocytes and inducing EAE development.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-98181-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Among the PTMs that regulate expression and localization of PKM2, phosphorylation is the most frequently reported type. However, it remains less understood whether ubiquitination could serve as a potential regulator. Ubiquitin-mediated degradation of PKM2 has been reported. Recently, in ovarian cancer, E3 ligase CHIP was shown to directly interact with PKM2 and mediate its degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shang et al., 2017</xref>). TRIM family E3 ligase TRIM35 was previously shown to mediate the degradation of PKM2 in cardiomyocytes and breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lorenzana-Carrillo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wu et al., 2022</xref>). Although laforin/malin E3 ligase-induced ubiquitination of PKM2 did not lead to its degradation, ubiquitination in this case impaired its nuclear transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Viana et al., 2015</xref>). Different from these findings, it should be emphasized that our study adds to the current knowledge that ubiquitination, in addition to SUMOylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>) and phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yang et al., 2012</xref>), could induce the relocalization of PKM2 in the nucleus.</p><p>TRIM21 is found in our study to interact with and ubiquitylate PKM2. As a traditional E3 ubiquitin ligase, multiple key molecules involved in metabolism, immunity and inflammation have been recognized as substrates of TRIM21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2022b</xref>). In addition to the well-known function of TRIM21 in inflammation, an increasing number of studies have suggested that TRIM21 plays a regulatory role in glucose metabolism. Glycolytic-related enzymes including PFK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tang et al., 2022</xref>), GLUT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gu et al., 2022</xref>) and glycolysis-related transcription factor HIF-1α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2021</xref>) were identified to be substrates of TRIM21, and TRIM21 mediated the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of these proteins, thereby inhibiting aerobic glycolysis. Hereby, we recognized PKM2 as an interacting protein of TRIM21, and further studies are required to determine if it is a substrate of E3 ligase TRIM21. The fate of the ubiquitinated protein varies greatly, depending on the linkage type present in the ubiquitin chain. Here, we found that TRIM21 promoted K63-linked ubiquitination of PKM2, the second common type of linkage that is typically not associated with protein degradation. These findings imply that enzymes and proteins implicated in glycolysis are potential substrates of TRIM21, further suggesting that TRIM21 as a regulator of glycolysis. The limitation of the current study is the lack of mechanistic insight into the signaling pathways resulting in TRIM21 upregulation in EAE. Future studies are needed to investigate whether TRIM21 is also elevated in other CNS diseases.</p><p>The growing body of literature shows that nuclear translocation of PKM2 are related to the pathogenesis of diverse CNS diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, ischemic stroke, glioblastoma, and spinal cord injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dhanesha et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Traxler et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Specifically, in ischemic stroke, upregulation of nuclear PKM2 in neutrophils has been observed in both human and mouse models. Application of ML-265 (TEPP-46) to inhibit nuclear translocation of PKM2 improved stroke outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dhanesha et al., 2022</xref>). In agreement with these findings, our study revealed that nuclear PKM2 levels in astrocytes are increased in different stages of EAE. Similarly, TEPP-46 treatment mitigated EAE development. Previous study demonstrated the ability of TEPP-46 in inhibiting PKM2 nuclear translocation and glycolysis in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and showed its therapeutic effect in limiting inflammation in EAE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angiari et al., 2020</xref>). In addition to the previous observed effect of TEPP-46 in the peripheral immune system in EAE, our study highlights the potential role of TEPP-46 in the central immune system. Glial cell activation and demyelination were inhibited following TEPP-treatment in EAE models. Our findings reveal that astrocyte PKM2 nuclear translocation contributes to astrocyte glycolysis and activation, offering insights into PKM2’s pivotal role in other astrocyte-associated CNS diseases.</p><p>Although our study shed light on the role of PKM2 in astrocytes, whether PKM2 functions in a cell-specific manner or acts as a generalist warrants further studies. For example, microglia activation is a key step that contributes to CNS disorders such as multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Long et al., 2024</xref>). Activated M1 microglial cells exhibit a metabolic switch toward aerobic glycolysis similar to that of astrocytes. Thus, it is highly possible that PKM2 may also be involved in microglia metabolic change and activation. As such, PKM2 might be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of CNS disease. However, further studies are needed to decipher the role of nuclear localized PKM2 in different cells under pathological conditions to provide a thorough understanding of the biological functions of PKM2.</p><p>In the nucleus, PKM2 regulates gene expression by acting as a transcriptional co-activator or protein kinase. PKM2 is shown to interact with and phosphorylate STAT3 in cancer cells, immune cells and keratinocytes (Chen C. et al., 2022, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>). In addition to regulating cell proliferation and T cell differentiation, STAT3 directly and indirectly modulates genes linked to glucose metabolism, particularly glycolysis. STAT3 positively regulates the expression of HIF-1α and MYC, two crucial promoters of Warburg effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tošić and Frank, 2021</xref>). Moreover, STAT3 directly regulates the glycolysis-related genes by binding to the promoter of <italic>Slc2a1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 2022b</xref>). Aligning with these findings, our results reveal that PKM2 interacts with and phosphorylates STAT3, thereby providing a rationale for the proliferation and enhanced glycolysis observed in astrocytes of EAE. Additionally, we also identified other transcriptional factors, such as p65-NF-κB, that interact with PKM2. Given the crucial role of NF-κB in inflammation, further research is needed to determine if PKM2-p65 is involved in astrocyte inflammation.</p><p>In addition to identifying the contribution of TRIM21 to PKM2 nuclear translocation and TRIM21-PKM2 axis in promoting astrocyte glycolysis and proliferation, the therapeutic effect of TRIM21 in EAE was also tested. By using lentivirus with astrocyte-specific GFAP promoter, the knockdown of TRIM21 in astrocytes has been successfully achieved. This approach by using lentivirus to deliver shRNA into astrocytes has been previously reported by our group, in which shAct1 lentivirus showed potency for the treatment of EAE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yan et al., 2012</xref>). In the presented study, we showed that blocking TRIM21 pathway effectively ameliorated disease severity of EAE, which is evidenced by the reduced inflammation, demyelination, activation of astrocytes and microglia. Moreover, the in vivo effect of TRIM21 on promoting the nuclear translocation of PKM2 were verified, as evidenced by the observed inhibition of PKM2 nuclear immunostaining in astrocytes in shTRIM21-treated EAE mice. Our in vivo results suggested that targeting TRIM21-PKM2 is a promising approach for clinical treatment of multiple sclerosis. However, whether TRIM21-PKM2 could potentially serve as therapeutic targets in multiple sclerosis warrants further studies.</p><p>In conclusion, our study revealed that PKM2 nuclear translocation is the key mechanism accounting for glycolysis-dominant metabolic switch and proliferation of astrocytes. We propose a post-translational modification mechanism for the regulation of PKM2 nuclear translocation by the ubiquitin ligase TRIM21. From the perspective of metabolism, our study provides a rationale for targeting glycolysis metabolism to ameliorate astrocyte-mediated CNS diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal experiments</title><p>Eight-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were obtained and kept in the animal center of Shaanxi Normal university.

This study shows that the glycolytic enzyme PKM2 relocates to astrocyte nuclei upon activation in EAE mice. Inhibiting PKM2's nuclear import reduces astrocyte activation, as evidenced by decreased proliferation, glycolysis, and inflammatory cytokine release. Crucially, the study identifies TRIM21 as pivotal in regulating PKM2 nuclear import via ubiquitination. TRIM21 interacts with PKM2, promoting its nuclear translocation and enhancing its activity, affecting multiple signaling pathways. Confirmatory analyses using single-cell RNA sequencing and immunofluorescence demonstrate TRIM21 upregulation in EAE astrocytes. Modulating TRIM21 expression in primary astrocytes impacts PKM2-dependent glycolysis and proliferation. In vivo experiments targeting this mechanism effectively mitigate disease severity, CNS inflammation, and demyelination in EAE.</p><p>The authors supported their claims with various experimental approaches, however, some results should be supported with higher-quality images clearly depicting the conclusions and additional quantitative analyses of Western blots.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the reviewer’s comments.

Moreover, we have added quantitative analyses of Western blots for some key experiments, for example quantitative results for Fig.2D is added in Fig.S3 to show the change of PKM2 and p-c-myc in DASA-58-treated conditions and quantitative results for Fig. 3D are added in Fig.S4B and S4C to show the change of nuclear and cytoplasmic PKM2, STAT3 and NF-κB in different conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Strength:</p><p>This study presents a comprehensive investigation into the function and molecular mechanism of metabolic reprogramming in the activation of astrocytes, a critical aspect of various neurological diseases, especially multiple sclerosis. The study uses the EAE mouse model, which closely resembles MS. This makes the results relevant and potentially translational. The research clarifies how TRIM21 regulates the nuclear import of PKM2 through ubiquitination by integrating advanced techniques. Targeting this axis may have therapeutic benefits since lentiviral vector-mediated knockdown of TRIM21 in vivo significantly reduces disease severity, CNS inflammation, and demyelination in EAE animals.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their positive and constructive comments on the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The authors reported that PKM2 levels are elevated in the nucleus of astrocytes at different EAE phases compared to cytoplasmic localization. However, Figure 1 also shows elevated cytoplasmic expression of PKM2. The authors should clarify the nuclear localization of PKM2 by providing zoomed-in images. An explanation for the increased cytoplasmic PKM2 expression should provided. Similarly, while PKM2 translocation is inhibited by DASA-58, in addition to its nuclear localization, a decrease in the cytoplasmic localization of PKM2 is also observed. This situation brings to mind the possibility of a degradation mechanism being involved when its nuclear translocation of PKM2 is inhibited.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the results of immunofluorescence staining of PKM2 in spinal cord of EAE mice and in cultured primary astrocytes, in addition to the observation of PKM2 nuclear translocation in EAE conditions, we showed an elevated expression of PKM2 in astrocytes, including the cytoplasmic and nuclear expression. In neurological diseases, various studies showed consistent results, for example, following spinal cord injury (SCI), not only the upregulated expressing of PKM2 but also nuclear translocation was observed in astrocytes (Zhang et al., 2015). In EAE conditions, CNS inflammation is elevated and several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines might contribute to the upregulated expression of PKM2 in astrocytes. We have tested TNFα and IL-1β, which are recognized to play important roles in EAE and MS (Lin and Edelson, 2017, Wheeler et al., 2020), and results from western blots showed the increased expression of PKM2 upon stimulation with TNFα and IL-1β (Author response image 1).

The western blot results for the MOG-stimulated group show high levels of STAT3, p50, and p65 in nuclear localization. However, in the MOG and DASA-58 treated group, one would expect high levels of p50, p65, and STAT3 proteins in the cytoplasm, while their levels decrease in the nucleus. These western blot results could be expanded. Additionally, intensity quantification for these results would be beneficial to see the statistical difference in their expressions, especially to observe the nuclear localization of PKM2.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s comments and we have incorporated the quantification of STAT3，p50 and p65 for Fig.3D and Fig.S4B and Fig.S4C.

While considering the use of TRIM21 as a target for treating multiple sclerosis in clinical trials, several issues need to be addressed to ensure the safety, efficacy and feasibility. One such aspect is the development of drug that specifically target TRIM21 in brain, capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier and have minimal off-target effects. The translation of preclinical finding into clinical trials poses a significant challenge. To provide evidence for the similarities between the EAE model and multiple sclerosis, we have screened GEO databases (Author response image 3). In GSE214334 which analyzed transcriptional profiles of normal-appearing white matter from non-MS and different subtypes of disease (RRMS, SPMS and PPMS). Although no statistical difference was observed among different groups, the TRIM21 expression has tendency to increase in SPMS (secondary progressive MS) and PPMS (primary progressive MS) patients. In GSE83670, astrocytes from 3 control white matter and 4 multiple sclerosis normal appearing white matter (NAWM) were analyzed. TRIM21 mRNA expression is higher in MS group (78.73 ± 10.44) compared to control group (46.67 ± 24.15).

It is obvious that TRIM21 functions as ubiquitin ligases and its substrate are various. Here we identify PKM2 as one of its interacting proteins and our focus is the relationship between TRIM21 and the nuclear translocation PKM2, we have used diverse experiments to clarify their relationships, for example immunoprecipitation, western blotting, immunofluorescence, cyto-nuclear protein extraction. These aforementioned experiments are key points of our studies. From the results of in vitro experiments, targeting either TRIM21 or PKM2 might be potential targets for EAE treatment. Expectedly, from in vivo experiments, either targeting TRIM21 or PKM2 nuclear transport ameliorated EAE. In order to test the relationship of TRIM21 and PKM2 nuclear transport in vivo, we have stained PKM2 in shVec and shTRIM21-treated mice. Expectedly, knocking down TRIM21 led to a decrease in the nuclear staining of PKM2 in spinal cord astrocytes in EAE models (Figure S7A). This observation underscores that the therapeutic potential of inhibiting TRIM21 in astrocytes in vivo might be partially due to its role in triggering the reduced nuclear translocation of PKM2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some experimental settings are not described to a level that is necessary to fully understand the data, especially for a non-expert audience: e.g. the EAE model and MOG treatment; action and reference of the different nuclear import inhibitors; use of splenocyte culture medium and the possible effect of non-EAE splenocytes.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the reviewer’s suggestions, we have added more detailed descriptions in the materials and methods section, for example, the use of splenocytes culture medium, mass spectrometry, HE and LFB staining have been added.

Briefly, spleen cells were suspended in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% FBS. Splenocytes were plated in 12-well plates at 1x106 cells/well containing 50 μg/mL MOG35-55 and cultured at 37°C in 5% CO2.

It is surprising that these cells do not bear classical astrocyte morphology in cell culture. How long do you culture astrocytes before treatment? How do you explain their morphological difference?</p></disp-quote><p>Astrocytes were cultured for 2 to 3 weeks which correspond to 2-3 passages before treatment. There are several possible reasons for the morphological differences observed between GFAP+ astrocytes and their classical morphology. Firstly, the cell density. In low-density culture just as shown in Figure 1B, we have observed that astrocytes adopt a more flattened morphology. In high-density cultures, they adopt a stellate shape. Moreover, variations in culture conditions, such as the use of different fetal bovine serum, can also influence the morphology of astrocytes. In addition, the mechanical injury induced by the isolation procedures for astrocytes might contribute to variations in their morphology during in vitro cultivation. In summary, the morphological differences observed in GFAP+ astrocytes in cell culture likely result from a combination of culture conditions, cell density, and mechanical injury occured during astrocyte isolation etc.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Additional verification of reactive astrocytes could be performed by different reactive astrocyte markers, such as GLAST, Sox9, S100ß. Thus, quantitative analysis of activated astrocytes can be done by counting DAPI vs GLAST, Sox9 or S100ß positive cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We really agree with the reviewer that there are other markers of reactive astrocytes such as GLAST, sox9 and S100β. However, numerous evidences support that GFAP is the most commonly used reactive astrocyte markers. Most of the cases, reactive astrocytes undergo GFAP overexpression. GFAP is one the most consistently induced gene in transcriptomic datasets of reactive astrocytes, confirming its usefulness as a reactive marker (Escartin et al., 2019). Thus, we have used GFAP as the marker of astrocyte activation in our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- How you performed quantifications for Figures 1C and 1D should be clearly explained, details are not given.</p></disp-quote><p>Quantification for Figure 1C and 1D were added in the figure legend.

For this reason, DASA-58 is also used as the inhibitor of nuclear translocation of PKM2. In primary BMDMs, LPS induced nuclear PKM2. However, driving PKM2 into tetramers using DASA-58 and TEPP-46 inhibited LPS-induced PKM2 nuclear translocation (Palsson-McDermott et al., 2015).

Observing the representative images suggests a notable increase in PKM2 levels, particularly within the nucleus of MOG35-725 55-induced EAE mice. However, to provide a more comprehensive analysis, it would be beneficial for the authors to include statistical data, such as average intensities {plus minus} standard deviation (SD), along with the nuclear PKM2 ratio, akin to the presentation for cultured primary astrocytes in vitro in panels B-D. Additionally, the authors should clearly specify the number of technical repeats and the total number of animals utilized for these data sets to ensure transparency and reproducibility of the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the reviewer’s suggestion.

The control means non-treated primary astrocytes cultured with traditional DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS. In fact, we have performed experiments to exclude the possibility that the observed effect of MOGsup on the activation of astrocytes is from cytokines secreted by splenocytes. Splenocytes from normal (non-EAE) mice were isolated, cultured in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% FBS for 60 hours, and supernatant was collected. Immunofluorescence staining of PKM2 and GFAP were performed in non-treated primary astrocytes and astrocytes stimulated with supernatant from control splenocytes. As shown in Figure S1C, in both groups, no difference was observed in PKM2 expression and localization, PKM2 was located mainly in the cytoplasm in theses conditions. These results indicate that observed effect of PKM2 in MOGsup-stimulated condition is not due to the cytokines secreted from splenocytes. Thus, we used non-treated primary astrocytes as controls in our study. To clarify the control group, we have revised the description in the figure legend, The revised expression is as follows: “Immunofluorescence staining of PKM2 (green) with GFAP (red) in non-treated primary astrocytes (control) or primary astrocytes cultured with splenocytes supernatants of MOG35–55-induced EAE mice (MOGsup) for different time points (6 h, 12 h and 24 h). ”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 3D: the presence of PMK2 in the nuclear fraction upon MOGSUP together with the DASA-58 (last lane of Figure 3D) is not supporting the hypothesis proposed and further may indicate that the reduction of pSTAT3, pp65, etc. observed is independent of PMK2 nuclear translocation/astrocyte activation being observed even in absence of MOGSUP.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this problem in manuscript. The representing image of nuclear level of PKM2 in Figure 3D is not obvious, as shown by figure 3D, which has raised doubts among the reviewers. To strengthen our conclusion that the reduction of STAT3 and p65 pathway is related to the inhibited nuclear level of PKM2 induced by DASA-58, nuclear PKM2 level was quantified and added in Figure S4B. From the quantification results, it is evident that DASA-58 administration decreased the nuclear level of PKM2 in MOGsup-stimulated astrocytes.

However, the accuracy of this predication can be influenced by the different models of 3D structures of TRIM21 and PKM2, as well as by factors such as post-translational modifications and flexibility of the proteins. Proteins in vivo are subject to post-translational modifications that can affect their interactions. These modifications are not fully captured in molecular docking analysis. For example, in our analysis, the predicted N-terminal Phe23 and Thr87 in TRIM21 hold the potential to interact with PKM2 by hydrogen bonds. However, such binding can be influenced by diverse biological environments, such as different cells and pathological conditions. Molecular docking predication may suggest the specific residues and binding pocked within the protein complex, however, the accuracy should be verified by experimental techniques such as immunoprecipitation. To address the predication results of molecular docking, the description has been revised as follows: “TRIM21 is predicted to bound to PKM2 via hydrogen bonds between the amino acids of the two molecules.”</p><p>Co-immunoprecipitation that involves the use of truncated domains of TRIM21 and PKM2, is an experimental technique relies on the specific interaction between antibody and targeted proteins. This technique can provide insights into the precise binding domains between TRIM21 and PKM2. As demonstrated in our study, PRY-SPRY domain of TRIM21 is involved in this binding. In summary, while molecular docking and Co-IP are valuable tools for studying protein-protein interactions, their differing focus and limitations may result in discrepancies between the predicted interaction sites and the experimentally identified interaction domains.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The Authors state that PMK2 is a substrate of TRIM21 E3 ligase activity, however, this is not proved: (i) interaction does not imply a ligase-substrate relationship; (ii) the ubiquitination shown in Figure 6C is not performed in denaturing conditions thus the K63-Ub antibody can detect also interacting FLAG-IPed proteins (besides, only a single strong band is seen, not a chain; molecular weights in immunoblot should be indicated); (iii) use of a catalytically inactive TRIM21 would be required as well.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments regarding the limitations of the immunoprecipitation and K63-antibody test, which could not lead to the conclusion that PKM2 is a substrate of TRIM21. To avoid any misunderstandings, we have revised the relevant sentence from “Hereby, we recognized PKM2 as a substrate of TRIM21” to “Hereby, we recognized PKM2 as an interacting protein of TRIM21, and further studies are required to determine if it is a substrate of E3 ligase TRIM21”. Moreover, we have revised the title of the relevant part in the results section, the previous title, “TRIM21 ubiquitylates and promotes the nuclear translocation of PKM2” has been replaced with “TRIM21 promotes ubiquitylation and the nuclear translocation of PKM2”. Moreover, molecular weights for all proteins in western blotting were indicated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) As above, molecular weights should always be indicated in immunoblot.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing out this problem in the figures. Accordingly, we have added the molecular weights for every protein tested in immunoblot.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The authors should describe the EAE mouse model in the text and in the material and methods as it may not be so well known to the entire reader audience, and the basic principle of MOG35-55 stimulation, in order to understand the experimental plan meaning.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments highlighting the importance of clarifying EAE model for a broader understanding of the reader audience. In response, we have described the EAE model both in the text and in the materials and methods section. In the text, the description of EAE model was added at the beginning of the first paragraph in the Results section. The description is as follows: “EAE is widely used as a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, which is typically induced by active immunization with different myelin-derived antigens along with adjuvants such as pertussis toxin (PTX). One widely used antigen is the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) 35-55 peptide (Nitsch et al., 2021), which was adopted in our current studies.”</p><p>We have also added the detailed experimental procedures for EAE induction in the materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) The authors should better explain and give the rationale for the use of splenocytes and why directly activated astrocytes (isolated from the EAE model) cannot be employed to confirm/prove some of the presented data.</p></disp-quote><p>Firstly, splenocytes offer a heterogenous cell population, encompassing T cells and antigen presenting cells (APC), which may better mimic the microenvironment and complex immune responses observed in vivo.</p><p>Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) 35-55 peptide is one widely used antigen for EAE induction. MOG35-55 elicits strong T responses and is highly encephalitogenic. Moreover, MOG35-55 induces T cell-mediated phenotype of multiple sclerosis in animal models. Thus, by isolating splenocytes from the onset stage of EAE mice, which contains APC and effector T cells, followed by stimulation with antigen MOG35-55 in vitro for 60 hours, the T-cell response in the acute stage of EAE diseases could be mimicked in vitro. The supernatant from MOG35-55 stimulated splenocytes has high levels of IFN-γ and IL-17A, which in part mimic the pathological process and environment in EAE, and this technique has been documented in the references (Chen et al., 2009, Kozela et al., 2015).</p><p>Correspondingly, we have revised sentence for the use of MOG35-55 stimulates splenocytes in EAE mice and add the relevant references: “Supernatant of MOG35-55-stimulated splenocytes isolated from EAE mice were previously shown to elicit a T-cell response in the acute stage of EAE and are frequently used as an in vitro autoimmune model to investigate MS and EAE pathophysiology (Chen et al., 2009, Du et al., 2019, Kozela et al., 2015).”</p><p>Secondly, activated astrocytes (isolated from the EAE model) can not be employed for in vitro culture for the following reasons:</p><p>(1) Low cell viability. Compared to embryonic or neonatal mice, adult mice yield a limited number of viable cells. The is mainly because that adult tissues possess less proliferative capacity.</p><p>(2) Disease changes. Astrocytes in EAE mice are exposed to microenvironment including inflammatory cytokines, antigens and other pathological factors. Without this environment, the function and morphology of astrocytes undergo changes, which make it difficult to interpret the results in vitro.</p><p>For these reasons, the in vitro cultured primary astrocytes used the neonatal mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) The authors should indicate the phosphorylation sites they are referring to when analysing p-c-myc, pSTAT3, pp65, etc...</p></disp-quote><p>According to the reviewer’s suggestions, we have added the phosphorylation sites for pSTAT3 (Y705), pp65 (S536), p-c-myc (S62) and pIKK (S176+S180) in the figure panels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Reference of DASA-58 and TEPP-46 inhibitors and their specificity should be given.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the reviewer’s comments, we have added the relevant references for the use of DASA-58 and TEPP-46 as inhibitors of PKM2 nuclear transport. In primary BMDMs, LPS induced nuclear PKM2. However, driving PKM2 into tetramers using DASA-58 and TEPP-46 inhibited LPS-induced PKM2 nuclear translocation (Palsson-McDermott et al., 2015). Consistently, FSTL1 induced PKM2 nuclear translocation was inhibited by DASA-58 in BMDMs (Rao et al., 2022). Accordingly, we have added these references in the manuscript.</p><p>To address the selectivity of TEPP-46 and add the references, the relevant sentence has been revised from “TEPP-46 is an allosteric activator that blocks the nuclear translocation of PKM2 by promoting its tetramerization” to “TEPP-46 is a selective allosteric activator for PKM2, showing little or no effect on other pyruvate isoforms. It promotes the tetramerization of PKM2, thereby diminishing its nuclear translocation (Anastasiou et al., 2012, Angiari et al., 2020).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewing Editor (Recommendations For The Authors):</p><p>The reviewing editor would appreciate it if the original blots from the western blot analysis, which were used to generate the final figures, could be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the reviewing editor’s comment, accordingly, we will add the original blots for the western blots analysis.</p><p>References</p><p>Anastasiou D, Yu Y, Israelsen WJ, Jiang JK, Boxer MB, Hong BS, et al.
