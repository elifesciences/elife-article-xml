relaxation of measures for reducing the number of infections, the waning of immune protection (particularly in high-risk population groups), and the low uptake of new vaccine boosters, forecast new waves of hospitalizations and admission to intensive care units. There is an urgent need for easily implementable and clinically effective Early Warning Scores (EWSs) that can predict the risk of complications within the next 24–48 hr. Although EWSs have been used in the evaluation of COVID-19 patients, there are several clinical limitations to their use. Moreover, no models have been tested on geographically distinct populations or population groups with varying levels of immune protection.</p></sec><sec id="abs2"><title>Methods:</title><p>We developed and validated COVID-19 Early Warning Score (COEWS), an EWS that is automatically calculated solely from laboratory parameters that are widely available and affordable. We benchmarked COEWS against the widely used NEWS2.

The final model included complete blood count, blood glucose, and oxygen saturation features. To make COEWS more actionable in real clinical situations, we transformed the predictive coefficients of the COEWS model into individual scores for each selected feature. The global score serves as an easy-to-calculate measure indicating the risk of a patient developing the combined outcome of mechanical ventilation or death within the next 48 hr.</p><p>The discrimination in the external validation cohort was 0.743 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.703–0.784) for the COEWS score performed with coefficients and 0.700 (95% CI: 0.654–0.745) for the COEWS performed with scores. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was similar in vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. Additionally, we observed that the AUROC of the NEWS2 was 0.677 (95% CI: 0.601–0.752) in vaccinated patients and 0.648 (95% CI: 0.608–0.689) in unvaccinated patients.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The COEWS score predicts death or MV within the next 48 hr based on routine and widely available laboratory measurements.

This situation will add up to a load of work accumulated and the high pressure supported by emergency departments.</p><p>In the midst of this rapidly evolving situation, there is an urgent need for easily implementable and clinically effective decision tools to assist healthcare personnel in their decision-making process. These tools play a crucial role in optimizing the level of care and ensuring the appropriate allocation of resources. In response to this need, numerous predictive models for COVID-19 have been published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Shakeel et al., 2021</xref>), utilizing vital signs and laboratory such as the PRIORITY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Martínez Lacalzada et al., 2021</xref>), or only laboratory results such as the COvid-19 Disease Outcome Predictor (CODOP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Klén et al., 2022</xref>). However, it is important to note that these models primarily focus on predicting complications that may arise during the hospitalization period, which can span from 24 hr up to 7 days. Therefore, when a patient is hospitalized, the utilization of Early Warning Scores (EWSs) is preferable as they predict the risk of complications within the next 24–48 hr. EWS enables standardized and daily evaluation of patients by detecting changes in clinical parameters that precede clinical deterioration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kostakis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Martín Rodríguez et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Although EWS has been used in the evaluation of COVID-19 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aygun and Eraybar, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Huespe et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Sarkar et al., 2022</xref>), there are clinical limitations to its use. For instance, the COVID-19 severity index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Huespe et al., 2021</xref>) employs vital signs, laboratory parameters, and chest X-ray findings to predict the risk of ICU admission within the next 24 hr. However, implementing these scoring systems requires the expertise of experienced healthcare professionals. The NEWS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Royal College of Physicians, 2017</xref>) also evaluates vital signs conducted by healthcare professionals, which may pose challenges during periods of overwhelming demand, and this model. Moreover, no models have been tested on geographically distinct populations or population groups with varying levels of immune protection.</p><p>In this study, we developed and validated, in a multicontinental cohort, COVID-19 Early Warning Score (COEWS): an EWS automatically calculated solely by laboratory parameters of widespread availability and affordability. Additionally, we evaluated the predictive performance of vaccinated and unvaccinated patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Source of data</title><p>For the development and validation of this predictive model, we used data from the Hospital 12 de Octubre (Madrid, Spain) and the Argentinian COVID-19 Network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boietti et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Casas-Rojo et al., 2020</xref>). These registries comprise patients hospitalized between January 2020 and March 2022, with demographic, clinical, and analytical data.</p><p>The use of patient data in this study has received approval from the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of Hospital 12 de Octubre [reference 20/117]. Additionally, the Institutional Review Board of the Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires approved the study for each participating site in the Argentinian COVID-19 Network (Approval Number: #5602). As the present study is a retrospective observational study, it does not involve any procedures or activities beyond the standard consultation and care provided to patients. It poses no additional risks to their health and incurs no extra costs for them or their healthcare coverage. Patient data will be assessed retrospectively through electronic medical records. Considering that this study involves minimal risk due to the handling of participant data, the corresponding ethics committees have granted an exemption from obtaining signed informed consent. This exemption is in accordance with Guideline 10: Modifications and Dispensations of Informed Consent outlined in the CIOMS 2019 guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Participants</title><p>Patients hospitalized with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 who received oxygen therapy were included. COVID infection was defined as a positive result of real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab specimens or sputum samples, also in the second and third waves, some patients were diagnosticated with the Panbio TM COVID-19 rapid test (Abbott) in the Spanish hospitals. We considered only the first hospitalization for COVID-19 for each patient during the study period. Patients were followed from hospital admission until death or hospital discharge.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Outcome and variables</title><p>The aim of this study was the development of an EWS. Therefore, the outcome of the predictive model was death or mechanical ventilation (MV) in the next 48 hr. The potential predictors evaluated were: demographic data, admission vital signs (heart rate, temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and oxygen saturation), and blood test values (hemoglobin in g/dl, percentage lymphocytes, leukocytes in 10³/mm³, platelets in 10³/mm³, and glycemia mg/dl), vaccination status, and clinical variables that were present in all training and test cohorts.

In the training and internal testing database, we used simple imputation with the median values of the training dataset. For the external validation, we consider this missing data as ‘Missing completely at random’ (MCAR) (without systematic differences between the missing values and the observed values, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sterne et al., 2009</xref>), Hence, we performed multiple imputations by the Chained Equations procedure. To reduce the sampling error due to the imputations, we set the number of 20 imputed datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">White et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Sample size</title><p>To build a predictive model with approximately 10 estimated variables, we needed 10–20 outcome events per variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Katz, 2011</xref>). We expected to include between 5 and 10 variables in the model, therefore we need at least 100–200 outcome events per database. Due to the fact that the number of outcomes (death and MV within 48 hr after hospital admission) in each database was higher than 200, we had enough sample size in the training and testing databases.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>COEWS development</title><p>The Spanish database was divided randomly into training (75%) and test (25%) datasets. COEWS was built using stable iterative variable selection (SIVS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mahmoudian et al., 2021</xref>) and linear regression with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) regularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Friedman et al., 2010</xref>). In model building, only the training cohort was used and models were built using 10-fold cross-validation. In the feature selection stage of SIVS, 100 models were built and for each model selected variables were recorded. To reduce the number of features to as few as possible (therefore, increasing the easiness of use of COEWS), we used the weighting function in SIVS (called variable importance scoring) with a threshold of 0.15. This method has been shown to be very efficient, especially when the ratio of positive and negative outcomes is imbalanced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Klén et al., 2019</xref>). Lasso models were built in R Development Core Team, 2010 (version 3.6.0) package glmnet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Friedman et al., 2010</xref>) (version 4.1–1).

The Argentinian database was used for external validation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Transformation of linear predictors to the score</title><p>Based on the final linear Lasso model and clinical insights, the final COEWS score was created. The clinical insights was used to determine the normal range, which gives zero points in the COEWS score. The other scoring ranges with negative and positive points were determined using the coefficients of the final Lasso model by linear interpolation from the COEWS. Especially, the ranges per feature were defined by the magnitude of the corresponding coefficient, and larger absolute values of coefficients yielded shorter ranges.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Discrimination and calibration</title><p>The performance of the developed models was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), and the model’s calibration was evaluated using the root mean square error.

We performed a graph with the average probability of the outcome predicted by the model (average of individual estimated probabilities) and the observed probability (proportion of nonattendance) within each decile stratum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Giunta et al., 2023</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), (<bold>A</bold>) and calibration slopes for training and testing database (<bold>B</bold>).</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-85618-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In order to account for the transformation of model coefficients into a score, we conducted additional evaluations to assess discrimination in each database using the score derived from the coefficients.

To determine the cutoff point for the analysis, we selected July 2021. This decision was based on the publication and implementation of the Recovery Trial indications, which introduced significant therapeutic changes during the pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Horby et al., 2021</xref>).

In order to increase the clinical usefulness of COEWS, we transformed the coefficients of the predictive model and created an easy-to-use score table that can be used without an electronic calculator.</p><p>Although several predictive models of severity in COVID-19 patients have been published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Miller et al., 2022</xref>), they only predict whether the patient will have the outcome during hospitalization, regardless of when the patient will have the outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Miller et al., 2022</xref>), which limits their clinical use during a pandemic situation. In this context, EWS models offer the clinical advantage to predict the outcome of interest in a short time horizon (e.g., the next 24–48 hr). In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, several EWS has been developed and used (NEWS2, NEWS2 with age, Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), and the COVID-19 severity index) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Colombo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Huespe et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Royal College of Physicians, 2017</xref>). However, each of them have clear limitations such as not having a time horizon for prediction in the development, lack of testing in vaccinated versus non-vaccinated patients, and not using MV as a clinical outcome. The latest is necessary because COVID-19 patients also die under MV, and also because the measurement of vital signs that are included in an EWS model, will be altered due to MV and hemodynamic support. In fact, we observed that NEWS2 has poor discrimination when considering this combined outcome (death or MV). In this way, the COEWS score has better discrimination, even in an external cohort of patients from a different continent.</p><p>The COEWS is the first EWS in which the predictive performance in vaccinated and unvaccinated patients has been compared. Even though hospitalized vaccinated patients have more favorable outcomes from unvaccinated patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Busic et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Huespe et al., 2022</xref>), we observed that the predictive performance was similar between patients with and without vaccines. This observation strongly suggests that hospitalized COVID-19 patients show similar clinical and laboratory manifestations when they are going to suffer serious adverse events, independently of their vaccination status.</p><p>Additionally, we found that the COEWS demonstrated good discrimination in patients hospitalized after July 2021. These findings underscore the model’s robustness over time, affirming its potential as a valuable clinical tool. Despite the evolution of therapeutic approaches during the study period, it is important to note that the laboratory and clinical signs of deterioration associated with severe COVID-19 have remained consistent. This consistency further supports the relevance and reliability of the COEWS in identifying patients at risk of severe disease.</p><p>Finally, it is interesting to note that the proportion of vaccinated patients hospitalized in Europe was less than half of that in the Argentinean cohort. This difference may be due to a higher proportion of BIBP-CorV (Beijing Institute of Biological Products; Sinopharm) vaccinations in Argentina, which has been reported to have lower efficacy in reducing hospitalizations compared to the BNT162b2 (Pfizer) vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Momani et al., 2022</xref>). Our team’s recent study also suggests slightly lower efficacy for BIBP-CorV (Beijing Institute of Biological Products; Sinopharm) and Gam-COVID-Vac (Sputnik) vaccines in reducing mortality among hospitalized patients compared to BNT162b2 (Pfizer) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Huespe et al., 2022</xref>). However, investigating the precise reasons behind the disparity in vaccinated hospitalized patients between Spain and Argentina falls beyond the scope of our study. Further research is needed to explore this intriguing finding.</p><p>Our study has unique strengths. First, we have developed an easy and fast triage tool for COVID-19 hospitalized patients that can classify the risk of the patients only using widely available blood tests and without the need for clinical evaluations. Thus, the COEWS score can be added to the Electronic Health Record to automatically calculate the risk of patient deterioration and for recommending the appropriate level of care within a time window of 24–48 hr. Also, COEWS was created with a big and broad (from 2020 to 2022) patient database and externally validated in a even bigger cohort of patients from another continent, which increases the confidence in COEWS performance. Importantly, we evaluated the predictive performance of the score with the coefficients but also with the score transformation, as the transformation of the coefficients in a score makes it easier to use but can reduce the predictive performance. Finally, our study is the first one evaluating the predictive performance of an EWS score in vaccinated and unvaccinated patients.</p><p>This study also has limitations. First, the amount of missingness in some parameters can alter the performance of COEWS. To reduce this effect, we used the MCAR method, which enabled us to perform complete case analysis without selection bias. Also, we used populations from Spain and Argentina, which prompts questions about the validity of our model for non-European nor South American populations. Finally, the datasets of Hospital 12 de Octubre carry a misclassification of some vaccinated patients as some hospitalized patients could have been previously vaccinated in other centers before their hospitalization. However, it is important to note that the misclassification issue primarily applies to patients who were vaccinated toward the end of the cohort follow-up. During the initial vaccination campaigns, all patients in the Hospital 12 de Octubre dataset were indeed vaccinated at their own hospital. This hospital maintains a close cohort due to its coverage area in Madrid. Additionally, we want to emphasize that the misclassification problem did not occur in the Argentinian database, and the results obtained from the vaccinated cohort patients in both countries were extremely similar.</p><p>The extensive external validation, its high performance, its easiness to use and the positive benchmark in comparison with the widely used NEW2, positions COEWS as a new tool of reference for assisting clinical decisions and improving patient care in the upcoming pandemic waves.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Investigation, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Supervision, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Supervision, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Supervision, Investigation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Supervision, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Supervision, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Supervision, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>The SEMI-COVID-19 Registry and the COVID registries of 12 de Octubre and the Costa del Sol hospitals have been approved by the Provincial Research Ethics Committee of Malaga (Spain; C.I.F. number: 0-9150013-B).

In their convincing approach, they integrate sex, SpO2, complete blood count and blood glucose. A score equal to or higher than 6 represents a high risk for the admitted COVID-19 patient in need of oxygen to be intubated or die within 48 hours. The score is tested in a Spanish cohort and validated through a smaller Spanish cohort and a larger Argentinian one. It shows good performance, better than that of NEWS2. Hence the paper is relevant for clinicians.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85618.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Giamarellos-Bourboulis</surname><given-names>Evangelos J</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04gnjpq42</institution-id><institution>National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Medical School</institution></institution-wrap><country>Greece</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Development and validation of an Early Warning System for COVID-19 patients in a multicontinental cohort: The COEWS (COVID-19 Early Warning Score) Score&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jos van der Meer as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>– The most important comment is on the vaccination status of the participants. The vaccination percentages are low in both cohorts. Remarkably, the vaccination rates of the participant patients from Argentina are almost double compared to the rates of the participant patients from Spain. This fact (and perhaps a possible interpretation) should be mentioned in the Discussion section. Despite these percentages, even more important is the issue described in the following two sentences of the manuscript: &quot;Finally, the datasets of Hospital 12 de Octubre carry a misclassification of some vaccinated patients as some hospitalized patients could have been previously vaccinated in other centers before their hospitalization. The lack of a centralized data service makes it impossible to track these patients&quot;. These sentences, subconsciously, give the reader the message &quot;We don't know the vaccination status of the patients of the Spanish cohort&quot; because the uncertainty they contain practically 'cancels' the non-vaccination status of these patients. Theoretically, according to these sentences, all non-vaccinated patients from Hospital 12 de Octubre might have been previously to a different vaccination center.</p><p>– In the introduction, some already existing Early Warning Scores are mentioned (including NEWS2 and CODOP). Is it possible to provide a little more information about these scores and models? It could be quite useful to the reader, even in the form of a table.</p><p>– In the paragraph &quot;Transformation of linear predictors to the Score&quot; the final sentence mentions &quot;The other scoring ranges with negative and positive points were determined using the coefficients of the final Lasso model by linear interpolation from the COEWS&quot;. Can you be more specific, please?</p><p>– In the following paragraph &quot;Discrimination and calibration&quot; a certain graph is described: &quot;We performed a graph with the average probability of the outcome predicted by the model (average of individual estimated probabilities) and the observed probability (proportion of nonattendance) within each decile stratum. Is this the graph of Figure 2b? If so, can this information be included in the manuscript text?</p><p>– Upon the COEWS score as presented in Table 2: The scoring of SpO2 parameter: Why is the classification &quot;&gt;95%&quot; considered as &quot;abnormal&quot;? Is it because, like the NEWS2 score, patients with hypercapnic respiratory insufficiency have (as &quot;standard&quot;) a lower everyday measurement of SpO2? The scoring of Neutrophils (%) parameter: Does it refer to the absolute count of neutrophils (per μL)? (according to the values given in Table 2). The scoring of Platelets parameter: Please be a little more specific about the scaling of the presented platelets values (absolute count, in thousands). Unless typed incorrectly, why is the value of 401000 so significant in order to solely receive one point? (While values of 400000 and 402000 receive zero and two points respectively). The levels of the final score (&quot;The global score&quot;, as mentioned): How are these levels defined? Or, to make this question clearer, what is the percentage of an unlikely event (death or intubation) on each level?</p><p>– Additionally, about the levels of the final score: Is the second level (score of 4-5) also ranked as &quot;Low risk&quot; or can it be classified as &quot;Intermediate&quot;? The color &quot;coding&quot; used (yellow instead of green) differentiates it from the first level (score of 0-3).</p><p>– Why did the authors include only hospitalized patients in need of oxygen?</p><p>– Nothing is mentioned about ICF or the waiver from patients whose data were used.</p><p>– Patient data had a range of 2 years (2020-2022). In this time period much has been learned and much has changed-improved in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Although a sensitivity analysis between unvaccinated and vaccinated patients is welcome, I would perform a sensitivity analysis or even from the beginning split the cohorts according to the waves of the pandemic.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85618.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>– The most important comment is on the vaccination status of the participants.

Indeed, in the Spanish cohort, the proportion was 4.7%, while in the Argentinian cohort, it was 11.4%. This discrepancy is an interesting observation, and we believe it may be attributed to a higher proportion of BIBP-CorV (Beijing Institute of Biological Products; Sinopharm) vaccinations in Argentina. It has been reported that BIBP-CorV has lower efficacy in reducing hospitalizations compared to the BNT162b2 (Pfizer) vaccine. (Al-Momani et al., 2022).</p><p>Furthermore, our recent study conducted by our team suggests slightly lower efficacy for BIBP-CorV and Gam-COVID-Vac (Sputnik) vaccines in reducing mortality among hospitalized patients compared to BNT162b2 (Pfizer). (Huespe et al., 2023). We will include these findings in the Discussion section as recommended by the reviewer. However, we acknowledge that investigating the precise reasons behind the disparity in vaccinated hospitalized patients between Spain and Argentina falls beyond the scope of our study. Further research is needed to explore this intriguing finding and delve deeper into the underlying factors.</p><p>Thank you for bringing up this important point, and we will address it accordingly in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Despite these percentages, even more important is the issue described in the following two sentences of the manuscript: &quot;Finally, the datasets of Hospital 12 de Octubre carry a misclassification of some vaccinated patients as some hospitalized patients could have been previously vaccinated in other centers before their hospitalization.

However, it is important to note that the misclassification issue primarily applies to patients who were vaccinated toward the end of the cohort follow-up. During the initial vaccination campaigns, all patients in the Hospital 12 de Octubre dataset were indeed vaccinated at their own hospital. This hospital maintains a close cohort due to its coverage area in Madrid.</p><p>Additionally, we want to emphasize that the misclassification problem did not occur in the Argentinian database, and the results obtained from the vaccinated cohort patients in both countries were extremely similar.</p><p>We appreciate the reviewer's attention to this matter, and we will provide a more comprehensive explanation of the potential misclassification limitations in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In the introduction, some already existing Early Warning Scores are mentioned (including NEWS2 and CODOP). Is it possible to provide a little more information about these scores and models? It could be quite useful to the reader, even in the form of a table.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer suggestion and we improved the description of these scores in the introduction section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In the paragraph &quot;Transformation of linear predictors to the Score&quot; the final sentence mentions &quot;The other scoring ranges with negative and positive points were determined using the coefficients of the final Lasso model by linear interpolation from the COEWS&quot;. Can you be more specific, please?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment. We have now complemented “The other scoring ranges with negative and positive points were determined using the coefficients of the final Lasso model by linear interpolation from the COEWS.” with clarification “Especially, the ranges per feature were defined by the magnitude of the corresponding coefficient, and larger absolute values of coefficients yielded shorter ranges.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In the following paragraph &quot;Discrimination and calibration&quot; a certain graph is described: &quot;We performed a graph with the average probability of the outcome predicted by the model (average of individual estimated probabilities) and the observed probability (proportion of nonattendance) within each decile stratum. Is this the graph of Figure 2b? If so, can this information be included in the manuscript text?</p></disp-quote><p>We included this information in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Upon the COEWS score as presented in Table 2: The scoring of SpO2 parameter: Why is the classification &quot;&gt;95%&quot; considered as &quot;abnormal&quot;? Is it because, like the NEWS2 score, patients with hypercapnic respiratory insufficiency have (as &quot;standard&quot;) a lower everyday measurement of SpO2? The scoring of Neutrophils (%) parameter: Does it refer to the absolute count of neutrophils (per μL)? (according to the values given in Table 2). The scoring of Platelets parameter: Please be a little more specific about the scaling of the presented platelets values (absolute count, in thousands). Unless typed incorrectly, why is the value of 401000 so significant in order to solely receive one point? (While values of 400000 and 402000 receive zero and two points respectively).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing up these important points regarding the scoring of parameters in the COEWS score as presented in Table 2. We appreciate your observation, and we apologize for the errors in the table. We have carefully reviewed and made the necessary corrections.</p><p>Regarding the SpO2 parameter, a value of &quot;95%&quot; should indeed be classified as normal, and we have rectified this classification accordingly.</p><p>For the Neutrophils parameter, the unit of measure is &quot;x 10³/mm³&quot; or &quot;per cubic millimeter,&quot; and we have clarified this in the revised table.</p><p>Regarding the Platelets parameter, the cutoff point for scoring is 400 x 10³/mm³ or 400,000 platelets per cubic millimeter. Any value above this cutoff receives 1 point. We have also made this clarification in the revised table.</p><p>We apologize for any confusion caused by these misprints and appreciate your attention to detail.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The levels of the final score (&quot;The global score&quot;, as mentioned): How are these levels defined? Or, to make this question clearer, what is the percentage of an unlikely event (death or intubation) on each level?</p></disp-quote><p>The global score, obtained by summing the individual scores, serves as an easy-to-calculate measure indicating the risk of a patient developing the combined outcome of mechanical ventilation or death within the next 48 hours. We established the levels of risk in the final score based on the NEWS 2 Scale: lower risk (less than 10%), moderate risk (10 to 20%), high risk (20 to 30%), and critical risk (higher than 30%). Our aim was to categorize patients into different risk categories based on their likelihood of experiencing the combined outcome.</p><p>To provide a comprehensive understanding of the outcome percentages for each risk level, we examined our cohort and found the following rates:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Patients classified as Low risk had an 8.5% rate of experiencing the outcome.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients classified as moderate risk had an 18.4% rate of experiencing the outcome.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients classified as High risk had a 25.6% rate of experiencing the outcome.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients classified as critical risk had a 43.4% rate of experiencing the outcome.</p></list-item></list><p>These percentages illustrate the increasing likelihood of the outcome as the risk level escalates.</p><p>Thank you for your inquiry, and we improve the explanation of the risk classification in the article.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Additionally, about the levels of the final score: Is the second level (score of 4-5) also ranked as &quot;Low risk&quot; or can it be classified as &quot;Intermediate&quot;? The color &quot;coding&quot; used (yellow instead of green) differentiates it from the first level (score of 0-3).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion caused by the incorrect classification in the manuscript. As the reviewer correctly points out, a score of 4-5 should be classified as a &quot;Moderate risk&quot; rather than &quot;Low risk.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Why did the authors include only hospitalized patients in need of oxygen?</p></disp-quote><p>During the pandemic, particularly in its early stages, there was a tendency to hospitalize mild or asymptomatic patients solely for the purpose of isolation. However, it is important to note that hospitalization for this group of clinically stable patients is not the current standard practice, as hospitalized patients now typically require oxygen therapy. The requirement for oxygen therapy helps standardize the population, ensuring that only patients with moderate or severe COVID-19 are included. This approach aims to exclude patients who might have been admitted to the hospital for social reasons rather than medical necessity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Nothing is mentioned about ICF or the waiver from patients whose data were used.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's comment and agree that it is important to address the issue of informed consent for the use of patient data in our study. Given the retrospective nature of our study, which relied on secondary databases from Spanish and Argentinean registries, it is important to note that the study is exempt from the requirement for informed consent.</p><p>This exemption from obtaining informed consent is in accordance with Guideline 10:</p><p>Modifications and Dispensations of Informed Consent outlined in the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) 2019 guidelines. Furthermore, the use of patient data has been approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of Hospital 12 de Octubre [reference 20/117] for the Spanish cohort. Additionally, institutional review boards approved the use of data at each participating site in the Argentinian COVID-19 Network study, with approval numbers 1575, 5562, and 5606. We will ensure to include a clear statement regarding the exemption from informed consent and the ethical approvals obtained in the revised manuscript to address this important aspect. Thank you for bringing it to our attention.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Patient data had a range of 2 years (2020-2022). In this time period much has been learned and much has changed-improved in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Although a sensitivity analysis between unvaccinated and vaccinated patients is welcome, I would perform a sensitivity analysis or even from the beginning split the cohorts according to the waves of the pandemic.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's suggestion and recognize the importance of considering the changes and improvements in the treatment of COVID-19 patients over time. To address this concern, we performed an additional validation of the COWES score using data from patients hospitalized after July 2021, which aligns with the implementation of significant therapeutic changes as indicated by the publication of the Recovery Trial findings. (RECOVERY Collaborative Group et al., 2021).</p><p>Through this new analysis, we observed a similar predictive value of the COWES score, indicating its robustness across different time periods. Despite the evolving therapeutic approaches, it is noteworthy that the laboratory and clinical signs of deterioration associated with severe COVID-19 have remained consistent. Consequently, the clinical manifestations and predictive factors of severe disease observed in patients were consistent from 2020 to 2022.</p><p>Al-Momani H, Aldajah K, Alda’ajah E, ALjafar Y, Abushawer Z. 2022.
