pandemic continues to infect people worldwide. While the vaccinated population has been increasing, the rising breakthrough infection persists in the vaccinated population. For living with the virus, the dietary guidelines to prevent virus infection are worthy of and timely to develop further. Tannic acid has been demonstrated to be an effective inhibitor of coronavirus and is under clinical trial. Here we found that two other members of the tannins family, oligomeric proanthocyanidins (OPCs) and punicalagin, are also potent inhibitors against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection with different mechanisms. OPCs and punicalagin showed inhibitory activity against omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The water extractant of the grape seed was rich in OPCs and also exhibited the strongest inhibitory activities for viral entry of wild-type and other variants in vitro. Moreover, we evaluated the inhibitory activity of grape seed extractants (GSE) supplementation against SARS-CoV-2 viral entry in vivo and observed that serum samples from the healthy human subjects had suppressive activity against different variants of SARS-CoV-2 Vpp infection after taking GSE capsules. Our results suggest that natural tannins acted as potent inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and GSE supplementation could serve as healthy food for infection prevention.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Since it first surfaced in late 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on people’s lives. While several vaccines have been created, infections have not disappeared. This is largely due to new variants of the virus responsible for the disease (SARS-CoV-2) emerging, which current vaccines do not work as well against. Indeed, several reports suggest that protection from the omicron variant wanes as shortly as four to six months after vaccination. Therefore, other strategies are needed to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections.</p><p>In 2022, researchers discovered that tannic acid blocked two proteins that SARS-CoV-2 needs to enter and replicate inside human cells. Tannic acid is part of the tannin family, which includes natural molecules found in plant-based meals and beverages. Here, Chen et al. – including some of the researchers involved in the 2022 studies – set out to find whether two other tannins found in nature (OPCs and punicalagin) could also inhibit SARS-CoV-2.</p><p>Chen et al. administered tannic acid, OPCs and punicalagin to human cells cultured in a laboratory that had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. This revealed that all three tannins suppress the activity of the same proteins required for viral entry and replication, but to varying degrees suggesting that they block SARS-CoV-2 infections via different mechanisms. The compounds were also able to inhibit different variants of the virus, including omicron, from infecting the lab-grown cells.</p><p>Further experiments revealed that water extracted from seeded grapes, which contains high levels of OPCs, could also block SARS-CoV-2 entry in the cell culture system. To test this further, Chen et al. gave 18 healthy individuals capsules containing different concentrations of grape seed extract and collected samples of their serum. The serum samples suppressed entry of different variants of SARS-CoV-2 in the cell culture system, with serums from subjects that received the higher dose having the greatest effect.</p><p>These findings suggest that naturally occurring tannins can suppress multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2 from entering and replicating in cells. Consuming supplements of grape seed extract could potentially reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, further experiments, including clinical trials, are needed to test this possibility.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>tannins</kwd><kwd>grape seed</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>viral entry</kwd><kwd>COVID19</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100020950</institution-id><institution>National Science and Technology Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NSTC 112-2639-B-039-001 -ASP</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hung</surname><given-names>Mien-Chie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100020950</institution-id><institution>National Science and Technology Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOST 110-2628-B-039-004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peng</surname><given-names>Shin-Lei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taiwan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOHW112-TDU-B-222-124016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hung</surname><given-names>Mien-Chie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010002</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education in Taiwan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>“Cancer Biology and Precision Therapeutics Center, China Medical University&quot;, The Featured Areas Research Center Program, Higher Education Sprout Project</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hung</surname><given-names>Mien-Chie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100020950</institution-id><institution>National Science and Technology Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOST 109-2327-B-039-003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hung</surname><given-names>Mien-Chie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Two natural tannins, oligomeric proanthocyanidins and punicalagin, acted as potent inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and grape seed extract supplementation could serve as a healthy food for infection prevention.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Since its outbreak in late 2019, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has made a significant impact threatening health care to the general livelihood of virtually everybody on earth. In the past year, deep knowledge of the biology of the virus has been unveiled, and effective vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been rolling out to fight the pandemic. However, with this tremendous progress, the pandemic has been resilient and far beyond to be waning down.</p><p>The challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic has become direr with the emergence of a swarm of variants popping out in multiple countries around the globe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Plante et al., 2021</xref>). Some of the variants, such as the alpha variant of the UK lineage B.1.1.7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhou and Wang, 2021</xref>), the closely related beta variant of the South Africa lineage B.1.351 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Plante et al., 2021</xref>), and the gamma variant of the Brazil lineage P.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coutinho et al., 2021</xref>), have higher infection rates and are more deadly than the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Torjesen, 2021</xref>). The delta variant of the India lineage B.1.617.2 was first identified in India in December 2020, rapidly swept across European countries in June 2021, and surged worldwide to become the most predominant SARS CoV-2 variant with increased activity transmissibility compared to other countries' pandemic variants in 2021 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lopez Bernal et al., 2021</xref>). Following the previous mutant strains, Delta infection accounts for the increasing breakthrough cases in fully vaccinated population and &gt;99% of hospitalized cases of COVID-19, sounding the alarm that the mainstay vaccines may not be as efficient as they were expected in protection from virus infection and symptom development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chia et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Riemersma et al., 2021</xref>). After almost 1 y, the newest highly divergent omicron variant of the lineage B.1.1.529 was identified in South Africa, in November 2021, and quickly became the dominant variant around the world in 2022 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mehta et al., 2022</xref>). The omicron variant has &gt;50 mutations relative to the wild-type virus, with 30 nonsynonymous substitutions in the Spike protein, which interacts with human cells for cell entry and that has been the primary target for current vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sun et al., 2022</xref>). The robust immune evasion capability allows the omicron variant to quickly escape from existing mAbs and vaccines and increase the risk of reinfection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ao et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, the dietary guidelines for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection are of high stake.</p><p>Infection by the SARS-CoV-2 starts from the cellular entry of the virus through the interaction between the viral Spike (S) protein with its cell surface receptor ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) and priming of the S protein by the cellular protease TMPRSS2 (transmembrane serine protease 2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoffmann et al., 2020</xref>). Proteolytic processing of the S protein by TMPRSS2 produces S1 and S2 fragments, which remain noncovalently associated. The S1 polypeptide interacts with the ACE2 receptor through the receptor binding domain (RBD), and the S2 polypeptide facilitates the fusion of the virus with the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2020b</xref>). The internalized virus translated its RNA genome into a polypeptide, followed by a highly regulated and coordinated proteolytic processing by the main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>/3CL<sup>pro</sup>), a chymotrypsin-like protease, and cleaves its substrate polypeptides specified by well-defined cleavage sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anand et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hilgenfeld, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yang et al., 2003</xref>). Blocking the maturation process of the viral polyproteins thus abrogates viral replication in host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jin et al., 2020</xref>). Together these viral and cellular proteins constitute promising targets for clinical treatment and prevention of SARS-CoV-2.</p><p>We previously showed that several natural products including the natural polyphenol compound tannic acid are potent inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and M<sup>pro</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wu et al., 2022</xref>). Tannic acid belongs to the unique family of tannins consisting of four subfamilies: hydrolysable tannins, condensed tannins, phlorotannins, and complex tannins. Hydrolysable tannins and condensed tannins are found in terrestrial plants, especially fruits and vegetables, while phlorotannins occur only in brown marine algae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Das et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2018</xref>). Compared to phlorotannins, hydrolysable tannins and condensed tannins are widely distributed in nature and are present in plant foods and some beverages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Serrano et al., 2009</xref>). In this report, we compared the representative derivative compounds of the tannin family, namely tannic acid, punicalagin, and proanthocyanidins (OPCs), of the hydrolysable and condensed tannins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fraga-Corral et al., 2021</xref>). The results reveal that the tannin family is a potential resort of plant foods and beverages that may associate with activity to prevent infection of anti-SARS-CoV-2. Grape seed extract (GSE), a natural food supplement, was found to enrich OPC content, and serum from individuals who took the GSE exhibited activity to suppress infection of SASR-CoV-2.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Spike protein–ACE2 interaction ELISA assay</title><p>The inhibitory effects of tannic acid, OPCs, or punicalagin on the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and human ACE2 were detected using the SARS-CoV-2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) Kit (AllBio). Briefly, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugate-ACE2 was pre-incubated with various concentrations of tannic acid, OPCs, or punicalagin (0, 50, 100 μM) at room temperature for 30 min, followed by the addition to the ELISA plate pre-coated with SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD at 37°C for 1 hr. Each well was aspirated and then washed with washing buffer five times. After the last wash, 90 μl TMB (3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine, AllBio) substrate solution was added to each well and incubated at 37°C for 20 min. The color development was then stopped by adding a 50 μl Stop solution, and the HRP activity was measured by detecting the optical density at 450 nm. The binding rate or interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD and human ACE2 was calculated using the following equation: Spike-ACE2 interaction (%) is the ratio of averaged OD450 values of the sample/DMSO control × 100%.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>FRET-based enzyme activity assay</title><p>The fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based enzyme activity assay of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was established in the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2020c</xref>). Briefly, purified SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was incubated with different concentrations of tannic acid, OPCs, or punicalagin (0, 50, 100 μM) in 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 20 mM NaCl at room temperature for 30 min. Fluorescent protein substrate CFP-YFP was added to initiate the reaction. The activity assay was measured for 30 min by detecting the fluorescent signal at a wavelength of 474 nm after excitation at a wavelength of 434 nm. The reaction velocity was calculated using the data points from the first 15 min and normalized to the DMSO control.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Cell culture</title><p>The human embryonic kidney cells 293T stably expressing recombinant human ACE2 (293T-ACE2) were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 1% P/S, and 200 μg/μl hygromycin.

The binding of the two proteins was measured using an ELISA-based analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amanat et al., 2020</xref>). The results showed that punicalagin had the highest inhibitory activity against the Spike protein–ACE2 interaction compared to tannic acid and OPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This result suggested that the tannins, significantly punicalagin, could block viral infection by interrupting Spike–ACE2 interaction. However, it does not exclude the involvement of other mechanisms. To further test the mode of action of the tannins, the enzymatic activities of M<sup>pro</sup> were assessed using a FRET-based assay method developed in prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2022b</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, we purchased the GSE powder from raw materials suppliers and prepared the GSE capsules. Then, the healthy human subjects were randomly divided into three groups (0 mg, 200 mg, or 400 mg) to take GSE capsules or placebo and their serum samples were collected at the indicated time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The serum samples collected from the human subjects were further examined for their potential activity with Vpp assay.

Given that the tannin compounds are enriched in natural products such as grape and pomegranate, tannin uptake from common fruits may have the benefit of reducing viral infection. We have reported that tannic acid is an inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> with a binding pocket predicted by docking analysis involving the key residue Cys145 via the pi-sulfur and hydrogen bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2020d</xref>). Consistently, a recent in silico study showed interactions of tannins with the catalytic dyad residues (Cys-145 and His-41) of SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Khalifa et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, structural docking analyses suggested that tannins have better binding affinities than remdesivir with the SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Falade et al., 2021</xref>). These studies together support the anti-COVID activities of the tannins.</p><p>In the current study, representative members of the tannin subfamilies, including OPCs of condensed tannin, punicalagin of ellagitannins, and the positive control tannic acid of gallotannins, were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities. Ellagitannins and gallotannins belong to hydrolysable tannins, usually made up of a glucose core, while the condensed tannins consist of oligomers or polymers of flavan-3-ol subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aboagye and Beauchemin, 2019</xref>). Our results support the OPCs for its activity in SARS-CoV-2 inhibition. Generally, OPCs are comprised of the monomeric unit flavan-3-ols such as (+)catechin and (-) epicatechin and divided into propelargonidins, prodelphinidins, and procyanidins depending on the type of monomeric flavan-3-ols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bittner et al., 2013</xref>). The most common type of proanthocyanidins are procyanidins, which are classified into monomer, dimer, trimer, and other polymers reflecting the degrees of polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rue et al., 2018</xref>). The OPCs with lower degrees of polymerization such as 2–4 monomers are more soluble and mobile, whereas the polymeric proanthocyanidins consisting of &gt;5 monomers are difficult to be absorbed in the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Unusan, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2020a</xref>). Especially, dimeric and trimeric procyanidins have stronger antioxidant activity, better intestinal absorption, and better bioavailability in the gut than other types of procyanidins as demonstrated in in vitro studies, and animal as well as humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deprez et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">García-Ramírez et al., 2006</xref>). Besides, binding between M<sup>pro</sup> and the dimeric proanthocyanidins such as procyanidin B2 (PB2) has been modeled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhu and Xie, 2020</xref>). In vitro analysis showed that PB2 inhibited the M<sup>pro</sup> of SARS-CoV-2 at an IC<sub>50</sub> (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) of 75.3 ± 1.29 μM. Punicalagin is enriched in pomegranate and has been shown to have a unique inhibitory activity against the SARS-CoV-2 virus via blocking the Spike–ACE2 interaction and inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tito et al., 2021</xref>). According to the inhibitory activities of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the tannin family and our data performed in this paper, it is indicated that different classifications of tannin might be potential nutritional supplements to enhance protection against SARS-CoV-2 virus and its variants.</p><p>Multiple cell assay systems expressing infection-aiding proteins, including ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the cell lines Vero E6, NCI-H460, and 293T, were employed in this report, coupled with the Vpps derived from the wild-type or the other variants. Assessments of the efficacy across these different systems unveiled potentially essential aspects of the action mechanisms of the tannins. In general, cells expressing TMPRSS2 were more sensitive to tannic acid and OPCs than the vector control, suggesting that the increased expression of TMPRSS2 conveyed a vulnerability to these two tannins. One possibility is that tannic acid and OPCs act at least in part through attenuating the virus-cell engagement. On the other hand, punicalagin did not have TMPRSS2 preference, suggesting a distinct mode of action compared to tannic acid and OPCs.</p><p>Furthermore, the Vpp assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) in the 293T/ACE2 and NCI-H460 cells showed that tannic acid and OPCs could block alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and omicron variants Vpp infection as well as wild-type Vpps. Conversely, punicalagin is a potent inhibitor only for wild-type, alpha, and gamma Vpp infection, but not beta, delta, and omicron Vpps. Punicalagin prevented viral entry relying on block ACE2–Spike protein interaction. Therefore, different mutations of viral spike protein might make it prone to ineffectiveness. Otherwise, punicalagin had an excellent ability to obstruct virus M<sup>pro</sup> enzyme activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and then might decline the virus replication. Consequently, punicalagin and OPCs were considered potent inhibitors against omicron variants in a live virus system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These results suggested that different tannin compounds may have overlapped but distinct action mechanisms in inhibiting viral infection.</p><p>While this article was under preparation, the omicron variant (B.1.1.529 or BA.1) had become the globally prevalent SARS-CoV-2 strain since late December 2021. BA.1 has since been replaced by emerging lineages BA.2 in March 2022, followed by BA.4 and BA.5, which have accounted for a majority of SARS-CoV-2 infections since late June 2022 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">US Department of Health and Human Services, 2023</xref>). However, a recent report showed that vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization during the BA.1/BA.2 and BA.4/BA.5 periods was 79 and 60%, respectively, during the 120 d after the third dose and decreased to 41 and 29%, respectively, and indicated that the effectiveness of three doses of mRNA vaccines against COVID-19–associated hospitalization had declined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Surie et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, to measure neutralizing antibody titers after vaccination, the neutralization titer (NT50) was defined as the highest dilution at which the input virus signal was reduced by at least 50%. Several studies indicated the mean of NT50 waned by 6 mo after vaccination and showed no neutralizing activity against omicron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Edara et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Favresse et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Singanallur et al., 2022</xref>). In conclusion, the results suggest that vaccination does not fully protect people from omicron virus infection after 4–6 mo of vaccination.</p><p>Thus, safe and effective food or nutritional supplements are urgently needed to protect people from this and other emerging mutant virus strains. Our results warrant further studies to elucidate the biological functions of tannins in infection inhibition and prevention. According to the viral load inhibition assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), the EC50 of OPCs against omicron virus infection is 2.93 μg/ml. A typical adult human has approximately 5 l of blood in the body. Therefore, this EC50 converted to human blood content is 14.65 mg/5 l. Based on the mass spectrometry results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), the concentration of OPCs in GSE and grape juice with seed is 13.5 mg/g and 0.77 mg/g. Assuming that the absorption rate is 100%, only 1.085 g of the grape seeds or 19.025 g of grape juice can be consumed to achieve an effective concentration. Even though there is no clear cut-off to define an NT50 value that indicates protective immunity, most studies considered the NT50 &lt; 100 was defined as a lack of neutralizing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Edara et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kevlicius et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, we chose 200 times dilution of serum to evaluate the effectiveness of the GSE supplement. The data showed that 200 times dilution of serum from the human subjects who took GSE reduced by about 50% infection rate compared to baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). It suggested that compared to vaccination alone, daily GSE supplement significantly increases prevention from SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is nonpractical to vaccinate people every 4–6 mo as it is not sustainable or affordable today. But we can power our body with GSE daily. Several studies have suggested that GSE had beneficial effects against many diseases, such as inflammation, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, cancer, peptic ulcer, microbial infections, and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gupta et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, GSE was considered a healthy dietary supplement and was available as a liquid, tablet, or capsule. Previous studies have shown that the lethal dose (LD50) of GSE is &gt;5000 mg/kg in the rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lluís et al., 2011</xref>). In another subchronic toxicity investigation with rats, the no-observed-adverse-effect level of GSE was 1410 mg/(kg body weight/day) for males and 1501 mg/(kg body weight/day) for females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yamakoshi et al., 2002</xref>). Studies conducted in humans used in the range of 150–300 mg GSE daily for heart health purposes, while doses up to 600 mg have been used with no reported side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nowshehri et al., 2015</xref>). Most importantly, the safety and tolerability of oral dosages of proanthocyanidin-rich GSE in healthy adult volunteers were evaluated in a clinical investigation. GSE up to 2500 mg taken orally for 4 wk was discovered to be typically safe and well tolerated in people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sano, 2017</xref>). Our findings demonstrated that, in comparison to baseline blood samples, serum samples from human patients who took either 200 mg or 400 mg GSE capsules had a dose-dependent suppressive efficacy against various SARS-CoV-2 Vpp infection types. The daily consumption of 200 mg or 400 mg GSE is much lower than the safe dose shown in previous studies. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences conducted a toxicological assessment of GSE due to its potential health benefits to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">National Toxicology Program, 2023</xref>). Following this evaluation, the Food and Drug Administration certified it as generally recognized as safe. Consequently, it is now marketed as a dietary additive and is listed on the Everything Added to Food in the United States database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">US Food and Drug Administration, 2022</xref>). These results suggested that daily GSE supplements would be safe and provide benefits against COVID-19.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We found that two tannin compounds OPCs and punicalagin had potent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, in addition to the tannic acid reported before. We further assessed the efficacy across the different cell systems and different variants of Vpps and unveiled potentially essential aspects of the action mechanisms of OPCs and punicalagin. The results indeed showed that OPCs and punicalagin can serve as good inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, we also observed that GSE contained abundant OPCs and may serve as a good resource for food supplements to prevent virus infection. It seems unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 will disappear naturally or by current intervention strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Furuse and Oshitani, 2020</xref>). Thus, identifying natural products such as fruits associated with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities may be important for the community. The knowledge stemming from this study can help in the guideline for the development of food, nutrients, or supplements to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>registered as the inventor of a patent application based on inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection of punicalagin and OPC (ROC Patent No.111133318)</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Funding acquisition, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Project administration</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: The study was approved by the NTUH Research Ethics Committee (202101064RINB), and the participants gave written informed consent and consent to publish.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-84899-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in the manuscript.</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to acknowledge the service provided by the Biosafety Level-3 Laboratory of the First Core Laboratory, National Taiwan University College of Medicine.

Regarding the concern, we agree with the reviewer the safety of GSE is indeed important. As a matter of facts, the safety issue of GSE has been documented in the literature. We apologize that we did not discuss this in detail in the original manuscript. We have now added a paragraph in the Discussion section to summarize published reports on the safety of GSE in vivo (Line 515-536).</p><p>Briefly, previous studies have shown that the lethal dose (LD50) of GSE is greater than 5000 mg/kg in the rat [1]. In another sub-chronic toxicity investigation with rats, the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) of GSE was 1410 mg/(kg body weight/day) for males and 1501 mg/(kg body weight/day) for females [2]. Studies conducted in humans used in the range of 150-300mg GSE daily for heart health purposes, while doses up to 600mg have been used with no reported side effects [3]. Most importantly, the safety and tolerability of oral dosages of proanthocyanidin-rich grape seed extract (GSE) in healthy adult volunteers were evaluated in a clinical investigation. GSE up to 2500 mg taken orally for 4 weeks was discovered to be typically safe and well tolerated in people [4]. Our findings demonstrated that, in comparison to baseline blood samples, serum samples from human patients who took either 200 mg or 400 mg GSE capsules had a dose-dependent suppressive efficacy against various SARS-CoV-2 Vpp infection types. The daily consumption of 200mg or 400mg GSE is much lower than the safe dose shown in previous studies. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences conducted a toxicological assessment of grape seed extractant due to its potential health benefits to humans [5]. Following this evaluation, the Food and Drug Administration certified it as generally recognized as safe. Consequently, it is now marketed as a dietary additive and is listed on the Everything Added to Food in the United States database [6]. These results suggested that daily GSE supplements would be safe and provide benefits against COVID-19.</p><p>References</p><p>1.
