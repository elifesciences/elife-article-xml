As the stimulation intensity increases, immobility is followed by bursts of activity (running and jumping; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kunwar et al., 2015</xref>).

Remarkably, the tidal volume normalized for bodyweight (TVadjPerGram; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a-IV</xref>) was not altered by the intervention (3x3 mixed-design ANOVA: F<sub>(2,26)</sub> = 1.165, p=0.322). Furthermore, since minute volume equals the tidal volume multiplied by BPM, it follows that, the principal factor explaining the changes in MVadjPerGram was the increased BPM.

Therefore, the increase in BPM was achieved by selectively shortening the IT through an increase in PIFadj, while expiratory parameters (e.g. PEFadj (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–VIII</xref>)) did not achieve statistical significance level and therefore do not seem to have contributed significantly to the increase in BPM.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Chemogenetic activation of lateral hypothalamic Foxb1-expressing neurons alters multiple respiratory parameters.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Data across all DREADD WBP recordings was plotted as averaged line plots for each animal group (DREADD_neg, hM3Dq and hM4Di) and condition (Saline (red), Clozapine (green) or CNO (blue) i.p.injection). Each animal was recorded three times within each condition (nine recordings in total). Respiratory parameters do not differ between condition in DREADD_neg animals.

This indicates that the effect was caused by neuronal excitation of the parvafox<italic><sup>Foxb1</sup></italic> and not by an inherent effect of the injected substances (i.e. clozapine or CNO). This conclusion is further strengthened by the increase of c-Fos immunoreactivity evident in the parvafox nucleus of hM3Dq expressing mice, but not in those of hM4Di expressing mice nor in control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To test for a potential bias of respiratory recordings by alterations in gross locomotor activity, an open-field test was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c and d</xref>).

Thus, despite reaching statistical significance for distance moved in hM3Dq animals and for time spent in an immobile state in DREADD_neg animals, the magnitude of the effect size of chemogenetic modulation of the parvafox<italic><sup>Foxb1</sup></italic> on gross locomotor activity is only small and negligible, respectively, and is unlikely to explain the large size of the effects observed in the alterations of respiratory patterns.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Optogenetic modulation of <italic>Foxb1</italic> terminals in the dlPAG induces immobility</title><p>Respiratory results aside (see previous paragraph), the most prominent effect observed in the optogenetic experiments was the immobility (‘freezing behavior’) displayed by the group of ChR2-expressing mice during photoactivation of the hypothalamic <italic>Foxb1</italic><sup>+</sup> axonal projections to the rostral part of the dlPAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; Bregma –3.40/–4.04; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

It is to be assumed that these short-axon cells, with overlapping distribution in the dlPAG, would locally inhibit the activity of the glutamatergic neurons activated by the PMd<italic><sup>Cck</sup></italic> neurons. Another subgroup of nitric oxide expressing neurons in the dlPAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Onstott et al., 1993</xref>) also display a tonic inhibitory effect, via a potentiation of GABAergic synaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xing et al., 2008</xref>). The role of a fourth group of acetylcholinesterase positive neurons in the dlPAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Illing, 1996</xref>) is unknown. The immobility of the mouse would then derive from the local inhibition of the excitatory elements of the dlPAG. Future work will be required to clarify this issue. A second potential explanation is rooted in the expression pattern of <italic>Foxb1</italic> and <italic>Cck</italic> within the PMd. Our reanalysis of the scRNA seq data of the murine ventral-posterior hypothalamus has revealed, that there is a substantial number of <italic>Foxb1</italic> and <italic>Cck</italic> single-positive cells in the PMd. Since our study and the one from Adhikari’s group both made use of single-gene Cre knock-in mouse lines, the optogenetic stimulation in both studies led to activation of both single-positive and double-positive neurons. We therefore propose that the observed effects in both studies may be exclusively mediated by single-positive neuronal populations within the PMd. Using an intersectional approach combining Cre- and Flp-recombination dependent expression of optogenetic tools, would allow to investigate whether the same behavioral effects can also be elicited by exclusively activating double-positive (<italic>Foxb1</italic><sup>+</sup>/<italic>Cck</italic><sup>+</sup>) neurons within the PMd.</p><p>Which other parts of the brain are recruited by the dlPAG neurons to initiate bradycardia and immobility? The dlPAG projects to the cuneiform nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Meller and Dennis, 1991</xref>), which is involved in defensive locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jordan, 1998</xref>) through its connection with the lateral gigantocellular reticular nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tovote et al., 2016</xref>), implicated in high-speed locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caggiano et al., 2018</xref>). Additional targets of the cuneiform projections are the motor nucleus of the vagus and the nucleus tractus solitarius (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Korte et al., 1992</xref>) and a few immunostained boutons were found around the nucleus ambiguus in the rostroventrolateral medullary nucleus (Figure 5K in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Korte et al., 1992</xref>). These projections are probably involved in the bradycardic response to the optogenetic stimulation in the dlPAG. The projections of the cuneiform nucleus to the rostral ventrolateral medulla promote sympathetic vasomotor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Verberne, 1995</xref>). An alternative pathway for the expression of the behavioral and autonomic effects of dlPAG activation is through a link with the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dampney et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Bradycardia starts immediately after the beginning of the optogenetic activation of the <italic>Foxb1</italic><sup>+</sup> terminals in the dlPAG. The increase in the HRV during the optogenetic stimulation indicates an intervention of the parasympathetic system on the sinoatrial node of the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Standish et al., 1995</xref>). The parasympathetic impact on the heart is mediated by acetylcholine neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wu et al., 2019</xref>) and has a very short latency of response, with peak effect at about 0.5 s and return to baseline within 1 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pumprla et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>During ultrasonic vocalization tests in our laboratory (data not reported in this study), we observed that the <italic>Foxb1</italic>-Cre mice did not escape the ChR2-induced state of immobility, even when another genotype-matched and novel intruder mouse was placed into the ChR2-expressing mouse’s home cage. When approached by the intruder mouse, the mice were still able to move their heads under photo-stimulation, did sniff and interacted with the intruder mouse but did not actively follow the intruder. A mouse displaying complete immobility remained completely motionless even when the intruder was actively approaching it and even when it started digging into the cage bedding underneath the resident mouse.</p><p>In an interesting recent publication of Chen’s group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2022</xref>), the projection of the parvafox<italic><sup>Foxb1</sup></italic> to the lateral PAG (lPAG) indeed has been found to drive social avoidance in mice. Inhibition of the parvafox<italic><sup>Foxb1</sup></italic> neurons by the GABAergic input from the lateral septum reversed the deficit in social novelty preference induced by chronic social defeat stress. The authors conclude that activation of the parvafox<italic><sup>Foxb1</sup></italic> leads to avoidance of general social situations.</p><p>Hence, our observations of a reduced social interaction phenotype agree with the results from Chen’s group. However, since activation of the parvafox<italic><sup>Foxb1</sup></italic> terminals in the dlPAG also leads to immobility of the mouse in the absence of any social stimulus, we argue that the outcome of the social avoidance test could have been influenced by the failing motor performance of the <italic>Foxb1</italic>-Cre mice and might not be of pure social nature. In light of these observations, it is further interesting to note, that the results from our hot plate experiments indicate that the immobile/hyporeactive phenotype of these mice can indeed be escaped, when an adequate stimulus is presented (e.g. thermal stimulus intensity reaching nociceptive levels).</p><p>The possibility of antidromic propagation of ChR2-mediated action potentials poses a major caveat to the interpretation of results obtained from experiments in which presynaptic terminals are optogenetically activated. This mechanism could lead to coincident activation and realease of neurotransmitters from collaterals originally not intended to be targeted by the intervention. The use of inhibitory optogenetic tools, however, circumvents such a mechanism of uncontrolled backpropagating action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rost et al., 2022</xref>). In our optogenetic experiments in which we have used the inhibitory opsin ArchT3.0, we detected statistically significant differences to the baseline conditions in multiple locomotive parameters. This observation of bidirectional modulation is an indication of at least some baseline activity of the <italic>Foxb1</italic><sup>+</sup> neurons in the hypothalamus in our experimental settings. Importantly, these results and observations additionally support the notion that the locomotor phenotype is due to the specific projection of <italic>Foxb1</italic><sup>+</sup> neurons onto the PAG. If the hypolocomotor phenotype in ChR2 expressing mice was driven by backpropagation-mediated activation of collaterals, the presynaptic ArchT3.0-mediated inhibition of the <italic>Foxb1</italic><sup>+</sup> projections to the PAG would be unlikely to cause an effect opposing the ChR2-mediated phenotype. In our ArchT3.0 experiments, we specifically employed a stimulation paradigm in which we had light illumination on for 10 s and then off for another 10 s. This was done to reduce pH-mediated side effects of ArchT3.0 axonal activation observed with sustained stimulation, like spontaneous release of neurotransmitters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mahn et al., 2016</xref>). If such side effects had occured in our experiments, we would expect to see a phenotype that resembles the one observed in the ChR2-mediated activation. However, in our experiments, we saw no indication of such a behavior. Recently, two new optogenetic tools have been developed that allow efficient and targeted presynaptic silencing through GPCRs without the alteration in intracellular pH levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mahn et al., 2021</xref>). For future experiments, such tools might be more suitable for presyaptic silencing experiments.</p><p>In summary, our results demonstrate evidence for a role of the hypothalamic <italic>Foxb1</italic><sup>+</sup> neuronal population located in the parvafox<italic><sup>Foxb1</sup></italic>, and the PMd in the expression of bradycardia and immobility, as well as in increasing respiratory rate. This effect is in accordance with distinctive coping patterns, the freezing-like behavior accompanied by bradycardia being associated with innate defensive behavior.</p><p>In view of the recent finding that PMd neurons are activated during escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2021</xref>), the immobility that we observe could be mediated by the terminal endings of the parvafox<italic><sup>Foxb1</sup></italic>, synapsing on the inhibitory GABA-interneurons of the rostral third of the dlPAG or could be the result of the activation of the <italic>Foxb1</italic> single-positive PMd neuronal population (i.e. <italic>Foxb1</italic><sup>+</sup>/<italic>Cck</italic><sup>-</sup>). Further investigations on the neuronal activity of these hypothalamic <italic>Foxb1</italic><sup>+</sup> populations during exposure to natural threats will allow for a better understanding of the differential roles of <italic>Foxb1</italic><sup>+</sup> and <italic>Cck</italic><sup>+</sup> PMd neurons. Such experiments could for example consist of fiber photometry calcium recordings or microendoscopic calcium imaging experiments during predator exposure in <italic>Foxb1</italic> and/or <italic>Cck</italic> Cre-driver lines.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

All optogenetic and chemogenetic agents injected into <italic>Foxb1</italic>-Cre and <italic>Pvalb</italic>-Cre mice were Cre-dependent and were bilaterally injected into the posterior portion of the parvafox nuclei of the LHA.</p><p>All intracerebral viral vector injections were conducted according to the following standard protocol:</p><p>The animal was weighed and was anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) of a mixture of ketamine (40–60 mg.kg<sup>–1</sup> of body weight) and xylazine (10–15 mg.kg<sup>–1</sup> of body weight) diluted in physiological (0.9 %) saline. The fur covering the cranium was shaved and the mouse was head fixed into a stereotaxic apparatus (Kopf instruments, model 5000) equipped with a heating pad to maintain body temperature. Depth of anesthesia was assessed regularly throughout the entire duration of the surgery. If necessary, additional doses of the anesthetic agent were injected. Eye ointment was applied, and the eyes were protected from exposure to direct light. Once tail pinch and toe pinch reflexes were vanished, a sagittal skin incision above the midline of the cranium was performed and the cranial sutures were identified to locate bregma. Craniotomy was performed bilaterally above the site of injection with a dental steel bur. The viral vector was then aspirated into a 2.5 μl Hamilton syringe via a fine-bored 34-gauge needle (external diameter of 0.14 mm). The Hamilton syringe was mounted onto a manual microinjection unit and fixed to the stereotaxic frame. After identification of bregma, the needle tip was placed just above it and the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral coordinates for the injection sites were calculated relative to bregma (AP –1.3 mm, ML +/-1.3 mm). The needle was then placed on the brain surface above the target injection site and the dorsal-ventral coordinate was calculated relative to the brain surface (DV –5.5 mm). The needle was subsequently lowered into the brain until the desired depth was reached. 200 nl of the viral construct were injected into the parvafox nuclei bilaterally at a rate of 100 nl/min. Before retraction of the needle, the needle was left in place for 5 min to allow diffusion of the virus and to minimize backflush of the virus along the entry path of the needle. The same procedure was then repeated on the contralateral side. Once both viral injections were completed, the mouse was released from the stereotaxic frame and the skin incision was closed with one to two surgical stiches. The mouse was placed into a separate cage to recover from the surgery and was later put back into its home cage once consciousness was regained.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Fiber optic cannulas and implantation procedure</title><p>Fiber optic cannulas were custom made with ceramic ferrules (230 μm ID, 1.25 mm OD; Prizmatix Ltd., Israel) and optical fibers (200 µm OD, 0.66 NA; Prizmatix Ltd., Israel). The length of the protruding glass fiber end was set to 0.4 mm for the cannulas to be implanted above the dlPAG. The non-protruding end of the optical fiber was polished on a series of lapping sheets with decreasing grit size (5 μm, 3 μm, 1 μm, 0.3 μm). Each optical fiber implant was measured for its coupling efficiency before implantation. Implantation of the fiber optic cannulas was performed 2–3 weeks after virus injection.</p><p>The surgical procedure for implantation of the cannulas was as follows:</p><p>Initial preparation of the animal for access to the skull was performed as described above for viral vector injections. Once bregma was identified, small marks on the skull were made to identify the position of the bilateral bur holes for the cannulas and the three to four skull fixation screws. The bur holes were hand drilled with a dental steel bur and three to four fixation screws were screwed into the skull. The skull fixation screws were additionally locked to the skull by cyanoacrylate adhesive. A cannula was then mounted to the stereotaxic frame via a standard electrode holder (Kopf instruments) and was inserted into the brain at the desired coordinates. The bilateral cannulas implanted above the dlPAG were inserted at a 20° angle in the coronal plane (V-shaped arrangement of cannulas) to allow enough space for later connection to the patch cords. The coordinates for dlPAG cannulas insertion sites were AP –4.0 mm, ML +/-1.5 mm relative to bregma and insertion depth (at an angle of 20°) was –2.8 mm from the surface of the skull. Once the fibers were in place, self-curing acrylic (Palidur powder and liquid, Heraeus Kulzer GmbH, Hanau, Germany) was applied to the skull, the ceramic ferrule and the fixation screws. The mouse was then released from the stereotaxic apparatus and a 0.3 ml subcutaneous injection of physiological (0.9 %) saline into the neck scruff was made to support recovery from the surgery. Further, Carprofen (Rimadyl, 5 mg.kg<sup>–1</sup> of body weight) was subcutaneously administered as an analgesic following surgery. After surgery, the mouse was placed in a separate cage under a warming lamp until consciousness was fully regained. Whenever possible, mice were put back into their home cages together with their cage mates. If fighting behavior was observed between male cage mates, the mice were kept in separate cages.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Optogenetic stimulation</title><p>Time-resolved optogenetic gain-of-function manipulation of <italic>Foxb1</italic><sup>+</sup> axon terminals was performed bilaterally. A dual LED light source (MP-Nr: 34117; Prizmatix Ltd., Israel) with blue (peak λ=453 nm) and lime green (peak λ=536 nm) light emitting diodes (LEDs) were connected to a 1.5 mm optical fiber (NA 0.63; MP-Nr: 34131; Prizmatix Ltd.) which terminated into a rotary joint (MP-Nr: 34043, Prizmatix Ltd.), connecting to a dual fiber patch cord (2x500 μm, NA 0.63, MP-Nr: 34115; Prizmatix Ltd.). The two patch cord ends were attached to the cannulas on the head of the mouse by ceramic sleeves (ID = 1.25 mm, MP-Nr: 34071; Prizmatix Ltd.). ChR2 mice were stimulated with an intensity of 7–15 mW per fiber tip.

CNO was administered at a dose of 1 mg∙kg<sup>–1</sup> of bodyweight 30 min before the start of the experiment. Due to faster pharmacokinetics, clozapine was administered i.p. at a subthreshold dose of 0.1 mg∙kg<sup>–1</sup> of bodyweight immediately before the start of the experiment. Attention was given to eventual backflush or unintentional subcutaneous administration. Dose calculations were adjusted individually to bodyweight before each injection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Whole body barometric plethysmography (WBP)</title><p>To measure respiratory parameters, mice were placed in whole-body barometric plethysmography chambers (item Nr. 601-0001-011, DSI) that were connected to a Buxco Bias flow pump (item Nr. 601-2201-001, DSI, St. Paul, MN, USA) to avoid CO<sub>2</sub> accumulation inside the chambers and to circulate ambient air through the chambers at a rate of 1 L∙min<sup>–1</sup>. Each chamber was equipped with a high sensitivity differential pressure transducer (Buxco TRD5700 Pressure, item Nr. 600-1114-002, DSI) as well as a temperature and humidity probe (item Nr. 600-2249-001, DSI). All sensors were connected to the ACQ-7700 amplifier for pre-processing of signals.</p><p>Acquisition and processing of respiratory signals as well as the TTL signal from the LED pulser was performed within the Ponemah Software (PNM-P3P-CFG, DSI). The respiratory flow signals were sampled at a rate of 500 Hz and were filtered with a 30 Hz low pass filter. Using the Unrestraint Plethysmography Analysis Module (URPM) within Ponemah, respiratory cycles were validated in the flow signal and several respiratory parameters were derived from them. For each animal, the attribute analysis settings were individually adjusted to obtain optimal validation marks of respiratory cycles. The derived respiratory parameters were then averaged into 5 s averages and exported as excel files for further statistical analysis and plotting in R and RStudio (RStudio, Inc, Boston, MA, USA).</p><p>On the experimental day, mice were brought into the experimental room and were allowed to habituate to the new environment for at least 45 min. Each animal had two habituation sessions of 90 min on two different days prior to the first baseline measurements. For these habituation sessions, DREADD mice were injected with 0.2 ml of physiological (0.9 %) saline i.p. 30 min before they were placed into the WBP chamber.</p><p>Each animal’s baseline (BL) was measured for 3x90 min on 3 consecutive days. BL condition for DREADD animals consisted in a 0.2 ml i.p. injection of physiological (0.9 %) saline 30 min before measurement. After BL recordings, DREADD animals were measured for 3x90 min under CNO stimulation on 3 consecutive days and for another 3x90 min under clozapine stimulation on another 3 consecutive days. Mice were given a break of at least 3 days between CNO and clozapine experimental blocks to allow for complete clearance of the substances and to reduce stress on the animal. WBP chambers were cleaned with soap and water after each recording to avoid olfactory stimulation of the next mouse. All WBP experiments for a given mouse were performed at the same time of the day to account for circadian variability.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Cardiovascular measurements with telemetry</title><p>For measuring cardiovascular functions, an implantable telemetry system from Datascience International (DSI) was used. The transmitter was implanted in 13 mice following manufacturer instructions and as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huetteman and Bogie, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pillai et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with the aid of isoflurane and implanted with a PA-C-10 transmitter (DSI). This small pressure sensing telemetry tool was implanted in the left carotid artery taking care to place the pressure-sensitive tip in the aortic arch. The radio transmitting device (RTD) was placed under the skin along the right flank of the mice. Mice were given analgesics for 3 days post-surgery. One week after telemetric sensor implantation, a test measurement was conducted to ensure that the catheter, the RTD and the receiver (RPC-1) were functioning well. The optogenetic experiment was performed after 2 more weeks.</p><p>Measurements were recorded with Dataquest ART (version 3.1) and RespiRate (DSI). Recordings were taken three times for 3 weeks post-surgery. Recordings were continuously taken for 30 s every 5 min during these sessions. Systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure, heart rate and activity were analyzed. Pulse wave signals were used to measure the heart rate variability (HRV).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Open field test</title><p>As in all other experiments reported in this paper, mice were transported into the experimental room and were allowed to acclimatize to the new environment for at least 45 min. The experimental arena for the open field test consisted in a 40x40 cm cage with transparent plexiglas walls and a gray colored metal floor. After each recording of a mouse, the arena was thoroughly cleaned with 70% ethanol. Each mouse was recorded four times (2 x saline/LEDoff and 2 x clozapine/LEDon) spread across 2 days with at least 2 days between experimental days. In DREADD experiments, the saline condition was performed in the morning and the clozapine session in the afternoon. To account for potential circadian bias, optogenetic morning and afternoon sessions for each mouse were alternated, so that the two recordings for LEDoff and LEDon, respectively, were recorded once in the morning session and once in the afternoon session. Recordings consisted of a 5-min habituation period inside the experimental arena, uninterruptedly followed by a 5-min recording period. Mice for DREADD experiments were injected with clozapine (i.p. 0.1 mg∙kg<sup>–1</sup> of bodyweight) 30 min before the recording time window. Optogenetic mice remained in their home cages until the start of the 5-min habituation session, shortly before which they were attached to the patch cords. In all optogenetic animals (including controls), a stop watch signal marked the end of the 5 min of habituation. The experimenter then initiated the LEDon period accompanied by another brief auditory signal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Pose estimation of open field data</title><p>For body part tracking, DeepLabCut (version 2.2.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mathis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nath et al., 2019</xref>) was used. Specifically, 500 frames taken from 25 videos were labeled and 95% was used for training. A ResNet-50-based neural network with default parameters was used for 600,000 training iterations. We validated with 1 shuffle, and found the test error was: 2.03 pixels, train: 2.39 pixels (image size was 1280 by 720 pixels). We then used a p-cutoff of 0.95 to condition the X,Y coordinates for future analysis. This network was then used to analyze videos from similar experimental settings.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Hot plate test</title><p>To assess thermal nociceptive perception in optogenetic <italic>Foxb1</italic>-Cre mice, they were first connected to the patch cords and placed onto an insulation layer of cork and several layers of paper towels on the hot plate for 3 min to acclimatize to the new environment. The hot plate (Analgesia meter for rodents, IITC life sciences Inc, Woodland Hills, CA, USA) was maintained at 51+/-0.1 °C. After 3 min had passed, the insulation layer was removed and the latencies until hindlimb shaking, hindlimb licking and jumping were recorded as baseline. In case the mouse did not display any of the two endpoint behaviors (i.e. hind paw licking or jumping), the recording was terminated 50 s after the onset of the thermal stimulus to prevent tissue damage. After termination of the baseline recording, the insulation layer was again placed between the mouse and the hot plate and the optogenetic stimulation was initiated (see ‘Optogenetic stimulation’ for detailed parameters). After 3 min of optogenetic stimulation, the insulation was once again removed and the mouse was placed back onto the hot plate, while the stimulation continued. Just like in the baseline condition, the same latencies were recorded, or the experiment was terminated after maximally 50 s. As observed in pilot experiments, the ChR2-injected mice displayed reduced locomotor activity and seemed to be limited in their ability to lick their hind paw. We therefore also terminated the recording, when the mouse displayed an obvious attempt to lick its hind paw and the latency until the display of such an event was recorded. The same procedure was repeated one more time on another day to record two baseline and two LED condition recordings for each optogenetic animal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Histology</title><p>Before mice were perfused, they went through the same routine as in a regular experimental condition (LED stimulation or CNO injection) for later detection of c-Fos immunofluorescence. Two hours after the start of the activation/inhibition experiments, the mice were deeply anesthetized with the same anesthetic agent used for surgical procedures (see above). Once the pain reflexes vanished, the thorax was fenestrated, and the mouse was transcardially perfused with physiological (0.9 %) saline for 3 mins and subsequently with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS 0.1 M (pH 7.4) for 5 min. Decapitation was performed and the head was placed in 4% PFA until extraction of the glass fiber implants. After cannulas extraction from the skull, the cannulas were stored for post-extraction coupling efficiency measurement. The brains were then harvested and further immersed in TBS 0.1 M+18% sucrose +0.02% Na-azide overnight for cryoprotection.</p><p>Brain tissue was cryo-sectioned into 40-μm-thick sections on a sliding microtome (SM 2010R, Leica) connected to a freezing unit (Microm KS 34, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and every sixth section was selected for incubation with antibodies.</p><p>The histological processing of free-floating sections was performed as follows:</p><p>Sections were washed for 3x5 min in TBS 0.1 M. The sections were then incubated for 2 days at 4 °C with the primary antibodies at their corresponding dilutions (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>) in TBS 0.1 M+0.1% Triton X-100 and 10% bovine serum (BS). After incubation with the primary antibodies, sections were washed for 3x5 min in TBS 0.1 M and further incubated for 2 hr at room temperature with a biotinylated antibody diluted 1:200 in TBS 0.1 M and 10% BS. Subsequently, sections were washed 1x5 min in TBS 0.1 M and 2x5 min in Tris pH 8.2 before they were incubated with Cy2-, Cy3- and Cy5-conjucated secondary antibodies or streptavidin, which were diluted 1:200 in Tris pH 8.2 for 2 hr at room temperature. After incubation with Cy-conjugated secondary antibodies and Cy-conjugated streptavidin, the sections were washed 1x5 min in Tris pH 8.2 and 2x5 min in TBS 0.1 M and then incubated with DAPI 1:5000 in TBS 0.1 M for 5 min at room temperature.</p><p>Sections were mounted onto Superfrost +glass slides (Thermo Scientific) and were left to dry for 2 hr at 37 °C.

Subsequently, the four separate objects were merged into a common Seurat object and the percentage of mitochondrial transcripts as well as the number of hemoglobin transcripts per cell were calculated. Quality control was performed by analyzing number of features, number of counts, percentage of mitochondrial RNA, and number of hemoglobin gene transcripts. Data meeting the following criteria were kept for downstream analysis: nFeatures &gt;200 &amp; nFeatures &lt;7500 &amp; percent.mtRNA &lt;15 &amp; nHemoglobin_RNA &lt;50. The filtered dataset was then normalized within each original identity (male1, male2, female1, female2) using the SCTransform function and 3000 integration features were selected. To correct for batch effects, integration anchors were detected based on the selected integration features prior to integration of the four datasets. Next, uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) was performed for dimensional reduction before clusters were identified and plotted for inspection. We then plotted the expression levels of a set of candidate genes (features) to identify the cluster representing the PMd and to differentiate it from the lateral and medial premammillary nuclei (LM and MM). To confirm our cluster identification, we extracted markers for the identified PMd cluster as well as differential markers for the PMd cluster vs. MM and LM clusters. Qualitative comparison of these markers with in situ hybridization data from the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas confirmed PMd cluster identity. Within the PMd cluster, we then extracted and plotted the level of co-expression of <italic>Cck</italic> and <italic>Foxb1</italic> within each cell of the cluster.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Data analysis and statistics</title><p>Statistical analysis and data handling was performed with custom written codes in R/RStudio and with Python in Jupyter Notebooks.</p><p>WBP data was first plotted as line plots and violin plots with the ggplot2 package within R. To check whether data matched the test assumptions, data was first assessed with a Shapiro-Wilks test and with visual inspection of Q-Q plots.</p><p>Before the analysis of the WBP data, outliers above and below 1.5 x the interquartile range were removed and the data was averaged across each condition (saline, clozapine, CNO). WBP experiments were analyzed by a 3x3 mixed-design ANOVA with Huynh-Feldt Sphericity correction, followed by post-hoc two-tailed paired Welch’s t-Tests. Hedge’s g with a correction for paired data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gibbons et al., 1993</xref>) was calculated for all statistically significant pairwise comparisons.</p><p>The hot plate and open field experiments were analyzed with two-tailed paired Welch’s t-Tests if assumptions of normality were met. Otherwise, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used. Statistical analysis was limited to the groups that contained at least three subjects. Hedge’s g with a correction for paired data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gibbons et al., 1993</xref>) was calculated for all statistically significant pairwise comparisons. Pose estimation data from open field experiments were further analyzed and plotted in R. A set of functions for the analysis of DeepLabCut labeled data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sturman et al., 2020</xref>) was used and modified where necessary according to the analysis requirements. The open field arena was partitioned into arena, periphery, center, and corner zones according to the default parameters. Animal movement and zone visits were calculated with a movement cut-off of 1 and an integration period of 13 (with a video frame rate of 25 frames/second). For optogenetic experiments, a 3-min bin immediately before (baseline) and 3 min immediately after (stim) the start of the optogenetic stimulation were used for statistical comparison and plotting. For chemogenetic experiments, 5 min bins (following a 5-min habituation) were used from each experiment (2 x BL, 2 x Clo for each animal) for statistical comparison and plotting. The telemetrically recorded cardiovascular and movement-related data were analyzed in Ponemah. To be able to identify the LEDon and LEDoff periods in these data, two video cameras were used in parallel: camera 1 was recording the animal (photostimulation light visible), and camera 2 was recording a computer screen displaying the telemetric recording in real-time. To quantify the effect of the optogenetic activation (respectively of the change from LEDoff of LEDon in control animals), data of the last 60 s of the LEDoff condition were used as baseline data and statistically compared to the data of the first 60 s of the LEDon condition. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to test for the presence of overall differences between the LEDoff vs. LEDon conditions. If significant, pair-wise ordinary least squares (OLS) was used for post-hoc analysis. To correct for multiple testing (four dependent variables), p=0.5/4=0.125 was set as threshold level for post-hoc significance (Bonferroni correction).</p><p>To assess heart rate variability (HRV), the heart rate data were analyzed in full, that is 1-epoch resolution. The duration of each individual heart cycle was derived by calculating the difference between the timestamp of each pair of two subsequent heart cycles. The mean, median and SD of all heart cycle durations during the last baseline minute (LEDoff), respectively during the first minute of the LEDon condition, were calculated. The SD of all heart cycle durations during that minute was used as an indicator for HRV.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Resources, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All experiments were approved by the Swiss federal and cantonal committee for animal experimentation (2016_20E_FR and 2021-10-FR) and were conducted in accordance with the institutional guidelines of the University of Fribourg.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Track visualizations with underlying density maps of all tested DREADD animals.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-86737-supp1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Zone visit diagrams of all tested DREADD animals.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-86737-supp2-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Track visualizations with underlying density maps of all tested optogenetic animals.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-86737-supp3-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp4"><label>Supplementary file 4.</label><caption><title>Zone visit diagrams of all tested optogenetic animals.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-86737-supp4-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp5"><label>Supplementary file 5.</label><caption><title>Heart rate variability (HRV) during the optogenetic activation of the Foxb1-terminal endings in the dlPAG of mouse 106-21/10.</title><p>Comparison between the one-minute period before (green rectangle) and after (red rectangle) the start of the optogenetic activation.

First, they reported that chemogenetic activation of Foxb1hypothalamic cell groups led to tachypnea. The authors tend to attribute this effect to the activation of hM3Dq expressed in the parvofox Foxb1 but did not rule out the participation of the PMd Foxb1 cell group, which may as well have expressed hM3Dq, particularly considering the large volume (200 nl) of the viral construct injected. Notably, the activation of the Foxb1hypothalamic cell groups in this experiment did not alter the gross locomotor activity, such as time spent immobile state. Thus, this contrasts with the authors' finding on the optogenetic activation of the Foxb1hypothalamic fibers projecting to the dorsolateral PAG. In the second experiment, the authors applied optogenetic ChR2-mediated excitation of the Foxb1+ cell bodies' axonal endings in the dlPAG, leading to freezing and, in a few cases, bradycardia. The effective site to evoke freezing was the rostral PAGdl, and fibers positioned either ventral or caudal to this target had no response. Considering the pattern of Foxb1hypothalamic cell groups projection to the PAG, the fibers projecting to the rostral PAGdl are likely to arise from the PMd Foxb1 cell group and not from the parvofox Foxb1 of the LHA. Here, it is important to consider that activation of PMd CCK cell group, which consists of around 90% of the PMd cells, evokes escape, not freezing. According to the present findings, a specific population of PMd Foxb1 cells may be involved in producing freezing. In addition, only a few of the animals with correct fiber placement presented sudden onset of bradycardia in response to the photostimulation. Considering the authors' findings, the Foxb1+ hypothalamic groups are likely to mediate behavioral responses related to innate defensive responses, where the parvofox Foxb1 of the LHA would be involved in promoting tachypnea and the PMd Foxb1group in mediating freezing and bradycardia. These findings are exciting, and, at this point, they need to be tested in a scenario of actual exposure to a natural predator.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86737.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The authors aimed to examine the role of a group of neurons expressing Foxb1 in behaviors through projections to the dlPAG.

First, they reported that chemogenetic activation of Foxb1hypothalamic cell groups led to tachypnea. The authors tend to attribute this effect to the activation of hM3Dq expressed in the parvofox Foxb1 but did not rule out the participation of the PMd Foxb1 cell group which may as well have expressed hM3Dq, particularly considering the large volume (200 nl) of the viral construct injected. It is also noteworthy that the activation of the Foxb1hypothalamic cell groups in this experiment did not alter the gross locomotor activity, such as time spent immobile state. Thus, contrasts with the authors finding on the optogenetic activation of the Foxb1hypothalamic fibers projecting to the dorsolateral PAG. In the second experiment, the authors applied optogenetic ChR2-mediated excitation of the Foxb1+ cell bodies' axonal endings in the dlPAG leading to freezing and, in a few cases, bradycardia as well. The effective site to evoke freezing was the rostral PAGdl, and fibers positioned either ventral or caudal to this target had no response. Considering the pattern of Foxb1hypothalamic cell groups projection to the PAG, the fibers projecting to the rostral PAGdl are likely to arise from the PMd Foxb1 cell group, and not from the parvofox Foxb1 of the LHA. Here it is important to consider that optogenetic ChR2-mediated excitation of the axonal endings is likely to have activated the cell bodies originating these fibers, and one cannot ascertain whether the behavioral effects are related to the activation of the terminals in the PAGdl or the cell bodies originating the projection.</p></disp-quote><p>Authors’ reply: We acknowledge and agree about the possibility of backpropagation in ChR2mediated terminal stimulation experiments. We have introduced a paragraph in the discussion section discussing this issue. In short, the observation of an opposing phenotype in ArchT3.0 animals indicates, that the ChR2-mediated phenotype is indeed Foxb1-PAG projection specific. This is due to the fact, that the use of light-activated proton pumps for terminal stimulation can not induce backpropagation of an inhibitory effect to the soma. Potential downsides of the use of proton pumps in small compartments as e.g. in the axon are also discussed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, activation of PMd CCK cell group, which consists of around 90% of the PMd cells, evokes escape, and not freezing. According to the present findings, a specific population of PMd Foxb1 cells may be involved in producing freezing.

These findings are very interesting, and, at this point, they need to be tested in a scenario of real exposure to a natural predator.</p></disp-quote><p>Authors’ reply: We fully agree with the proposed experiments. Due to the previously mentioned retirement of Prof. Celio and the concomitant expiration of licenses for animal experimentation we are prevented from conducting these experiments on our own. We have integrated a statement in the discussion, regarding these potential future experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The authors aimed to examine the role of a group of neurons expressing Foxb1 in behaviors through projections to the dlPAG.

Fig.1 has no experimental data and needs to be replaced with detailed pictures from the viral injected mice showing the projections diagrammed.</p></disp-quote><p>Authors’ reply: We believe that this graphic illustration is helpful to the reader to comprehend the spatial relationship between the parvafoxFoxb1 nucleus, the mammillary nuclei, and the PAG. In a previous study we have characterized the projections of the parvafoxFoxb1 nucleus in detail (using the same Foxb1-Cre mouse line as in the present study) and, in this regard, would like to refer Reviewer #2 to this publication (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.24057">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.24057</ext-link>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Fig. 3 needs control pictures and statistical comparison with different conditions in c-Fos. Also expression in other nearby regions needs to be presented to demonstrate the specificity of the expression.</p></disp-quote><p>Authors’ reply: We have modified the original Fig. 3 with more pictures across all three conditions used in the chemogenetic experiments. Since the new figure now takes up a whole page, and because the data in this figure is for validation purpose of the DREADD experiments, we have decided to rather put it into the supplementary files. The figure is now labelled as “Supplementary File S1”. All figure and file numberings throughout the text have been adjusted accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Fig. 5, a great effort has been made to illustrate the point that CCK and Foxb1 are differentially expressed. Why not just perform a double in situ experiment to directly illustrate the point?</p></disp-quote><p>Authors’ reply: We have addressed this comment in the initial release of the eLife manuscript. In short, we agree that a double ISH experiment would have been an alternative approach, but would like to state that scRNAseq is a well established and valid method for this purpose.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Fig. 7 data on optogenetic stimulation on immobility and breathing, since not all mice showed the same phenotype, what is the criterion for allocating these mice to hit or no hit groups? Given the dramatically reduced breathing and locomotion, what is the temperature response? More data needs to be gathered to support that this is a defense behavior.</p></disp-quote><p>Authors’ reply: The criteria for allocation of animals to the experimental groups is described in section “Optogenetic modulation of Foxb1 terminals in the dlPAG induces immobility” and is based on the stereotaxic coordinates of the tips of the glass fiber implants. We did not perform any experiments, in which we recorded body temperatures or temperature preferences in optogenetic animals. Such experiments were outside the scope of the study. As mentioned in a previous comment above, we have added an additional paragraph to the discussion section regarding future investigations of these hypothalamic Foxb1 neurons during exposure to natural predators. Such experiments would certainly allow more insight into the defensive nature of the described phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors claim to target dlPAG. However, in the picture shown in Fig. 8C, almost all PAG contains ChR2 fibers and it is likely all the fibers will be activated by light. Thus, as presented, the data does not support the claim of the specificity on dlPAG. Also c-Fos data needs to be presented on the degree of activation of downstream PAG neurons after light exposure.</p></disp-quote><p>Authors’ reply: We attach the original image 8c, without arrows and indications, in which the localization of ChR2-positive fibers in the dlPAG is better visible. They are located exactly under the tip of the fiberoptic fiber. We do not know the functional characteristics of the post-synaptic PAG neurons and have not determined experimentally their downstream targets. Investigating the downstream target was outside the scope of the current publication.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-86737-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Fig. 9 only showed one case. A statistical comparison needs to be presented.</p></disp-quote><p>Authors’ reply: Our cardiovascular experiments are of exploratory and descriptive nature (i.e. pilot experiments). It was a conscious decision to not perform hypothesis tests on these experiments. We did not have enough mice to perform statistical tests with sufficient statistical power. Providing results from hypothesis tests on these data would lead to statistically unjustified conclusions. To clarify this issue, we have added a paragraph to the relevant results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Optogentic terminal activation in the PAG will likely elicit back-propagation and subsequent activation of additional downstream brain sites of Foxb1 neurons. More experiments need to be done to assess this and as presented, the data does not support the role of PAG necessarily.</p></disp-quote><p>Authors’ reply: Please see our answer to Reviewer #1 regarding the same issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors claim negative data from PVH-Cre mice. More data need to be presented to make this case.</p></disp-quote><p>Authors’ reply: We would like to refer to our answer to point 6 that was raised by Reviewer #2</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The conclusion, even as presented, adds to the known evidence of the PAG in the defense behavior.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>In the pharmacogenetic experiments, the authors need to clarify which Foxb1hypothalamic presented the activation of hM3Dq. It is important to know whether this activation-producing tachypnea was restricted to the parvofoxFoxb1 or also included the PMd Foxb1 group. It would be important to isolate the effect of the pharmacogenetic activation of each one of these Foxb1 hypothalamic cell groups.</p><p>After determining which cell group would be involved in mediating this respiratory effect, it would be nice to discuss the possible pathways involved in this effect.</p><p>In the optogenetic experiments, the authors should differentiate between the effects of the PAG projecting fibers from the PMd and those from the parvofox groups. As it stands, it seems that the freezing and bradycardia depend on projection from the PMd Foxb1 group to the rostral PAGdl. However, considering the large volume (200 nl) of the viral construct injected, both groups were likely to express channelrhodopsin, and it would be important if the authors could restrict the viral injections to each one of the Foxb1 hypothalamic cell groups.</p></disp-quote><p>Authors’ reply: We fully agree with the suggestion, but due to the recent retirement of Prof. Celio we unfortunately not allowed to conduct any further animal experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors also reported that photoactivation ventral to the PAGdl, possibly in the PAGl did not yield any clear behavioral response. However, as pointed out in the discussion, a recent publication found that the parvofox Foxb1 projection to the lateral PAG drives social avoidance, and we were wondering whether there was any avoidance behavior during the photoactivation of the PAGl fibers.</p></disp-quote><p>Authors’ reply: We did not conduct any social avoidance experiments ourselves. However, we did perform ultrasonic vocalization experiments (unpublished data) in which we optogenetically stimulated Foxb1+ terminals in the PAG. Due to experimental issues related to the age of the tested mice, we did not obtain conclusive results regarding the ultrasonic vocalizations. By a purely observational account, we did not observe any active avoidance during optogenetic stimulation, but rather a cessation of interaction. We are unable to judge whether this was more pronounced in the PAGl targeted mice or not.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another important point is that optogenetic ChR2-mediated excitation of the axonal endings is likely to activate the cell bodies originating these fibers, and one cannot ascertain whether the behavioral effects depend on the activation of the terminals in the PAGdl or the activation of the cell bodies originating these terminals. Note, in the present case, PMd cell bodies may also project elsewhere, such as the cuneiform nucleus, known to mediate freezing responses. To circumvent this problem, during photoactivation of the PAGdl terminals, the authors should inhibit the cell bodies originating these terminals.</p></disp-quote><p>Authors’ reply: We would like to refer to the answer we provided above regarding the issue of backpropagation or ChR2-mediated phenotypes and projection-specificity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another important issue is related to the fact that around 90% of the PMd express CCK (Wang et al., 2021), and previous work showed that activation of these cells yielded escape and not freezing (Wang et al., 2021). Although the authors claim that the single-cell RNA sequencing dataset reveals distinct Foxb1 expression in the PMd, these results derive from tissues collected in the posterior hypothalamus, not exactly restricted to the PMd. Therefore, it would be desirable if the authors could show CCK and Foxb1doulbe labeled PMd sections to evaluate the exact percentage of cells expressing either one of these peptides.</p></disp-quote><p>Authors’ reply: The tissues for the scRNAseq data were obtained from hypothalamic tissues between stereotaxic coordinates of AP-2.54 to AP-3.16 (please see Fig. 1b in Mickelsen et al. 2020) and not purely from the posterior hypothalamic nucleus. These tissues hence include a large proportion of the PMd neurons. We would like to point out that the expression profile of the PMd cluster matches well with the ISH data from the Allen Brain Atlas that we have put together in &quot;Supplementary File S6” (originally “Supplementary File S5”)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should also explain why only a small number of animals that received PAGdl photoactivation presented bradycardia. Moreover, they should also discuss the possible pathways mediating this effect. Here, it is important to point out that the cuneiform nucleus, as suggested by the authors as one possible way to mediate this effect, promotes sympathetic vasomotor activity (Verbene, 1995).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the sentence: “The projections of the cuneiform nucleus to the rostral ventrolateral medulla promote sympathetic vasomotor activity (Verberne 1995).” to the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>In this reviewer's view, this study needs substantial improvement:</p><p>1. The writing is very sloppy and difficult to follow. There is no clear logic flow in the main text and the figures need substantial realigning for panels, additions of labelling etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the sentence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Fig. 6 the hot plate data is out of place and should be placed in supplementary or removed completely.</p></disp-quote><p>Authors’ reply: We and others have previously shown that the parvalbumin+ population of the Parvafox nucleus is involved in nociceptive behavior. Hence, we believe it is of interest to show, that we do not see the same phenotype with the stimulation of the Foxb+ population of the parvafox nucleus. This data shows that the nociceptive component of the parvafox nucleus is confined to its parvalbumin+ population.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors discussed social behavior data in the Discussion, but no such data is presented, which is very confusing.</p></disp-quote><p>Authors’ reply: Indeed we did not perform any experiments to investigate social behavior. However, we address that the observed locomotive phenotype of optogenetic Foxb1+-terminals could have lead to a bias in the interpretation of the social behavior experiments published elsewhere by others.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors discussed a great deal on potential differences between parvafox and PMd Foxb1 neurons, however, no clear data was presented to show a functional difference between them, which is also confusing.</p></disp-quote><p>Authors’ reply: Even though investigations on the functional differences of parvafox and PMd Foxb1 neurons would be highly interesting, it was outside the scope of the current study. Due to the recent retirement of Prof. Celio, we are not allowed to perform any additional animal experiments.</p></body></sub-article></article>
