worldwide but the mechanisms that underlie migraine chronicity are poorly understood. Cytoskeletal flexibility is fundamental to neuronal-plasticity and is dependent on dynamic microtubules. Histone-deacetylase-6 (HDAC6) decreases microtubule dynamics by deacetylating its primary substrate, α-tubulin. We use validated mouse models of migraine to show that HDAC6-inhibition is a promising migraine treatment and reveal an undiscovered cytoarchitectural basis for migraine chronicity. The human migraine trigger, nitroglycerin, produced chronic migraine-associated pain and decreased neurite growth in headache-processing regions, which were reversed by HDAC6 inhibition. Cortical spreading depression (CSD), a physiological correlate of migraine aura, also decreased cortical neurite growth, while HDAC6-inhibitor restored neuronal complexity and decreased CSD. Importantly, a calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist also restored blunted neuronal complexity induced by nitroglycerin. Our results demonstrate that disruptions in neuronal cytoarchitecture are a feature of chronic migraine, and effective migraine therapies might include agents that restore microtubule/neuronal plasticity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Migraines are a common brain disorder that affects 14% of the world’s population. For many people the main symptom of a migraine is a painful headache, often on one side of the head. Other symptoms include increased sensitivity to light or sound, disturbed vision, and feeling sick. These sensory disturbances are called aura and they often occur before the headache begins. One particularly debilitating subset of migraines are chronic migraines, in which patients experience more than 15 headache days per month. Migraine therapies are often only partially effective or poorly tolerated, making it important to develop new drugs for this condition, but unfortunately, little is known about the molecular causes of migraines.</p><p>To bridge this gap, Bertels et al. used two different approaches to cause migraine-like symptoms in mice. One approach consisted on giving mice nitroglycerin, which dilates blood vessels, produces hypersensitivity to touch, and causes photophobia in both humans and mice. In the second approach, mice underwent surgery and potassium chloride was applied onto the dura, a thick membrane that surrounds the brain. This produces cortical spreading depression, an event that is linked to migraine auras and involves a wave of electric changes in brain cells that slowly propagates across the brain, silencing brain electrical activity for several minutes.</p><p>Using these approaches, Bertels et al. studied whether causing chronic migraine-like symptoms in mice is associated with changes in the structures of neurons, focusing on the effects of migraines on microtubules. Microtubules are cylindrical protein structures formed by the assembly of smaller protein units. In most cells, microtubules assemble and disassemble depending on what the cell needs. Neurons need stable microtubules to establish connections with other neurons. The experiments showed that provoking chronic migraines in mice led to a reduction in the numbers of connections between different neurons. Additionally, Bertels et al. found that inhibiting HDAC6 (a protein that destabilizes microtubules) reverses the structural changes in neurons caused by migraines and decreases migraine symptoms. The same effects are seen when a known migraine treatment strategy, known as CGRP receptor blockade, is applied.</p><p>These results suggest that chronic migraines may involve decreased neural complexity, and that the restoration of this complexity by HDAC6 inhibitors could be a potential therapeutic strategy for migraine.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>migraine</kwd><kwd>pain</kwd><kwd>aura</kwd><kwd>allodynia</kwd><kwd>tubulin</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS109862</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pradhan</surname><given-names>Amynah A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA040688</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pradhan</surname><given-names>Amynah A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008460</institution-id><institution>National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AT009169</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rasenick</surname><given-names>Mark M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006812</institution-id><institution>Center for Integrated Healthcare, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BX00149</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rasenick</surname><given-names>Mark M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000042</institution-id><institution>Amgen Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pradhan</surname><given-names>Amynah A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008523</institution-id><institution>Center for Clinical and Translational Science, University of Illinois at Chicago</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pradhan</surname><given-names>Amynah A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In models of chronic migraine, neuronal complexity is diminished in head-pain processing regions but restored through HDAC6 inhibition, which increases tubulin acetylation and cytoskeletal flexibility, and CGRP receptor blockade.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Migraine is an extremely common neurological disorder that is estimated to affect 14% of the global population, making it the third most prevalent disease worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 Collaborators, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">GBD 2016 Disease and Injury Incidence and Prevalence Collaborators, 2017</xref>). One particularly debilitating subset of migraine patients are those with chronic migraine, which is defined as having more than 15 headache days a month (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Headache Classification Committee of the International Headache Society (IHS), 2013</xref>). Despite its high prevalence, migraine therapies are often only partially effective or are poorly tolerated, creating a need for better pharmacotherapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ford et al., 2017</xref>). Recent clinical success of antibodies and antagonists against calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and CGRP receptor demonstrate the effectiveness of targeted migraine therapeutics. While there has been more research into understanding the molecular mechanisms of migraine, there remains much to be discovered.</p><p>Neuroplastic changes play an important role in a variety of chronic neuropsychiatric conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Descalzi et al., 2015</xref>), and epigenetic alterations through histone deacetylases (HDACs) are frequently investigated. HDACs are best characterized for their ability to deacetylate histones, promoting chromatin condensation and altered gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Krishnan et al., 2014</xref>). Intriguingly, some HDACs can also deacetylate non-histone targets, including proteins involved in cytoarchitecture and dynamic cellular structure. Due to its cytoplasmic retention signal, HDAC6 is primarily expressed in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Valenzuela-Fernández et al., 2008</xref>), and one of its primary targets for deacetylation is α-tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Valenzuela-Fernández et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">d'Ydewalle et al., 2012</xref>). α- and β-tubulin form heterodimers that make up microtubules, which are a major component of the cytoskeleton, and regulate intracellular transport, cell morphology, motility, and organelle distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Janke and Bulinski, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Janke and Montagnac, 2017</xref>). Microtubules undergo multiple cycles of polymerization and depolymerization, creating a state of dynamic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Janke and Bulinski, 2011</xref>). Tubulin displays a variety of post-translational modifications, including α-tubulin acetylation, which occurs endogenously through α-tubulin N-acetyltransferase I (αTAT1), and it is correspondingly deacetylated by HDAC6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Janke and Montagnac, 2017</xref>). Tubulin acetylation is associated with increased flexibility and stability of microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Xu et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, deacetylated microtubules are more fragile and prone to breakage or increased cycling between assembly and disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Xu et al., 2017</xref>). Microtubules are important for cellular response to injury and play a role in neurite branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gallo, 2011</xref>); and microtubule dynamics influence neuronal signaling and mediate axonal transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Covington et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Braun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schappi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Van Helleputte et al., 2018</xref>). Importantly, changes in cellular structure such as alterations in dendritic spine density, have been implicated in disease chronicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jochems et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Forrest et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Singh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nestler and Lüscher, 2019</xref>).</p><p>The aims of this study were to determine if altered neuronal cytoarchitecture facilitates the chronic migraine state and whether modifying this by inhibition of HDAC6 would be effective in mouse models of migraine. We observed decreased neuronal complexity in headache-processing brain regions in the nitroglycerin (NTG) model of chronic migraine-associated pain. We further demonstrated that treatment with HDAC6 inhibitor reversed these cytoarchitectural changes and correspondingly decreased cephalic allodynia. These studies were extended to a mechanistically distinct model of migraine, cortical spreading depression (CSD), which is thought to be the electrophysiological correlate of migraine aura. Again, we observed decreased neuronal complexity in migraine related sites, which was reversed by a HDAC6 inhibitor. To investigate the translational implication, we also tested the effect of olcegepant, a CGRP receptor inhibitor, and found that it alleviated chronic allodynia induced by NTG, and restored cytoarchitectural changes associated with chronic migraine-associated pain. These results suggest a novel mechanism for migraine pathophysiology and establish HDAC6 as a novel therapeutic target for this disorder.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Exposure to chronic NTG induces cytoarchitectural changes in key pain processing regions</title><p>Changes in the structural plasticity of neurons have been observed in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders and can serve as a marker of disease chronicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Forrest et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nestler and Lüscher, 2019</xref>). To investigate if this was also the case in migraine, we treated male and female C57BL/6J mice every other day for 9 days with NTG or vehicle and tested for periorbital mechanical responses on days 1, 5, and 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). NTG induced severe and sustained cephalic allodynia as measured by von Frey hair stimulation of the periorbital region as compared to vehicle animals on the same day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Mice were sacrificed on day 10, 24 hr after the final NTG/VEH treatment, and neuronal size and arborization were examined through a Golgi staining procedure in a key cephalic pain processing region, the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Goadsby et al., 2017</xref>). We observed a dramatic decrease in neuronal complexity after NTG treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Neurons of chronic NTG-treated mice had significantly fewer branch points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), and shorter neurites resulting in decreased overall length of the neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Further examination of the complexity of the neurons using Sholl Analysis, showed a significant decrease in the number of intersections following NTG treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–I</xref>). In addition to the TNC we also determined if other brain regions related to central pain processing were affected by chronic NTG treatment. We examined the somatosensory cortex (SCx) and periaqueductal gray (PAG) of these mice and found similar results, where neurons from NTG-treated mice had fewer branch points, were shorter in length, and had fewer intersections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–D and E–H</xref>, respectively). To ensure that this effect was associated with migraine-pain processing and not a non-specific effect of NTG we also analyzed neuronal complexity in the nucleus accumbens shell (NAc), a region more commonly associated with reward, and found no alteration in number of branches, total neuron length, or Sholl analysis for cells in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I–L</xref>). Furthermore, we also examined the dorsal horn of the lumbar and cervical spinal cord, important sites for pain processing in the peripheral nervous system. No differences in NTG versus vehicle controls in number of branches, total neuron length, or Sholl analysis were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1M–T</xref>). These results suggest that decreased neuronal complexity may be a feature that maintains the chronic migraine state; a previously undiscovered phenomenon.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The NTG model of chronic migraine produces cytoarchitectural changes in a cephalic pain processing region.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of testing schedule, M and F C57Bl/6J mice were treated with vehicle or nitroglycerin (10 mg/kg, IP; NTG) every other day for 9 days.

Recent studies demonstrate that increased tubulin acetylation facilitates microtubule flexibility and prevents microtubule breakage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Janke and Montagnac, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Portran et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Xu et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that inhibiting HDAC6 to promote microtubule stability may restore the neuronal complexity observed following chronic NTG. We tested the selective HDAC6 inhibitor, ACY-738, in the chronic NTG model. Mice were treated with NTG or VEH for 9 days. On day 10, mice were injected with ACY-738, after 4 hr, tissue was processed and analyzed by western blot. ACY-738 treatment resulted in a significant increase in the ratio of acetylated α-tubulin to total tubulin within the trigeminal ganglia (TG), TNC, SCx, NAc, and spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). A separate group of mice were analyzed by neuronal tracing in the TNC, 4 hr post-ACY-738 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Endogenously there is a balance of acetylated and deacetylated α-tubulin which regulates optimal neuronal complexity. In the case of chronic migraine, there is a disbalance resulting in decreased neuronal complexity. HDAC6 or CGRP receptor inhibition restores tubulin dynamics and neuronal complexity and correspondingly decreases chronic migraine-associated symptoms.</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig7sdata1"><label>Figure 7—source data 1.</label><caption><title>Data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-63076-fig7-data1-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p><p><supplementary-material id="fig7sdata2"><label>Figure 7—source data 2.</label><caption><title>Data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-63076-fig7-data2-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p><p><supplementary-material id="fig7sdata3"><label>Figure 7—source data 3.</label><caption><title>Data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-63076-fig7-data3-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p><p><supplementary-material id="fig7sdata4"><label>Figure 7—source data 4.</label><caption><title>Data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-63076-fig7-data4-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p><p><supplementary-material id="fig7sdata5"><label>Figure 7—source data 5.</label><caption><title>Data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-63076-fig7-data5-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p><p><supplementary-material id="fig7sdata6"><label>Figure 7—source data 6.</label><caption><title>Data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-63076-fig7-data6-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-63076-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results indicate that in models of chronic migraine and aura there is a dysregulation of cellular plasticity resulting in decreased neuronal complexity. We found that following the establishment of chronic cephalic allodynia in the NTG model of migraine-associated pain, there was a decrease in the number of branch points, combined neurite length, and interactions of neurons within the TNC, PAG, and somatosensory cortex. With this newly discovered phenomenon we sought to mitigate this decrease through inhibition of HDAC6 which we found to reciprocally restore neuronal complexity and inhibit allodynia. We found that the cytoarchitectural changes were not just induced by NTG but were also prominent following CSD. Reduction in neuronal complexity was also observed in this model of migraine aura, and again HDAC6 inhibition restored neuronal plasticity and decreased the number of CSD events. The latter effect is a hallmark of migraine preventive drugs. Furthermore, we found that a migraine specific treatment, CGRP receptor inhibition, also restored cytoarchitectural changes. Together our results demonstrate a novel mechanism of chronic migraine and reveal HDAC6 as a novel therapeutic target for this disorder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>).</p><p>We used the NTG model in this study, as it is a well-validated model of migraine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Demartini et al., 2019</xref>). NTG is a known human migraine trigger and is used as a human experimental model of migraine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schytz et al., 2010</xref>). Similar to humans, NTG produces a delayed allodynia in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bates et al., 2010</xref>), as well as photophobia and altered meningeal blood flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Markovics et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Greco et al., 2011</xref>). Chronic intermittent administration of NTG is used to model chronic migraine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pradhan et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Farajdokht et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Long et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Christensen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Compared to humans, much higher doses of NTG are required to produce allodynia. However, NTG-induced hypersensitivity in mice is inhibited by migraine-specific medications, such as sumatriptan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bates et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pradhan et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pradhan et al., 2014b</xref>) and CGRP targeting drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Christensen et al., 2019</xref>), as well as the migraine preventives propranolol and topiramate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tipton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Greco et al., 2018</xref>). Further, mice with human migraine gene mutations are more sensitive to NTG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brennan et al., 2013</xref>). Systemic administration of NTG also causes cellular activation throughout nociceptive pathways including in the TNC and brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tassorelli and Joseph, 1995a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tassorelli and Joseph, 1995b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ramachandran et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Greco et al., 2018</xref>). Correspondingly, we also observed changes in neuronal complexity in the TNC, as well as in the PAG and somatosensory cortex, regions heavily involved in pain processing. Alterations in these regions could contribute to allodynia or interictal sensitivity observed in chronic migraine patients. Previous studies have shown an increase in TNC activity in headache models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Oshinsky and Luo, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akerman et al., 2013</xref>). While our data show an overall decrease in complexity within these neurons, they do not necessarily contradict these previous findings. For example, decreased neuronal flexibility could encourage the strengthening of excitatory synapses and/or prevent the formation of inhibitory synapses, as the cell is in a more fixed state. Within the TNC, there are both inhibitory and excitatory neuronal populations; and future studies will determine which populations are altered in migraine models and how these changes directly affect neuronal activity.</p><p>Alterations in neuronal complexity in response to NTG appeared to be limited to brain regions involved in pain processing. We did not observe any alterations in the nucleus accumbens which is commonly associated with reward and motivation. RNA-Seq and proteomic experiments from our lab have also revealed that the nucleus accumbens has very different responses to chronic NTG relative to parts of the trigeminovascular system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jeong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Krishna et al., 2019</xref>). We also observed no change in neuronal cytoarchitecture in the lumbar spinal cord, a region largely involved in peripheral but not cephalic pain processing. Importantly, we found no cytoarchitectural alterations in the cervical spinal cord, a region that is also involved in head/neck pain processing. These data suggest that decreased neuronal complexity in response to migraine states may be limited to central sites that regulate headache and pain processing.</p><p>We also observed decreased neuronal complexity in CSD, a migraine model mechanistically distinct from NTG. CSD is thought to underlie migraine aura and reflects changes in cortical excitability associated with the migraine brain state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Charles and Baca, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brennan and Pietrobon, 2018</xref>). Previous studies also support the idea of cytoarchitectural alterations accompanying spreading depression/depolarization events and focused mainly on dendritic morphology. Neuronal swelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Takano et al., 2007</xref>) and dendritic beading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Steffensen et al., 2015</xref>) were observed following spreading depression events. CSD also resulted in alterations in dendritic structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Takano et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eikermann-Haerter et al., 2015</xref>) and volumetric changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Takano et al., 2007</xref>). Further, Steffensen et al. showed decreased microtubule presence in dendrites following spreading depression in hippocampal slices, again implying alterations in cytoarchitectural dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Steffensen et al., 2015</xref>). Microtubules have been shown to disassemble in response to increased intracellular calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schliwa et al., 1981</xref>); and the increased calcium influx induced by spreading depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basarsky et al., 1998</xref>) may facilitate this breakdown. Tubulin acetylation is associated with increased flexibility and stability of microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Xu et al., 2017</xref>). One way in which HDAC6 inhibitors could attenuate CSD is through increased tubulin acetylation, thus counteracting microtubule disassembly produced by CSD events. In addition, CSD waves pass through the neuron in phases, from apical dendrites, to somatodendritic sites, and finally to proximal dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pietrobon and Moskowitz, 2014</xref>). Along with preventing the dendritic alterations that occur in response to calcium influx, it is possible that HDAC6 inhibition could redistribute or disturb the phasic movement of CSD events, which may decrease and/or elongate CSD events. Furthermore, multiple reports indicate that CSD can activate the trigeminovascular complex, and evoke cephalic allodynia in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bolay et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fioravanti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Noseda and Burstein, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Melo-Carrillo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Filiz et al., 2019</xref>). We also observed decreased neurite branching in the TNC following CSD, further linking CSD to head pain processing. Combined, these data suggest that CSD has an impact on neuronal morphology that contributes to migraine pathophysiology.</p><p>Proper acetylation of microtubules is necessary for a variety of cellular functions including appropriate neurite branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gallo, 2011</xref>), cell response to injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gallo, 2011</xref>), mitochondrial movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Braun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jin et al., 2017</xref>), anchoring of kinesin for microtubule mediated transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gibbs et al., 2015</xref>) and regulation of synaptic G protein signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schappi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Singh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Singh et al., 2020</xref>). Disruption of this process can have significant physiological effects. Knockout of the α-tubulin acetylating enzyme, α-TAT1, in peripheral sensory neurons results in profound deficits in touch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Morley et al., 2016</xref>). Further, Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is a hereditary axonopathy that affects peripheral nerves resulting in damage to both sensory and motor function. Mouse models of CMT reveal deficits in mitochondrial transport in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) due to reduced α-tubulin acetylation, and HDAC6 inhibition ameliorate CMT-associated symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">d'Ydewalle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benoy et al., 2018</xref>). We observed that ACY-738 broadly increased neuronal complexity, including in vehicle and sham controls. However, we did not see any alterations in mechanical thresholds or CSD events in response to this upregulation in these control groups. Furthermore, this effect of ACY-738 appeared to be short lasting and was no longer present at the 24 hr timepoint. Other groups using ACY-738 or other HDAC6 inhibitors also did not observe general disruption in mechanical or temperature sensitivity with HDAC6 inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Krukowski et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Van Helleputte et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ma et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sakloth et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, constitutive knockout of HDAC6 produces viable offspring with few phenotypic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). These findings suggest that HDAC6 inhibition does not appear to generally cause a loss of sensation, but in a migraine state, where mechanical responses are decreased, they can have anti-allodynic effects.</p><p>While these results are the first of their kind to demonstrate cytoarchitectural changes in models of chronic migraine, alterations in neuronal plasticity have been described previously in models of neuropathic pain. A mouse model of chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve reduced neurite length in GABA neurons within lamina II of the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Another group observed that following spared nerve injury, there were decreases in the number of branches and neurite length of hippocampal neurons but increases in spinal dorsal horn neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). These studies, along with our results, suggest that adaptations in response to chronic pain can culminate in alteration of neuronal cytoarchitecture within the central nervous system.</p><p>HDAC6 inhibitors have been studied in other models of pain. They were shown to effectively reduce chemotherapy-induced allodynia following treatment with vincristine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Van Helleputte et al., 2018</xref>) or cisplatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Krukowski et al., 2017</xref>) in mice. In addition, both groups found that chemotherapy blunted mitochondrial transport in sensory neurons, an effect that was restored by HDAC6 inhibition. Another study also found that HDAC6 inhibitors were effective in models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sakloth et al., 2020</xref>). Together, these studies highlight the importance of cytoarchitectural dynamics in relation to pain sensation and the ability of HDAC6 inhibition to promote relief from allodynia/hyperalgesia.</p><p>We chose to focus on the role of HDAC6 in tubulin acetylation and microtubule dynamics, as we observed changes in neuronal complexity in migraine models. However, HDAC6 also regulates Hsp90 and cortactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Valenzuela-Fernández et al., 2008</xref>). HDAC6 deacetylates Hsp90, which plays an important role in glucocorticoid receptor maturation and adaptation to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kovacs et al., 2005</xref>). A previous study showed that in social defeat stress HDAC6 knockout or inhibition decreased Hsp90-glucocorticoid receptor interaction and subsequent glucocorticoid signaling, thus encouraging resilience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Espallergues et al., 2012</xref>). In line with these findings, HDAC6 inhibitors also show antidepressant-like effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Covington et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jochems et al., 2014</xref>), and membrane-associated acetylated tubulin is decreased in humans with depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Singh et al., 2020</xref>). Further, HDAC6 also directly deacetylates cortactin, a protein that regulates actin-dependent cell motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>). Future studies will explore the contribution of these other mechanisms by which HDAC6 may impact neuronal complexity in migraine.</p><p>We investigated whether a current migraine treatment strategy, CGRP receptor inhibition, could ameliorate the cytoarchitectural changes induced by chronic migraine-associated pain. We found a good correlation between the anti-allodynic effects of olcegepant and its ability to restore neuronal complexity in the chronic NTG model. In contrast to ACY-738, olcegepant had no effect on vehicle-treated mice and only recovered, but did not increase neuronal branching, length, or intersections in the NTG-treated group. Considering that CGRP receptors are not known to directly affect microtubule dynamics, these results suggest that there are multiple ways through which migraine therapies can affect neuronal plasticity. Previous studies have shown that activation of various Gα subunits, including α<sub>i</sub>, α<sub>o</sub>, α<sub>s</sub>, can inhibit microtubule assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Roychowdhury et al., 1999</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that an increase in CGRP, which was found to be present following NTG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Greco et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Moye et al., 2021</xref>), could result in altered microtubule assembly. Inhibition of the CGRP receptor could therefore reverse this process allowing for elaboration of microtubules. Olcegepant was previously shown to poorly cross the blood brain barrier; and it may result in cytoarchitectural changes in the central nervous system by blocking nociceptive signals from the periphery, resulting in upstream changes in the TNC and other central regions. Further, the effect of olcegepant along with the finding that NTG did not alter complexity in the spinal cord or nucleus accumbens, help to confirm that the changes in neuronal cytoarchitecture following NTG are associated with migraine mechanisms. This study suggests a possible mechanism in which recovered neuronal complexity is a marker of effective migraine medication.</p><p>Our results reveal a novel cytoarchitectural mechanism that may underlie chronic migraine and imply that this disorder results from attenuation of neurite outgrowth and branching. Human imaging studies reveal decreased cortical thickness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Magon et al., 2019</xref>), and gray matter reductions in the insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and amygdala of migraine patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Valfrè et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, a significant correlation was observed between gray matter reduction in anterior cingulate cortex and frequency of migraine attacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Valfrè et al., 2008</xref>). These structural changes could reflect decreased neuronal complexity in combination with other factors. We propose that strategies targeted toward pathways regulating neuronal cytoarchitecture may be an effective approach for the treatment of chronic migraine. Our results suggest that HDAC6 inhibitors may restore cellular adaptations induced by chronic disease states but may not otherwise affect healthy physiological function; and such compounds could contribute to the migraine therapeutic armamentarium.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (Mouse Male and Female)</td><td>C57BL/6J</td><td>Jackson Laboratories</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:000664</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit polyclonal anti-HDAC6 antibody</td><td>Tso-Pang Yao Duke University</td><td/><td>(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Alexa Fluor 555 Donkey polyclonal anti-Rabbit antibody</td><td>Life Technologies</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/AB_162543">AB_162543</ext-link></td><td>(1:2000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse monoclonal anti-acetyl-α-tubulin antibody</td><td>Sigma</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/AB_2819178">AB_2819178</ext-link> (Sigma Clone 6-11B1)</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>HRP-linked goat polyclonal anti-mouse antibody IgG</td><td>Jackson ImmunoResearch</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/AB_10015289">AB_10015289</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>RNeasy Plus mini kit</td><td>Quiagen</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Nitroglycerin</td><td>American Reagent</td><td/><td>Purchased in 30% alcohol,30% propylene glycol, and water solution</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>ACY-738</td><td>Acetylon</td><td/><td>5% DMSO saline solution</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Trichostatin A</td><td>Sigma</td><td>T8552</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Olcegepant</td><td>Tocris</td><td>BIBN 4096</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Simple Neurite Tracer</td><td/><td/><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Experiments were performed on adult male and female C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME.

The selected region of interest was stimulated using a series of manual von Frey hair filaments (bending force ranging from 0.008 g to 2 g). A response of the head was defined as shaking, repeated pawing, or cowering away from the filament. In the hind paw, a response was lifting of the paw, shaking, or licking the paw after stimulation. The first filament used was 0.4 g. If there was no response a heavier filament (up) was used, and if there was a response a lighter filament (down) was tested. The up-down pattern persisted for four filaments after the first response. To decrease bias in testing, researchers were blinded to treatment groups at time of testing. While the same researcher performed both the mechanical threshold testing and injections these measures were recorded in different places and at separate time points.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Nitroglycerin model of chronic migraine</title><p>Nitroglycerin (NTG) was purchased at a concentration of 5 mg/ml, in 30% alcohol, 30% propylene glycol and water (American Reagent, NY, USA). NTG was diluted on each test day in 0.9% saline to a concentration of 1 mg/ml for a dose of 10 mg/kg. Mice were administered NTG or vehicle every other day for 9 days. Animals used in cephalic experiments were tested on days 1, 5, and 9. On test days a basal threshold was measured then animals were treated with either NTG or vehicle and then put back in the testing racks and subsequently tested 2 hr later for the post-treatment effect.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Cortical spreading depression model</title><p>The procedure for the cortical spreading depression (CSD) model is based on previously published work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen and Ayata, 2017</xref>) that is commonly used to screen potential migraine preventives and further used in our own work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pradhan et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dripps et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertels et al., 2021</xref>). Mice were grouped into sham and CSD groups and then further subdivide into ACY-738 (50 mg/kg, IP) or vehicle (i.e. Sham-ACY, Sham-Veh, CSD-ACY, CSD-Veh). To make the thinned skull cortical window, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (induction 3–4%; maintenance 0.75% to 1.25%; in 67% N<sub>2</sub> / 33% O<sub>2</sub>) and placed in a stereotaxic frame on a homoeothermic heating pad. Core temperature (37.0 ± 0.5℃), non-peripheral oxygen saturation (∼ 99%), heart rate, and respiratory rate (80–120 bpm) were continuously monitored (PhysioSuite; Kent Scientific Instruments, Torrington, CT, USA). Mice were frequently tested for tail and hind paw reactivity to ensure that the anesthesia plane was maintained.</p><p>To verify CSD events, optical intrinsic signal (OIS) imaging was primarily used and electrophysiological recordings were recorded as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pradhan et al., 2014b</xref>). Briefly, following anesthesia, the skin from the skull was detached and a rectangular region of ~2.5×3.3 mm<sup>2</sup> (~0.5 mm from sagittal, and ~1.4 from coronal and lambdoid sutures) of the right parietal bone was thinned to transparency with a dental drill (Fine Science Tools, Inc, Foster City, CA, USA). Mineral oil application improved transparency of cortical surface parenchyma and vasculature for video recording. A green LED (530 nm) illuminated the skull throughout the experiment (1-UP; LED Supply, Randolph, VT, USA). Cortical surface reflectance detected by OIS was collected with a lens (HR Plan Apo 0.5 × WD 136) through a 515LP emission filter on a Nikon SMZ 1500 stereomicroscope (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY, USA). Images were acquired at 1–5 Hz using a high-sensitivity USB monochrome CCD camera (CCE-B013-U; Mightex, Pleasanton, CA, USA) with 4.65-micron square pixels and 1392 × 1040 pixel resolution.</p><p>Lateral to the thinned window two burr holes were drilled around the midpoint of the rectangle. These burr holes were deeper than the previously drilled skull region such that the dura was exposed but not broken. To record local field potentials (LFPs) an electrode (in a pulled glass pipette filled with saline) was inserted into one burr hole and attached to an amplifier. A separate ground wire, placed underneath the skin caudal to the skull, grounded this set up and LFPs were recorded for an hour to ensure a stable baseline and recovery from any surgically induced CSDs. After an hour of stabilization, a second pulled glass pipette was filled with 1 M KCl and placed into the more rostral burr hole, avoiding contact with the brain or the surrounding skull. An initial flow of KCl was pushed to begin and then an even flow was held so that there was a constant small pool of KCl that filled the burr hole. Excess liquid was removed with tissue paper applied next to the burr hole. Regardless of grouping the CSD recording continued for 3600 s after the initial drip of KCl. Mice were euthanized by anesthetic overdose followed by decapitation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Golgi staining</title><p>Golgi staining was performed according to the FD Rapid Golgi Stain kit (FD Neurotechnologies). For NTG or Veh-treated mice, they underwent the chronic NTG model and on day 10, 4, 24, and 48 hr after ACY-738 treatment or vehicle, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, euthanized, brain/spinal cord was rapidly removed, and tissue was rinsed in ddH<sub>2</sub>O. Tissue was then placed in the impregnation solution that was an equal amount of solutions A and B that was prepared at least 24 hr in advance. After the first 24 hr the brain was placed in new impregnation solution and then stored for 1 week in the dark. The brains were then transferred to solution C, which was also replaced after the first 24 hr. After replacing solution C the brains were stored at room temperature for 72 hr more. Following solution C, brains were flash frozen in 2-methyl butane and cryostat cut at −20°C into 100 µm slices. The slices were mounted onto gelatin coated slides and secured by a drop of solution C placed onto each slice. These slides were then left to dry naturally in the dark.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Neurite tracing</title><p>After processing, images were taken at ×20 magnification and a Z-stack was created based on different levels of focal plane. After the Z-stack was created the FIJI program Simple Neurite Tracer was used to trace the processes of the neuron. While many of the neurons had some overlap with other analyzed neurons, Z-stacks of varying focus levels allowed for clearer tracing. A sample gif file of a Z-stack from a traced neuron is included and demonstrates how the change in focus allow for better determination of branching from overlapping neurons (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Animation 1</xref>). Furthermore, after tracing the neurons were analyzed using Simple Neurite Tracer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Longair et al., 2011</xref>) software to assess the number of branch points from each neuron, overall length of the neuron, and Sholl Analysis. Sholl Analysis was performed by placing a center ROI point at the center of the soma and producing consecutive circles every 20 pixels/0.377 µm, for the entire body of the neuron. Intersections were counted based on the number of times a neurite crossed each of these consecutive circles. These data were compiled per neuron and then brought into one Masterfile. Male and female mice were used for a majority of studies, and no significant differences were observed in any of the key findings based on sex.</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-63076-video1.gif"><label>Animation 1.</label><caption><title>Representational gif file of trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) image at 20X magnification used to trace neurons.</title><p>Images were taken through changes in z-stack focus and collapsed into a single image file.

For all brain regions analyzed, six to eight relatively isolated neurons were randomly chosen per mouse. The selected neurons were fully impregnated with Golgi stain and relatively complete. An atlas was used along with clear anatomical markers to ensure the neurons were being taken from their described region of interest. Neurons characterized for the trigeminal nucleus caudalis region were taken only from the outer lamina of caudal sections. Neurons analyzed for somatosensory cortex were all taken from layer IV of the primary somatosensory barrel cortex. To ensure a homogenous cell population, only pyramidal cells were selected. The most complex neurons were chosen for analysis in all regions. Previously, it was shown that dendritic complexity was directly correlated to soma size. To ensure that the NTG group where not just smaller in size we directly compared soma diameter of neurons in the NTG and Veh group. There was no significant difference in soma size between these two groups (Veh 9.258 ±. 2515 and NTG 9.192 ±. 2782, student run t-test p=0.8608). Three individuals traced all cells. Interrater reliability was determined by having each tracer trace five neurons in their entirety. Pearson product correlations were accessed in three measures; number of branches, total dendritic length, and total intersection number through Sholl analysis and found to be 0.91, 0.94, and 0.95, respectively. All tracings of neurons were re-examined by the primary tracer (Z.B.) to assure quality control.

ACY-738 was dissolved in a 5% DMSO saline solution, which was used as the vehicle control. RN-73 was dissolved in 10% DMSO, 10% Tween-80, and 80% saline and was injected 1 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg, this mixture was also used as the vehicle control group. ASV-85 was dissolved in 15% DMSO, 15% Tween-80, and then 70% saline, this mixture was also used as the vehicle control group. ASV-85 was injected at 1 mg/kg dose. TSA was dissolved in 20% DMSO solution in 80% 0.01M PBS and injected at a dose of 2 mg/kg, this same solution was used for the vehicle. Olcegepant was dissolved in saline solution and was injected at a 1 mg/kg dose. For the CSD experiments ACY-738 was injected 3 hr before starting the surgery so that it would reach its peak efficiency of 4 hr by the time the CSD event started.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Quantitative RT-PCR</title><p>Total RNA was isolated from flash frozen brain punches using the RNeasy Plus Mini kit from Quiagen. RNA samples were reverse transcribed to single-stranded cDNA. cDNA transcription was used following the protocol from Superscript III (Life Technologies) and the TaqMan Gene Expression Assay system (Applied Biosystems). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, Hs02758991_g1) was used as a housekeeping gene. The threshold cycle (CT) of each target product was determined and CT values between HDAC6 transcripts and housekeeping genes were calculated (ΔCT). The fold change (2<sup>- ΔΔCT</sup>) for each was calculated relative to the median ΔCT from the saline control animals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Mice were anesthetized with Somnasol (100 µl/mouse; 390 mg/mL pentobarbital sodium; Henry Schein) and perfused intracardially with 15 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (0.1 M PBS, pH 7.2) and subsequently 50 mL of ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1M PBS (pH 7.4). Whole brain and trigeminal ganglia (TG) were harvested and overnight left to post-fix in 4% PFA/0.1M PBS at 4°C. Brain and TG were then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in 0.1M PBS until they sunk. Brains were then flash frozen using 2-methyl butane over dry ice. Coronal sections of the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) and the somatosensory cortex were sliced on a cryostat at 20 µM and TG at 16 µM and immediately mounted onto slides. Slides were washed with PBST, then incubated with a blocking solution containing 5% normal donkey serum with PBST for 1 hr at room temperature. Slides were then incubated overnight at RT with the primary rabbit anti-HDAC6 antibody (1:500, courtesy of Tso-Pang Yao at Duke University) diluted in 1% NDSDT. Slides were subsequently washed with 1% NDST and then the secondary antibody was added for 2 hr at room temperature (donkey anti rabbit IgG, 1:2000). Slides were washed with 0.1 M phosphate buffer, and cover slipped with Mowiol-DAPI mounting medium. Images were taken by in a blinded manner using the EVOS FL Auto Cell Imaging system, using a ×40 objective.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Western blots</title><p>Samples were taken from chronically treated NTG or Vehicle mice, which received an injection of ACY-738 or Vehicle on day 10. Samples were collected 4 hr post-ACY/VEH. TG, TNC, and SCtx was analyzed using traditional western blot analysis while Nac and spinal cord samples were analyzed at a later time using the ProteinSimple Wes. Spinal cord samples were a combination of cervical and lumbar spinal cord sections. Protein concentrations were assessed using a Nanodrop 2000c spectrophotometer and equal quantities were loaded onto each Stain-Free acrylamide gel for SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The gels were subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA USA) for western blotting. The membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk diluted in TBS-T (10 mM Tris-HCl, 159 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.4) for 1 hr. Following the blocking step, membranes were washed with Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 and then incubated with an anti-acetyl-α-tubulin antibody (Lysine-40) (Sigma Clone 6-11B1), α-tubulin (Sigma), overnight at 4°C. Membranes were washed with TBS-T and incubated with a secondary antibody [HRP-linked anti-mouse antibody IgG F(ab′)two or HRP-linked anti-rabbit antibody IgG F(ab′)2] (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA, catalog #115-036-072 for mouse, and catalog #111-036-047 for rabbit,) for 1 hr at room temperature, washed, and developed using ECL Luminata Forte chemiluminescent reagent (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Blots were imaged using a Chemidoc computerized densitometer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and quantified by ImageLab 3.0 software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). In all experiments, the original gels were visualized using BioRad stainfree technology to verify protein loading. For the spinal cord and nucleus accumbens, samples were prepared and run on the ProteinSimple Instruments Wes System according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Images for these samples were also measured and visualized using the same system.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Sample size was calculated by power analysis and previous experience.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kate Wassum as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Maggie Waung (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>There is considerable enthusiasm for your manuscript, in particular, the important findings implicating HDAC inhibition of migraine associated structural changes in the brain and its effects on behavior. However, there is strong agreement among the Reviewers that more experimental data are needed to establish a tighter connection between neuronal complexity and changes in allodynia/CSD. The manuscript clearly presents separate features: neuronal complexity based on histology; HDAC6 elevation/inhibition; behavioral endpoints. However, it does not adequately establish cause and effect relationships among these components. Additional experiments that strengthen the correlation are essential to a successful revision.

This may be consistent with the lack of increase in HDAC6 outside the TG in the NTG model.

We have performed two additional experiments in which mice are treated chronically with NTG/VEH for 9 days. On day 10 mice were injected with ACY-738 or vehicle and subsequently sacrificed 24 or 48 hrs post-treatment and the trigeminal nucleus caudalis was analyzed using Golgi staining. We find that the timing of the anti-allodynic effects of ACY-738 corresponds with its normalizing effect on neuronal cytoarchitecture. ACY-738 inhibits migraine-associated pain at 4 and 24h post-injection, and this effect is lost 48h post-injection. In terms of Golgi staining: at 4h, both vehicle-ACY and NTG-ACY groups show increased neuronal complexity (Figure 2), while at 24h only the NTG-ACY group has increased neuronal complexity (Figure 3C-E); and at 48h the NTG-ACY group is similar to the NTG-VEH group (ie decreased neuronal complexity relative to VEH-VEH controls, Figure 3F-H).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Experiments providing longitudinal data about NTG and ACY's effects on neuronal complexity or a demonstration that targeted inhibition of HDAC6 during NTG administration prevents chronic allodynia would greatly strengthen the connection.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this, we performed an additional experiment in which ACY-738 was administered following each NTG injection in the chronic migraine paradigm. In this case, chronic treatment with ACY-738 prevented the development of NTG-induced allodynia (NTG-VEH vs NTG-ACY738, Figure 4D). These data indicate that sustained HDAC6 inhibition can prevent the development of chronic-migraine associated pain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please clarify how and to what extent blinding was achieved (e.g. with respect to testing for allodynia and drug administration).</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated this in the methods.

These stack images allow for accurate tracing even in the cases where there are some partial overlap of neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The lack of change in the dorsal horn suggests that NTG selectively activates the trigeminal pain system, but there is no mechanism by which this could easily be explained.

At the very least it would be informative to know whether the observed findings occur in upper cervical DRG or whether they are entirely restricted to the trigeminal system.</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed. We could not use Golgi stain on ganglia neurons (TG or dorsal root ganglia), however, we did examine the cervical spinal cord. We determined if chronic NTG resulted in altered neuronal cytoarchitecture in the dorsal horn of C1-C3. Similar to the lumbar spinal cord we did not observe any significant difference between vehicle and NTG treated groups (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). These results suggest that in this model altered cytoarchitectural dynamics are more prominent in the brain and not necessarily throughout the whole pain circuit. Future studies will investigate how neuronal plasticity is altered in some regions, but not others.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to the above question, does ACY increase acetylated α-tubulin in the NAc and spinal cord, or are these effects specific to the TG, TNC, and cortex?</p></disp-quote><p>Additional experiments were added to examine the effect of ACY-738 on tubulin in both the nucleus accumbens and the spinal cord. In both regions we saw an increase in acetylated tubulin following administration of ACY-738. This indicates that the effects of increased acetylated tubulin are not specific to migraine specific areas. Please see Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Sample western blots for Supplementary Figure 2 should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We have adjusted this figure, now called Figure 2—figure supplement 1, accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For the Discussion:</p><p>Several figures show that ACY increases neuronal complexity in sham animals.

In other words, there is no requirement that HDAC6 be elevated in a specific region for neuronal complexity to decrease, because HDAC6 inhibition will increase neuronal complexity globally, regardless of levels of expression. This requires more discussion as it changes the interpretation and framing of the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>Although HDAC6 inhibitor does increase neuronal complexity in vehicle treated groups, this increased trophism does not result in any behavioral consequence in the endpoints measured. In addition, the time course that we have added to this manuscript show that this effect in the vehicle group is short lasting (4h) relative to ACY treatment in the NTG group (24h). We have updated the discussion to reflect the point that HDAC6 inhibition might be one of many ways in which blunted neuronal complexity associated with chronic migraine can be corrected. Importantly, as HDAC6 directly affects tubulin dynamics, HDAC6 inhibitors represent a more targeted strategy to restore neuronal complexity. Our findings open the possibility of examining HDAC6 and other determinants of cytoarchitectural dynamics as potential migraine therapies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>You report that a single olcegepant treatment after 9 days of NTG attenuates behavior and normalizes structural changes within 4 hours.

Our data suggest that blunted neuronal complexity could be a characteristic of chronic migraine, and restoration of this complexity a sign of effective therapy. As mentioned in the above comment there appear to be multiple ways to restore neuronal complexity, including HDAC6 inhibition and CGRP antagonists. We have rewritten the Discussion to reflect this point, and future studies will focus on common processes/pathways between these mechanistically distinct targets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are the half-lives of the alternate HDAC inhibitors known? ACY has a 12 min half life and causes 24 hours of behavioral efficacy, but the other HDAC inhibitors effects were shorter lasting. It seems unlikely that their half-lives are shorter than 12 min, as this is already fairly rapid metabolism.</p></disp-quote><p>Preliminary measurement of both RN73 and ASV85 show that it is still present in the plasma and to a lesser extent the brain at 40 minutes post-injection. Only the 20 and 40 min time points have been measured and peak levels are seen at the earlier time point. ASV85 has a slightly better brain penetrance. We are happy to include this data in the Materials and methods, but it is preliminary.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Since acetylated tubulin is important for touch, and KO of a-TAT1 leads to profound deficits in touch, how do you know that there is relief of cephalic pain with HDAC6 inhibition vs. loss of touch sensation, thus affecting assays of mechanical allodynia?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer brings up a good point, which we have now addressed in the discussion. In mice chronically treated with vehicle (control for NTG), acute ACY-738 does not affect mechanical thresholds at 4, 24, or 72h (Figure 3A). In addition, even when ACY-738 is given chronically we do not observe any change in the ACY-VEH group, and the NTG-ACY group maintains normal mechanical responses (Figure 4D), while a loss of sensation may result in a seemingly antinociceptive effect. Furthermore, three other groups have used the same and different HDAC6 inhibitors and none report changes in responding in control groups.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Consider a discussion about how an intervention that increases neurite growth might decrease CSD frequency. It also appears that CSD duration is increased with HDAC6 inhibition.</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed. We have added to the discussion on how HDAC6 inhibition may disrupt the wave path of CSD events.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, how does a reduction in TNC neurites explain the physiological increase in TNC activity seen in other rodent models of headache (and in humans)?</p></disp-quote><p>In the discussion we outline a few possible mechanisms for how reduced neuronal complexity could still result in increased activity in these head pain-processing regions. For example, decreases neuronal complexity would not only weaken or prevent some neuronal connections/synapses, the decreased flexibility may also strengthen other synapses as the neuron might be in a more fixed state. The strengthening of these synapses would still be measured as increased neuronal activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Both males and female mice were used- is there a sex difference in the results?</p></disp-quote><p>We analyzed our data carefully for sex differences but did not find anything significant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please ensure full statistical reporting within the manuscript, e.g., t values, f values, degrees of freedom, p values etc.</p></disp-quote><p>Greater specificity and statistical reporting was added to the figure legends to better convey our findings.</p></body></sub-article></article>
