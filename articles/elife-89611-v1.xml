brain neuropil and vice versa. In models of brain injury, BBB dysfunction and the associated leakage of serum albumin to the neuropil have been shown to induce pathological plasticity, neuronal hyper-excitability, and seizures. The effect of neuronal activity on BBB function and whether it plays a role in plasticity in the healthy brain remain unclear. Here we show that neuronal activity induces modulation of microvascular permeability in the healthy brain and that it has a role in local network reorganization. Combining simultaneous electrophysiological recording and vascular imaging with transcriptomic analysis in rats, and functional and BBB-mapping MRI in human subjects, we show that prolonged stimulation of the limb induces a focal increase in BBB permeability in the corresponding somatosensory cortex that is associated with long-term synaptic plasticity. We further show that the increased microvascular permeability depends on neuronal activity and involves caveolae-mediated transcytosis and transforming growth factor β signaling. Our results reveal a role of BBB modulation in cortical plasticity in the healthy brain, highlighting the importance of neurovascular interactions for sensory experience and learning.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>synaptic plasticity</kwd><kwd>blood–brain barrier</kwd><kwd>magnetic resonance imaging</kwd><kwd>caveolae-mediated transcytosis</kwd><kwd>albumin</kwd><kwd>transforming growth factor β</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>717/15</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Friedman</surname><given-names>Alon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2254/20</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Friedman</surname><given-names>Alon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJT 148896</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Friedman</surname><given-names>Alon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Research Area Network</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NDD 168164</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Friedman</surname><given-names>Alon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neuronal activity modulates blood–brain barrier permeability, influencing synaptic plasticity and local network reorganization in the healthy brain.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The intricate components comprising the blood–brain barrier (BBB) regulate the bi-directional transport of molecules between the brain and the circulatory system and maintain the extracellular environment needed for normal function of the neurovascular unit (NVU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chow and Gu, 2015</xref>). Dysfunction of the BBB is common in many neurological disorders and is associated with impaired cross-BBB influx and efflux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Obermeier et al., 2013</xref>). For example, seizures were shown to increase cross-BBB influx of serum albumin in a process partially mediated by excessive release of neuronal glutamate and subsequent activation of <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vazana et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Emerging evidence suggests that cross-BBB influx/efflux may also change in response to physiological neuronal activity in the healthy brain: (1) whisker stimulation (1 hr, 2 Hz) was shown to increase BBB influx of insulin-like growth factor-I in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nishijima et al., 2010</xref>); (2) physiological neuronal activity was shown to regulate BBB efflux transport in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pulido et al., 2020</xref>); and (3) circadian rhythms were shown to alter BBB efflux in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>) and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pulido et al., 2020</xref>). However, the mechanisms and the role of these physiological changes in BBB properties are not known.</p><p>Here, we sought to test whether physiological BBB modulation may involve mechanisms previously linked to pathological BBB changes, for example, transcytosis of serum albumin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ivens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Seiffert et al., 2004</xref>) and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">David et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heinemann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ivens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Weissberg et al., 2015</xref>). As TGF-β signaling has been linked to synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dahlmanns et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gradari et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Patel and Weaver, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Weissberg et al., 2015</xref>), we also explored the hypothesis that physiological BBB modulation may be associated with neuroplasticity. Lastly, we sought to provide the first evidence for physiological BBB modulation in humans.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Stimulation increases BBB permeability</title><p>To test for changes in BBB permeability in response to stimulation, we combined electrophysiological recordings with BBB imaging using intravital microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, see timeline of stimuli in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). First, we localized vascular response to sensory stimulation using wide-field imaging of arterial diameter and monitoring change in total hemoglobin (HbT) signal during a 1 min stimulation of the limb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b–d</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bouchard et al., 2009</xref>). Fluorescent angiography before and immediately after 30 min of limb stimulation showed local extravasation of the tracer sodium fluorescein (NaFlu) around the responding blood vessels, indicative of BBB leakage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f and g</xref>). Histological analysis confirmed the presence of NaFlu in the extravascular space around small vessels in the somatosensory cortex, contralateral (and not ipsilateral) to the stimulated limb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1m and n</xref>). Next, we intravenously injected a separate cohort of rats with either the albumin-binding dye Evans blue (EB) or albumin conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (Alexa488-Alb) without performing craniotomy. Brain extravasation of both dyes was found in the contralateral hemisphere, indicating the presence of serum albumin in the neuropil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h–k</xref>). ELISA performed in cortical tissue at different time points after stimulation confirmed a higher concentration of albumin in the stimulated sensorimotor cortex early after stimulation (30 min) compared to non-stimulated sham controls, which declined 4 and 24 hr post-stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1l</xref>). As a positive control, brain tissues were also prepared from rats subjected to photothrombosis (PT)-induced ischemia (see ‘Materials and methods’). Albumin concentrations in the peri-ischemic cortex 24 hr following PT were significantly higher compared to sham and all time points after stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>).

In rats, we show that prolonged paw stimulation results in increased cross-BBB extravasation of both low- and high-molecular-weight tracers. We also show that this extravasation is (1) focal and localized to the cortical area corresponding to the stimulation; (2) mediated by AMPA neurotransmission, TGF-β signaling, and caveolae transcytosis; and (3) associated with synaptic potentiation and increased postsynaptic density. In humans, we present the first evidence for increased BBB permeability in response to prolonged limb activity. Together, our results suggest that stimulation-induced BBB modulation may play a role in synaptic potentiation.</p><p>Physiological changes in cross-BBB transport have been previously reported in response to whisker stimulation, circadian rhythms, and age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nishijima et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pulido et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we examined whether the mechanisms involved in this process may include those identified in our studies of pathological BBB modulation. Previous studies from our group showed that brain injury is associated with albumin transcytosis, albumin binding to TGF-βR in astrocytes, and pathological TGF-β-mediated plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Salar et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we show that prolonged physiological sensorimotor activation is also associated with albumin extravasation (although at a significantly lower concentration than under pathological conditions; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1l</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>) and TGF-βR signaling. We further show that blocking caveolae-mediated albumin transcytosis or TGF-βR signaling inhibits stimulation-evoked increase in BBB permeability and synaptic potentiation (without affecting the physiological hemodynamic response). These results suggest that caveolae albumin transcytosis and TGF-β signaling are key mediators of activity-dependent BBB modulation and subsequent synaptic plasticity. These findings are supported by reports linking TGF-β signaling to synaptic plasticity induced by environmental enrichment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dahlmanns et al., 2023</xref>; enhanced spine and synapse formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Patel and Weaver, 2021</xref>; and hippocampal neuroplasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gradari et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, our finding of caveolae-mediated albumin transcytosis in pial arterioles is in line with previous studies showing caveolae-dependent transcytosis of albumin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tecedor et al., 2013</xref>; caveolae abundance in arteriolar ECs and not capillary ECs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chow et al., 2020</xref>; and the contribution of caveolae transcytosis to NVC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andreone et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chow et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, in our experiments, caveolae inhibition prevented BBB modulation yet did not significantly affect NVC, likely due to the contribution of other vasodilatory pathways such as endothelial nitric oxide synthase.</p><p>As mentioned above, albumin is a known activator of TGF-β signaling, and TGF-β has a well-established role in neuroplasticity. Interestingly, emerging evidence suggests that TGF-β also increases cross-BBB transcytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Betterton et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaplan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McMillin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schumacher et al., 2023</xref>). Hence, we propose the following two-part hypothesis for the TGF-β/BBB-mediated synaptic potentiation observed in our experiments: (1) prolonged stimulation triggers TGF-β signaling and increased CMT of albumin; and (2) extravasated albumin induces further TGF-β signaling, leading to synaptogenesis and additional cross-BBB transport in a self-reinforcing positive feedback loop. Future research is needed to examine the validity of this hypothesis.</p><p>Our study also shows that physiological BBB modulation requires AMPAR glutamate signaling and not NMDA. This finding is consistent with studies showing the dominant role of AMPAR in electrophysiological and hemodynamic responses to somatosensory stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Graves et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gsell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, the well-established role of AMPAR in neuroplasticity, LTP, and experience-dependent sensory cortical plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Daw et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feldman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Watt et al., 2004</xref>) further supports the plasticity-related role of activity-dependent BBB modulation.</p><p>Our gene analysis was designed to complement our in vivo and histological findings by assessing the magnitude of change in DEGs. This analysis showed that (1) the hemisphere contralateral to the stimulus has significantly more DEGs than the ipsilateral hemisphere; and (2) the DEGs were related to synaptic plasticity and TGF-β signaling. These findings strengthen the hypothesis raised by our experiments.</p><p>Our animal experiments show that a 30 min limb stimulation (at 6 Hz and 2 mA) increases cross-BBB influx, while a 1 min stimulation (of similar frequency and magnitude) does not. We argue that both types of stimulations fall within the physiological range because in rats activity between 5 and 15 Hz represents physiological rhythmic whisker movement during environment exploration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mégevand et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, our continuous electrophysiological recordings showed no signs of epileptiform or otherwise pathological activity and the recorded SEP levels were similar to those reported in previous LTP studies in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eckert and Abraham, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Han et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mégevand et al., 2009</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McGregor et al., 2016</xref>). In humans, skill acquisition often involves motor training sessions that last ≥30 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bengtsson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Classen et al., 1998</xref>) and result in physiological plasticity of sensory and motor systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Classen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Draganski et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sagi et al., 2012</xref>). Hence, the experimental task in our human study (30 min of repetitive squeezing of an elastic stress ball) is likely to represent physiological learning task involving neuronal activation in primarily motor and sensory areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Halder et al., 2005</xref>). Future human and animal studies are needed to explore the BBB modulating effects of additional stimulation protocols, with varying durations, frequencies, and magnitudes. Such studies may also elucidate the temporal and ultrastructural characteristics that differentiate between physiological and pathological BBB modulation.</p><p>A key limitation of our animal experiments is the fact they were performed under anesthesia due to the complex nature of the experimental setup (i.e., simultaneous cortical imaging and electrophysiological recordings). Anesthetic agents can potentially alter neuronal activity, SEPs, CBF, and vascular responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aksenov et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lindauer et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Masamoto and Kanno, 2012</xref>). To minimize these effects, we used ketamine-xylazine anesthesia, which, unlike other anesthetics, was shown to maintain robust BOLD and SEP responses to neuronal activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Franceschini et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shim et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, the antagonistic effect of ketamine on NMDA receptors might attenuate the magnitude of SEP potentiation recorded in our experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anis et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Salt et al., 1988</xref>).</p><p>Another limitation of our animal study is the potentially non-specific effect of mβCD – an agent that disrupts caveola transport but may also lead to cholesterol depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Keller and Simons, 1998</xref>). To mitigate this issue, we used a very low mβCD concentration (10 μM), orders of magnitude below the concentration reported to deplete cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Koudinov and Koudinova, 2001</xref>). Lastly, our animal study is limited by the inclusion of solely male rats. While our findings in humans did not point to sex-related differences in stimulation-evoked BBB modulation, larger animals and human studies are needed to examine this question.</p><p>To conclude, our study suggests that BBB modulation in response to physiological neuronal activity involves mechanisms previously identified in pathology-induced BBB changes (despite the significantly smaller increase in cross-BBB influx under physiological conditions). Our findings further suggest that physiological modulation of cross-BBB influx may play a role in synaptic plasticity, calling for future research into the dynamics of BBB function in health and disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study design</title><p>This study included rat and human experiments.

Briefly, image registration and segmentation were performed to produce a binary image, separating blood vessels from extravascular regions.

To determine whether an extravascular pixel had tracer accumulation over time (due to BBB permeability), the pixel’s intensity curve was divided by that of the responding artery (i.e., the arterial input function, representing tracer input). This ratio was termed the BBB permeability index (PI), and extravascular pixels with PI &gt; 1 were identified as pixels with tracer accumulation due to BBB permeability.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Histology and immunohistochemistry</title><p>Albumin extravasation was confirmed histologically in separate cohorts of rats that were anesthetized and stimulated without craniotomy surgery.

the authors’ response to the previous reviews</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The goal of the current study was to evaluate the effect of neuronal activity on blood-brain barrier permeability in the healthy brain, and to determine whether changes in BBB dynamics play a role in cortical plasticity. The authors used a variety of well-validated approaches to first demonstrate that limb stimulation increases BBB permeability. Using in vivo-electrophysiology and pharmacological approaches, the authors demonstrate that albumin is sufficient to induce cortical potentiation and that BBB transporters are necessary for stimulus-induced potentiation. The authors include a transcriptional analysis and differential expression of genes associated with plasticity, TGF-beta signaling, and extracellular matrix were observed following stimulation. Overall, the results obtained in rodents are compelling and support the authors' conclusions that neuronal activity modulates the BBB in the healthy brain and that mechanisms downstream of BBB permeability changes play a role in stimulus-evoked plasticity. These findings were further supported with fMRI and BBB permeability measurements performed in healthy human subjects performing a simple sensorimotor task. There is literature to suggest that there are sex differences in BBB dysfunction in pathophysiological conditions and the authors have acknowledged the use of only males as a minor limitation of the study that should be addressed in the future. Future studies should also test whether the upregulation of OAT3 plays a role in cortical plasticity observed following stimulation. Overall, this study provides novel insights into how neurovascular coupling, BBB permeability, and plasticity interact in the healthy brain.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study builds upon previous work that demonstrated that brain injury results in leakage of albumin across the blood brain barrier, resulting in activation of TGF-beta in astrocytes. Consequently, this leads to decreased glutamate uptake, reduced buffering of extracellular potassium and hyperexcitability. This study asks whether such a process can play a physiological role in cortical plasticity. They first show that stimulation of a forelimb for 30 minutes in a rat results in leakage of the blood brain barrier and extravasation of albumin on the contralateral but not ipsilateral cortex. The authors propose that the leakage is dependent upon neuronal excitability and is associated with an enhancement of excitatory transmission. Inhibiting the transport of albumin or the activation of TGF-beta prevents the enhancement of excitatory transmission. In addition, gene expression associated with TGF-beta activation, synaptic plasticity and extracellular matrix are enhanced on the &quot;stimulated&quot; hemisphere. That this may translate to humans is demonstrated by a break down in the blood brain barrier following activation of brain areas through a motor task.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This study is novel and the results are potentially important as they demonstrate an unexpected break down of the blood brain barrier with physiological activity and this may serve a physiological purpose, affecting synaptic plasticity.</p><p>The strengths of the study are:</p><p>(1) The use of an in vivo model with multiple methods to investigate the blood brain barrier response to a forelimb stimulation.</p><p>(2) The determination of a potential functional role for the observed leakage of the blood brain barrier from both a genetic and electrophysiological view point</p><p>(3) The demonstration that inhibiting different points in the putative pathway from activation of the cortex to transport of albumin and activation of the TGF-beta pathway, the effect on synaptic enhancement could be prevented. (4) Preliminary experiments demonstrating a similar observation of activity dependent break down of the blood brain barrier in humans.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The authors adequately addressed most of my points. A few remain:</p><p>(1) Although the reviewers have addressed the possible effects of anaesthesia on neuro-vascular coupling. They have not mentioned or addressed the possible effects of ketamine (an NMDA receptor antagonist) on synaptic plasticity. Indeed, the low percentage of SEP increase following potentiation (10-20%) could perhaps be explained by partial block of NMDA receptors by ketamine.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and apologize for this oversight. This important issue is now addressed in the Discussion.</p><p>“Notably, the antagonistic effect of ketamine on NMDA receptors might attenuate the magnitude of SEP potentiation recorded in our experiments (Anis et al., 1983; Salt et al., 1988).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The experimental paradigms remain unclear to me. Now, it appears that drugs are applied for 50 minutes and that the stimulation occurs during the &quot;washout period&quot;. The more conventional approach would be to have the drug application during the stimulation period to determine if the drugs occlude or enhance the effects of stimulation and then washout the drugs. The problem is that drugs variably washout at different rates depending upon their lipid solubility.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the more conventional approach would have been to continue applying the drug throughout the experiment and that differential rates of washout may add variability to our experiments. However, despite this limitation, within each treatment group we found that the SEP response at 50 minutes (immediately after the drug application window) does not differ from SEP response at 80 minutes (after 30 minutes of stimulation and washout) [Figure 3H&amp;G]. This suggests that the drug effects were still present despite terminating drug application and performing potentiation-inducing stimulation. Moreover, our analysis showed that animals within each treatment group (except AP5) had similar SEP responses with little intra-group variability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) It is still not clear to what extent the experimenters and those doing the analysis were blinded to group. If one or both were blind to group, then please put this in the methods.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. We revised the Methods section to clearly confirm that data was collected and analyzed blindly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study used prolonged stimulation of a limb to examine possible plasticity in somatosensory evoked potentials induced by the stimulation.

We believe that both types of stimulations fall within the physiological range because our continuous electrophysiological recordings showed no signs of epileptiform or otherwise pathological activity. Moreover, the recorded SEP levels were similar to those reported in previous physiological LTP studies in rats (Eckert &amp; Abraham, 2010; Han et al., 2015; Mégevand et al., 2009) and humans (McGregor et al., 2016). In humans, skill acquisition often involves motor training sessions that last ≥30 minutes (Bengtsson et al., 2005; Classen et al., 1998) and result in physiological plasticity of sensory and motor systems (Classen et al., 1998; Draganski et al., 2004; Sagi et al., 2012). Hence, the experimental task in our human study (30 minutes of repetitive squeezing of an elastic stress-ball) is likely to represent physiological activity, with neuronal activation in primarily motor and sensory areas (Halder et al., 2005). Future human and animal studies are needed to explore the BBB modulating effects of additional stimulation protocols – with varying durations, frequencies, and magnitudes. Such studies may also elucidate the temporal and ultrastructural characteristics that differentiate between physiological and pathological BBB modulation. “</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors need to ensure other aspects of the rebuttal are as clear in the paper as in the rebuttal too.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. This was addressed in the revised paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The only remaining concern that is significant is that it is hard to understand the figures.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. We revised the figures according to the reviewer’s recommendations. We hope that these changes increase the legibility of the figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The manuscript is improved but there are still suggestions that do not appear to have been addressed.

This explanation is not convincing because a LFP would not necessarily show a depolarization ship. Another argument of a discussion of the event as a seizure is warranted. Note that expanding the trace might also show it is unlike a seizure. Regarding the idea that 6Hz 2 mA stimuli for 30 min are physiological, the authors make three arguments which are not clear. First, no epileptiform activity was found, but in Fig. 1 it looks like a seizure occurred. Second, memory and skill acquisition in humans open involve a similar training duration - but what about 6Hz 2 mA?</p></disp-quote><p>Rats are known to rhythmically move their whiskers at frequencies ranging between 5 and 15 Hz (Mégevand et al., 2009). We agree that there is no clear way to justify the similarity between the experimental design in humans and rats. However, we believe that both paradigms (paw stimulation in rats and ball squeeze in humans) represent non-pathological input that we found to modulate barrier permeability. This argument was added to the discussion of the paper:</p><p>“We believe that both types of stimulations fall within the physiological range because in rats, activity between 515 Hz represents physiological rhythmic whisker movement during environment exploration (Mégevand et al., 2009).”</p><p>Seizures are typically induced in rats via direct tetanic stimulation of the brain (at 50 Hz and 0.3-2.5mA) or maximal electroshock test to the cornea (at 50 Hz and 150 mA) (Swinyard et al., 1952). We, therefore, assert that the activity we observe represents physiological responses and not seizures. This argument is beyond the scope of the current paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please note a limitation is that the high level of serum albumin is unlikely to be physiological but may not have been as high in the animal because of the low diffusion rate and degradation (please add the refs in the rebuttal).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, we added the following to the Results section:</p><p>“The relatively high concentration of albumin was chosen to account for factors that lower its effective tissue concentration such as its low diffusion rate and its likelihood to encounter a degradation site or a cross-BBB efflux transporter (Tao &amp; Nicholson, 1996; Zhang &amp; Pardridge, 2001).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig. 1.</p><p>Please consider a box in b to show where the expanded traces in the lower row came from.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion.

We now included an explanation that “an excerpt of the stimulation trace is shown above the middle LFP trace”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c and d are very different field potentials in shape and therefore hard to compare. The rebuttal addresses this but the explanation is not in the revised text.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that there is variability in SEP responses between animals. We now added a statement acknowledging this in the methods section: “To overcome potential variability in SEP morphology between animals (Mégevand et al., 2009), each animal’s plasticity measures (max amplitude and AUC of post stimulation SEP) were compared to the same measures at baseline.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In d, it is not clear there is potentiation because the traces are not aligned.</p></disp-quote><p>All panels depicting SEP traces represent raw data with no alignment. The shift observed in panel d exemplifies why we compare post-stimulation parameters of max amplitude and area under curve to baseline in each animal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Exact P values are said to have been added in the rebuttal but they were not.</p></disp-quote><p>Exact P values appear in Figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) b. Use arrows to mark the area of interest.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We added a white circle to mark the area of tracer accumulation similar to Figure 1f.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d. Why is there an oscillation superimposed on all traces except CNQX?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an interesting question. Future studies should determine the source of this SEP pattern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) What does the line and the number 2 mean? How were data normalized? What was counted? What area of cortex?</p></disp-quote><p>The number 2 refers to the scale bar line, meaning a log fold change of 2 reflects the size of the scale bar line.</p><p>The plot shows the log fold change against the mean count of each gene in the contralateral somatosensory cortex between 1 and 24 hours after stimulation.</p><p>The x axis title was changed to “mean expression” and the legend was modified to:</p><p>“Scatter plot of gene expression from RNA-seq in the contralateral somatosensory cortex 24 vs. 1 h after 30 min stimulation. The y axis represents the log fold change, and the x axis represents the mean expression levels (see methods, RNA Sequencing &amp; Bioinformatics). Blue dots indicate statistically significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by Wald Test (n = 8 rats per group).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How were the pericytes, smooth muscle cells, ,etc. distinguished?</p></disp-quote><p>This was explained under Methods-&gt;RNA Sequencing &amp; Bioinformatics: “Analysis of cell-specific and vascular zonation genes was performed as described (Vanlandewijck et al., 2018), using the database provided in (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://betsholtzlab.org/VascularSingleCells/database.html">http://betsholtzlab.org/VascularSingleCells/database.html</ext-link>)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What were the chi square statistics? If there were cells used instead of rats, please justify.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. The legend was expanded to include the following:</p><p>“The contralateral somatosensory cortex was found to have a significantly higher number of DEGs related to synaptic plasticity, than the ipsilateral side (***p&lt;0.001, Chi-square).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) b. what do the icons mean?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the icons were confusing. We simplified this panel to just show when participants were asked to squeeze the ball (black icon). This explanation was added to the Figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Abbreviations?</p></disp-quote><p>Abbreviations of MRI protocols were added to the figure legend for clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In c-e what are the units of measure? Fold-change?</p></disp-quote><p>The units represent t-statistics values for each voxel. The label ‘t-statistic’ was added to the figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What are the white Iines, + and - signs?</p></disp-quote><p>The white lines point to voxels of highest activation (t-statistic). This was added to the legend.</p><p>And these are not +/- signs these are voxels with significant activation which only appear similar.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>f. Please explain f and g for clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. The explanation was modified for added clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Supplemental Fig. 4.</p><p>Original question: If ipsilateral and contralateral showed many changes why do the authors think the effects were only contralateral?</p><p>The authors replied: Our gene analysis was designed to complement our in vivo and histological findings, by assessing the magnitude of change in differentially expressed genes (DEGs). This analysis showed that: (1) the hemisphere contralateral to the stimulus has significantly more DEGs than the ipsilateral hemisphere; and (2) the DEGs were related to synaptic plasticity and TGF-b signaling. These findings strengthen the hypothesis raised by our in vivo and histological experiments.</p><p>Could the authors clarify the answer to the question in the text?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you.
