Identification of their genetic and molecular basis is challenging, limiting their diagnosis and treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferreira, 2019</xref>). Knowledge of tissues and cell types that manifest with pathophysiological changes in patients was shown to facilitate the understanding of disease mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hekselman and Yeger-Lotem, 2020</xref>). For example, transcriptomic analysis of muscle tissues helped to genetically diagnose patients with rare muscle disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cummings et al., 2017</xref>). Likewise, identification of a rare cell type affected by cystic fibrosis opened new avenues for treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Montoro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Plasschaert et al., 2018</xref>). However, whereas affected tissues may be evident for many Mendelian diseases, the exact cell types that manifest with pathophysiological changes within affected tissues are often unknown.</p><p>Owing to massive single-cell profiling of mammalian tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jones et al., 2022</xref>), investigation of diseases in cellular contexts has become feasible. In particular, it was shown that genes whose aberration leads to disease (i.e., disease genes) tend to be expressed preferentially in cell types that express pathology (denoted disease-affected cell types). For instance, 21/29 mouse homologs of human disease genes associated with nephrotic syndrome were shown to be upregulated in podocytes, the disease-relevant renal cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Park et al., 2018</xref>). In an inspiring manner, cell-type-specific expression of the cystic fibrosis gene CFTR in ionocytes of human and mouse airways revealed their role in cystic fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Montoro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Plasschaert et al., 2018</xref>). Likewise, the preferential expression of disease genes for 18 Mendelian muscle disorders revealed disease-affected muscle cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eraslan et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, preferential expression of disease genes may serve as an indicator of disease-affected cell types, and has the potential to shed light on the cellular mechanisms that underlie Mendelian diseases.</p><p>Preferential expression of disease- and trait-associated genes has been used to illuminate cell types affected by complex traits in previously published studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eraslan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jagadeesh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim-Hellmuth et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rouhana et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rouhana et al., 2021</xref>, presented the ECLIPSER method, which tested whether the expression of genes mapped to trait-associated loci was enriched in specific cell types of a given tissue, when compared to a background set of genes associated with unrelated traits. The CSEA-DB repository applied a cell-type-specific enrichment analysis (CSEA): They assessed cell-type specificity of genes using t-statistics, and then tested whether the top 5% cell-type-specific genes were overrepresented in trait-associated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dai et al., 2021</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eraslan et al., 2022</xref>, associated traits to relevant cell types by defining cell-type-specific gene modules and assessing their overlap with trait-associated genes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>, introduced a polygenic single-cell disease relevance score (scDRS), which identified cells exhibiting excess expression of trait-associated genes. Interestingly, expression of trait-associated genes was weighted by trait-association and inversely by technical noise level in single-cell expression data, and the resulting polygenic scDRS score was compared to empirical distribution of control gene sets and all cells. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jagadeesh et al., 2022</xref>, presented sc-linker, which constructed continuous-valued gene sets that were differentially expressed in a cell type from healthy samples versus other cell types or versus the same cell type from disease samples, and then linked them to trait-related SNPs. Additional studies compared the differential expression of genes in cell types of diseased versus healthy tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mathys et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Segerstolpe et al., 2016</xref>) and showed that many trait-associated genes were cell-type specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Smillie et al., 2019</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guan et al., 2021</xref>, defined cell-type specific gene interaction modules, which were overlapped with disease-associated genes. Lastly, the SC2disease database compared gene expression differences between cell types of diseased and healthy samples, among cell types of diseased samples, and among cell types of samples with varying degree of disease severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhao et al., 2021</xref>). However, most efforts rarely validated or corroborated the inferred associations in an extensive manner.</p><p>Here, we developed a method that infers disease-affected cell types from the Preferential Expression of Disease genes in Cell Types (PrEDiCT). The summarized preferential expression of disease genes was compared to empirical distribution of control gene sets in the same cell type, allowing for the inference of associations between diseases and likely affected cell types. We applied PrEDiCT to 1,140 Mendelian diseases that manifest in six human tissues and inferred likely affected cell types for 328 diseases. We corroborated our findings by text-mining of PubMed records, expert curation, and by their recapitulation in mice. The resulting scheme and large-scale resource allowed us to show that diseases manifesting in multiple tissues tend to affect similar cell types, to refine inference of disease-affected cell types by focusing on gene functions, and to explore characteristics of disease-affected cell types.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Preferential expression of disease genes indicates disease-affected cell types</title><p>To identify the cell types affected by Mendelian diseases with known disease genes, we developed the PrEDiCT scoring scheme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

We focused on tissues with two or more samples with ≥800 sequenced cells that were also sequenced in mice [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tabula Muris, 2018</xref>); Methods]. Tissues included bone marrow, lung, skeletal muscle, spleen, tongue and trachea, and altogether were comprised of 129 cell types. Next, we associated these tissues with Mendelian diseases that affect them, based on their phenotypic abnormality annotations in Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) database [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Köhler et al., 2021</xref>); Methods]. To assess the reliability of HPO annotations we compared them to manually curated annotations that were available in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://netbio.bgu.ac.il/odisea/">ODiseA</ext-link> database [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hekselman et al., 2022</xref>); Methods]. This asserted 490 of 649 (76%) annotations available for these diseases in ODiseA, supporting the usage of HPO as an indicator of the disease-affected tissue. We then gathered the respective disease genes from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Men (OMIM) database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amberger et al., 2019</xref>). Overall, 1140 diseases and 2434 disease genes were associated to at least one affected tissue, with the majority associated to skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>To calculate PrEDiCT scores, we computed the preferential expression of disease genes in each cell type relative to other cell types of the disease-affected tissue (Methods). Next, we set the PrEDiCT score of a disease in each cell type to the median preferential expression of the respective disease genes. Statistical significance of the score was determined using a permutation test (Methods; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). In total, we analyzed 34,249 disease–cell-type associations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). PrEDiCT score distribution is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>.</p><p>We identified 489 (1.4%) ‘likely’ associations (PrEDiCT ≥ 1, FDR &lt;0.1), covering 328/1140 diseases and 102/129 cell types. Although most likely associations involved diseases with a single disease gene, the fraction of diseases with likely associations was higher for diseases with multiple disease genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). As proof-of-concept, primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), which has 31 disease genes expressed in lung and is characterized by damaged ciliary machinery in lung ciliated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Leigh et al., 2019</xref>), was indeed likely associated with lung ciliated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Additionally, Heinz body anemias, which is characterized by accumulation of inclusion bodies in erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Herman et al., 2023</xref>), was indeed likely associated with bone marrow erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Lastly, compatible with the high demand for mitochondrial activity in muscle cells, four out of five mitochondrial complex deficiencies were likely associated with slow and fast muscle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). ‘Mitochondrial complex II deficiency’ also scored highest in slow and fast muscle cells yet its PrEDiCT scores were insignificant, potentially due to the stringency of our statistical analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). As a negative control, gracile bone dysplasia that might manifest with ankyloglossia (also known as ‘tongue-tie’) is not expected to inflict on cell types of tongue tissue, and indeed no likely affected cell-type was detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Likewise, platelet-type bleeding disorder, which affects bone-marrow–derived platelets, had no likely affected cell-type in bone-marrow since platelets and their precursor cells (megakaryocytes) were missing from that tissue.</p><p>To assess at larger scale whether likely associations indicate disease-affected cell types, we turned to literature text-mining and to expert annotations. For text-mining, we postulated that diseases and their affected cell types will co-appear in the literature more frequently than expected by chance. To estimate co-appearance, we extracted PubMed records mentioning a disease or a cell type in our dataset and tested the significance of the co-appearance of all disease–cell-type pairs (Methods). Records were extracted by using Biopython package, which retrieves up to 9,999 records per term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cock et al., 2009</xref>). We identified 229 ‘literature-supported’ pairs that co-appeared in the literature more often than expected by chance (adjusted p&lt;0.001, Chi-squared test; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). PCD, for example, co-appeared significantly with lung ciliated cells, as well as with respiratory goblet, mucous, and basal cells (the latter are precursors of the other three). Based on literature-supported pairs, we estimated the false-positive and false-negative rates. The false-positive rates for likely associations were low (Methods; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Likely disease–cell-type associations were enriched for literature supported pairs (41/489, 8.4%) relative to all disease–cell-type associations (229/34,249, 0.7%; p&lt;E-15, Fisher’s exact test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Lastly, we repeated the above analyses using expert-curated annotations of disease-affected cell types, showing a low false-positive rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>) and a higher enrichment for expert-curated associations (p=1.3E-4, Fisher’s exact test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>).

Altogether, we obtained 97 cell clusters across all six tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Sixteen clusters overlapped considerably with cell types annotated by Tabula Muris and were thus annotated similarly. We annotated the 81 remaining clusters by careful examination of the expression of known cell-type marker genes (Methods), thereby improving cell type annotation per tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). For instance, the number of annotated cell types in skeletal muscle increased from six to 19. Newly annotated cell types included clinically relevant cell types, such as basement-membrane residing fibroblasts that are a main source of different collagens and are essential for skeletal muscle physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kivirikko et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zou et al., 2008</xref>).

The impact of disease genes on the matching was negligible, as shown by repeating the identification of similar cell types upon excluding disease genes from the list of marker genes (Methods).</p><p>Next, we tested whether diseases affected matching cell types between human and mouse. For this, we calculated PrEDiCT scores in mouse cell types, based on expression of mouse orthologs of human disease genes. The distribution of PrEDiCT scores was similar between mouse and human, and included 380/24,638 (1.5%) likely disease–cell-type associations (PrEDiCT ≥ 1, FDR &lt; 0.1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). Compatible with our previous proof-of-concept cases in human, PCD likely affected mouse lung ciliated epithelial cells which match human lung ciliated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), and Heinz body anemias likely affected mouse bone marrow reticulocytes and erythroblasts which match human erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Likewise, four mitochondrial complex deficiencies likely affected mouse striated muscle cells, which matched human slow and fast muscle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Similar to the results in human, ‘mitochondrial complex II deficiency’ scored highest in these cell types, yet the scores were insignificant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We compared the PrEDiCT scores of all cell-type pairs of the corresponding tissues between the species.

We suspected that these diseases affect a cell type that is similar between the disease-manifesting tissues. To test this hypothesis, we identified matching cell types between tissues, and then examined whether cell types affected by the same disease were enriched for matching cell types. Matching cell types were identified using matchSCore2 package [Methods; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mereu et al., 2020</xref>)]. Overall, we identified 840 pairs of matching cell types between tissues, of which 52% were immunocytes, including macrophages, neutrophils, T cells, B cells, as well as endothelia and fibroblasts.

However, the same disease phenotype might arise from mechanisms with distinct cellular contexts. For example, the bone-marrow disease hyper-IgM immunodeficiency could arise from mutations in CD40 gene, affecting B cells, or mutations in CD40 ligand (CD40LG), affecting CD4 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yazdani et al., 2019</xref>). In such cases the PrEDiCT scheme might fail to infer the affected cell types. Indeed, only CD4 T cells were predicted as likely affected by hyper-IgM immunodeficiency (PrEDiCT = 1.6, FDR &lt;0.048). We hypothesized that the cellular context of such ‘multi-cellular diseases’ could be revealed by separately applying the PrEDiCT scheme to subsets of disease genes with distinct functions.</p><p>We first focused on diseases that alter intercellular communication. We identified seven diseases in our dataset that were caused by mutations in genes encoding ligands and their receptors. Next, we applied PrEDiCT scheme separately to ligands and to receptors (Methods). As expected, hyper-IgM immunodeficiency was found to likely affect naïve B cells through CD40 (receptor; PrEDiCT = 2.9, FDR = 0.06), and CD4αβ T cells through CD40LG (ligand; PrEDiCT = 3.7, FDR &lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Another example is autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, which is caused by mutations in laminin-α2 (LAMA2) or its receptor α-dystroglycan (DAG1). By applying PrEDiCT scheme without subdividing the disease genes, we could not infer any likely affected cell type. Yet, by separately applying PrEDiCT scheme to LAMA2 (ligand) and DAG1 (receptor), we inferred mesenchymal stem cells and satellite stem cells as the likely affected cell types, respectively (PrEDiCT = 3.8 and 3.7, FDR &lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Preferential expression of disease genes was previously explored in tissue contexts and was shown to characterize disease-affected tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barshir et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barshir et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hekselman and Yeger-Lotem, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lage et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sonawane et al., 2017</xref>). Recently, cell-type preferential expression has been used to highlight potentially-affected cell types for Mendelian diseases and complex traits, often in combination with cell-type regulatory information and enrichment analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eraslan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jagadeesh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim-Hellmuth et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhao et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rouhana et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). However, large-scale in-silico validation was rarely conducted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Montoro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Plasschaert et al., 2018</xref>). Here, in contrast, we corroborated likely disease-affected cell types by literature text-mining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), expert curation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), and recapitulation in mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>The use of PrEDiCT scheme to identify affected cell types has limitations. Aberrations in disease genes that are preferentially expressed in a cell type do not necessarily lead to disease phenotypes in that cell type, leading to erroneous annotation of disease-affected cell types. For example, metabolic–myopathy-associated genes were upregulated in adipocytes of both muscle and breast, yet only muscle adipocytes showed myopathy phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eraslan et al., 2022</xref>). To reduce the risk for erroneous annotations, we applied PrEDiCT only to cell types of disease-affected tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To enhance the robustness of likely associations, PrEDiCT scores included the cell-type preferential expression of all disease genes, similarly to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>. For PCD, the PrEDiCT score included 31 genes, and indeed pointed to known disease-affected cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Additionally, similarly to other RNA-based schemes, PrEDiCT is oblivious to post-translational regulation, and, since most available single-cell transcriptomic datasets do not contain full-length gene reads, PrEDiCT is also oblivious to cell-type preferential expression of alternatively spliced transcripts. Lastly, preferential expression is just one of several mechanisms that lead to tissue-selective disease manifestations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hekselman and Yeger-Lotem, 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, by applying PrEDiCT to 1,140 diseases and single cell transcriptomes of six distinct tissues, we revealed affected cell types for 29% of the Mendelian diseases in our dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Interestingly, this fits with previous observations that about 30% of Mendelian diseases manifest clinically in a tissue that overexpresses disease genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barshir et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barshir et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hekselman and Yeger-Lotem, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lage et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>We supported likely disease–cell-type associations by three lines of evidence. The first was text-mining of literature for co-appearance of diseases and cell-types. Text-mining enabled large-scale in-silico assessment, yet co-appearance could also reflect negative and/or speculative results. Our second line of evidence was expert curation. This analysis, although on a smaller scale, provided additional support for the relevance of likely associations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). The third line of evidence came from recapitulation of results using mouse single-cell data. Yet, since the patterns of variation across genes tend to be similar, mouse single-cell data did not provide statistically independent information. This could lead to more false-positive associations for diseases with a single disease gene. However, the fraction of associations that were recapitulated in mouse did not differ between diseases with a single or multiple disease genes, supporting this line of evidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Another caveat in the comparison between human and mouse was that gene expression data drove both PrEDiCT calculation and human-mouse cell-type matching. This caveat too had limited impact, since matched cell-types were almost identical upon excluding disease genes. Notably, it would be intriguing to integrate data obtained from human and mouse to increase discovery power in future applications. Altogether, the three lines of evidence provided complementary support for likely associations.</p><p>Overall, 328 diseases affected 102/129 cell types. Interestingly, there was no correlation between cell type prevalence and its likelihood to be affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In particular, endothelia were more likely to be affected by diseases than other prevalent cell classes, whereas immunocytes and epithelia were the least likely to be affected among the prevalent cell classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This suggests that these cell types are either more resilient than other cell types, or, alternatively, that their impairment is lethal to the organism. To analyze this further, a cross-tissue study of 20 human tissues showed that immunocytes had similar expression signatures across tissues, in accordance with their common functions, whereas endothelia had tissue-specific expression signatures that reflect their tissue-specialized roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jones et al., 2022</xref>). Hence, it seems that germline impairment of immunocytes is more likely lethal, whereas the tissue-specialization of endothelia limits the impact of their germline impairment and thus facilitates overall survival. Yet, our analyses focused on diseases and cell types from six specific tissues and thus were limited in scope. The generalizability of our observations therefore awaits analysis of larger sets of diseases and cell types. In the future, once single cell technologies could offer a comprehensive coverage of expressed genes per cell, it will also be intriguing to assess disease heterogeneity across cells within a cell type.</p><p>Our expansive resource of diseases and likely affected cell types could be used to interrogate disease etiologies. For example, we showed that mitochondrial diseases tend to affect muscle cells, in accordance with their energetic demands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Additionally, we showed that diseases inflicting on multiple tissues likely affect similar cell types among those tissues, thereby providing a mechanistic explanation for this phenomenon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Lastly, we demonstrated that the inference of likely affected cell types could be refined by applying PrEDiCT scheme separately to subsets of disease genes with distinct functions. For instance, by separately analyzing oncogenes and TSGs of heritable lung and trachea cancers, we found that oncogenes likely affect basal cells, and TSGs likely affect monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This could suggest that tissue-constructive cells are more susceptible to oncogene mutations, whereas protective cells, such as monocytes, are more susceptible to TSG mutations. The latter is consistent with the function of monocytes in the elimination of malignant transformation of cells in different tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Robinson et al., 2021</xref>). Another interesting subset of diseases are those that impair intercellular communication. A recent study explored the cell types affected by monogenic muscular disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eraslan et al., 2022</xref>). Consistent with their results, we found that autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy disrupts intercellular communication among muscle cell types, via mutations in the DAG1 receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Yet, by applying PrEDiCT separately to the ligand of DAG1, LAMA2, we also highlighted the involvement of mesenchymal stem cells in the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Urciuolo et al., 2013</xref>). By exploring disease genes in appropriate cellular context, we enhanced the mechanistic understanding of disease emergence.</p><p>The associations between diseases and affected cell types, though supported by literature and recapitulated in mice, remain putative. Experimental testing could be performed in human cell lines, or in mouse models, in light of the many shared cell types between human and mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These validation experiments have a huge potential to open new directions in disease research and accelerate cell-directed gene therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Human single-cell transcriptomics analysis</title><p>Single-cell transcriptomes were downloaded from Tabula Sapiens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jones et al., 2022</xref>). We focused on tissues that consisted of ≥2 samples with ≥800 cells and were sequenced in both human and mouse using microfluidic droplet-based 3’-end technology. These tissues included bone marrow, lung, skeletal muscle, spleen, tongue, and trachea. Analysis was done using Seurat package v4.0.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hao et al., 2021</xref>). Per tissue, gene expression levels were normalized cell-wise using the NormalizeData function. Henceforth, we considered only genes with normalized counts ≥ 0.05 in≥10% of cells of at least one cell type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9">Supplementary file 9</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Mouse single-cell transcriptomics analysis</title><p>Single-cell transcriptomes were downloaded from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tabula Muris, 2018</xref>. To improve the annotation of mouse cells from Tabula Muris, we reanalyzed the transcriptomic profiles of each tissue. First, we selected 2,000 variably expressed genes using FindVariableFeatures function in Seurat. The minimum and maximum average normalized expression of genes across cells were set to 0.05 and 3, respectively (mean.cutoff=c(0.05,3)). We scaled and centered the expression values of the variably expressed genes using ScaleData function, while correcting for the different samples (vars.to.regress=‘mouse.id’). Then, we projected their expression on all significant principal components (PCs; p&lt;0.001, JackStraw test) ordered by their explained variance.</p><p>Next, we applied a two-phase clustering process. We clustered cells using Seurat FindNeighbors and FindClusters functions based on all the top significant PCs. To resolve over-clustering of cells, we hierarchically ordered cell clusters using BuildClusterTree function. Then, we tested whether cells from different splits in the tree were distinguishable, according to out-of-bag error of a random forest classifier that was trained on variably expressed genes. Indistinguishable cell clusters (p≥0.05) were merged. To estimate sample-based differences between related clusters, we repeated hierarchically ordering of merged cell clusters. Terminal splits of cell clusters that included uneven numbers of cells from different samples (adjusted p&lt;0.001, Chi-square) were merged. Such differences were observed only in tongue and lung tissues. Gene expression normalization and average calculations were applied as described for human tissues. Henceforth, we considered only genes with normalized counts ≥ 0.05 in ≥10% of cells of at least one cell type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp10">Supplementary file 10</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Annotations of mouse cell clusters</title><p>We compared the clusters obtained above to the cell type annotations of Tabula Muris. A cluster where a similar annotation was common to &gt;90% of its cells, and where &gt; 90% of cells with that annotation were within that cluster, was annotated according to Tabula Muris. All other clusters were manually annotated based on highly expressed marker genes (Z score ≥2). We manually searched PubMed for evidence that any of these markers indicates a known cell type (including cell identity and\or function), preferably in the context of the relevant tissue. A cluster was annotated if at least two of its markers indicated the same cell type. To comply with other studies, cell types were named as in Cell Ontology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Diehl et al., 2016</xref>).

Each disease was associated with its disease genes and their mouse orthologs according to OMIM, and was associated with its affected tissue according to HPO phenotypic abnormality annotations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Köhler et al., 2021</xref>). We focused on disease that were cataloged by HPO as having main phenotypic abnormality in blood and blood-forming tissues (HP: 0001871), lungs (HP: 0002088), musculature (HP: 0003011), spleen (HP: 0001743), tongue (HP: 0000157), and trachea (HP: 0002778), in accordance with the six tissues that we analyzed. Phenotypic abnormalities that HPO categorized under each of these main terms were also included. We assessed the reliability of associations by comparing them to manually curated associations of diseases and their affected tissues from ODiseA database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hekselman et al., 2022</xref>). For this, we downloaded from ODiseA all the diseases affecting blood and bone marrow, lung, and trachea. ODiseA annotations indicating that a tissue is unaffected by a disease were excluded from further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>PrEDiCT score calculation and significance assessment</title><p>For each disease, we calculated its cell-type PrEDiCT scores in all cell types of the disease-affected tissue(s).

Diseases with less than three records that mentioned it together with a specific cell type were excluded. Cell types that were not mentioned with any disease were excluded. Next, per tissue, we determined whether disease–cell-type pairs significantly co-appeared by applying a Fisher’s exact test.

Markers of mouse cell types were converted to their human orthologous genes according to the Mouse Genome Informatics database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bult et al., 2019</xref>). Next, we estimated the similarity between each pair of cell types using matchSCore2 package, which compared the two markers lists by using Jaccard index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mereu et al., 2020</xref>). Cell types were determined as matching if their Jaccard index was ≥0.05 and in the top 10th percentile. To test the impact of disease genes on the matching of human and mouse cell types, we repeated the matching upon excluding disease genes from the list of marker genes.

Then, we applied an analysis of variance (ANOVA) test to the proportions of diseases that likely affected each cell class using aov function in R v4.1.1. To further determine whether specific cell classes were more susceptible than others, we compared the cell-type susceptibility of prevalent cell classes (&gt;15 cell types across ≥4 tissues each). to all other cell types, by using Mann-Whitney U test. p-Values were adjusted for multiple comparisons by Benjamini-Hochberg correction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Ligands- and receptors-associated diseases</title><p>We extracted a list of 1625 pairs of ligands and their corresponding receptors from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jin et al., 2021</xref>.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Molly Przeworski as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. All reviewers commented with respect to lack of rigor in the approach for determining statistical significance (Rev1#1, Rev2#1, Rev3#2). Criteria for statistical significance needs to be justified/investigated to provide statistical stringency for determining the set of significant associations.</p><p>2. Investigation of null/negative control genes would strengthen the conclusions of this work (Rev3#1, Rev2#4). For example, some Mendelian diseases impact disease through coding mutations without impacting expression in any cell type. Such genes could serve as negative controls showcasing the method does not identify any disease-affected cell type.</p><p>3. Improved textual contextualization (and caveats) of proposed work to better showcase the proposed results would significantly strengthen the rigor (Rev1#2, Rev3#1,4,5,6).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Hekselman et al. presents analyses linking cell-types to monogenic disorders using over-expression of monogenic disease genes as the signal. The manuscript analyses data from 6 tissues (bone marrow, lung, muscle, spleen, tongue and trachea) together with ~1,000 rare diseases from OMIM (with ~2,000 associated genes) to identify cell-type of interest for specific disease of choice. The signal used by the approach is the relative expression of OMIM-genes in a particular cell type relative to the expression of the gene in the tissue of interest identifying cell-type-disease pairs that are then investigated through literature review and recapitulated using mouse expression. A potentially interesting finding is that disease genes manifesting in multiple tissues seem to hit same cell-types. Overall, this important study combines multiple data analyses to quantify the connection between cell types and human disorders. However, whereas some of the analyses are compelling, the statistical analyses are incomplete as they don't provide full treatment of type I error.</p><p>I have two main critiques that reduce my enthusiasm for this work.</p><p>1. The statistical framework to identify cell-types for a given disease (gene) is likely not calibrated to type I error (page 5 and methods). The approach notes that disease-cell-type pairs with a PREDICT score &gt; 2 (top 5%) of all pairs are &quot;considered significant&quot;. I could not find any justification for why this is a well-calibrated test that yields significant associations. Under a model of where no true cell-type-associations are present in the data, this approach will still incorrectly flag the top 5% as being significant. In fact, Figure 1B appears consistent with PREDICT scores drawn from a normal distribution centered on 0 potentially consistent with most (if not all) associations being null. The approach needs a proper statistical model that is well-calibrated test to declare significant associations.</p><p>2. Functional validation of the disease-cell-type is limited. Associations are investigate using literature search in Pubmed focused on co-occurrence of disease and cell types; this is not validation as many of those co-appearances reflect negative and/or speculative results. The second line of evidence that these associations are true comes from recapitulation of results using mouse data; these results could be over-interpreted as human and mouse cell type data is matched based on expression itself thus creating an expected loop: mouse cell-type expression matched to human cell-type expression identifies similar expression-driven associations.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Comments:</p><p>1. The PrEDiCT score threshold for inferring a disease-cell type pair as statistically significant seems unlikely to be sufficiently stringent. The threshold for inferring statistical significance must be rigorously justified.</p><p>First, for diseases with only 1 associated gene, z&gt;2 is a lax threshold, as 2.5% of disease-cell type pairs would be expected to be significant by chance. The distribution of the number of associated genes per disease is important and must be discussed in the main text with an associated Supp Table/Supp Figure (how many of the 1113 diseases have only 1 associated gene, how many have exactly 2 associated genes, etc.).</p><p>Second, from Table S3, it seems that the total number of disease-cell type pairs tested is 3952 + 5624 + 12996 + 2568 + 780 + 540 = 26460 (which is less than 1113*129 = 143577, because only cell types in disease-associated tissues were tested). The number is 26460 is important and must be reported in the main text. Given that 2.5% * 26460 = 662, in the extreme case that all diseases have only 1 associated gene we would expect 662 significant PrEDiCT scores by chance, such that many of the 753 significant PrEDiCT scores that are reported could be false positives.</p><p>Third, under the null hypothesis of no disease-affected cell types, for diseases with only 1 associated gene, the PrEDiCT scores may have more large values than a normal distribution, because there could be many genes with patterns of preferential expression in a particular cell type. On the other hand, for diseases with x associated genes with x&gt;1, the PrEDiCT scores may have fewer large values than a normal distribution, because the median of x independent z-scores has a &lt;2.5% chance of being &gt;2.</p><p>The best solution would be to assess statistical significance via empirical comparison with PrEDiCT scores for non-disease-associated control genes (for diseases with only 1 associated gene), or empirical comparison with PrEDiCT scores for the median of x non-disease-associated control genes (for diseases with x associated genes with x&gt;1). I recommend that this approach should be used. The resulting P-values can then be evaluated for statistical significance using Bonferroni (probably too conservative) or FDR. It is likely that the method has higher power for larger values of x, such that FDR could be stratified by the value of x. Note that the main point here is variation across genes: unless disease-associated gene(s) are very significantly different from non-disease-associated control genes, then no significant disease-affected cell type should be inferred.</p><p>An alternative, which I have much less enthusiasm for but which is plausible, would be to state throughout that the PrEDiCT scores identify <italic>candidate</italic> disease-affected cell types, and use excess overlap with disease-cell type pairs from literature co-appearance to assign an FDR to the <italic>candidate</italic> disease-affected cell types (perhaps at different PrEDiCT score thresholds), e.g., FDR = 100% / (fold excess overlap).</p><p>2. The numbers in Figure 1E are not consistent with the numbers in the main text.</p><p>First, the main text (p.5) states that 753 disease-cell type pairs have significant literature co-appearance, whereas Figure 1E states that 654+99=753 disease-cell type pairs have significant PrEDiCT scores and 448+99=547 pairs have significant literature co-appearance. I am guessing that 753 in the main text is a typo and should be 547.</p><p>Second, the main text (p.6) states that 714 diseases had disease-affected cell types inferred (I believe this is based on the PrEDiCT score, but the wording of the text is confusing and could be improved), whereas Figure 1E states that 654+99=753 disease-cell type pairs have significant PrEDiCT scores. I’m guessing that 753&gt;714 because some diseases have &gt;1 disease-affected cell types inferred, but this should be stated explicitly.</p><p>Third, the main text (p.6) states that 18% of disease-cell type pairs with significant PrEDiCT scores have significant literature co-appearance. However, based on the numbers in Figure 1E, 99/753 = 13%, which is different from 18%.</p><p>Fourth, the main text (p.6) states that 6% of all disease-cell type pairs have significant literature co-appearance. However, based on 547 from Figure 1E and the total of 26460 disease-cell type pairs tested (see Comment 1), 547/26460 = 2%, which is different from 6%.</p><p>In addition to fixing the discrepancies, it may be good to expand the explanations, as this is really the most important part of the paper.</p><p>3. The PCD example (Figure 1C, Figure 2D) is a great example. However, I suggest to increase the number of specific Mendelian diseases highlighted in the main Figures (prior to delving into diseases with multiple affected tissues, or other special categories of diseases) from 1 to at least 4, e.g., via a separate main Figure highlighting 4 Mendelian diseases (with human or human+mouse results).</p><p>4. I expect that for some Mendelian diseases, coding mutations to disease-associated gene(s) affect protein product but do not affect expression in any cell type. It would be interesting to include some well-studied Mendelian diseases in this category as negative controls, for which failure to implicate any disease-affected cell type is the correct answer.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I really do believe the authors should provide context of their method with a larger set of previously published work. Additionally, the thresholding concerns and lack of a clear null comparison make it difficult to assess the robustness of the method and the analyses.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84613.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Instead of considering disease–cell-type pairs with PrEDiCT score &gt; 2 (top 5%) as significant, we used permutation testing to determine statistical significance Results, page 6, 1<sup>st</sup> paragraph; Methods, page 21-22, ‘PrEDiCT score calculation and significance assessment’; (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). Specifically, given a disease D with n disease-associated genes, we randomly selected n genes expressed in any cell type, and computed the PrEDiCT score for this random gene set in each cell type of the disease-affected tissue (referred to as ‘random score’). We repeated this procedure 1,000 times, resulting in 1,000 random scores per disease and cell type. The p-value of the PrEDiCT score of disease D in cell type c was set to the fraction of random scores in c that were at least as high as the original PrEDiCT score of D in c. P-values were adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing per disease using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. To increase stringency, we treated only statistically significant disease–cell-type pairs with PrEDiCT score≥1 as 'likely affected'. We estimated type I error using literature text-mining or expert curation (Figure 1F and Figure 1—figure supplement 4A). False-positive rates of the revised procedure were low in both (0.01 and 0.07, respectively).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

To strengthen the reliability of likely disease–cell-type associations, we assigned an expert to curate associations with different PrEDiCT scores (ten associations per tissue, for six tissues; Methods, page 23, ‘Expert curation and assessment of disease-affected cell types’). Next, we used the curated association to estimate false-positive and false-negative rates. This analysis showed that the revised scheme had a low false-positive rate and that likely associations were enriched in expert-verified pairs (p=1.3E-4, Fisher’s exact test; Figure 1—figure supplement 4).</p><p>With respect to the recapitulation of results using mouse data, we assessed the impact of 'reuse' of expression data to drive associations. To avoid reusing disease genes in both PrEDiCT scheme and in the matching between human and mouse cell types, we matched between cell types based on the expression of non-disease genes alone. We found that most of the originally matched celltype pairs (109/122, 89%) were also matched upon excluding disease genes. Hence, the impact of 'reuse' of expression data seems minor. We acknowledge this caveat and mention the observation described herein in Discussion, page 17, 2<sup>nd</sup> half of the 2<sup>nd</sup> paragraph; Results, page 8, last sentence; and Methods, page 23, ‘Determining matching cell types between tissues’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Comments:</p><p>1.

We recalculated the various numbers after redoing the entire analysis, including revising the disease-tissue dataset, calculation of PrEDiCT scores and their statistical significance, and rerunning the Biopython package to identify disease–cell-type pairs with significant literature coappearance. Consequently, the results have changed, and we revised all relevant numbers (also summarized in new Supplementary File 1A). For the first and second point, the revised number of disease–cell-type pairs with significant PrEDiCT scores, denoted 'likely affected associations', was 489. The disease–cell-type pairs with significant literature co-appearance was revised to 229 pairs (denoted 'literature-supported pairs'). Importantly, the current version of Biopython retrieves only up to 9,999 records per term, rather than the previously available threshold of 99,999 records. For instance, Biopython retrieved 9,999 records for each of the terms erythrocytes and β-thalassemia, of which 32 records overlapped (the overlap remained statistically significant). We revised wording to explicitly state the revised numbers in Results, page 7, last sentence; and in Figure 1G (also see figure legend).</p><p>For the third and fourth points, we recalculated the different fractions. The fraction of likely affected disease–cell-type pairs that are literature-supported out of all likely affected pairs was updated to 41/489 (8.4%). The fraction of literature-supported disease–cell-type pairs out of all disease–celltype pairs was updated to 229/34,249 (0.7%, now in Supplementary File 2A; the number of all disease–cell-type pairs grew due to miscalculation in the original analysis). We updated the text and expanded the explanations in Results, page 8, 1<sup>st</sup> paragraph; and in Figure 1G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The PCD example (Figure 1C, Figure 2D) is a great example. However, I suggest to increase the number of specific Mendelian diseases highlighted in the main Figures (prior to delving into diseases with multiple affected tissues, or other special categories of diseases) from 1 to at least 4, e.g., via a separate main Figure highlighting 4 Mendelian diseases (with human or human+mouse results).</p></disp-quote><p>Per the reviewer’s suggestion, we highlight five additional Mendelian diseases (Results, page 7, 1<sup>st</sup> paragraph; Figure 1D and 1E), all of which were recapitulated using mouse data (Results, page 9, 1<sup>st</sup> paragraph; Figure 2D and 2E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. I expect that for some Mendelian diseases, coding mutations to disease-associated gene(s) affect protein product but do not affect expression in any cell type. It would be interesting to include some well-studied Mendelian diseases in this category as negative controls, for which failure to implicate any disease-affected cell type is the correct answer.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We included two cases of negative controls, for which failure to implicate any disease-affected cell type is the correct answer in Results, page 7, 1<sup>st</sup> paragraph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I really do believe the authors should provide context of their method with a larger set of previously published work. Additionally, the thresholding concerns and lack of a clear null comparison make it difficult to assess the robustness of the method and the analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>We provide context for our method by providing a detailed description of a larger set of previously published work (Introduction, page 2-3). Additionally, we revised the statistical analysis and clarified the null comparison of the results (Results, page 6, 1<sup>st</sup> paragraph; Methods, page 21-22, ‘PrEDiCT score calculation and significance assessment’; Figure 1—figure supplement 2). We enhanced the assessments of the method performance and robustness by using several lines of external evidence (Results, page 7, 2<sup>nd</sup> paragraph; Methods, page 22, ‘Text-mining of PubMed records’, and page 23, ‘Expert curation and assessment of disease-affected cell types’; Figure 1F,G, and Figure 1—figure supplement 4).</p></body></sub-article></article>
