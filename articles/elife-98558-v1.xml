While drugs exist to help manage symptoms, none are currently curative.</p><p>IPAH mainly affects the pulmonary arteries, which are tasked with carrying the blood from the heart to the lungs to collect oxygen. The disease causes the walls of these vessels to thicken abnormally, obstructing blood flow and requiring the heart to work harder.</p><p>The outer layers of pulmonary arteries are formed of both fibroblast and smooth muscle cells: the fibroblasts produce proteins that support the structure of the vessel, while the smooth muscle helps control blood flow by contracting and relaxing. Both types of cells are involved in vessel wall thickening in IPAH, but what causes them to switch from a healthy to a diseased state remains unclear.</p><p>To examine this question, Crnkovic et al. compared the gene activity, protein production and behaviour of smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts obtained from the pulmonary arteries of healthy donors and IPAH patients. The experiments revealed that both types of cells showed similar impairments to their mitochondria, the cellular structures that help provide energy. However, differences also emerged. Diseased smooth muscle tissue produced the proteins that these cells use to contract and relax, ultimately impairing their ability to regulate blood flow to the lungs. Meanwhile, IPAH fibroblasts multiplied abnormally fast, potentially contributing to vessel thickening.</p><p>Growing smooth muscle and fibroblast cells together in the laboratory allowed Crnkovic et al. to examine how interactions between these cells could help drive the disease. This showed that the fibroblasts released signals which triggered IPAH-characteristic changes in normally healthy smooth muscle cells. As such, the ability of fibroblasts to ‘talk’ to smooth muscle cells could be important in the progression of the condition.</p><p>Crnkovic et al. hope that these findings will help develop better treatments to stop or reverse the progression of IPAH. However, further research is needed to confirm which biological processes should be targeted, and to ensure that reversing the abnormal changes in lung blood vessels is both safe and effective.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pulmonary artery</kwd><kwd>adventitial fibroblasts</kwd><kwd>vascular smooth muscle cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100021703</institution-id><institution>Cardio-Pulmonary Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EXC 2026 390649896</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kwapiszewska</surname><given-names>Grazyna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.55776/i4651</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Crnkovic</surname><given-names>Slaven</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Transition from healthy to diseased state is a cell-type-specific process, influenced by neighboring cells and resulting in functionally meaningful differences between pulmonary artery adventitial fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Classical view of vascular smooth muscle cells as resident cells mediating vasoactive responses and adventitial fibroblasts as structural support cells producing fibrillar collagen has been appended by single-cell transcriptomics studies in humans. Single-cell resolution has helped to define the tissue-specific heterogeneity within and delineate the distinctions of vascular resident cell populations to other smooth muscle and fibroblast populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crnkovic et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Muhl et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Muhl et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Travaglini et al., 2020</xref>). Additional layer of cellular complexity and heterogeneity is acquired through the disease process. Fate mapping studies in animal models of systemic and pulmonary vascular disease have shown that the majority of vascular smooth muscle cells and adventitial fibroblasts retain their lineage identity during vascular remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biasin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bordenave et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sheikh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Steffes et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wirka et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Worssam et al., 2023</xref>). However, a subset of these cells exhibits the acquisition or loss of specific markers, such as smooth muscle actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chu et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shankman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Short et al., 2004</xref>). Nevertheless, diseased cells consistently demonstrate altered expression profiles compared to their healthy counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crnkovic et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wirka et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Worssam et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>Pulmonary vascular disease is an umbrella term encompassing functional and morphological alterations in lung vasculature, either as a standalone condition or, more often, accompanying chronic lung and heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Humbert et al., 2019</xref>). We have previously shown that pulmonary vascular disease and remodeling of pulmonary artery compartment is associated with a skewed cellular communication centered on smooth muscle cells and adventitial fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crnkovic et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, molecular alterations identified in situ and freshly isolated cells are at least partially preserved and propagated in vitro. For example, pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) and pulmonary artery adventitial fibroblasts (PAAFs) isolated from remodeled pulmonary arteries display metabolic and proinflammatory reprogramming that was linked with the progression of pulmonary vascular remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sutendra et al., 2010</xref>). On transcriptional and proteomic level, PASMC displays characteristics of phenotypic shift, namely downregulated expression of contractile machinery and upregulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crnkovic et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Régent et al., 2016</xref>). PAAF was shown to direct the behavior of immune cells and serving as a homing place for the immune cells during vascular remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chelladurai et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">El Kasmi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Plecitá Hlavatá et al., 2023</xref>). Cumulatively, results imply a cell-type-specific communication network that is perturbed in the vascular remodeling. It is however unclear to which extent are the changes in expression profiles ultimately mirrored phenotypically.</p><p>In the current study, we investigated early-passage PASMC and PAAF sourced from the same pulmonary artery of healthy, downsized lung donors or patients with idiopathic form of pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH). We have combined integrative omics and network-based analysis with targeted phenotypic screens to identify common and cell-type-specific differences. Our aim was to uncover significant phenotypic differences upon pulmonary vascular remodeling and identify a set of key molecular correlates that could serve as surrogate marker defining healthy and diseased cell states in a cell-type-specific manner. Our results provide insight into bidirectional cell communication between PASMC and PAAF and the critical role of heterotypic cell-to-cell interaction in cell-state maintenance and transition in pulmonary artery compartment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Human tissue samples</title><p>Human lung samples from IPAH patients and downsized non-transplanted donor lungs, serving as healthy control, were obtained from Division of Thoracic Surgery, Medical University of Vienna, Austria. The protocol and tissue usage was approved by the local ethics committee (976/2010; 1417/2022) and patient consent was obtained before lung transplantation. Small size, resistance pulmonary arteries (diameter &lt;0.5 cm) were dissected from the lungs and used for smooth muscle cell and fibroblast cell isolation or flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Briefly, adventitial layer was pulled off the PA and used for outgrowth of PAAF. Remaining PA was cut open, endothelial layer scraped off and remaining media mechanically cut into small size pieces and used for smooth muscle cell outgrowth. Cells were grown in full media (VascuLife SMC or FibroLife S2, LifeLine Cell Technology) and used up to passage four. Respective basal media without added supplements and serum was used for starvation. Expression profiling (transcriptomic and proteomic) and functional cellular assays were performed on cells isolated from the same pulmonary artery.

Experiments were performed on the Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) coupled with ACQUITY M-Class ultra-performance liquid chromatography (Waters Corporation). A flow rate of 450 nl/min was used for this liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry experiment, where mobile phase A was 0.2% formic acid in water and mobile phase B was 0.2% formic acid in acetonitrile. Analytical columns were pulled using fused silica (I.D. 100 µm) and packed with Magic 1.8 µm 120 Å UChrom C18 stationary phase (nanoLCMS Solutions) to a length of ~25 cm. Peptides were directly injected onto the analytical column using a gradient (2–45% B, followed by a high-B wash) of 80 min.

After 96 and 120 hr the medium was replaced by Standard Oxidation Stress Test assay medium (10 mM glucose, 1 mM pyruvate, and 2 mM glutamine) and plates were incubated in a non-CO<sub>2</sub> incubator for 60 min prior to the assay. Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) were measured in a Seahorse XFe96 extracellular flux analyzer (Agilent) using XF Substrate Oxidation Stress Test Kits (XF Long Chain Fatty Acid Oxidation Stress Test Kit, XF Glucose/Pyruvate Oxidation Stress Test Kit). First, basal respiration was established, followed by injection of the relevant pathway inhibitor (4 µM etoxomir, 2 µM UK5099). The response to the inhibitor was monitored, then ATP production was blocked by oligomycin (1.5 µM), followed by the dissipation of proton gradients with FCCP (1 µM). The electron transport chain was inhibited by rotenone/antimycin (0.5 µM) to reveal the non-mitochondrial respiration. OCR/ECAR values are representing the ratio of mitochondrial respiration/glycolysis derived from the first rate measurements of the Substrate Oxidation Stress Test. The acute response to the inhibitor represents alterations of basal respiration as OCR response to pathway inhibitors (etoxomir, UK5099). The glycolytic capacity was calculated as the difference of maximum ECAR measurement after oligomycin injection and the last ECAR measurement right before oligomycin injection. Non-mitochondrial respiration was defined as the minimum OCR measurement after rotenone/antimycin injection. Proton leak was calculated as minimum OCR measurement after oligomycin injection minus non-mitochondrial respiration.

Furthermore, all cells with more than 5% mitochondrial DNA and cells with under 200 and over 2500 RNA counts were filtered out. Final quality control step included filtering out outliers defined as cells with an RNA-count outside the range of 5 MADs. Data normalization was performed with the NormalizeData function from Seurat, followed by data scaling (ScaleData). The FindVariableFeatures Seurat-function detected the variable features in the dataset (selection method = vst, nfeatures = 2000).

At first, we focused on defining the normal, healthy cell states by using very early-passage (p1) PASMC and PAAF isolated from same (source-matched) pulmonary arteries (PA) of healthy, downsized donors (<italic>n</italic> = 4). We performed deep molecular characterization of RNA and protein expression profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata2">Source data 2</xref>). Principle component analysis confirmed that molecular distinction between two cell types was preserved in early passage on both transcriptomic and proteomic level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). It also revealed higher interpersonal heterogeneity within PASMC samples, while source-matched PAAF represented as a more homogenous group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We identified a set of significantly enriched genes/proteins in PASMC (Regulator of G Protein Signaling 5 – RGS5, Insulin-Like Growth Factor-Binding Protein 5 – IGFBP5, Integrin Alpha 2 – ITGA2, Cysteine and Glycine Rich Protein 1 – CSRP1, Actin Filament-Associated Protein 1 – AFAP1) and PAAF (Alcohol Dehydrogenase 1C – ADH1C, Scavenger Receptor Class A Member 5 – SCARA5, Complement Factor D – CFD, Microsomal Glutathione <italic>S</italic>-Transferase 1 – MGST1, Thioredoxin-Related Transmembrane Protein 2 – TMX2) for orthogonal validation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Some of the molecules were previously associated predominantly with SMC, such as RGS5 and CSRP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crnkovic et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Snider et al., 2008</xref>), or adventitial fibroblast, such as SCARA5, CFD, and MGST1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crnkovic et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sikkema et al., 2023</xref>) expression. We mapped the location of selected enriched targets by multicolor staining of human lung tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref>: <italic>n</italic> = 5). In the pulmonary artery compartment, RGS5 and IGFBP5 positivity overlapped predominantly with ACTA2 (alpha smooth muscle actin) stain, while ADH1C, SCARA5, and CFD were observed mostly in adventitial region marked by PDGFRA (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor Alpha) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref>). Antibodies used to detect other targets (ITGA2, AFAP1, MGST1, and TMX2) yielded inconclusive results due to lack or very weak signal in PASMC/PAAF, with exception of CSRP1. AFAP1 and ITGA2 stained endothelial layer, CSPR1 had medial staining pattern in addition to inflammatory cells, while MGST1 and TMX2 stained mostly inflammatory or epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Comparative analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic datasets revealed a strong, but not complete level of linear correlation between the gene and protein expression profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We therefore decided to use an integrated dataset and analyzed all significantly enriched genes and proteins (−log<sub>10</sub>(p) &gt;1.3) between both cell types to achieve stronger and more robust analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). A GSEA on GO terms for biological processes was used to infer functional implications of observed expression profiles. The analysis confirmed polarized and distinct cell-type functional associations, revealing vascular development and cell migration processes for PASMC, and endoplasmatic reticulum protein targeting for PAAF. Additionally, PASMC was associated with processes linked to sterol transport, <italic>O</italic>-glycosylation, and nerve growth factor signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). PAAF on the other hand showed enrichment in mitochondrial metabolic processes and heavy metal ion detoxification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Applying an additional cutoff by taking into consideration only strongly expressed genes/proteins, we performed an overrepresentation analysis of GO biological processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Among top10 processes, there was a clear separation and functional distinction between PASMC and PAAF, with overlap in angiogenesis and adhesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Contrasting the canonical functional roles, it was PASMC, rather than PAAF, that showed enrichment for ECM organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), while PAAF showed enrichment for heavy metal ion response, lipid homeostasis, and cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). The enrichment of lipid-associated processes in PAAF prompted us to validate the observed results phenotypically. We performed a fuel usage assay using Seahorse metabolic analyzer (<italic>n</italic> = 6). Real-time monitoring of oxygen consumption under basal condition and upon specific metabolic inhibitors revealed that PASMC could equally utilize glucose/pyruvate and long chain fatty acids as a fuel source for oxidative metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H1</xref>). In contrast, upon blocking fatty acid utilization in Krebs cycle, PAAF had stronger drop in basal respiration rate while PASMC was less sensitive to this maneuver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). PAAF displayed additional significant metabolic differences to PASMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). PAAF had lower OCR and ECAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Ratio of oxygen consumption to extracellular acidification (OCR/ECAR) revealed that PAAF has relative preference for oxidative phosphorylation compared to PASMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), in line with observed enrichment for mitochondrial respiration processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This was further supported by lower glycolytic capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) and lower mitochondrial proton leak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

PCA analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic profiles revealed a clear sample separation based on cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, sample separation based on disease state was less obvious (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We used the supervised multivariate OPLS-DA method to determine the significance of cell-type and disease-state as parameters that drive sample separation. In the first model iteration, we considered either cell type or disease state as input parameter. OPLS-DA modeling found significant differences in the global transcriptomics and proteomics profiles based only on the cell type, but not disease state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), validating PCA analysis observations. For the second model iteration, we took both cell type and disease state simultaneously as input parameters. In this OPLA-DA model, only in the case of transcriptomic dataset there was significant separation between all four groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These results imply that remodeling process results in substantial transcriptional changes (cell state), but that each cell type retains their original cell lineage designation, in line with results from fate mapping and fresh cell single-cell transcriptomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biasin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crnkovic et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crnkovic et al., 2018</xref>).

GO analysis of selected gene sets from combined transcriptomic and proteomic data (significantly regulated genes/proteins), showed a cell-type-specific footprint of molecular changes upon IPAH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). IPAH-PASMC were characterized by upregulation of nucleotide-sugar and lipid biosynthesis, Golgi vesicle transport and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress processes, while simultaneously displaying downregulation of cytoskeletal components, ribonucleoprotein complex export and p53 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). IPAH-PAAF upregulated genes and proteins involved in cell proliferation, DNA repair and downregulated expression of NF-κB pathway components, NK-cell activation, and transcriptional stress response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Enrichment for activated sugars and Golgi transport process is associated with increased synthesis and secretion of glycosylated proteins, such as ECM components. We therefore measured production of proteoglycans on isolated PA using 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue assay. Quantitative analysis revealed increased GAG content in IPAH (<italic>n</italic> = 8) compared to donor (<italic>n</italic> = 7) PA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We localized the site of the increased GAG content in PA using Alcian blue staining of human lung tissue. This showed enhanced medial staining in IPAH (<italic>n</italic> = 10) compared to donor (<italic>n</italic> = 10) and prominent signal in neointimal PA compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) that was confirmed by quantitative image analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In line with observed enrichment for DNA replication and cell cycle phase regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), IPAH-PAAF displayed higher proliferative capacity compared to donor–PAAF, upon both stimulated and unstimulated conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). IPAH-PASMC in contrary showed lower proliferative rate compared to donor–PASMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), corresponding to our previous observation of G1 cell cycle accumulation of IPAH-PASMC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crnkovic et al., 2022</xref>). The observed phenotypic effect is strongest in very early passage and is progressively lost with passaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). In vitro results mirror indirect determination of cellular proliferation rates in situ using PCNA staining of human lung tissue. We observed frequent PCNA+ fibroblasts, identified by PDGFRA staining, in the adventitial layer of PA from IPAH patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), while decreased percentage of proliferating PASMC in IPAH PA, detected by PCNA and Ki-67 staining, was reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crnkovic et al., 2022</xref>). The attenuated differences in proliferation rates between IPAH and donor cells with prolonged passaging suggest culture-induced cell-state changes and a loss of disease-specific phenotypic features. To investigate the stability of key phenotypic differences between IPAH and healthy cells, we analyzed transcriptional signatures in freshly isolated, early-passage, and late-passage cells using published datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chelladurai et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crnkovic et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gorr et al., 2020</xref>). GSEA revealed significant distinctions between fresh and cultured cells, with marked differences in the top-enriched biological processes across all conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata3">Source data 3</xref>). By focusing on the key phenotypic features identified in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), we found that IPAH PASMCs exhibit a more gradual phenotypic shift with passaging, in contrast to the sharp changes observed early on in cultured PAAFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Early-passage IPAH-PASMC (p1) retain positive enrichment for biosynthetic and ECM processes and share positive enrichment for macrophage regulation processes with fresh cells, while simultaneously displaying gradual negative enrichment of contraction associated processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Surprisingly, both early (p1)- and late-passage (p6) IPAH-PAAF display prominent positive enrichment for cell cycle and proliferation processes, with fresh cells showing weak enrichment for DNA recombination process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Even more striking are prominent inverse enrichments for inflammatory/NF-κB signaling between fresh and cultured IPAH-PAAF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Similar, but less pronounced trend for inverse enrichment is displayed for processes involving cellular adhesion and ECM organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>).

Number of co-directionally regulated genes and proteins were limited to 47 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Further selection based on significance and fold change provided a list of most significantly regulated molecules in IPAH that are shared between PASMC and PAAF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, highlighted corners bottom left and top right). Using this as an input for network analysis based on the STRING database, we built the underlying gene interaction network and identify shared upstream regulating factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Only a fraction of commonly regulated genes and proteins were encompassed by the putative regulatory network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). For the remaining molecules, it was not possible to construct an interaction map, implying regulation by independent mechanisms and upstream regulators. We therefore focused further on those molecules that were encompassed in the interaction network. Interestingly, their regulatory nodes converged on the immuno-inflammatory and survival-apoptosis regulators and effectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Specifically, a majority of the nodes building the interaction network belonged to a limited set of genes comprising mostly cytokines/chemokines (IL1B, IL2, IL4, IL6, IL10, TNF, CCL2, and CXCL8) and inflammatory-stress response signal transduction pathways (JNK, AKT, NF-κB, STAT3, MYC, and JUN) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Additional pathway enrichment analysis based on the BioPlanet database, uncovered regulation of apoptosis as a shared pathway by both cell types in IPAH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Shared SOD2 (mitochondrial superoxide dismutase 2) downregulation prompted us to investigate the mitochondrial function and redox defenses. We performed TMRM staining for the detection of mitochondrial content and potential. Cellular mitochondrial content was lower both in IPAH-PASMC and IPAH-PAAF upon removal of serum and growth factors (starvation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). However, the remaining mitochondria in IPAH cells were hyperpolarized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization is linked with increased ROS production. We measured cellular ROS production using CellRox Deep Red dye at basal levels and upon PDGF-BB stimulation revealing that only IPAH-PASMC significantly upregulate ROS production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Although mitochondrial dysfunction seems as a common underlying disturbance between cell types in IPAH, the downstream consequences appear to be cell-type selective. Mitochondrial dysfunction and elevated ROS production are associated with increased apoptosis, aligning with reduced SOD2, which plays a role in clearing mitochondrial ROS and mitigating oxidative stress to protect against cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kokoszka et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). We therefore assessed in situ the rate of apoptosis using TUNEL assay on human lung tissue samples from donors and IPAH patients (<italic>n</italic> = 6 for each condition) and co-stained with ACTA2 and PDGFRA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>).

PASMC possessed more pronounced changes than PAAF as shown by the number of differentially regulated genes and proteins in IPAH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). A STRING-based interaction network, overlaid with information about the initial cell-type association under normal condition (preferential enrichment in donor–PASMC or PAAF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), revealed that the majority of downregulated molecules in IPAH-PASMC came from a set of genes and proteins preferentially expressed by PASMC in healthy state (donor–PASMC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This reflects the fact that most downregulation in PASMC takes place in contractile machinery elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) that are characteristic for smooth muscle cell lineage. In contrast, molecules upregulated in IPAH-PASMC contained targets from both PASMC- and PAAF-enriched dataset under healthy cell states (donors). IPAH-regulated molecules in PAAF on the other hand could be traced back to both PASMC- and PAAF-enriched normal cell state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). GO analysis of IPAH revealed a clear cell-type distinct fingerprint of molecular changes: PASMC harbored expression changes in biological processes related to ECM, while cell cycle and replication processes were enriched in PAAF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Looking selectively at top 20 differentially regulated genes, a similar pattern was observed: genes that were downregulated in IPAH-PASMC, such as SHROOM3, BLID or CCK, were preferentially expressed by donor–PASMC, while upregulated genes such as chemokines (CCL7 and CCL26) were not restricted to smooth muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). For comparison, expression of the same genes in PAAF was not significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

We wondered if a gene/protein-level evaluation of significantly changed elements for each cell type between IPAH and donors, could give indication of putative phenotypic changes in addition to pathway enrichment approach. We manually curated significantly changed elements in IPAH-PASMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, outermost circle) and IPAH-PAAF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, middle circle) and grouped them in ECM, immune system, metabolism, and cell cycle categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).

We also provide reference if a particular element was preferentially expressed in PASMC or PAAF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, innermost circle). Striking feature is that both cell types display perturbations in all four major functional categories, the involved genes/proteins are different. For instance, IPAH-PASMC upregulate proinflammatory cytokines (CCL7 and CCL26) and ECM components claudin 14 (CLDN14) and metalloproteinase ADAMTS18, while IPAH-PAAF downregulate anti-inflammatory NF-κB component RelB and laminin 1 (LAMA1) and matrix metallopeptidase 1 (MMP1) ECM components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Generally, PASMC and PAAF take a divergent path upon vascular remodeling: while IPAH-PASMC acquire synthetic phenotype with up regulation of chemotactic elements, IPAH-PAAF display hallmarks of fast-cycling cells. Based on these results, we wondered if ECM-based phenotypic assays could uncover cell-type and cell-state distinct responses, similarly to results obtained by proliferation and metabolic assays.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>ECM components centered signaling elicits cell-type and cell-state distinct phenotypic responses</title><p>Changes in ECM composition are a recurring hallmark of pulmonary vascular remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hoffmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hoffmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jandl et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mutgan et al., 2024</xref>) recapitulated also in current omics dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Ligand–receptor interaction analysis of our omics dataset indicated that ligand expressing PAAF might act as sender cell type and PASMC as receiver cells through their integrin receptor repertoire expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). ITGA2 and ITGB1 subunits expressed in PASMC build a heterodimer complex functioning both as laminin and collagen receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Languino et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). We speculated that change in laminin-to-collagen ratio in ECM would have functional consequence and influence phenotypic behavior of cells in contact with altered ECM. We measured attachment and motility properties of cells with respect to these two substrates. Both PASMC and PAAF (<italic>n</italic> = 6) displayed striking phenotypic differences depending on surface coating. Whereas cells on collagen-coated surface had spread-out shape with several protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), laminin coating inhibited cell spreading and cells obtained a more symmetric, round-like appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). PASMC, both donor and IPAH, attached less efficiently to laminin compared to collagen-coated surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), but only donor–PAAF displayed comparable behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Although not significant, IPAH-PASMC had tendentially higher attachment on laminin-coated surface compared to donor–PASMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This trend was again observed in an additional assay measuring gap closure on collagen- or laminin-coated surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <italic>n</italic> = 2–6). At early time points, donor–PASMC showed widening gap area before final gap closure on laminin coating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). On collagen coating, potential difference was observed at later time point and showed a reverse trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), probably due to influence of higher proliferative rate of donor–PASMC compared to IPAH-PASMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), rather than acute effects of attachment and migration that have more influence in early time points.

We therefore tested a possible feedback loop between the activated complement system and enhanced proteoglycan expression in IPAH.

We therefore asked if cellular crosstalk is able to modulate phenotypic markers using a co-culture model.

Expression levels of selected cell-type and cell-state markers were determined as a readout of phenotypic modulation. Simultaneously, same donor cells were co-cultured with IPAH cells from the other cell type, producing a combinatorial readout to assess PASMC-to-PAAF and PAAF-to-PASMC crosstalk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Results revealed that co-culture of donor–PASMC with IPAH-PAAF (<italic>n</italic> = 3) lead to partial loss of healthy state PASMC markers (CNN1 and RHOA) without affecting the expression of disease-state markers (VCAN and BGN) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).

As our proteomics approach sampled only proteins from the cell lysate, we additionally performed protein array-based screening of 137 unique soluble factors secreted from donor- compared to IPAH-PAAF (<italic>n</italic> = 4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). We selected for factors whose expression levels were changed 10% or more in at least two samples and performed clustering of tested samples and factors providing a list of 44 potential regulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). As some of those factors were already known and investigated in the context of IPAH, we focused on finding potentially novel PAAF-derived regulators of SMC phenotype. In order to narrow down the search, we used hierarchical clustering to group co-regulated ligands into smaller number of groups. Similarity matrix revealed one major and six minor clusters of factors showing correlated changes among four comparison pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). One cluster was characterized by co-regulated chitinase 3-like 1, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3), and angiogenin expression pattern; other clusters with Extracellular Matrix Metalloproteinase Inducer (EMMPRIN), Epithelial-Derived Neutrophil-Activating Protein 78 (ENA-78), and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A (VEGF) secretion, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). Three additional clusters involved upregulated secretion of epidermal growth factor, HGF, and chemerin with correlated PTX3 downregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). Based on further literature search, we excluded ligands with reported link to PAH and selected chitinase 3-like 1, IGFBP-3, angiogenin, HGF, and PTX3 for further validation. Stimulation of donor and IPAH-PASMC (<italic>n</italic> = 6) with HGF and PTX3 displayed the most consistent effects on modulation of PASMC cell-state markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>), while other tested ligands mostly lacked the effect on donor–PASMC and were not investigated further (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>). Intriguingly, HGF and PTX3 seem to have opposite effect on vascular smooth muscle cells, with PTX3 inhibiting neointima formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Camozzi et al., 2005</xref>) and HGF promoting pulmonary vascular remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Park et al., 2022</xref>). Indeed, stimulation of PASMC with PTX3 preserved the expression of contractile markers in donor cells, but not in IPAH, while HGF downregulated contractile state markers in donor–IPAH and increased disease-state marker VCAN in IPAH-PASMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Effective treatment of pulmonary arterial remodeling has been elusive over the years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stacher et al., 2012</xref>). IPAH is characterized by recalcitrant morphological changes and persistent alterations in cellular function. Studies have indicated that PASMC and PAAF retain these disease-associated changes in in vitro conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stenmark et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Viswanathan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Our current results using transcriptomic and proteomic profiling in combination with phenotypic screening demonstrate that PASMC and PAAF acquire distinct IPAH-associated cell states, while retaining their original cell-type designation. This shift from healthy to diseased state is a cell-type-specific process and results with functionally meaningful differences between cell types. Furthermore, we identify that maintenance of PASMC cell state is dependent on external cues, such as ECM components and soluble ligands, provided in part by neighboring PAAF.</p><p>The divergent fates and distinct disease states that cells acquire, can be traced to initial cell lineage differences that are formed and imprinted in a tissue- and anatomical location-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Muhl et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Muhl et al., 2020</xref>). These anatomical-location-based distinctions provide fibroblast and smooth muscle cell lineages with phenotypic potential beyond canonically assigned roles.</p><p>Expression of three selected markers in PAAF, scavenger receptor class A member 5 (SCARA5), complement factor D (CFD) and alcohol dehydrogenase 1C (ADH1C), provide the best example of PAAF pleiotropic roles beyond mere ECM production and structural support. PAAF, being at the outer barrier of vessels, might act as innate immunity sentinels with adventitia being the main compartment of inflammatory reaction and homing site for inflammatory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dahlgren et al., 2019</xref>). CFD activates the alternative pathway of the complement triggering chemotaxis and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">White et al., 1992</xref>). SCARA5, a ferritin scavenger receptor that mediates cellular iron uptake, limits the extracellular iron concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2009</xref>). Going beyond putative immunomodulatory functions, we additionally reveal PAAF involvement in lipid metabolism at expression profile and phenotypic level. This functionality perhaps reflects broader ontogenetic potential of PDGFRA+ cells as adipocyte precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angueira et al., 2021</xref>): PAAF express ADH1C, enzyme involved in metabolism of lipid peroxidation products and hydroxysteroids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Höög and Ostberg, 2011</xref>), PPARG, a key transcriptional regulator of lipid metabolism, and APOE, a lipid handling protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata2">Source data 2</xref>). All three homeostatic functions, complement regulation, iron handling, and lipid metabolism, seem to be co-opted and distorted in PAH pathomechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frid et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ruiter et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Simultaneously, acquisition of disease-cell state by the PASMC follows a different course. First, we observed that already healthy PASMC display intrinsically higher heterogeneity compared to PAAF. Enrichment in developmental, morphogenesis, migration, and signal transduction biological processes coupled with higher metabolic rate, both oxidative and glycolytic, provides PASMC with functional flexibility and adaptability in response to various injuries. Expression of regulator of G protein signaling 5 (RGS5) provides an example of the plasticity potential imprinted in normal PASMC. RGS5, for instance, as a gatekeeper of G protein signaling and signal transduction modulator, influences and fine-tunes the PASMC response to external cue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). Under normal condition, expression of contractile machinery coupled with higher metabolic rate, enables PASMC to fulfill their homeostatic role in providing vasoactive function and structural support for endothelial lined lumen. However, one of the defining vascular SMC characteristic and adaptation to vascular insult, including that of IPAH-PASMC cell state, is downregulated expression of the cytoskeletal contractile elements. This seems to be an intrinsic, ‘programmed’ response of SMC to remodeling, rather than vasodilator therapy-induced selection pressure. Similar phenotypic change is observed in SMC from systemic circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gomez and Owens, 2012</xref>) and animal model of pulmonary hypertension without exposure to PAH medication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crnkovic et al., 2023</xref>). We suspect that isolated decrease in contractile machinery would dampen both the contraction and relaxation properties of the PASMC, affecting not only its response to dilating agents, but also to vasoconstrictors. Clinical consequences and responsiveness to dilating agents are more difficult to predict, since the vasoactive response would additionally depend on mechanical properties of the pulmonary artery defined by cellular and ECM composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Thenappan et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Distinctive cell-type characteristics of PASMC and PAAF come into play during disease process of pulmonary vascular remodeling, testified by low overlap in commonly perturbed pathways and associated genes/proteins between PASMC and PAAF in IPAH. PAAF and PASMC acquire distinct cell states upon remodeling with IPAH-PAAF showing enrichment in DNA replication and repair processes and accompanying hyperproliferative phenotype. IPAH-PASMC in addition to partial loss of contractile markers alter their metabolic profile to support the increased biosynthetic demand. In line with this notion, we have observed significant downregulation of enolase 3, malate dehydrogenase 1B, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases, and phosphofructokinase, and upregulation of glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 2 in IPAH-PASMC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata2">Source data 2</xref>). This profile indicated potential glucose shunting into hexosamine pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barnes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buse, 2006</xref>). Hexosamine biosynthetic pathway is a side branch of glycolysis utilized for generation of amino-sugars and subsequent protein and lipid glycosylation, including glycosaminoglycans and PG synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buse, 2006</xref>) The mostly enriched ECM class next to classical fibrillar collagens, were PG, in line with previously published reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barnes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crnkovic et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jandl et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mutgan et al., 2024</xref>). Due to the complex structure of PG, they can withstand high pressure, modulate cellular phenotype and thus be a necessary part of the adaptation or maladaptation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wight and Merrilees, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Despite broad changes in expression profiles in both cell types upon vascular remodeling and strikingly low overlap in perturbed pathways between PASMC and PAAF, they nevertheless share one common feature. Expression pattern of key cell-type-enriched elements is preserved in the diseased state. This finding is further supported by the global analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic profiles revealing that cell type as a variable has a stronger influence on sample distinction then disease condition. In other words, majority of IPAH-PASMC are still more alike to donor–PASMC then to any PAAF.</p><p>Interestingly, both cell types share a common disturbance in mitochondria characterized by lower IPAH mitochondrial content and hyperpolarized mitochondrial membrane potential. Nevertheless, ultimate phenotypic consequences of such a change still seems to be divergent for each cell type, as implied by distinct stimulated ROS response. Whether mitochondrial disturbance is one the initial cause of the disease or its consequence, as a common point it offers a potential action point to revert cell states from different lineages toward a normal, homeostatic condition, in line with reports on restoring SOD2 expression as a viable therapeutic target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Paulin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Plecitá Hlavatá et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Going beyond cataloguing molecular and functional changes, we address the underlying communication mechanisms responsible for maintenance and transition between identified cell states. We first dissect the role of ECM composition and reveal how a relative change in the laminin-to-collagen ratio, driven by a shift in PAAF cell state, similarly alters the spreading, attachment, migration, and expansion of both normal and diseased PASMCs. The comparable responses of donor and IPAH-PASMC likely result from their shared integrin receptor expression profiles. Meanwhile, ECM class switching engages different high-affinity integrin receptors, which activate alternative downstream signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nguyen et al., 2000</xref>) and lead to differential responses to collagen and laminin matrices. We thus propose a model in which laminins and collagens act as PAAF-secreted ligands, regulating PASMC behavior through their ECM-sensing integrin receptors.</p><p>We also uncover an autocrine loop centered on PAAF and showing how activated complement pathway can drive expression of PAAF-enriched ECM components. These processes could induce a more invasive cellular phenotype and potentially promote neointima formation. One could trace this PASMC susceptibility to ECM composition change to their enriched expression in integrin subunits serving as collagen and laminin receptors, making them uniquely primed to sense and respond to external cues. However, the same mechanism renders cells susceptible to phenotypic change induced simply by extended in vitro culturing, testified by broad expression profile differences between fresh and cultured cells. This common caveat in cell biology research and represents a technical and practical tradeoff that requires cross validation of key findings. Using a combination of archived lung tissue and available single-cell RNA sequencing dataset of human pulmonary arteries, we show that some of the key defining phenotypic features of diseased cells, such as altered proliferation rate and ECM production, are preserved and gradually lost upon prolonged culturing. Interestingly, this culturing effect was more pronounced in PAAF particularly with respect to inverse direction of enrichment for inflammatory/cytokine signaling process. The removal of PAAF from their native immunomodulatory environment and the presence of hydrocortisone in PAAF culture media could provide a potential explanation for this effect.</p><p>We extend our investigations more broadly and uncover a general shift in IPAH-PAAF secretome being sufficient to induce significant phenotypic changes in normal PASMC. Among several deregulated ligands, we identify downregulated expression of PTX3, a protective factor, and upregulation of HGF, pathogenic factor, as PAAF-sourced regulators of PASMC cell state. PTX3 counteracts pro-proliferative action of fibroblast growth factor and its overexpression attenuates neointima formation in systemic arteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Camozzi et al., 2005</xref>). Conversely, upregulation of HGF/cMet pathway in endothelial cells upon Sox17 loss was associated with PAH promotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Park et al., 2022</xref>). We would therefore argue that potential exploratory clinical trial for pulmonary vascular disease could entail a combination therapy consisting of recombinant PTX3 and HGF blocking antibody or c-Met inhibitor. However, the identified factors likely represent just a fraction of ligands expressed by other cell types present in the pulmonary artery compartment. The influence of endothelial and inflammatory cells on PASMC and PAAF phenotype requires further investigation.</p><p>A low case number and end-stage disease samples used for omics characterization represents a study limitation that has to be taken into account before assuming similar findings would be evident in the entire PAH patient population over the course of the disease development and progression.</p><p>Nevertheless, our results provide detailed understanding of functional changes in relation to underlying molecular expression differences upon pulmonary vascular remodeling. Furthermore, we identify novel targets for cell-type-specific correction of diseased cell states and potential reverse remodeling strategies.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Resources, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con17"><p>Resources, Data curation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con18"><p>Resources, Data curation, Methodology, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con19"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con20"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con21"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con22"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con23"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con24"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con25"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human lung samples from IPAH patients and downsized non-transplanted donor lungs, serving as healthy control, were obtained from Division of Thoracic Surgery, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.

The authors also aimed to identify cell-cell communication axes in order to infer mechanisms by which these two cells interact and depend upon external cues. This study will be of interest to the scientific and clinical communities of those interested in pulmonary vascular biology and disease. It also will appeal to those interested in lung and vascular development as well as multi-omic analytic procedures.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) This is one of the first studies using orthogonal sequencing and phenotyping for characterization of source-matched neighoring mesenchymal PASMC and PAAF cells in healthy and diseased IPAH patients. This is a major strength which allows for direct comparison of neighboring cell types and the ability to address an unanswered question regarding the nature of these mesenchymal &quot;mural&quot; cells at a precise molecular level.</p><p>(2) Unlike a number of multi-omic sequencing papers that read more as an atlas of findings without structure, the inherent comparative organization of the study and presentation of the data were valuable in aiding the reader in understanding how to discern the distinct IPAH-associated cell states. As a result, the reader not only gleans greater insight into these two interacting cell types in disease but also now can leverage these datasets more easily for future research questions in this space.</p><p>(3) There are interesting and surprising findings in the cellular characterizations, including the low proliferative state of IPAH-PASMCs as compared to the hyperproliferative state in IPAH-PAAFs. Furthermore, the cell-cell communication axes involving ECM components and soluble ligands provided by PAAFs that direct cell state dynamics of PASMCs offer some of the first and foundational descriptions of what are likely complex cellular interactions that await discovery.</p><p>(4) Technical rigor is quite high in the -omics methodology and in vitro phenotyping tools used.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>There are some weaknesses in the methodology that should temper the conclusions:</p><p>(1) The number of donors sampled for PAAF/PASMCs was relatively small for both healthy controls and IPAH patients. Thus, while the level of detail of -omics profiling was quite deep, the generalizability of their findings to all IPAH patients or Group 1 PAH patients is limited. In the revised manuscript, the authors addressed this concern with important text changes and additional data.</p><p>(2) While the study utilized early passage cells, these cells nonetheless were still cultured outside the in vivo milieu prior to analysis. Thus, while there is an assumption that these cells do not change fundamental behavior outside the body, that is not entirely proven for all transcriptional and proteomic signatures. As such, the major alterations that are noted would be more compelling if validated from tissue or cells derived directly from in vivo sources. Without such validation, the major limitation of the impact and conclusions of the paper is that the full extent of the relevance of these findings to human disease is not known. The authors addressed this concern appropriately with significant text changes to clarify these limitations for the reader.</p><p>(3) While the presentation of most of the manuscript was quite clear and convincing, the terminology and conclusions regarding &quot;cell fate trajectories&quot; throughout the manuscript did not seem to be fully justified. That is, all of the analyses were derived from cells originating from end-stage IPAH, and otherwise, the authors were not lineage tracing across disease initiation or development (which would be impossible currently in humans). So, while the description of distinct &quot;IPAH-associated states&quot; makes sense, any true cell fate trajectory was not clearly defined. The revised manuscript has removed this terminology and replaced it with more precise language.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>The authors were quite responsive to all of my concerns, offering both important revisions to the presentation of the work as well as new data. While some of the limitations were not fully resolved (and the authors provide appropriate justification for this), the revised manuscript is much improved. It will be of great interest to both the scientific and clinical communities.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id

Thus, while the level of detail of -omics profiling was quite deep, the generalizability of their findings to all IPAH patients or Group 1 PAH patients is limited.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers concerns regarding the generalizability of the findings and have acknowledged this as the study limitation in the discussion: “A low case number and end-stage disease samples used for omics characterization represents a study limitation that has to be taken into account before assuming similar findings would be evident in the entire PAH patient population over the course of the disease development and progression”. We have addressed this issue by performing validation of key in vitro findings using fresh cells or assessment of FFPE lung material from additional independent samples in the revised manuscript (Figures 2D, 3D, 3H, 4H). For transparency, we provide biological sample number in the result section of the modified manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) While the study utilized early passage cells, these cells nonetheless were still cultured outside the in vivo milieu prior to analysis. Thus, while there is an assumption that these cells do not change fundamental behavior outside the body, that is not entirely proven for all transcriptional and proteomic signatures. As such, the major alterations that are noted would be more compelling if validated from tissue or cells derived directly from in vivo sources. Without such validation, the major limitation of the impact and conclusions of the paper is that the full extent of the relevance of these findings to human disease is not known.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this constructive and excellent suggestion. The comparison of fresh and cultured cells revealed a strong and early divergence of differentially regulated pathways for PAAF, while a more gradual transition for PASMC. The results of this analysis are included in the new Figures 2D, 3D, 3H, and 4H. Implications are discussed in the revised manuscript: “However, the same mechanism renders cells susceptible to phenotypic change induced simply by extended vitro culturing, testified by broad expression profile differences between fresh and cultured cells. This common caveat in cell biology research and represents a technical and practical tradeoff that requires cross validation of key findings. Using a combination of archived lung tissue and available single cell RNA sequencing dataset of human pulmonary arteries, we show that some of the key defining phenotypic features of diseased cells, such as altered proliferation rate and ECM production, are preserved and gradually lost upon prolonged culturing”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) While the presentation of most of the manuscript was quite clear and convincing, the terminology and conclusions regarding &quot;cell fate trajectories&quot; throughout the manuscript did not seem to be fully justified. That is, all of the analyses were derived from cells originating from end-stage IPAH, and otherwise, the authors were not lineage tracing across disease initiation or development (which would be impossible currently in humans). So, while the description of distinct &quot;IPAH-associated states&quot; makes sense, any true cell fate trajectory was not clearly defined.</p></disp-quote><p>In accordance to reviewer’s comment, we have decided to modify the wording to exclude the “cell fate trajectory” phrase and replace it with “acquisition of disease cell state”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Major comments:</p><p>(1) In Figure 1, PASMC and PAAF were collected from the lungs of healthy donors and analyzed for transcriptomics and proteomics; in Figure 1A, it can be taken as if both cells from IPAH patients were also analyzed, but this is not reflected in the results. In Figure1D, immunostaining of normal lungs confirms the localization of PASMC and PAAF markers found by transcriptomics. The authors describe a strong, but not perfect, correlation between the transcriptomics and proteomics data from Figure S1, but the gene names of each cellular marker they found should also be listed. In addition, the authors have observed the expression of markers characteristic of PASMC and PAAF in pulmonary vessels of healthy subjects by IH, but is there any novelty in these markers? Furthermore, are the expression sites of these markers altered in IPAH patients?</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript we have adjusted the schematic to reflect the fact that only donor cells are compared in Figure 1. We additionally provide a correlation of cell type markers between proteomic and transcriptomic data sets for those molecules that are detected in both datasets (Figure S1B).</p><p>We provide clarification on the novelty aspect in the result section: “Some of the molecules were previously associated with predominant SMC, such as RGS5 and CSPR1 (Crnkovic et al., 2022; Snider et al., 2008), or adventitial fibroblast, such as SCARA5, CFD and MGST1 (Crnkovic et al., 2022; Sikkema et al., 2023) expression”. Except for RGS5, expression and localization of other markers in IPAH was previously unknown.</p><p>The conservation of expression sites for reported markers was validated in IPAH in the revised manuscript (Figure 2D), with IGFBP5 showing dual localization in both cell types. Moreover, results in Figure 1D, 1E and 2D support the validity of omics findings and preservation of key markers during passaging.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In Figure 2, the authors compare PASMC and PAAF derived from IPAH patients and donors. The results show that transcriptomics and proteomics changes are clearly differentiated by cell type and not by pathological state. In the pathological state, transcriptional changes are more pronounced. The GO analysis of the factors that showed significant changes in each cell type is shown in Figure 2E, but the differences between the GO analysis of the transcriptomics and proteomics results are not clearly shown. The reviewer believes that the advantages of a combined analysis of both should be indicated. Also, in Figure 2G, the GAG content in PA appears to be elevated in only 3 cases, while the other 5 cases appear to be at the same level as the donor; is there a characteristic change in these 3 cases? Figure 2I shows that the phenotype of PAAF changes with cell passages. Since this phenomenon would be interesting and useful to the reader, additional discussion regarding the mechanism would be desired.</p></disp-quote><p>We have integrated both data sets in order to achieve stronger and meaningful analysis due to weaker and uncomplete correlation between transcriptomic and protein dataset as indicated in the results section: “Comparative analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic data sets revealed a strong, but not complete level of linear correlation between the gene and protein expression profiles (Figure S1B, C). We therefore decided to use an integrative dataset and analyzed all significantly enriched genes and proteins (-log10(P)&gt;1.3) between both cell types to achieve stronger and more robust analysis”. In general, proteomic profile showed fewer significant differences and extent of change was lesser compared with transcriptomics, likely due to technical limitations of the method and sensitivity, testified by the complete lack of top transcriptomic molecules (RGS5, ADH1C, IGFBP5, CFD, SCARA5) in the protein dataset.</p><p>To strengthen the findings of increased GAG in IPAH pulmonary arteries, we have performed compartment-specific, quantitative image analysis of Alcian blue staining on additional donor and patient samples (n=10 for each condition). The new analysis totaling around 40 PA confirmed significantly increased deposition of GAG in IPAH pulmonary arteries.</p><p>We have addressed the issue of phenotypic change with prolonged cell culture in the revised manuscript by systematically comparing enrichment for biological processes between fresh (Crnkovic et al., 2022: GSE210248), very early (this study: GSE255669) and later passage cells (Chelladurai et al., 2022: GSE144932; Gorr et al., 2020: GSE144274). We observed cell type differences in the rate of change of phenotypic features, with PAAF showing faster shift early on during culturing that could for some of the features be due to isolation from immunomodulatory environment or presence of hydrocortisone supplement in the PAAF cell media. These points have been described in the revised results section and mentioned in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors claim that one feature of this paper is the use of &quot;very early passage (p1)&quot; of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC). Since there are other existing (previouly reported) data that are publicly available, such as RNA-seq data using cells with 2-4 cell passages, it may be possible to show that fewer passages are better in primary culture by comparing the data presented in this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Following reviewers’ comments, we have performed systematic comparison (Crnkovic et al., 2022: GSE210248), very early (this study: GSE255669) and later passage cells (Chelladurai et al., 2022: GSE144932; Gorr et al., 2020: GSE144274). in the revised manuscript in order to comprehensively address the issue and define changes occurring as a result of prolonged in vitro conditions (Figure 3H). The results showed that the expression profile of early passage cells retains some of the key phenotypic features displayed by cells in their native environment, with PASMC displaying a more gradual loss of phenotypic characteristics compared to PAAF. Interestingly, PAAF displayed a striking inverse enrichment for inflammatory/NF-kB signaling between fresh and cultured PAAF, which could potentially be caused by the hydrocortisone supplement in the PAAF cell media or due to the isolation from its highly immunomodulatory enviroment. These points have been described in the revised results section and mentioned in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors describe a study characterized by decreased expression of &quot;cytoskeletal contractile elements&quot; in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC) derived from patients with IPAH. What are the implications of this result, and does it arise from the use of smooth muscle in patients resistant to pulmonary artery smooth muscle dilating agents? A discussion on this issue needs to be made in a way that is easy for the reader to understand.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an interesting point regarding the loss the contractile markers and response to vasodilating therapy. We would speculate that isolated decrease in contractile machinery, without concomitant change in ECM and other PASMC features, would dampen both the contraction and relaxation properties of the single PASMC, affecting not only its response to dilating agents, but also to vasoconstrictors. Clinical consequences and responsiveness to dilating agents are more difficult to predict, since the vasoactive response would additionally depend on mechanical properties of the pulmonary artery defined by cellular and ECM composition. Nevertheless, we believe that decreased expression of contractile machinery reflects an intrinsic, “programmed” response of SMC to remodeling, rather than vasodilator therapy-induced selection pressure, since similar phenotypic change is observed in SMC from systemic circulation and in various animal models without exposure to PAH medication. These considerations have been included in the revised discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) There are a lot of secreted proteins that increase or decrease in Figure 6G, but there is scant reason to focus on PTX3 and HGF among them. The authors need to elaborate on the above issue.</p></disp-quote><p>We regret the lack of clarity and provide improved explanation of the ligand selection strategy in the revised manuscript. In order to prioritize the potential hits, we first used hierarchical clustering to group co-regulated ligands into smaller number of groups. We then prioritized for the ligands that lacked or had limited information with respect to IPAH. Based on these results, we analyzed the effect of three additional ligands on PASMC cell state marker expression (Figure S8). This additional data supported the initial focus on PTX3 and HGF.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>(1) Regarding the number of specimens used in the Result, it would be more helpful to the reader if the number of samples were also mentioned in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included the number of used samples in manuscript text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) There is no explanation of what R2Y represents in Figure 2B. This reviewer is not able to understand the statistical analysis of Figure 2H.

Significant interaction effects are indicated as follows: * for stimulation × cell type interactions and # for cell type × disease state interactions (both *, # p&lt;0.05)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In Figure 3, the authors examined whether there were molecular abnormalities common to IPAH-PASMC and IPAH-PAAF and found that the number of commonly regulated genes and proteins was limited to 47. Further analysis of these regulators by STRING analysis revealed that factors related to the regulation of apoptosis are commonly altered in both cells. On the other hand, the authors focused on mitochondria, as SOD2 is downregulated, and found an increase in ROS production specific to PASMC, indicating that mitochondrial dysfunction is common to PASMC and PAAF in IPAH, but downstream phenomena are different between cell types. Factors associated with apoptosis regulation have been found to be both upward and downward regulated, but the actual occurrence of apoptosis in both cell types has not been addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed TUNEL staining on FFPE lung tissue from donors and IPAH patients that revealed apoptosis as a rare event in both conditions in PASMC and PAAF. Therefore, no meaningful quantification could be conducted. An example of pulmonary artery where rare positive signal in either PAAF or PASMC could be found is provided in Figure 4H.</p><p>Unfortunately, association of a particular gene with a pathway is by default arbitrary and potentially ambiguous. In particular, factors identified as associated in apoptosis are also involved in regulation of inflammatory signaling (BIRC3, DDIT3) and amino acid metabolism (SHMT1). Nevertheless, mitochondria represent a crucial cellular hub for apoptosis regulation and, as shown in the current study, display significant functional alterations in IPAH in both cell types, aligning with reduced mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD2) expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The meaning of the gray circle in Figure 3C should be clarified. Similarly, the meaning of the color in Fig. 3D should be clearly explained. In Figure 3E-G, each cell is significantly different from 18-61 cells, and the number of each cell and the reason should be described.</p></disp-quote><p>We regret the confusion and provide better explanation of the figure legend: “gray nodes representing their putative upstream regulators”, “with color coding reflecting the IPAH dependent regulation”. In the revised Figure panels 4E-G (old 3E-G) we provide the exact number of cells measured in each condition. Although we tried to have comparable cell confluency at the time of measurement, different proliferation rates between cells from different cell type and condition led to different number of measured cells per donor/patient.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) In Figure 4, the authors focus on factors that vary in different directions between cells, revealing fingerprints of molecular changes that differ between cell types, particularly IPAH-PASMC, which acquires a synthetic phenotype with enhanced regulation of chemotaxis elements, whereas IPAH-PAAF, a fast cycling cell characteristics. Next, focusing on the ECM components that were specifically altered in IPAH-PASMC, Nichenet analysis in Figure 5 suggested that ligands from PAAF may act on PASMC, and the authors focused on integrin signaling to examine ECM contact and changes in cell function. The results indicate that adhesion to laminin is poor in PASMC. Although no difference was observed between donor and IPAH PASMCs, a discussion of the reasons for this would be desired and helpful to the readers.</p></disp-quote><p>Both donor and IPAH PASMCs respond similarly to laminin. However, our key finding is the downregulation of laminin in IPAH PAAF, which likely leads to a skewed laminin-to-collagen ratio and altered ECM composition in remodeled arteries. This shift in the ECM class results in altered PASMC behavior, affecting both donor and IPAH cells similarly. In the revised manuscript, we demonstrate that PASMC largely retain the expression pattern of integrin subunits that serve as high-affinity collagen and laminin receptors, with higher levels compared to PAAF (Figure 6F, G). Furthermore, we speculate that the distinct cellular phenotypic responses to collagen versus laminin coatings may arise from different downstream signaling pathways activated by the various integrin subunits (Nguyen et al., 2000). These considerations have been included in the revised discussion: “The comparable responses of donor and IPAH PASMC likely result from their shared integrin receptor expression profiles. Meanwhile, ECM class switching engages different high-affinity integrin receptors, which activate alternative downstream signaling pathways (Nguyen et al., 2000) and lead to differential responses to collagen and laminin matrices. We thus propose a model in which laminins and collagens act as PAAF-secreted ligands, regulating PASMC behavior through their ECM-sensing integrin receptors.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Since Figure 3B and Figure 4A seem to show the same results, why not combine them into one?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, these figure panels show the same results, but the focus of the investigations in each Figure is different. We therefore opted to keep the panels separate for better clarity and logical link to other panels in the same figure</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) In Figure 6, the interaction analysis of scRNAseq data with respect to signaling between PASMC and PAAF was performed using Nichenet and CellChat, showing that signaling from PAAF to PASMC is biased toward secreted ligands and that a functionally relevant set of soluble ligands is impaired in the IPAH state. From there, they proceeded with co-culture experiments and showed that co-culture healthy PASMC with PAAF of IPAH patients abolished PASMC markers in the healthy state. Furthermore, the authors attempted to identify ligands that induce functional changes in PASMCs produced from IPAH PAAFs and found that HGF is a factor that downregulates the expression of contractile markers in PASMCs. Further insights may be gained by co-culturing IPAH-derived cells in co-culture experiments. Also, no beneficial effect of pentraxin3 was found in Figure 6H. The authors should examine the effect of pentraxin3 on PASMC cells derived from IPAH patients, rather than healthy donors.</p></disp-quote><p>We tested the influence of IPAH-PASMC on donor-PAAF and found no effect on the expression of the selected markers. We thank the reviewer for the suggestion to conduct the experiments on IPAH-PASMC. The new data show that both PTX3 and HGF have a significant effect, but differential effect on IPAH-PASMC as compared to donors-PASMC. Whereas PTX lacks effect on donor PASMC, it leads to downregulation of some of the contractile markers in IPAH PASMC, while HGF upregulates VCAN synthetic marker in IPAH PASMC. These results are now included in Figure 7H.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The authors should double-check for grammar and typos in the manuscript.
