GCC185 is a trans Golgi-associated protein that captures vesicles inbound from late endosomes. Although predicted to be relatively rigid and highly extended, we show that flexibility in a central region is required for GCC185’s ability to function in a vesicle tethering cycle. Proximity ligation experiments show that that GCC185’s N-and C-termini are within &lt;40 nm of each other on the Golgi. In physiological buffers without fixatives, atomic force microscopy reveals that GCC185 is shorter than predicted, and its flexibility is due to a central bubble that represents local unwinding of specific sequences. Moreover, 85% of the N-termini are splayed, and the splayed N-terminus can capture transport vesicles in vitro. These unexpected features support a model in which GCC185 collapses onto the Golgi surface, perhaps by binding to Rab GTPases, to mediate vesicle tethering.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12790.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12790.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12790.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Some cells release molecules, such as hormones and neurotransmitters, to signal to other cells and influence how they work. As part of the release process, these molecules are packaged into small, balloon-like structures called vesicles. Such vesicles move around within cells and are able to find the right place to release their contents to the outside.</p><p>A cellular compartment called the Golgi complex helps to prepare proteins for release from the cell. Vesicles can bind to tethering proteins on the surface of the Golgi, but it was not clear how these proteins are able to capture the correct kind of vesicle. The prediction was that the proteins are rigid, shaped like pipe cleaners that stick out from the Golgi as a meshwork that traps vesicles.</p><p>Cheung et al. isolated a specific Golgi tethering protein (called GCC185) from cultured human cells and used a technique called atomic force microscopy to visualize its structure. This revealed that this protein is not rod-like; it is instead rather floppy, and has two arms at one end that may ‘hug’ the incoming vesicle. Cheung et al. showed that this protein needs its middle portion to be floppy to work correctly. This changes the way we think about how vesicles are able to find their corresponding targets on different compartments inside cells.</p><p>Further experiments are now needed to answer a number of questions. What does the tether look like when actually bound to a vesicle? What happens after the vesicle binds – how does the tether let go? What other components are needed for vesicle capture and release?</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12790.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12790.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>coiled-coil</kwd><kwd>membrane traffic</kwd><kwd>vesicle tethering</kwd><kwd>Golgi complex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK37332</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pfeffer</surname><given-names>Suzanne R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheung</surname><given-names>Pak-yan Patricia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005492</institution-id><institution>Stanford University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Limouse</surname><given-names>Charles</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Atomic force microscopy reveals a floppy, dimeric, coiled coil Golgin structure that captures transport vesicles via splayed, N-terminal ends at the Golgi complex.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Membrane trafficking involves the collection of cargo into transport vesicles, movement of vesicles along cytoskeletal tracks, and tethering, docking and fusion of vesicles at their target membranes. Tethering is the process by which partner membranes are brought together into close proximity to permit their subsequent fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Pfeffer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sztul and Lupashin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Yu and Hughson, 2010</xref>). Two classes of transport vesicle tethers have been described to date: multi-subunit complexes such as the Exocyst, COG, Dsl1 and TRAPP complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bröcker et al., 2010</xref>), and larger, dimeric coiled-coil containing proteins such as p115 and EEA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sztul and Lupashin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Munro, 2011</xref>). Both classes share the ability to bind to Rab GTPases, SNARE proteins and vesicle coat complexes, suggesting that they play important roles in coordinating molecular events important for target recognition and membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Short et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sinka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hayes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hughson and Reinisch, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Golgins are long, Golgi-associated proteins that contain a high proportion of sequences that are predicted to form coiled coils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Munro, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Short et al., 2005</xref>). They are anchored to the Golgi via their C-termini, and models suggest that they protrude long distances, relying on the relative rigidity of the coiled coil structure to provide a meshwork that can capture vesicles in the vicinity of the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Yu and Hughson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Munro, 2011</xref>). GCC185 is a Golgin required for the transport of mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) from late endosomes to the trans Golgi network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Reddy, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Derby et al., 2007</xref>). Cells depleted of GCC185 accumulate MPRs in Rab9 GTPase- and AP-1-decorated transport carriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hayes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Reddy, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brown et al., 2011</xref>), providing an assay for GCC185 tethering capacity. GCC185 is likely anchored on the TGN surface by cooperative binding of its C-terminus to both Rab6 and Arl1 GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burguete et al., 2008</xref>). We (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Reddy, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burguete et al., 2008</xref>) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Derby, 2004</xref>) have shown that GCC185 binds Arl1 rather weakly, but Rab6A binding greatly enhances Arl1 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burguete et al., 2008</xref>). Arl1’s role in anchoring GCC185 was questioned because it seemed not to be required if siRNA-depleted by 80% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Houghton et al., 2009</xref>); in fact, 90% depletion of Arl1 is required to displace GCC185 from membranes and to detect its role in Golgi localization of the GCC185 C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burguete et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>To date, we have little (if any) information, whether Golgins are actually as long as predicted, whether they are relatively rigid, or even where or how they bind transport vesicles. Moreover, once they bind vesicles, what happens next? Many coiled-coil tethers contain putative hinges, located between predicted rod-like, coiled-coil domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barr and Short, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lupas et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Munro, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Pfeffer, 1999</xref>). Do these regions function as hinges? We have taken a multidisciplinary approach to investigate the mechanism of vesicle tethering by a trans Golgi network (TGN)-associated Golgin, GCC185. Our data provide novel insight into the tethering process and suggest that the TGN Golgin, GCC185, uses an unexpected mechanism to accomplish vesicle tethering.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Secondary structure prediction algorithms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lupas et al., 1991</xref>) suggest that GCC185 may be almost entirely coiled-coil, perhaps &gt;200 nm in length. To determine the protein’s actual length, we expressed and purified an N-terminally GFP-FLAG-tagged, GCC185 wild type in HEK293 cells. To test models of vesicle tethering that invoke tether bending, we also generated a '△hinge' construct missing two potential hinge domains near the middle of the protein that were selected based upon predicted breaks in coiled coil sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; △751-805, △890-939). The wild type protein migrated at ~220 kD upon SDS-PAGE; GCC185 △hinge was somewhat smaller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Purified GCC185 was imaged by atomic force microscopy (AFM) after application onto a mica surface. AFM of GCC185 under physiological buffer conditions revealed the molecule as a parallel dimer of ~145 nm in length with splayed ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">3</xref>). The N-terminal, globular GFP moiety could often be visualized; the C-terminal, smaller 'GRIP domain' could also be detected.

It is important to note that the N-terminal GFP used in AFM experiments did not impede the ability of the N-terminus to form a coiled coil because many fewer splays and central bubbles were seen in initial experiments when GCC185 was purified in the absence of dithiothreitol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Without DTT, GCC185 appeared rod-like.</p><p>Remarkably, half of the GCC185 molecules displayed central unwinding of the coiled coil structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). To our knowledge, such unwinding in a coiled coil has not been detected previously. The unwound 'bubble' region was less frequently observed in GCC185 △hinge protein preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>) and thus not a general artifact of protein deposition on mica; the mean size of the bubble was ~27 nm in wild type versus ~17 nm in △hinge molecules, with a much sharper size distribution in the latter case, and only 20% of the △hinge molecules showing any bubble at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,E</xref>). The normalized splay-to-splay distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) provides information about the molecule’s tendency to bend in this region; rigid (or elongated) molecules have a longer splay-to-splay distance (approaching a value of 1) than bent molecules. △hinge proteins all showed the longest mean, normalized splay-to-splay distances; using this metric, wild type molecules with bubbles were more bent than those without bubbles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). These data show that GCC185 is a flexible molecule and its tendency to bend is contributed by the so-called 'hinge' residues 751-805 and 890-939.</p><p>That the molecules detected by AFM represent individual dimers rather than end-to-end tetramers was determined by introduction of an HA epitope tag into the central hinge region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>); antibody labeling of such molecules was readily detected by AFM and showed antibodies at the position expected for the epitope tag location within a parallel dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B-D</xref>).

These experiments demonstrate the importance of hinge sequences for GCC185-mediated vesicle tethering, and show that these sequences provide flexibility rather than a binding site for another cellular component.</p><p>The above experiments show that GCC185 tethering requires central flexibility, implying that GCC185 may flex in the middle—to bring N-terminally bound cargo closer to the target membrane (and to the tether’s C-terminus). This was tested using a 'proximity ligation assay' (PLA) to monitor the proximity of GCC185’s N- and C-termini on the surface of the Golgi in cells. Briefly, cells are labeled with primary antibodies from different species that are specific for the two domains to be tested; secondary antibodies are added that have short oligonucleotides attached. A circularizing oligonucleotide is added, ligated, and amplified; the product is detected by hybridization to a fluorescent oligonucleotide. Epitopes that are within 40 nm of each other are detected as a fluorescent spot. The total intensity of PLA signal per cell can then be quantified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carpenter et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Using mouse anti-GCC185 N-terminus and rabbit anti-GCC185 C-terminus antibodies, PLA signal was readily detected on Golgi complexes of individual cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Cells expressing GFP-GCC185 wild type and GFP-GCC185 △hinge constructs showed similar levels of protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, X-axis). However, GFP-GCC185-△hinge yielded a significantly weaker PLA signal when compared with cells expressing GFP-GCC185 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>). This suggests strongly that the flexibility-conferring regions facilitate the ability of the N- and C-termini to achieve proximity on the Golgi. Quantitation of PLA signal intensity as a function of protein expression confirmed the importance of the hinge region for proximity ligation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Only at higher expression levels was proximity detected for the GCC185-△hinge construct; at high expression levels, these are likely to represent inter- rather than intra-molecular processes. These experiments show that the presence of a flexible region is needed for GCC185 function and permits the N- and C-termini to become closer together, on the Golgi, in cells. It should be noted that proximity ligation could indicate bending/flexing of individual proteins or inter-digitation of two different proteins in anti-parallel orientation; we favor the former explanation, as it is hard to imagine that hinge deletion would influence the possibility of inter-digitation.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Vesicle capture by GCC185 splayed N-termini</title><p>Current models posit that a tethering protein should capture vesicles at one end and be anchored to the target membrane at the other end.

We have shown that transport vesicles can bind to GCC185’s N-terminus, and seem to prefer to bind to splayed ends of this dimeric, coiled coil tether. The presence of multiple Rab-binding sites along the length of individual Golgin proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sinka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hayes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Short et al., 2001</xref>) has led others to suggest that vesicles may hop along individual tethers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barr and Short, 2003</xref>) or be captured by Golgin ‘tentacles’ within a potential Golgin meshwork towards the target membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Munro, 2011</xref>). Such a model considers tethers as rigid, extended rods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, left). Our data favor a model whereby GCC185 is C-terminally anchored to the TGN through Rab6 and Arl1 GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burguete et al., 2008</xref>) and captures Rab9-decorated transport vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hayes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Reddy, 2006</xref>) by binding them at the N-terminus and/or near the hinge region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brown et al., 2011</xref>); importantly, the central bubble gives significant flexibility to the protein and would allow it to collapse onto the Golgi surface, bringing vesicles close to the trans Golgi target membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). GCC185 can bind multiple Rab GTPases along its length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hayes et al., 2009</xref>), as well as syntaxin16, Arl1 and Arl4 GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burguete et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ganley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lin et al., 2011</xref>). GCC185 also binds to CLASP proteins that catalyze microtubule polymerization from the Golgi surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Efimov et al., 2007</xref>). These additional interactions will all pull the tether towards the Golgi surface, bringing N-terminally bound vesicles closer to the Golgi surface for productive vesicle docking.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12790.014</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Collapse model for vesicle tethering at the TGN.</title><p>Previous models based on GMAP-210 have led to a model that tethers extend from the Golgi as highly rigid rods that may bend in the middle ('Rigid hinge'). Data presented here show that GCC185 is shorter than originally predicted (145 nm vs. &gt;204 nm), has splayed ends that can capture vesicles, and an unusual central bubble and floppiness as detected by atomic force microscopy. These features lead us to propose a flexible collapse model whereby the tether may collapse onto the Golgi surface, possibly facilitated by Rab GTPases and other proteins that are localized there. Note that vesicles may also (or alternately) bind near the bubble, and engage both the AP1 and Rab9 binding sites there, in addition to GCC185’s N-terminal arms.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12790.014">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12790.014</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-12790-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>We have shown here that the functionally essential, GCC185 N-terminus has the capacity to bind to transport vesicles in vitro. N-terminal vesicle binding is shared with GMAP-210, a Golgin localized to the cis-Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sato et al., 2015</xref>); for other Golgins, it is presumed due to binding sites for various coat proteins. In previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brown et al., 2011</xref>), we showed that GCC185 residues 938–1032 comprise an AP-1 binding site that is also needed for GCC185 vesicle tethering (blue bar in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>); the transport vesicles are AP-1 decorated, thus this was presumed to represent a possible vesicle binding site. This AP-1 binding site is located immediately downstream of the regions deleted in the △hinge protein studied here (751-805, 890939) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Moreover, an apparently dispensible, Rab9 GTPase binding site is located directly between the two deletions made to generate the △hinge mutant (orange bar, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Binding of Rab9 to that site could influence the ability of that part of the protein to form a bubble, and could influence the efficiency of tethering on a time scale finer than that assayed here and previously. Both Rab9 and AP-1 are present on the transport vesicles captured, but we do not yet know the precise molecular interaction underlying the ability of the N-terminal domain to bind vesicles. That a splayed N-terminus is utilized suggests that the tether gains efficiency by avidity, and can reach out to 'hug' the vesicle. How the various binding sites along GCC185 coordinate interactions with the vesicle and the target membrane to accomplish vesicle tethering represents an important area for future work.</p><p>Given the presence of AP-1 and Rab9 binding sites adjacent to the central bubble (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and the additional capacity of the splayed N-terminus to capture transport vesicles, it is also possible that rather than being held near GCC185’s N-terminus, the vesicle could bind primarily <italic>near the bubble</italic> while still being enwrapped by the N-terminal arms. The model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> is drawn to scale and assumes that the transport vesicles are ~50 nm in diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barbero, 2002</xref>); they need not be larger to be able to occupy both potential vesicle binding domains. The AP-1 binding site (939–1,031)is essential for GCC185’s role in vesicle tethering but not Golgi ribbon maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brown et al., 2011</xref>), and must be considered in any model of GCC185 vesicle tethering.</p><p>Like GCC185, the other human GRIP domain Golgins are also predicted to contain a high proportion of coiled coil sequences. Golgin-245 shares with GCC185 two very obvious breaks in the coiled coil that may also form a central bubble; its absolute N-terminus is also likely splayed. The shorter Golgin-97 and GCC88 proteins are likely about half as long as GCC185 by sequence alone; Golgin-97’s N-terminus is likely splayed, and GCC88 may very well also contain a central bubble.</p><p>Finally, a domain between GCC185 residues 1332 and 1438 is required for maintenance of Golgi ribbon structure but not transport vesicle tethering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brown et al., 2011</xref>). This observation highlights the fact that workers in this field have oversimplified thinking about how tethers function—simple engagement of N- and C-termini is not sufficient for both vesicle capture and Golgi ribbon stabilization. A recent paper studying Golgi tethers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Wong and Munro, 2014</xref>) concluded that unlike other TGN tethers, GCC185 could not tether vesicles upon re-localization to mitochondria. The extent of Golgi membrane mobilization seen in that study was far greater than the small pool size of the much rarer, Rab9-containing, AP-1 positive, mannose phosphate receptor transport vesicle intermediates—that are only visualized in cells upon depletion of tethering factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Reddy, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brown et al., 2011</xref>). It is very possible that that study assayed the ability of TGN tethers to recruit/assemble TGN ribbons, rather than capture rare transport vesicle intermediates. Since ribbon assembly and transport vesicle capture are driven by separate domains of GCC185, perhaps GCC185 is more potent in vesicle tethering rather than Golgi ribbon assembly.</p><p>A remaining mystery is why depletion of any one of the GRIP domain-containing Golgins leads to Golgi fragmentation. Whatever the explanation, the floppy appearance of purified GCC185, when deposited on mica in the absence of fixative, and the proximity of GCC185’s N- and C-termini on the Golgi in cells, argue strongly against this protein behaving like a pipe cleaner, protruding on the surface of the trans Golgi network in cells. Instead, tether collapse represents an appealing, alternative model.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Expression plasmids</title><p>cDNAs encoding GCC185 full-length and fragments were prepared by ligating the full-length sequence and sequence encoding residues 1–358, 394–751, 1–889, 890–1684 into EGFP-C1 with a FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK) inserted downstream of GFP flanked by the GGATCC linker (AS) for purification purposes.

After 1 hr primary antibody incubation at room temperature, the PLA probe anti-mouse Plus and anti-rabbit Minus were diluted in PBS containing 1% BSA and added to cells for 1 hr at 37°C in a humidified chamber. All subsequent steps were performed at 37°C in a humidified chamber. Cells were then incubated with oligonucleotides complementary to the proximity probe and T4 DNA ligase for 30 min. Rolling-circle amplification was initiated by addition of Phi29 DNA polymerase and Texas red-labeled nucleotide probe. After 100 min, cells were washed and mounted and imaged using an Axiophot2 epifluorescence microscope fitted with a Plan-Neofluar 40x/0.75 objective (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Thornwood, NY), and a digital CCD camera ORCA-R<sup>2</sup> C10600 (Hamamatsu, Hamamatsu City, Japan). All microscope instrumentation was controlled by AxioVision4.7.2 software (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging). Individual cells (objects) were identified, and proximity ligation and GFP signals were quantified using CellProfiler (Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cellprofiler.org">www.cellprofiler.org</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>Expression and purification of GST-tagged constructs were as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brown et al., 2011</xref>). Constructs were transformed into BL21 (DE3) RIPL competent cells and bacterial cultures were induced at OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.5-0.7 with 0.25 mM IPTG for 3 hr at 30°C. Cells were resuspended in 50 mM Hepes, pH7.4, 250 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol and protease inhibitors and lysed by two passes through an EmulsiFlex-C5 apparatus (Avestin, Ottawa, ON) at &gt;10,000 lb/in<sup>2</sup> followed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 min in a FiberLite F15 (8x50c) rotor (Thermo Scientific). Clarified lysates containing GST-tagged proteins (His-1-358-GST, GST-1-358 and GST-1032-1331) were incubated with glutathione Sepharose resin (GE Healthcare) for 1 hr at 4°C.

After 8 minutes, the mica surface was gently rinsed with 2 ml buffer followed by 2 ml of ddH<sub>2</sub>0 to remove unbound proteins and dried by soft argon flow. Imaging was done in air with a Park100 AFM (Park Systems, Santa Clara, CA) operated in non-contact mode. We used ultra-sharp diamond-like carbon probes (NSG10 DLC, ~2–5 nm radius of curvature at the tip (K-Tek Nanotechnology, Wilsonville, OR) driven near resonance at ~200 kHz. To minimize both sample and tip damage during scanning, the set point was set to the largest possible value (largest average tip-sample distance) that allowed good surface tracking. Raster scans (1.2 μm X 1.2 μm) were performed at a resolution of 512x512 pixels with a scan rate of 1Hz. For presentation and analysis, images were first processed using a custom Matlab script (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Source code 1</xref> provided) to remove sample slant (flattening) by row and column-wise median subtraction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Analysis of AFM images</title><p>Individual molecules of each type were selected manually based on the following criteria: the whole object should be within the captured field without any part(s) being cropped by the borders, easily identified as isolated, individual, non-aggregated object with no overlap(s) with any other objects, and traceable/measurable. The number of selected molecules usually covered 40–70% of all the objects in the field, depending on the distribution of molecules and local quality of an image. To quantify the conformation of each molecule, a selected molecule was segmented into maximally 8 sections based on apparent structural features. The length of each segment (X1 to X8) was measured with ImageJ by setting the measuring scale with the known image spatial size and outlining the molecule contour with the segmented line tool.</p><p>Statistics- Minimum sample sizes were determined assuming 5% standard error and &gt;95% confidence level; P values and their methods of determination are indicated in the legends.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was funded by a grant to SRP from the US NIH (DK37332).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Fred Hughson, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors investigate the Golgin protein GCC185, which has functions in Golgi morphology and endosome-derived vesicle tethering. They demonstrate that two central hinge regions of GCC185 are required for GCC185 function in cells, and that these hinges can be replaced by synthetic flexible linkers (Gly-Ser repeats) to restore function. Proximity ligation is used to demonstrate that the N- and C-termini of GCC185 can be located within 40 nm of each other (despite a predicted length of ~200 nm for a rigid GCC185 molecule). Importantly, this proximity required the hinge region.</p><p>Purified full-length GCC185 was also analyzed by AFM. The authors observe a central bubble region that corresponds to the region containing the hinges. They find that the hinge region is required for enabling the molecule to form more compact structures. The authors also find that the N-terminus in particular exhibits splaying in which the two monomers are not coiled together. This is interesting because the authors also show that that the N-terminus of GCC185 can capture Rab9/CI-MPR vesicles from a crude vesicle fraction. Interestingly, the orientation of this N-terminus fused to GST is important – the more physiological chimera performs best.</p><p>This manuscript addresses a number of important and longstanding questions in the field of membrane traffic. We enjoyed reading the manuscript and felt that it is the type of exciting and pioneering study that <italic>eLife</italic> should publish. It certainly leaves many questions unanswered, but it also provides a real advance for an important area in cell and membrane biology.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The data and the model indicate that the GCC185 N-terminus is most important for capturing incoming Rab9 vesicles. However, the established Rab9 and AP-1 binding sites are both near the two hinges. This central region seems like the least likely part of the protein to be able to contact the Golgi. How do the authors reconcile these disparate facts? Is it possible that the size of the vesicle comes into play (how large are Rab9/CI-MPR vesicles)? In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, is the size of the vesicle shown to scale relative to the GCC185 molecule (which the authors have now measured precisely)? Some discussion of these issues is merited and should be included in a revised manuscript.</p><p>2) The authors should seriously consider re-ordering the manuscript, with the AFM data first. One point of view is that the story is essentially backwards: the AFM data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> allows one to make sense of the cell function data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>.

In other words, might they be stalling the tethering cycle with the hinge mutation rather than blocking tethering? The functional data doesn't have the resolution to pick that up. One option might be to change the abstract to say &quot;that flexibility in a specific, central region is required for GCC185's ability to function in a vesicle tethering cycle.&quot;</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> needs some western blot controls for depletion of endogenous GCC185 and to estimate the level of replacement using various GCC185 transgenes once transfection efficiency is accounted for.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12790.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The data and the model indicate that the GCC185 N-terminus is most important for capturing incoming Rab9 vesicles.

We thank the referees for asking us to make sure the model is drawn to scale (it needed slight revision). We have added new text to the Discussion to consider these points and redrawn <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> to scale and added a <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> text legend. We think it is likely that the tether can in fact collapse down onto the Golgi surface.</p><p>“Given the presence of AP-1 and Rab9 binding sites adjacent to the central bubble (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and the additional capacity of the splayed N-terminus to capture transport vesicles, it is also possible that rather than being held near GCC185’s N-terminus, the vesicle could bind primarily near the bubble while still being enwrapped by the N-terminal arms. […] The AP-1 binding site (939–1,031)is essential for GCC185’s role in vesicle tethering but not Golgi ribbon maintenance (Brown, Schindelhaim, and Pfeffer, 2011), and it must be included in any model of vesicle tethering.”</p><p><italic>2) The authors should seriously consider re-ordering the manuscript, with the AFM data first.

We estimate that for the total population of cells, the exogenous rescue proteins are expressed at no more 3-5 times the level of the endogenous protein (Results, seventh paragraph) – but the direct, single cell evaluation is most accurate.</p></body></sub-article></article>
