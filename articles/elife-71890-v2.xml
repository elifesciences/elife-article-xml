information processing. Yet, how arousal signals influence cortical population activity in detail has so far only been characterized for a few selected brain regions. Traditional accounts conceptualize arousal as a homogeneous modulator of neural population activity across the cerebral cortex. Recent insights, however, point to a higher specificity of arousal effects on different components of neural activity and across cortical regions. Here, we provide a comprehensive account of the relationships between fluctuations in arousal and neuronal population activity across the human brain. Exploiting the established link between pupil size and central arousal systems, we performed concurrent magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and pupillographic recordings in a large number of participants, pooled across three laboratories. We found a cascade of effects relative to the peak timing of spontaneous pupil dilations: Decreases in low-frequency (2–8 Hz) activity in temporal and lateral frontal cortex, followed by increased high-frequency (&gt;64 Hz) activity in mid-frontal regions, followed by monotonic and inverted U relationships with intermediate frequency-range activity (8–32 Hz) in occipito-parietal regions. Pupil-linked arousal also coincided with widespread changes in the structure of the aperiodic component of cortical population activity, indicative of changes in the excitation-inhibition balance in underlying microcircuits. Our results provide a novel basis for studying the arousal modulation of cognitive computations in cortical circuits.</p></abstract><kwd-group

These variations occur continuously due to subtle fluctuations in the level of arousal, and even in the absence of changes in overt behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Harris and Thiele, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">McGinley et al., 2015b</xref>). Two key mediators of arousal-dependent variations are the brainstem nucleus locus coeruleus (LC), which supplies noradrenaline (NE), and the basal forebrain (BF), which supplies acetylcholine (ACh) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Harris and Thiele, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hasselmo, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lee and Dan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Steriade, 1996</xref>). It has long been thought that these nuclei are organized homogeneously and innervate cortical target regions diffusely, and indiscriminately across cortical regions.

In addition, neuromodulator receptors exhibit a rich and diverse distribution across the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">van den Brink et al., 2019</xref>). In this report, we comprehensively show how this structural and molecular heterogeneity translates into a multitude of arousal effects on neuronal population activity across the human cortex.</p><p>We used pupil diameter as a proxy for arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beatty, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bradshaw, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hess and Polt, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kahneman et al., 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kahneman and Beatty, 1966</xref>). Pupil diameter has recently attracted interest in neuroscience as a peripheral index of how arousal influences cortical state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">McGinley et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Reimer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Vinck et al., 2015</xref>). Spontaneous changes in pupil diameter mimic the effects seen during the behavioral transition from quiet wakefulness to locomotion in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Crochet and Petersen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Niell and Stryker, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Polack et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Poulet and Petersen, 2008</xref>): suppression of low (&lt;10 Hz) and elevation of higher frequency (&gt;30 Hz) activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">McGinley et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Reimer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Vinck et al., 2015</xref>). Critically, fluctuations in pupil diameter under constant retinal illumination track LC-NE activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Breton-Provencher and Sur, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">de Gee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Joshi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Murphy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Reimer et al., 2016</xref>) as well as BF-ACh activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Reimer et al., 2016</xref>). Fluctuations in pupil diameter are reflected more strongly in cholinergic activity, whereas the rate of change in pupil diameter (i.e., its temporal derivative) is most strongly associated with noradrenergic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Reimer et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Rodent research has mostly been limited to circumscribed sensory cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Joshi and Gold, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">McGinley et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Reimer et al., 2014</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Shimaoka et al., 2018</xref>). Insights from non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in humans, on the other hand, have revealed spatially rich correlations of cortical activity with pupil-linked arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Groot et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Schneider et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Yellin et al., 2015</xref>). However, the low temporal resolution of these measurements complicates direct comparisons with results from electrophysiological recordings in rodents and non-human primates. Therefore, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of which features of cortical population activity are shaped by arousal and how such effects are distributed across cortex.</p><p>To close these gaps, we assessed the covariation of spontaneous fluctuations in pupil-linked arousal and whole-head magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings in resting human participants across brain regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), components of cortical activity (oscillatory and aperiodic), and temporal lags. Our findings provide a comprehensive picture of relationships between intrinsic fluctuations in pupil-linked arousal and neural population activity in different brain regions. First, we demonstrate opposite effects of pupil-linked arousal on low- and high-frequency components of cortical population activity across large parts of the brain, similar to previously observed effects in rodent sensory cortices. These distinct effects occurred in a systematic temporal sequence. Second, we also uncovered hitherto unknown, nonlinear (inverted U-shaped) arousal effects in occipito-parietal cortex. Third, we identified spatially widespread correlations between pupil-linked arousal and the structure of aperiodic activity, suggesting underlying changes in cortical excitation-inhibition balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Waschke et al., 2021</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Rationale of our approach and summary results.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Even at rest and under constant illumination, pupil size (diameter) fluctuates spontaneously.

All recordings were carried out under constant illumination and in sound-attenuated environments, thus removing fluctuations in pupil size due to changes in sensory input. Participants were instructed to keep their eyes open, while fixating and resting otherwise. The length of individual recordings varied between 5 and 10 min (see Materials and methods for further details).</p><p>For each of the three MEG laboratories, we obtained time courses of MEG activity and of pupil diameter fluctuations. A first control analysis of the recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>) established that they were highly comparable between laboratories, despite the differences in locations, setups, and participants.</p><p>In what follows, we refer to the time course of pupil diameter as ‘pupil’. Previous work in rodents suggests that this time course and its temporal derivative indicate distinct (cholinergic and noradrenergic, respectively) neuromodulatory inputs to cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Reimer et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, we also tested for relationships of MEG activity with the first temporal derivative of the pupil diameter time course (hereafter: ‘pupil derivative’). We found that, in our data, the results were largely similar for pupil and pupil derivative. Therefore, the main figures show only results for pupil, whereas the results for pupil derivative are presented in the Supplement.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Robust pupil-brain couplings across the spectrum of cortical population activity</title><p>We evaluated the strength of pupil-brain coupling across a wide range of frequency bands in MEG sensor space by means of mutual information (MI), which is sensitive to monotonic as well as non-monotonic associations between two signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ince et al., 2017</xref>). We calculated the MI between pupil traces and power time courses of band-limited cortical activity across 25 log-spaced center frequencies from 2 to 128 Hz at each MEG sensor (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref> for power spectra of MEG and pupil size time courses for each laboratory).

Consistent for all three datasets, the cross-correlation analysis for pupil derivative revealed peaks closer to zero lag for low and high frequencies (2–4 Hz negative peak at 277 ms, 64–128 Hz positive peak at –90 ms; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, correlations with activity in the 8–16 Hz range peaked somewhat later (700 ms; negative peak; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The shorter lags for the pupil derivative are consistent with previous findings in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Reimer et al., 2016</xref>). It should be noted that, due to the nature of the employed wavelet analysis, the temporal resolution of the spectral estimates varies across frequency bands, which poses a potential challenge when comparing peak latencies across frequencies. In the present case, however, the differences in peak latencies between frequency bands were sufficiently large in order to be interpretable despite this limitation.</p><p>The cortical innervation profiles of subcortical arousal centers and the cortical receptor composition for the neuromodulators released by these centers exhibit substantial heterogeneity across cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Ramos and Arnsten, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">van den Brink et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">van den Brink et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, we reasoned that the nature (frequency dependence and/or temporal lag) of pupil-brain couplings may differ considerably across cortical areas and tested the topographical profile of the cross-correlations. To account for the different channel layouts of the three MEG systems, we averaged cross-correlations, computed for individual MEG channels, within 39 non-overlapping channel groups, consisting of channels that were grouped based on their location along the anterior-to-posterior axis (see Materials and methods). In keeping with the previous analyses, we collapsed the data into three non-overlapping frequency bands of interest: 2–4, 8–16, and 64–128 Hz.</p><p>Consistent with the results obtained from sensor averages, a negative correlation between pupil diameter fluctuations and power in the low frequencies (2–4 Hz) peaked at a lag of around 900 ms, with a spatial profile that was relatively uniform across brain areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, left). For the high frequencies (64–128 Hz), on the other hand, the positive peak was confined to posterior regions, with a lag similar to the low-frequency band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, right). In the 8–16 Hz-range, the picture was more nuanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, center): The close-to zero-lag positive correlation dominated posterior sensors whereas anterior sensors registered a negative correlation with a peak around 1 s. This suggests that the correlation between pupil diameter and power in the 8–16 Hz range may have been driven by independent mechanisms that operate on distinct time scales (see Discussion).</p><p>The spatio-temporal correlation patterns between pupil size (and pupil derivative) and band-limited power separated by MEG recording site are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>In summary, we identified lags between spontaneous fluctuations in pupil diameter and low- and high-frequency activity that are consistent with previously reported lags between noradrenergic and cholinergic activity, respectively, and spontaneous pupil diameter fluctuations in rodents. In addition, we found that pupil-brain coupling in the intermediate 8–16 Hz range peaked with a time lag closer to maximum pupil dilation for posterior sensors. Our findings suggest that the correlations in different frequency bands, and for different cortices within the intermediate frequency range, may be mediated by different neuromodulatory systems (see Discussion).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Spatial and spectral dissociations of pupil-power correlations</title><p>Having established the distinct temporal coupling profiles for different frequency bands, we now tested which cortical areas received the strongest modulation. Sensor space analyses suggested that effects of pupil-brain coupling were not uniformly distributed along the anterior-posterior axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). To map out cortical loci of frequency-specific pupil-brain coupling in detail, we used spectrally resolved source-reconstructed MEG data.

Capitalizing on our source reconstructions, we tested if the correlations between pupil diameter and cortical activity varied across cortical regions of interest (see inset maps in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), including three sensory areas (visual cortex, auditory cortex, and somatosensory cortex) as well as anterior cingulate cortex, a region that receives strong innervations from the LC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chandler et al., 2013</xref>), while also projecting to the LC itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Joshi et al., 2016</xref>).

Correlations in the auditory cortex, on the other hand, were dominated by negative correlations in the low-frequency range (&lt;8 Hz; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, second to top).

Correlations with activity in anterior cingulate were significant across most frequencies, with a spectral pattern similar to auditory cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, bottom).</p><p>For further insights into the spatial distribution of the observed correlations, we mapped correlations of pupil and pupil-derivative time courses with band-limited power fluctuations across all 8799 source locations, again estimated at a lag of 930 ms for pupil and a lag of 0 ms for pupil derivative. To this end, we focused on four frequency bands of interest, with the following center frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>): 4, 11.3, 19, and 64 Hz, corresponding to the classical theta, alpha, beta, and gamma frequency ranges. In the low frequencies (centered at 4 Hz), correlations were negative in the majority of source locations, with bilateral peaks in the anterior sections of the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, top left). Significant positive correlations between pupil and activity in the alpha/beta range (11.3 and 19 Hz) were located in the visual cortices of both hemispheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, top right and bottom left). Significant negative correlations were found in left and right motor and somatosensory cortices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, top right), although limited to activity in the alpha range (centered at 11.3 Hz). Similarly, correlations with high-frequency activity (centered at 64 Hz) were non-uniform across space, with negative correlations located in visual cortices bilaterally, and positive correlations across large parts of the prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, bottom right).</p><p>Repeating the analyses for the pupil derivative, we found largely similar spatial patterns for the correlations, albeit with reduced magnitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> for statistical comparison of pupil-power and pupil-derivative-power correlations). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">McGinley et al., 2015a</xref>, reported a similar reduction when comparing pupil derivative with pupil-based correlations in rodents.</p><p>Briefly summarized, source localization of pupil-brain coupling revealed frequency band-specific patterns of arousal influences on cortical processing.

We, therefore, reasoned that local pupil-power couplings may exhibit similar inverted U relationships. To test this, we divided the data into non-overlapping temporal segments of 2 s length and computed power spectra as well as mean pupil size (or mean pupil derivative) for each segment.

However, cortical electrophysiological processes can also be characterized by a broadband, or aperiodic component. This component can be understood as the decay of power with increasing frequency and is therefore also known as the 1/f component. The slope of the 1/f component reflects fluctuations in attentional state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Waschke et al., 2021</xref>) and has been suggested to track the ratio between excitation and inhibition (in short: E/I) in the underlying neuronal circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gao et al., 2017</xref>). As neuromodulators linked with the regulation of arousal have been shown to change cortical E/I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Martins and Froemke, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Pfeffer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Pfeffer et al., 2021</xref>), we next investigated the relation between intrinsic fluctuations in pupil diameter (as well as its temporal derivative) and the aperiodic component in the power spectrum. Our goal was to characterize correlations between intrinsic fluctuations in pupil-linked arousal and the slope of the aperiodic component, as a potential marker of cortical E/I.</p><p>To this end, we parameterized the power spectra of consecutive, overlapping data bins of 2 s length of the source-projected MEG data in a frequency range from 3 to 40 Hz, separately for all source locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Donoghue et al., 2020</xref>). Simulations of a biologically plausible neural network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Trakoshis et al., 2020</xref>) as well as empirical insights from optogenetic stimulations in neonatal mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chini et al., 2021</xref>) show that spectral slopes extracted from the chosen frequency range are in fact sensitive to changes in the underlying ratio between excitation and inhibition. The resulting parameter estimates described the periodic and the aperiodic components per epoch (data segmentation as in the previous section; see Materials and methods). Again, for this analysis we shifted the pupil time series forward by 930 ms relative to the MEG signal (no shift was applied in the corresponding pupil derivative analysis). The analysis yielded the parameterized power spectrum (for each source region) and average pupil diameter values (or pupil derivative) for each of the temporal bins.</p><p>First, we sorted all bins based on mean pupil diameter (small to large) and plotted the spectral exponent, a measure that expresses the steepness of the slope of the aperiodic component of the power spectrum, against it. The spectral exponent decreased strongly linearly as a function of pupil diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), indicative of a shallower decay of power as a function of frequency (see Materials and methods for details). We next correlated the fluctuations in the estimated spectral exponent with fluctuations in pupil diameter across all bins (i.e., without prior sorting and averaging within bins). This resulted in a significant negative correlation when averaged across all source locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, gray dots), with little variability when zooming in on four regions of interest (visual cortex: mean <italic>r</italic> = –0.0278; p = 0.0014; auditory cortex: mean <italic>r</italic> = –0.0518, p = 4.5*10<sup>–10</sup>; somatosensory cortex: mean <italic>r</italic> = –0.0421, p = 1.09*10<sup>–5</sup>; anterior cingulate cortex: <italic>r</italic> = –0.0336, p = 1.09*10<sup>–5</sup>; two-tailed paired t-tests against zero). In fact, the negative correlation between the spectral exponent and mean pupil diameter for the corresponding segment was significant in the vast majority of brain regions (8137/8799 of source locations, or 92.5%, after adjusting for a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

In a large sample (<italic>N</italic> = 81), our mapping revealed diverse and consistent arousal effects on band-limited, as well as aperiodic cortical activity.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Arousal modulates cortical activity across space, time, and frequencies</title><p>Our findings are consistent with previously reported links between both locomotion-related and pupil-related changes in arousal and LFP recordings in sensory cortices of rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">McGinley et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Reimer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Reimer et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly put, periods of elevated arousal were accompanied by a decrease in low- and an increase in high-frequency activity, similar to cortical state changes typically observed during increased attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Harris and Thiele, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Schwalm and Rosales Jubal, 2017</xref>).

Future research using brain-wide maps of the distribution of neuromodulatory receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">van den Brink et al., 2019</xref>) may help to further disentangle the differential contributions of NE and ACh as well as their various receptor subtypes. Additionally, this may elucidate the roles of serotonergic and dopaminergic neuromodulation, which also influence pupil size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cazettes et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">de Gee et al., 2017</xref>). Further, we note that our analyses and interpretations focus on arousal-related neuromodulatory influences on cortical activity, whereas recent work also supports a reverse ‘top-down’ route, at least for frontal cortex high-frequency activity on LC spiking activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Totah et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The low-frequency regime referred to in rodent work (2–10 Hz; e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">McGinley et al., 2015b</xref>) includes activity that shares characteristics with human alpha rhythms (3–6 Hz; e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Nestvogel and McCormick, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Senzai et al., 2019</xref>). The human equivalent however clearly separates from activity in lower frequency bands and, here, showed idiosyncratic relationships with pupil-linked arousal. Specifically, a negative correlation, localized to somatomotor cortices and specific to alpha-band (8–12 Hz) activity, peaked earlier than a positive correlation that localized to occipital visual cortices and encompassed alpha and beta bands (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4D</xref>). Of all effects found, the effect in visual cortices had the shortest lag with respect to pupil dilation (~200 ms).</p><p>This short-lag positive correlation may stem from interactions between the LC and regions of the thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">McCormick, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">McCormick et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Stitt et al., 2018</xref>), in particular those implicated in the generation of occipital alpha-band activity via thalamo-cortical feedback loops (e.g., the pulvinar; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Saalmann et al., 2012</xref>). These loops may therefore be sensitive to noradrenergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dahl et al., 2022</xref>) or even BF regulated cholinergic modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Nestvogel and McCormick, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Zagha and McCormick, 2014</xref>). Both scenarios posit indirect multi-synaptic routes to the neuromodulation of alpha activity that may delay the lag relative to other effects and put it closer to the time of maximum pupil dilation. Another, not mutually exclusive, possibility is that the arousal-dependent low-lag alpha-/beta-band activity is linked to the activity of a distinct subpopulation of GABAergic neurons in the LC, which have been shown to exhibit a temporally closer relationship with pupil diameter compared to the noradrenergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Breton-Provencher and Sur, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Seemingly contradicting the present findings, previous work on task-related EEG and MEG dynamics reported a negative relationship between pupil-linked arousal and alpha-range activity in occipito-parietal sensors during visual processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Meindertsma et al., 2017</xref>) and fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dahl et al., 2020</xref>). Note however that results from task-related experiments, that focus on evoked changes in pupil diameter rather than fluctuations in tonic pupil size, cannot be directly compared with our findings. Similar to noradrenergic neurons in LC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005</xref>), phasic pupil responses exhibit an inverse relationship with tonic pupil size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Knapen et al., 2016</xref>). This means that on trials with larger baseline pupil diameter (e.g., during a pre-stimulus period), the evoked (phasic) pupil response will be smaller and vice versa. Therefore, a negative correlation between alpha-band activity in the visual cortex and task-related phasic pupil responses does not preclude a positive correlation with tonic pupil size during baseline or rest, as reported here. In line with this, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Whitmarsh et al., 2021</xref>, found a negative relationship between alpha-activity and pupil size in the somatosensory cortex that agrees with our finding. Although using an event-related design to study attention to tactile stimuli, this relationship occurred in the baseline, that is, before observing any task-related phasic effects on pupil-linked arousal or cortical activity.</p><p>Note that reported changes in alpha activity in the visual cortex cannot be trivially explained by pupil dilation altering retinal illumination. In that case, one would expect a negative relationship, that is, decreasing alpha power with increasing pupil size (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Donner and Siegel, 2011</xref>). Moreover, changes in alpha activity preceded changes in pupil dilation, albeit with a shorter lag compared to activity in other frequency ranges (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Correlations between cortical activity and the pupil derivative largely mirrored these results, although most links were found to be weaker in magnitude. This is likely due to the fact that both signals (pupil diameter as well as its temporal derivative) correlate to some extent with noradrenergic and cholinergic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Reimer et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>An arousal-triggered cascade of activity in the resting human brain</title><p>The temporal profile of the diverse relationships between pupil-linked arousal and local cortical activity described above may point toward a cascade of interrelated effects that the resting brain undergoes routinely. Several scenarios could produce such a cascade: First, episodes of arousal could arise seemingly at random, from underlying complex nonlinear neural dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Kringelbach and Deco, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Robinson et al., 2003</xref>). Second, they could be coupled to other physiological processes, such as respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kluger and Gross, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Zelano et al., 2016</xref>). Respiration has an average base rate of ~0.2 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Del Negro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fleming et al., 2011</xref>), similar to pupil fluctuations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bouma and Baghuis, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Pomè et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Turnbull et al., 2017</xref>). As a third scenario, the observed cascade may imply a specific cognitive sequence: Most participants will likely have ‘mind-wandered’ or engaged in ‘task-unrelated thoughts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Groot et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Karapanagiotidis et al., 2020</xref>) while resting. The sequence of effects we observe may therefore be a transient re-orientation toward the external sensory environment – a ‘monitoring sweep’. This is consistent with the increase in pupil-linked arousal, and its inverse relationship with an early dip in low-frequency activity, that is, the cessation of a globally synchronized cortical state, and agrees with a concurrent widespread increase in high-frequency cortical activity that signifies increased cortical excitability to process external sensory input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hanslmayr et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Harris and Thiele, 2011</xref>).</p><p>One aspect of mind-wandering is the retrieval of information from memory that heavily relies on theta rhythms in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Siegle and Wilson, 2014</xref>). Here, we localized the strongest pupil (and pupil-derivative) correlations with theta-range power fluctuations in bilateral hippocampal regions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), suggesting an arousal modulation of memory processes. In support, hippocampal LC-NE modulation has long been established in the rodent brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sara, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Segal and Bloom, 1976a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Segal and Bloom, 1976b</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">McGinley et al., 2015a</xref>, reported negative correlations between pupil-linked arousal and the occurrence of theta-range hippocampal ripple events. Moreover, a recent human neuroimaging study found that pupil-linked arousal modulated blood oxygenation in (para-) hippocampal regions during memory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Clewett et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Further on, the observed sequence of effects concludes with a peak in alpha/beta activity that is triggered roughly at the time of maximum correlations of arousal with low- and high-frequency activity. The increase in synchronized alpha/beta activity marks the return to a strong regime where external sensory (visual) input is attenuated, potentially indicating a shift to an introspective focus. A strong alpha rhythm thereby imposes widespread bouts of ‘pulsed inhibition’ on visual cortex that suppress local gamma band activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Jensen and Mazaheri, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Haegens et al., 2011</xref>; for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Van Diepen et al., 2019</xref>). This relationship between alpha and gamma activity has been well described in non-human primate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Spaak et al., 2012</xref>) and human visual cortices, with a role for cholinergic neuromodulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bauer et al., 2012</xref>). Corroborating this scenario, we also observe a decrease in local gamma-band activity in visual cortices.</p><p>The three scenarios described here are not mutually exclusive and may explain one and the same phenomenon from different perspectives. Further, it remains possible that the sequence we observe comprises independent effects with specific timings. A pivotal manipulation to test these assumptions will be to contrast the observed sequence with other potential coupling patterns between pupil-linked arousal and cortical activity during different behavioral states. In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kucyi and Parvizi, 2020</xref>, found spontaneous peaks of high-frequency band activity (&gt;70 Hz) in the insular cortex of three resting surgically implanted patients that preceded pupil dilation by ~500 ms – a time range that is consistent with the lag of our cross-correlation between pupil size and high-frequency (&gt;64 Hz) activity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Importantly, they showed that this sequence mimicked a similar but more pronounced pattern during task performance. Given the purported role of the insula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Menon and Uddin, 2010</xref>), this finding lends support to the idea that spontaneous covariations of pupil size and cortical activity signal arousal events related to intermittent ‘monitoring sweeps’ for behaviorally relevant information.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Inverted U relationship between periodic cortical activity and pupil-linked arousal</title><p>Nonlinear relations between arousal and other factors are well characterized, most prominently in the form of the Yerkes-Dodson law, which posits an inverted U-shaped relation between arousal and cognitive performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Yerkes and Dodson, 1908</xref>). More recently, an inverted U relation has also been identified for pupil-linked arousal fluctuations and detection performance and low-frequency (2–10 Hz) membrane potential fluctuations in primary auditory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">McGinley et al., 2015a</xref>). Here, we found a pronounced and comparable inverted U-shaped relationship between power in the alpha and beta bands, and pupil and pupil derivative alike: The inverted U alpha-band nonlinearity was most strongly expressed in inferior parietal cortex, extending toward higher visual as well as temporal regions in the beta band. In contrast to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">McGinley et al., 2015a</xref>, we found no evidence for an U-shaped relationship between pupil and high-frequency (50–100 Hz) activity.</p><p>The inverted U-shaped relationship between arousal and behavior may result from the differential activation of neuromodulatory receptors in particular noradrenergic adrenoreceptors with varying affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berridge and Spencer, 2016</xref>) or nicotinic and muscarinic ACh receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bentley et al., 2011</xref>). Similar mechanisms may therefore underlie the quadratic relationship observed here. More specifically, in the case of NE, the activation of high-affinity α<sub>2</sub> receptors at medium arousal level may (directly or indirectly) lead to increased alpha- and beta-band activity. At elevated arousal levels, on the other hand, correspondingly high levels of NE lead to the activation of low-affinity α<sub>1</sub> receptors, possibly resulting in a decrease of alpha- and beta-band activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buzsáki et al., 1991</xref>).</p><p>From a functional perspective, an inverted U relationship seems paradoxical. One would expect alpha activity to approach a minimum at intermediate states of pupil-linked arousal, that is, show a U-shaped relationship instead, to optimally facilitate the processing of external sensory input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Jensen and Mazaheri, 2010</xref>). However, our participants were resting, while neither receiving nor expecting visual input. In this situation an inward focus of attention suppressing external visual information may have reversed the expected relationship (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hong et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Of note, we find evidence for both, monotonic positive and inverted U shape relationships between alpha/beta activity and pupil-linked arousal in spatially coinciding cortical sources (cp. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C</xref>). Earlier research has suggested that parieto-occipital cortices harbor at least two distinct alpha rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barzegaran et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Keitel and Gross, 2016</xref>) with separable characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benwell et al., 2019</xref>) that may serve different functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Capilla et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Sokoliuk et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, spatially overlapping monotonic and inverted U effects may reflect distinct influences of arousal on the generative processes underlying these separate alpha rhythms.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Arousal modulation of cortical excitation-inhibition ratio</title><p>In addition to interactions between pupil-linked arousal and band-limited activity, we show that pupil diameter correlates systematically with aperiodic brain activity. Recent theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that the slope of the aperiodic component of neural power spectra, the spectral exponent, reflects the ratio between excitatory and inhibitory neuronal processes in the underlying neuronal circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Colombo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gao et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report a negative monotonic relation between pupil diameter and the spectral exponent. In other words, periods of elevated arousal were accompanied by a flattening of the power spectrum. In simulated neural networks, a shallower slope of the aperiodic component is related to increased excitation relative to inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Trakoshis et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, increased arousal (i.e., dilated pupils) may co-occur with increased E/I in distributed neuronal circuits, whereas periods of low arousal (i.e., constricted pupils) would indicate states of relatively decreased E/I. This interpretation is also consistent with previous findings arguing that NE increases cortical E/I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Pfeffer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Pfeffer et al., 2021</xref>), possibly through a decrease in inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Froemke, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Martins and Froemke, 2015</xref>). We found this relationship of E/I and pupil-linked arousal in most cortical regions, thus suggesting a global and uniform effect that only excluded some occipital visual cortices (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p>The absence of this effect in visual cortices may explain why <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Kosciessa et al., 2021</xref>, found no relationship between pupil-linked arousal and spectral slope when investigating phasic pupil dilation in response to a visual stimulus during task performance. However, this behavioral context, associated with different arousal levels, likely also changes E/I in the visual cortex when compared with the resting state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Pfeffer et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In sum, pupil-linked arousal may provide a window into yet another cortical circuit property, cortical E/I, relevant for cognitive computation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cavanagh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Kosciessa et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lam et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Murphy and Miller, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Pettine et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Pfeffer et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We exhaustively mapped how fluctuations in pupil-linked arousal and cortical activity covary in the human brain at rest. The diverse relationships we describe in our data suggest profound influences of arousal on cortical states and challenge a global and unspecific role for arousal neuromodulation in cortical function. Instead, our results support the view of specific neuromodulatory influences that differ depending on the targeted cortical region, can express in varying frequencies of band-limited activity or as broadband effects, and vary in their timing. Further, they largely agree with similar findings of a recent independent report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Podvalny et al., 2021</xref>). The present data provide the basis for studying how these influences change under cognitive task demands and when engaging in different behaviors. In fact, neuromodulatory effects are often neglected when studying the cortical population activity underlying cognitive function – given a central role for arousal, our results argue for including it as a covariate in future studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants and data acquisition (Hamburg)</title><p>Thirty healthy human participants (16 women, mean age 26.7, range 20–36) participated in the study after informed consent.

In a final step, these z-values were pooled across sensors and their mean across participants tested against zero, for each recording site separately. Test results are reported for uncorrected and FDR-corrected thresholds in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.

Cross-correlations were computed for each sensor and frequency, separately, after downsampling pupil time series to the respective frequency-specific temporal resolution. In order to allow for the comparison across MEG recording sites (with different sensor layouts), we first ordered the recording channels into 39 equally sized, non-overlapping spatial bins, sorted from anterior to posterior channels. We next averaged the cross-correlograms per bin and additionally averaged the cross-correlations across three distinct frequency ranges: 2–4, 8–16, and 64–128 Hz. Due to the varying width of the wavelets for each center frequency, the temporal resolution, and, therefore, the number of samples, varied across frequencies. Hence, prior to averaging, we linearly interpolated the frequency-specific cross-correlograms such that the number of samples was equal to the number of samples of the highest frequency of each band (i.e., 4, 16, and 128 Hz).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Source-level mapping of pupil-power correlations</title><p>To map pupil-power associations across each of the 246 cortical regions of the Brainnetome atlas, we correlated the forward-shifted (0.93 s) pupil time series with frequency-specific power envelopes by means of Spearman’s rank correlation for each of the 8799 voxels of the source model, separately, after downsampling pupil time series to the respective frequency-specific temporal resolution.</p><p>All steps were repeated for correlations between pupil derivative and power fluctuations, however without accounting for the lag as previous research showed near-instantaneous correlations between neuromodulatory activity and fluctuations in pupil derivative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Reimer et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Source-level power spectra and spectral parametrization</title><p>To correlate fluctuations in pupil diameter (and its temporal derivative) with fluctuations in the slope of the aperiodic component of the power spectra (henceforth referred to as the ‘spectral exponent’), we first computed source-level power spectra. To this end, we source-projected the broad-band signal using linear beamforming (LCMV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Van Veen et al., 1997</xref>) instead of DICS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gross et al., 2001</xref>). The procedure was similar to DICS, with the difference that the spatial filters were obtained using the cross-spectral density matrix averaged across all 25 frequency bands of interest. In keeping with the previous analysis, we used a regularization parameter of 5%.</p><p>Next, we divided the resulting source-level broad-band signal into non-overlapping temporal segments of 2 s length. For each segment, power spectra were computed using MATLAB’s ‘pwelch’ function, ranging from 2 to 128 Hz, with a frequency resolution of 0.5 Hz. In addition, for each temporal segment, the mean pupil diameter as well as the mean of the pupil derivative were computed after shifting the pupil diameter, but not the pupil-derivative signal forward by 930 ms relative to the MEG time. Note that we opted for a different spectral decomposition method here than the wavelet-based approach (as described above) for practical reasons: Welch’s periodogram method yields a direct estimate of the spectrum, which is convenient for parametrization as this analysis focused on the 1/f feature of the power spectrum rather than on power at any individual frequency.</p><p>To separate aperiodic and periodic components of the power spectra, we used the spectral parameterization toolbox ‘FOOOF’ for Python 3.7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Donoghue et al., 2020</xref>). The algorithm iteratively fits neuronal power spectra as the sum of a Lorentzian function and a variable number of Gaussians of varying width, height, and mean (corresponding to the center frequency). To constrain the fitting procedure, we limited the number of periodic components to six and defined a minimum peak height of 0.05, with the minimum and maximum bandwidth of each peak set to 1 and 8 Hz. The knee of the Lorentzian was set to zero.</p><p>The algorithm was applied to the power spectra of each individual temporal segment (see above), which provided time-resolved estimates of periodic and aperiodic components. While the slope of the aperiodic component is relatively stable for lower frequencies up until ~40–50 Hz, the rate at which power changes can differ substantially for higher frequencies. This means that fitting power spectra uniformly across the entire frequency range may result in poorer fits and, consequently, misleading parameter estimates. Thus, and largely consistent with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Pfeffer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Waschke et al., 2021</xref>), neuronal power spectra were fitted in the frequency range from 3 to 40 Hz.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Polynomial model</title><p>We quantified quadratic components of the relation between pupil diameter (and pupil derivative) and band-limited activity fluctuations in spectral power.

Next, we computed the average power for each of the bins and normalized (z-scored) the obtained values.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Martin Dahl (Reviewer #1); Tzvetan Popov (Reviewer #2); Andrew J Quinn (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In general, the referees are very positive, but further clarifications are needed for some of the analysis aspects as well as the embedding in the existing literature. The referees have made a set of constructive suggestions. Some of the overarching points being:</p><p>1) Methodological issues- e.g.</p><p>– The applied time-lag between pupil size and the MEG signal.</p><p>– Morlet vs sliding time-window</p><p>2) Relationship between eye movements and pupil dilation.</p><p>3) Discussion on E:I balance.</p><p>4) Relation to the existing literature on fMRI and animals research.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Please define the term arousal before usage. This definition is crucial, as previous research defined arousal based on behavioral outcomes (e.g., &quot;[…], for the purposes of this review, the term arousal refers to a continuum of sensitivity to environmental stimuli.&quot; [15]) and tied it closely to alterations in cortical EEG synchronization (&quot;Alterations in arousal state are accompanied by alterations in forebrain neuronal activity, reflected in electroencephalographic (EEG) signals&quot; [15], referring to work by Moruzzi and Magoun, 1949 [16]).</p><p>Behavioral responses are not collected in this study. Defining arousal based on M/EEG responses does not seem to work here either (as the authors attempt to demonstrate this association). Is arousal equated with pupil-indexed neuromodulation here (l. 45)?</p><p>Related: The authors introduce pupil diameters as proxy for arousal and index of cortical state. Are these two terms (arousal state, cortical state) referring to the same or different things?</p><p>2. The authors should mention at some point that also serotonergic[17] and even dopaminergic[18] neuromodulation has been related to pupil dilation.</p><p>3. I find the methods section somewhat difficult to read, likely due to the three-site design. For different sites, varying aspects of data collection and processing are reported. For instance, only for the Glasgow sample it is mentioned how the head shape was acquired – was this not done for the Hamburg and Münster samples? I suggest including a table directly contrasting the collection and preprocessing steps for the different sites. Figure S1 does indicate some site effects and the suggested table may help readers to guess what may be the underlying cause.</p><p>4. How did the authors determine the cut-off frequencies for their pupil band-pass filter? Previous research demonstrated (task-related) pupil fluctuations at 2 Hz [19], thus the upper limit does seem somewhat low.</p><p>5. The methods indicate that no time periods were removed due to invalid pupil data (e.g., l. 785 following). Please provide more information concerning the pupil segments that were interpolated? (mean, SD; range; % of raw data)</p><p>6. At some points, the methods could benefit from more details. To give only a few examples: The estimation of the Spearman's correlation in source space is only reported in the results but not the methods. Moreover (~l. 840) the Methods do not specify that statistics are run within participants and ß parameters are tested against zero on a group level. Finally, (~l. 800): The authors could state how they computed the cross-correlation (e.g., what is the max lag?) before reporting how they averaged the cross-correlations across sensors and frequencies.</p><p>7. ~l. 170 &quot;at a lag closer to zero (210 ms; negative peak)&quot; – shouldn't this be a positive peak for the α-β band?</p><p>8. &quot;l.265 As anterior cingulate cortex, a region receiving strong innervations from locus coeruleus (Chandler et al., 2013).&quot; It could be added here that AAC also projects to the LC, thus, there are bi-directional connections [2,20]</p><p>9. l. 315&quot;Above described analyses focused on quantifying linear relationships between intrinsic fluctuations in pupil diameter, as well as pupil-derivative, and band-limited cortical population activity.&quot; Should be monotonic, not linear?</p><p>10. L. 395 Here statistics are reported in full in the main text, but for parts of the paper they are not (e.g., Figure 5 A). I think the authors should be consistent and also report the other statistics.</p><p>11. l. 480 &quot;More indirect multi-synaptic route to neuromodulation of occipital α activity may delay the lag relative to other effects and put it closer to the time of maximum pupil dilation.&quot; While this argument seems intuitive, I was wondering whether the authors can provide any empirical support for a differential delay of direct cortical and thalamus-mediated α-β changes due to neuromodulation.</p><p>12. l. 560 &quot;More specifically, in the case of noradrenaline, the activation of high-affinity α2 receptors at medium arousal level may (directly or indirectly) lead to increased α- and β-band activity&quot; This reference seems suitable here [9]</p><p>13.

Eye movements.</p><p>There is a clear relationship between eye movements and pupil dilation (e.g. https://peerj.com/articles/1150/). This is not only the case for large saccades but likely for fixational eye movements (FEM) too. Both are likely present during the recording. I wondered, could the authors extract time series of gaze position and use these as a control analysis instead of the pupil time series? Does pupil dilation vary with gaze direction eccentricity? Does gaze direction relate to brain oscillations too or not at all. I guess a simple check is to plot the x-y- ET data together with pupil diameter locked to saccade (both micro and macro) onset. Next, one could re-do the main analysis (e.g. Figure 2 and 5) on data segments pre movement vs. post movement followed by equivalence test or something.</p><p>In particular, the anterior δ-theta effects and the visual α could be interpreted within the context of eye movements too. In fact, this could be the one of the &quot;independent mechanisms&quot; the authors speculate about on p. 6 line 216. The authors note that the effect in the visual cortices had the shortest lag with respect to pupil dilation. Yet, visual areas are early in the hierarchy of areas controlling and noticing eye movement. For example if one considers the observations that, cooling of V1 silences cell firing in the superior colliculus (i.e. extended work by Peter Shiller) and in turn eye movement, or some recent work on motor fields in V1 (https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6521/1191).</p><p>2. MEG gradiometer vs. magnetometer</p><p>Is there a difference in the correlation maps between the magnetometer and gradiometer data? A supplemental figure would help here.

Pupil data. I was confused what the pupil data actually is. From p. 5 line 164 I understood that cross-correlations were computed between sensor level power and pupil (power? or size?). Later on in Methods the exponent of pupil power spectra is mentioned. All Figures suggest pupil size as indicated by the eye cartoon. Please specify what data (size, power, exponent) is used in which of the different analyses. E.g. Figure 6A is this a correlation between spectral exponent(brain) vs. spectral exponent (pupil)? Do the main results replicate if one uses the absolute pupil size?</p><p>RE: The E/I idea. Figure 6 implies then that the whole cortex is a state of excitation which by itself appears in contrast with functional specificity of the E/I idea. In fact, a bit against the authors interpretation on line 441 &quot;modulations of specific cortical oscillations by arousal&quot;. All examined band widths and 1/f exponent relate to arousal. The &quot;specificity&quot; argument needs clarification.</p><p>Furthermore, I wonder to what extend the same is true if the authors redo the analysis on the planar gradient data? Can the beamformer weakness in modeling deep sources manifest in noise consistency which in turn is captured by the exponent correlation bit?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The following points relate to points in the public review</p><p>#1 spectral analyses. The two analysis types are:</p><p>Line 745 – &quot;MEG spectral analysis (all sites)&quot;, describes a Morlet wavelet analyses which appears to be used for the results in figures 1-4.</p><p>Line 325 and 817 – &quot;Nonlinear relations between pupil-linked arousal and band-limited cortical activity&quot;, describes a two second sliding window pwelch analysis.</p><p>The sliding window Welch's method analysis will have the same temporal resolution for each frequency band, and the pupil dynamics are matched to the sliding windows used for the MEG. I would strongly suggest running both analyses with Welch's periodogram across sliding windows. This would ensure that dynamics in all frequency have the same resolution and that all analyses in the paper are matched. If there is an additional concern that successive window are independent for the polynomial modelling then the window overlap could be adjusted between the two sections (though independent windows is potentially desirable for the first analysis as well?)</p><p>#2 An additional control analysis exploring whether the spatial correlation maps in are associated with source power in the presented frequencies. For example, figure 5D shows the spatial map of the quadratic coefficient at 11 and 19Hz – how closly related is this topography to the simpler spatial distribution of 11Hz and 19Hz power?</p><p>#3 From the discussion in Gao et al.,: “Hence, we propose that slope changes in a particular frequency region (30-70 Hz) correspond to changes in E:I balance, while making no claims about other frequency regions”. Not sure what to recommend about the frequency range difference here – at the least it should be acknowledged and discussed. Ideally this analysis should be matched to Gao et al., given how critical this reference is to the discussion and interpretation.</p><p>Additional points</p><p>#4 It isn't clear where the three frequency bands of interest (line 188: 2-4Hz, 8-16Hz, and 64-128Hz) come from. I think this is based on Figure 1 but only the Glasgow site appears to show distinct clusters in these bands. Hamburg and Munster are significant across the whole 2-32Hz range and Hamburg is additionally significant from 32-128Hz. On this basis, the exclusion of the 4-8Hz and 16-64Hz range seems a bit odd. Some additional clarification and justification would be helpful – apologies if I have missed this in another section.</p><p>#5 related to 4, subjectively the MI spectra across the three sites don't seem to be all that similar, a stronger justification for combining subjects in subsequent analyses would be reassuring. Given that this is the jumping off point for the rest of the paper it would be good to revisit this figure to emphasise the points of similarity – the supporting spectra in supplemental materials and topos show between site similarity more convincingly.</p><p>To formalise this, can you repeat the between subject correlation matrix from figure S1B for the MI spectra and see if there is substantial banding per-site? if site-specific bands are visible here, then a mixed-modelling approach or the inclusion of a site-covariate in subsequent analyses would be desirable.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71890.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In general, the referees are very positive, but further clarifications are needed for some of the analysis aspects as well as the embedding in the existing literature.

Please define the term arousal before usage. This definition is crucial, as previous research defined arousal based on behavioral outcomes (e.g., &quot;[…], for the purposes of this review, the term arousal refers to a continuum of sensitivity to environmental stimuli.&quot; [15]) and tied it closely to alterations in cortical EEG synchronization (&quot;Alterations in arousal state are accompanied by alterations in forebrain neuronal activity, reflected in electroencephalographic (EEG) signals&quot; [15], referring to work by Moruzzi and Magoun, 1949 [16]).</p><p>Behavioral responses are not collected in this study. Defining arousal based on M/EEG responses does not seem to work here either (as the authors attempt to demonstrate this association). Is arousal equated with pupil-indexed neuromodulation here (l. 45)?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes. We are using the term “<italic>pupil-linked arousal</italic>” frequently to make this point. Please note that we emphasise the link between arousal and neuromodulation early:</p><p>“Fluctuations in arousal, controlled by subcortical neuromodulatory systems, continuously shape cortical state, with profound consequences for information processing.” (first sentence of the abstract).</p><p>From our perspective, this provides a strong neuromodulatory angle on arousal from the outset. Following your comment we have reviewed language throughout for consistency.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related: The authors introduce pupil diameters as proxy for arousal and index of cortical state. Are these two terms (arousal state, cortical state) referring to the same or different things?</p></disp-quote><p>We refer to different things: We use pupil dilations as a proxy for arousal and want to know how this co-varies with “cortical state” as indexed by MEG-recorded activity (periodic and aperiodic). This is captured in panel B of our Figure 1. We have modified the two mentions of “arousal state” to just “arousal” and added wording to the following sentence in the introduction to disambiguate:</p><p>“Pupil diameter has recently attracted interest in neuroscience as a peripheral index of how arousal influences cortical state (McGinley, David, et al., 2015; Reimer et al., 2014; Vinck et al., 2015).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors should mention at some point that also serotonergic[17] and even dopaminergic[18] neuromodulation has been related to pupil dilation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is important. However, it is difficult to assess to what extent pupil dilations are a direct consequence of serotonergic or dopaminergic activity or merely a consequence of strong interconnectivity between neuromodulatory nuclei, especially by projections from locus coeruleus. For instance, in their Discussion, Cazettes et al., (reference [17]) report latencies between dorsal raphe (DR) stimulation and pupil dilation that are ~100 ms longer than pupil dilations elicited through stimulation of noradrenergic neurons (see their Discussion), which supports the idea of DR effects on pupil being mediated by locus coeruleus. Moreover, Breton-Provencher and Sur (2019) assessed the direct causal contribution of the locus coeruleus to the arousal-related (sound-induced) pupil response, showing that the silencing of noradrenergic neurons in LC abolished (or strongly attenuated) the pupil response to arousing auditory stimuli (see their Supplementary Figure 8).</p><p>Nonetheless, we agree with this point. Therefore, we have added the following information to the first paragraph of the section ‘Arousal modulates cortical activity across space, time and frequencies’ in the Discussion as follows:</p><p>“Additionally, this may elucidate the roles of serotonergic and dopaminergic</p><p>Neuromodulation, which also influence pupil size (Cazettes et al., 2021; de Gee et al., 2017).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. I find the methods section somewhat difficult to read, likely due to the three-site design. For different sites, varying aspects of data collection and processing are reported. For instance, only for the Glasgow sample it is mentioned how the head shape was acquired – was this not done for the Hamburg and Münster samples? I suggest including a table directly contrasting the collection and preprocessing steps for the different sites. Figure S1 does indicate some site effects and the suggested table may help readers to guess what may be the underlying cause.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the Methods section to align the data acquisition reporting between the three labs more strongly, while allowing for an evaluation of potential influences that would explain (non-consequential) differences. In the process, we have added details on headshape acquisition in the lab-specific ‘Participants and Data Acquisition’ sections. We have refrained from adding the suggested table as we felt that it would be difficult to contrast all differences between sites exhaustively, and in a concise and comprehensible fashion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. How did the authors determine the cut-off frequencies for their pupil band-pass filter? Previous research demonstrated (task-related) pupil fluctuations at 2 Hz [19], thus the upper limit does seem somewhat low.</p></disp-quote><p>We set the low-pass cut-off at 2 Hz as this was the lowest frequency that we analysed with respect to power fluctuations in cortical oscillations. Also, it does capture the time scales of arousal-linked pupillary phenomena such as the Hippus (~0.2 Hz) and the canonical response to arousing events (&lt; 1 Hz given an average t<sub>max</sub> of 930msec). Further, data of McGinley et al., (2015) and Reimer et al., (2016) suggests that neuromodulation has the most profound influences on pupil dynamics below &lt; 1 Hz. We have added these justifications to the Methods section.</p><p>It is worth pointing out that the suggested journal article [19] investigates pupil “entrainment” to physical changes in visual input, a response that depends on different neural circuitry and may therefore underlie different time scales than the arousal-linked changes of interest here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

At some points, the methods could benefit from more details. To give only a few examples: The estimation of the Spearman's correlation in source space is only reported in the results but not the methods. Moreover (~l. 840) the Methods do not specify that statistics are run within participants and ß parameters are tested against zero on a group level. Finally, (~l. 800): The authors could state how they computed the cross-correlation (e.g., what is the max lag?) before reporting how they averaged the cross-correlations across sensors and frequencies.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the requested details to the Methods section and revised that section further to include changes made in response to the other Reviewers’ comments.</p><p>With regard to the statistics on the ß parameters, this may be a misunderstanding: the statistics are not run within participants, but indeed only tested against zero on a group level. The polynomial model is fitted within subjects, in order to obtain parameters for each subject and block (only for the Hamburg data where two blocks were recorded).

These loops may therefore be sensitive to noradrenergic (Dahl et al., 2022) or even basal-forebrain regulated cholinergic modulation (Nestvogel and McCormick, 2021; Zagha and McCormick, 2014).

Eye movements.</p><p>There is a clear relationship between eye movements and pupil dilation (e.g. https://peerj.com/articles/1150/). This is not only the case for large saccades but likely for fixational eye movements (FEM) too. Both are likely present during the recording. I wondered, could the authors extract time series of gaze position and use these as a control analysis instead of the pupil time series? Does pupil dilation vary with gaze direction eccentricity? Does gaze direction relate to brain oscillations too or not at all. I guess a simple check is to plot the x-y- ET data together with pupil diameter locked to saccade (both micro and macro) onset. Next, one could re-do the main analysis (e.g. Figure 2 and 5) on data segments pre movement vs. post movement followed by equivalence test or something.</p><p>In particular, the anterior δ-theta effects and the visual α could be interpreted within the context of eye movements too. In fact, this could be the one of the &quot;independent mechanisms&quot; the authors speculate about on p. 6 line 216. The authors note that the effect in the visual cortices had the shortest lag with respect to pupil dilation. Yet, visual areas are early in the hierarchy of areas controlling and noticing eye movement. For example if one considers the observations that, cooling of V1 silences cell firing in the superior colliculus (i.e. extended work by Peter Shiller) and in turn eye movement, or some recent work on motor fields in V1 (https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6521/1191).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that controlling for eye movements is important. For this reason, we have regressed out the effect of (large) saccades on pupil diameter already during the preprocessing of the pupil time series (see Methods, section ‘Pupil preprocessing (all sites)’). All analyses reported in the manuscript are therefore unaffected by saccades.</p><p>In response to your comment, we have carried out several analyses in order to make sure that eye movements in general and microsaccades in particular do not explain our findings. To this end, we correlated gaze direction eccentricity with pupil diameter and analyzed microsaccade-locked time-frequency representations as well as changes in pupil diameter. Fluctuations in gaze eccentricity were not significantly correlated with fluctuations in pupil diameter (Mean correlation across subjects: r = -0.0158; P = 0.53; paired two-sided t-test). Next, we identified microsaccades using the Engbert-Kliegl algorithm (Engbert et al., 2003, Vis Res) with default parameters (minimal saccade duration of 5 samples, i.e., 12.5 msec and λ=6). For 10 subjects (Hamburg data), only horizontal eye movement data were saved. These subjects were excluded from the analysis. Furthermore, one subject of the Muenster dataset was excluded due to noisy gaze position data, resulting in 62 total subjects. Next, we computed event-locked time-frequency representations (sensor-level only). We found a significant reduction in α power following microsaccades (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A) extending from anterior to posterior sensors (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B). Critically, however, across all frequencies, there were no significant correlations between the change in pupil diameter and the change in cortical activity following microsaccades (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C). Moreover, pupil diameter does not change significantly following microsaccade onset (Figure 2—figure supplement 1D). Hence, while microsaccades seem to affect band-limited brain activity (across almost all sensors and most prominently in the α-range), they do not affect pupil diameter and the interaction of pupil diameter with cortical activity. Thus, we assume that microsaccades do not affect the correlations and results that are central to this paper.</p><p>We have added this control analysis to the manuscript as Figure 2—figure supplement 1 along with the following paragraph to the Results section (the procedure is described in detail in a new paragraph in the Methods section):</p><p>“A possible confound in identifying relationships between pupil and cortical dynamics are eye movements: Saccades change pupil size (Mathot, 2018; Mathôt et al., 2015) and oculomotor behaviour is functionally linked to cortical α oscillations (Popov et al., 2021). Here, we controlled for saccade effects by regressing out canonical responses from pupil time series (as detailed in the Methods section; see e.g., Urai et al., 2017). An additional control analysis found that remaining micro-saccades (not captured by the regressing-out) led to a transient suppression of cortical activity in the 8-32 Hz range. However, this effect was not associated with any changes in pupil diameter (Figure 2—figure supplement 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

In any case, that should not explain a <italic>stronger</italic> correlation between slope and pupil size for deeper sources.

Again, we would like to emphasize that it is not the spectral exponent per se, but the change in the spectral exponent for different pupil diameters that is crucial for this analysis. In the same vein, note that Beamformer coefficients are static.

The two analysis types are:</p><p>Line 745 – &quot;MEG spectral analysis (all sites)&quot;, describes a Morlet wavelet analyses which appears to be used for the results in figures 1-4.</p><p>Line 325 and 817 – &quot;Nonlinear relations between pupil-linked arousal and band-limited cortical activity&quot;, describes a two second sliding window pwelch analysis.</p><p>The sliding window Welch's method analysis will have the same temporal resolution for each frequency band, and the pupil dynamics are matched to the sliding windows used for the MEG. I would strongly suggest running both analyses with Welch's periodogram across sliding windows. This would ensure that dynamics in all frequency have the same resolution and that all analyses in the paper are matched. If there is an additional concern that successive window are independent for the polynomial modelling then the window overlap could be adjusted between the two sections (though independent windows is potentially desirable for the first analysis as well?)</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that we have applied wavelet-based approaches to spectral decomposition for all analyses except for the tests of nonlinear (quadratic) and aperiodic (spectral slope) relationships with pupil size, which are based on 2-sec sliding window short-term Fourier transforms based on Welch’s method.</p><p>While we understand that homogenizing the spectral analysis approaches may benefit the comprehensibility of the paper, we would like to keep with our two-pronged solution for practical reasons. We are convinced that the reviewer will agree that both approaches are equally valid and, in effect, largely equivalent – differences can be found in how both approaches detail adjusting spectral and temporal resolutions. To illustrate the similarities, we have recomputed Figure 2 with a pwelch approach for your comparison, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>:</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Comparison of results presented in Figure 2, obtained via different spectral decomposition approaches.</title><p>Upper panel: Wavelet-based approach as used in the paper.

Note that the STFT approach seems to impose a 1/f effect onto the results, while also reducing sensitivity in the higher frequency ranges.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-71890-sa2-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The wavelet approach as applied here does indeed change the temporal resolution for each frequency – the number of samples for pupil-power correlations increases with frequency. However, varying the temporal resolution also naturally accommodates different spectral resolutions, i.e. wider bands for higher frequencies, which is prudent given our logarithmic frequency scale. In turn, the window length of a short-term Fourier transform (pwelch) based sliding window approach would be determined by the lowest frequency of interest, in our case 2 Hz, and result in a window length of 0.5 sec, with a corresponding fixed frequency resolution of 2 Hz. This resolution may befit intermedial frequency ranges but is too high to yield a reasonable band discrimination within our low frequency range and too low to capture the natural bandwidth of broadband high-frequency activity.</p><p>For our analysis of the relationship between pupil size and aperiodic activity we opted for the pwelch approach with a 2-sec window length instead. Longer segments reduce noise in the spectral estimation, which improves the FOOOF fit of the aperiodic part (slope) of the power spectrum. Therefore, we prioritized goodness-of-fit of the FOOOF model over temporal resolution. Critically however, this analysis was based on a feature of the whole power spectrum (which were most practically derived via pwelch rather than reconstructed from wavelet-based decomposition) and did not underlie striking a careful balance between temporal and spectral resolutions in the same way as the frequency-specific estimates in the other analyses. This analysis was run in parallel with the test for non-linear relationships, which therefore also used the pwelch approach.</p><p>We have made our rationale explicit in the Methods section as follows:</p><p>Added to Methods section ‘MEG spectral analysis (all sites)’:</p><p>“Each frequency band was defined as the halve-octave band around the respective center frequencies, thus adapting spectral and temporal widths of wavelets to accommodate wider bands and finer temporal resolution for higher frequencies.”</p><p>Added to Methods section ‘Source-level power spectra and spectral parametrization’:</p><p>“Note that we opted for a different spectral decomposition method here than the wavelet-based approach (as described above) for practical reasons: Welch's periodogram method yields a direct estimate of the spectrum, which is convenient for parameterization as this analysis focused on the 1/f feature of the power spectrum rather than on power at individual frequencies.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>#2 An additional control analysis exploring whether the spatial correlation maps in are associated with source power in the presented frequencies. For example, figure 5D shows the spatial map of the quadratic coefficient at 11 and 19Hz – how closly related is this topography to the simpler spatial distribution of 11Hz and 19Hz power?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point. In order to test the similarity between the maps of the pupil-power coupling (linear as well as quadratic) and the source maps of power in the corresponding frequency range, we computed the spatial correlation between the two. The findings are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref> . In short, while the spatial distribution of band-limited power overlaps partially with the pupil-MEG correlation maps, especially in the low frequency range (see panel B), it explains only a fraction of the variance (&lt; 4%). Hence, regressing out the spatial power maps of the pupil-MEG maps has little effect on the results (see panel C).</p><fig id="sa2fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Comparison of the spatial distribution of power and the pupil-MEG correlation maps across four frequency bands of interest.</title><p>(A) Distribution of source power.

Not sure what to recommend about the frequency range difference here – at the least it should be acknowledged and discussed. Ideally this analysis should be matched to Gao et al., given how critical this reference is to the discussion and interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out – we agree that the choice of frequency range is not sufficiently justified in our manuscript. In their paper, Gao et al., generated data by simulating a simple statistical model (their Figure 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig5">Author response image 5</xref>) in order to obtain a rough frequency range where PSD is sensitive to changes in excitation-inhibition ratio, which they then apply to data recorded in humans (ECoG; 30-50 Hz) and monkeys (LFPs; 40-60 Hz). Importantly, however, it is evident from their Figure 1G that PSD slope in lower frequency ranges exhibits even higher correlations with excitation-inhibition ratio (the first data point in panel 1G is centered at 20 Hz and represents the frequency range from 10 Hz to 30 Hz). In order to make this more explicit, we simulated the model of Gao et al., (using publicly available code: https://github.com/voytekresearch/EISlope/) and extended the frequency range to lower frequency bands. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig5">Author response image 5</xref> shows, the correlations between excitation-inhibition ratio and PSD slope are even higher for frequency ranges not shown in the paper of Gao et al., and are highest in the range chosen for the current manuscript (shown in blue).</p><fig id="sa2fig5" position="float"><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption><title>Spearman correlation between changes in excitation-inhibition ratio and PSD slope.</title><p>Shown are center frequencies (+/- 10 Hz). Gray dotted lines show the standard deviation across five model runs.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-71890-sa2-fig5-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Consistently, by simulating a biologically more plausible conductance-based model comprised of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons, Trakoshis et al., (2020) demonstrated that the slope-based inference of E/I ratio is valid for both higher and lower frequencies (c.f. Figure 1D,E). In their own words: “Slopes from the low-frequency (Figure 1D) and high-frequency region (Figure 1E) increase when g is reduced (i.e. E:I ratio augmented)”, where the “low frequency region” is defined as 1-30 Hz and the “high frequency region” defined as 30 – 100 Hz. Hence, according to both, the simpler model (Gao et al.,), as well as a biologically plausible LIF model, the frequency range chosen in the current paper is justified.</p><p>In order to make this more clear in the paper, we now point to the aforementioned articles in order to better justify the frequency range chosen in our analysis:</p><p>“To this end, we parameterized the power spectra of consecutive data epochs of the source-projected MEG data in a frequency range from 3 to 40 Hz, separately for all source locations (Donoghue et al., 2020). Simulations of a biologically plausible neural network (Trakoshis et al., 2020) as well as empirical insights from optogenetic stimulations in neonatal mice (Chini et al., 2021) show that spectral slopes extracted from the chosen frequency range are in fact sensitive to changes in the underlying ratio between excitation and inhibition. The resulting parameter estimates described the periodic and the aperiodic components per epoch (data segmentation as in the previous section; see Methods).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional points</p><p>#4 It isn't clear where the three frequency bands of interest (line 188: 2-4Hz, 8-16Hz, and 64-128Hz) come from. I think this is based on Figure 1 but only the Glasgow site appears to show distinct clusters in these bands. Hamburg and Munster are significant across the whole 2-32Hz range and Hamburg is additionally significant from 32-128Hz. On this basis, the exclusion of the 4-8Hz and 16-64Hz range seems a bit odd. Some additional clarification and justification would be helpful – apologies if I have missed this in another section.</p></disp-quote><p>Note first that the 4-8Hz and 16-64 Hz ranges were not generally excluded. Instead, they were left out for reasons laid out below and for the cross-correlation analysis only (Figure 3). Other analyses included these bands.</p><p>The three frequency bands, referred to by the reviewer, are a result of their characteristic morphologies in the cross-correlation analyses (Figure 3), and not a result of analyses depicted in Figure 2 (which, we assume, the reviewer refers to as ‘Figure 1’). For the banding in the cross-correlation results (Figure 3), we took a careful approach and excluded bordering frequencies to emphasise the characteristic pattern for each band.</p><p>In general, our approach was to be as minimally prescriptive as possible with respect to “banding”. We are using it descriptively where the data commends it and as a means of data reduction to ease illustration and interpretation – see e.g. source reconstructions that separate bands more “classically” into theta, α, β and γ ranges. Further justifications are given by the typical subdivision into low- and high-frequency bands in rodent research.</p><p>Figure-2 findings are based on mutual information between pupil and power envelopes, which is sensitive to monotonic and non-monotonic relationships in the data, and can therefore be seen as a blanket approach to show that (1) there are relationships to be expected in the data across virtually all frequencies in follow-on, fine-grained analyses, and (2) this is widely consistent across labs. We find that this is captured in the following section of the Results section but will amend if the Reviewer thinks additional clarification is necessary:</p><p>“For all three MEG laboratories, standardised-MI spectra showed similar patterns of widespread pupil-brain associations across frequencies with prominent peaks in the 8-32 Hz range (Figure 2A). MI scalp distributions within this frequency range further underpinned the commonalities between recording sites despite different MEG systems and setups (Figure 2B). Significant relationships with pupil <bold>size</bold> were also evident for the low-frequency (4-8 Hz) and high-frequency (64-128 Hz) components of MEG-power (Figure 2A) in all three datasets.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>#5 related to 4, subjectively the MI spectra across the three sites don't seem to be all that similar, a stronger justification for combining subjects in subsequent analyses would be reassuring. Given that this is the jumping off point for the rest of the paper it would be good to revisit this figure to emphasise the points of similarity – the supporting spectra in supplemental materials and topos show between site similarity more convincingly.</p><p>To formalise this, can you repeat the between subject correlation matrix from figure S1B for the MI spectra and see if there is substantial banding per-site? if site-specific bands are visible here, then a mixed-modelling approach or the inclusion of a site-covariate in subsequent analyses would be desirable.</p></disp-quote><p>As pointed out in response to point 4 above, the crucial take-away from Figure 2 should be that there are systematic pupil-brain relationships across all (or most) frequencies for all three datasets. As mentioned by the Reviewer, pooling of the data was justified by a range of similarities, also taking into account the results of the cross-correlation analysis shown in Figure 3A and Figure 1—figure supplements 1 and 2.</p><p>Additionally, we have revised the first paragraph of Results section to point out analyses relating to Figures S1 and S2 (in the revised manuscript referred to as Figure 1—figure supplements 1 and 2), and their purpose in justifying a joint analysis of all three datasets more strongly:</p><p>“For each of the three MEG laboratories, we obtained time courses of MEG activity and of pupil diameter fluctuations. A first control analysis of the recordings (Figure 1—figure supplements 1 and 2) established that they were highly comparable between laboratories, despite the differences in locations, setups, and participants.”</p><p>We have further revised Figure S2 (revised version: Figure 1—figure supplement 2) to include more information and adapt the design of S1 (revised version: Figure 1—figure supplement 1).</p><p>For this response letter, we have also produced the requested correlation plot for individual spectra of standardised Mutual information (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig6">Author response image 6</xref> ). Note first that this similarity measure is necessarily noisier than related plots based on MEG or pupil power spectra (see, e.g., new plot Figure 1—figure supplement 2) due to relatively small effect sizes (e.g., correlations in the range of [-0.05; 0.05], see Figures 3 and 4). Although there seems to be some clustering around the Hamburg data, this is not exclusively lab-specific and is most likely explained by different signal-to-noise ratio between the labs that are due to the difference in the lengths of the resting-state blocks (Münster = 5 min, Glasgow = 7 min, Hamburg = 10 min; as reported in the Methods section), giving the Hamburg data the highest SNR. We assume that including a factor of “recording lab”, if explaining systematic variation in the data, would primarily indicate this SNR effect, and therefore would be uninformative.</p><fig id="sa2fig6" position="float"><label>Author response image 6.</label><caption><title>Participant-by-participant correlation of standardised Mutual Information (MI) spectra.</title><p>Colour coding along x and y-axes indicate the recording laboratories.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-71890-sa2-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig></body></sub-article></article>
