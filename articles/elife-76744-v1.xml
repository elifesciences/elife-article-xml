Nutritional components, such as dietary fatty acids, can act as inflammatory stimuli, but it is unknown if they can act as the primary stimuli in the context of innate immune memory. Here we find mice fed a diet enriched exclusively in saturated fatty acids (SFAs; ketogenic diet; KD) confer a hyper-inflammatory response to systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and increased mortality, independent of diet-induced microbiome and glycemic modulation. We find KD mediates the composition of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) compartment, and macrophages derived from the bone marrow of mice fed KD do not have altered baseline inflammation, but enhanced responses to a secondary inflammatory challenge. Lipidomics identified enhanced free palmitic acid (PA) and PA-associated lipids in KD-fed mice serum. We found pre-treatment with physiologically relevant concentrations of PA alone reprograms macrophages to induce a hyper-inflammatory response to secondary challenge with LPS. This response was found to be dependent on the synthesis of ceramide, and reversible when treated with a ceramide synthase inhibitor. <italic>In vivo</italic>, we found systemic PA confers enhanced inflammation and mortality during an acute inflammatory response to systemic LPS, and this phenotype was not reversible for up to 7 days post-PA-exposure. While PA-treatment is harmful for endotoxemia outcome, we find PA exposure enhanced clearance of <italic>Candida albicans</italic> in <italic>Rag1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. Further, we show that oleic acid (OA), a mono-unsaturated FA that depletes intracellular ceramide, reverses the PA-induced hyper-inflammatory response shown in macrophages treated with LPS, and reduces severity and mortality of LPS endotoxin stimulation, highlighting the plasticity of SFA-dependent enhanced endotoxemia severity <italic>in vivo. </italic>These are the first data to implicate enriched dietary SFAs, and specifically PA, in the induction of long-lived innate immune memory that is detrimental during an acute inflammatory response, but beneficial for clearance of pathogens.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NIGMS/NIH</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM133804</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Napier</surname><given-names>Brooke A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><back><sec id="s1" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interest</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf1"><p>The authors declare that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.
