However, the mechanism by which Ψ promotes selective packaging of the gRNA is not well understood. We used fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and quenching data to monitor the binding of recombinant HIV-1 Gag protein to Cy5-tagged 190-base RNAs. At physiological ionic strength, Gag binds with very similar, nanomolar affinities to both Ψ-containing and control RNAs. We challenged these interactions by adding excess competing tRNA; introducing mutations in Gag; or raising the ionic strength. These modifications all revealed high specificity for Ψ. This specificity is evidently obscured in physiological salt by non-specific, predominantly electrostatic interactions. This nonspecific activity was attenuated by mutations in the MA, CA, and NC domains, including CA mutations disrupting Gag-Gag interaction. We propose that gRNA is selectively packaged because binding to Ψ nucleates virion assembly with particular efficiency.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.27055.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.27055.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>HIV</kwd><kwd>retrovirus</kwd><kwd>virus assembly</kwd><kwd>RNA</kwd><kwd>protein-RNA interaction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Comas-Garcia</surname><given-names>Mauricio</given-names></name><name><surname>Datta</surname><given-names>Siddhartha AK</given-names></name><name><surname>Baker</surname><given-names>Laura</given-names></name><name><surname>Rein</surname><given-names>Alan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Intramural AIDS Targeted Antiviral Therapy Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Comas-Garcia</surname><given-names>Mauricio</given-names></name><name><surname>Rein</surname><given-names>Alan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Varma</surname><given-names>Rajat</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Contract HHS N26120080001E</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gudla</surname><given-names>Prabhakar R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>While HIV-1 Gag protein binds tightly to several RNAs, it binds to the viral RNA 'packaging signal' with higher specificity than to control RNAs.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Immature virions of HIV-1 and other retroviruses are assembled from the viral Gag polyprotein. This precursor protein consists of matrix (MA), capsid (CA), nucleocapsid (NC) and p6 domains, as well as two spacer peptides (SP1 and SP2) flanking the NC domain. The MA domain binds Gag to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhou et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chukkapalli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barros et al., 2016</xref>), although in the cytoplasm it is bound to RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kutluay et al., 2014</xref>); the CA domain (together with SP1) drives virion assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Worthylake et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Datta et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Datta et al., 2015</xref>); the NC domain is required for incorporation of nucleic acids (the two zinc fingers in this domain are necessary for selective RNA packaging) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aldovini and Young, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gorelick et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cimarelli et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 1998</xref>); and the p6 domain interacts with the host-cell machinery to release virions from the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Freed, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Usami et al., 2009</xref>). As far as is known, all retrovirus particles also contain RNA. In fact, addition of RNA to recombinant Gag protein in vitro leads to its assembly into virus-like particles (VLPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campbell and Rein, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campbell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gross et al., 2000</xref>). We have suggested that cooperative binding to nucleic acid brings Gag molecules into close proximity with each other, thereby nucleating virion assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rein et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Datta et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Datta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Comas-Garcia et al., 2016</xref>). In particular, we have found that SP1 undergoes a conformational change when two or more copies are closely juxtaposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Datta et al., 2015</xref>). It is plausible that this change causes the exposure of interfaces in Gag required for particle assembly. However, it is not known if the identity of the bound nucleic acid influences this process.</p><p>Almost any single-stranded nucleic acid can support virus-like particle (VLP) assembly in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campbell and Rein, 1999</xref>). Nonetheless in infected cells, the full-length viral RNA (genomic RNA or gRNA) is encapsidated with very high selectivity. However, when Gag is expressed in mammalian cells lacking gRNA, it assembles into VLPs containing a nearly random assortment of cellular mRNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rulli et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, the ‘structural’ role of RNA in virion assembly can be provided by either gRNA or by cellular RNAs. In infected cells, the gRNA is competing with a large excess of cellular RNAs and spliced viral RNAs for encapsidation, and evidently has a strong advantage in this competition.</p><p>What is the nature of this advantage? As in all retroviruses, the HIV-1 gRNA contains a <italic>cis</italic>-acting RNA element called the ‘packaging signal’ (‘Ψ') that is required for its selective packaging during virion assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aldovini and Young, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lever et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clavel and Orenstein, 1990</xref>). This signal consists of several hundred nucleotides in the 5’-untranslated region (UTR) and part of the Gag open reading frame. However, how the presence of Ψ leads to preferential encapsidation is not understood. One possibility is that Ψ is a high-affinity binding site for Gag. In fact, a great deal of effort has been devoted to measuring binding affinities of Gag and NC for nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shubsda et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Webb et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fisher et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abd El-Wahab et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernacchi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cruceanu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dannull et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berkowitz et al., 1993</xref>). However, we show here that under physiologically relevant salt concentrations, this protein binds to Ψ and non-Ψ RNAs with very similar, nanomolar affinities. Thus, it seems unlikely that a simple high-affinity scenario could explain the packaging selectivity observed in vivo.</p><p>In the present work, we have investigated the question of whether Gag discriminates between Ψ and non-Ψ RNAs at the level of binding. As noted above, we find that at near-physiological ionic strengths the affinities of Gag for these different RNAs are virtually indistinguishable. However, when the strength of Gag-Gag and/or Gag-RNA interactions is modulated, Gag binds with high specificity to a Ψ-containing RNA. While there are both specific and non-specific components in binding to any RNA, there is a much larger contribution of specific binding with Ψ. Unexpectedly, strong Gag-Gag interactions make a major contribution to the non-specific component. We suggest a novel general mechanism by which the type and strength of Gag-Gag and Gag-RNA interactions during binding might lead to preferential encapsidation of gRNA.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The goal of the experiments described here was to measure and characterize the binding of recombinant Δp6 HIV-1 Gag protein to short single-stranded RNAs. As noted in the Introduction, addition of RNA to Gag can lead to assembly of VLPs, complicating the measurement of a dissociation constant (<bold><italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic></bold>) for the binding. In fact, most biophysical techniques (e.g., sedimentation experiments or isothermal calorimetry) require high Gag concentrations (micromolar regime); at these concentrations Gag/RNA complexes will associate into virus-like-particles. We have circumvented this problem by using FCS, in which the concentration of the fluorophore-tagged RNA is low enough that association of Gag/RNA complexes into VLPs or other large structures is not thermodynamically favorable.</p><p>We have analyzed the binding of Gag to three 175-base viral-derived RNAs: HIV-1 nt 193–368, referred to here as ‘Ψ'; HIV-1 nt 2004–2179, called ‘GRPE’; and Moloney MLV nt 202–377, called ‘MoMLV Ψ'. GRPE has been suggested to contribute to selective packaging of gRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chamanian et al., 2013</xref>), but this now seems unlikely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nikolaitchik et al., 2014</xref>). As many lines of evidence indicate that only dimeric gRNA is selectively packaged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moore et al., 2009</xref>), we studied the HIV-1 Ψ RNA in both monomeric and dimeric forms (see Materials and methods). A 15-nt long polyA tail was added at the 3’-end of the viral sequences to increase the labeling efficiency. The RNAs were covalently labeled at their 3’ ends with Cy5, as detailed in Materials and methods.</p><p>In a typical experiment, the RNA was diluted in Binding Buffer to a concentration of 15 nM and different amounts of Gag protein (final concentrations between 15 and 300 nM) were added. After overnight incubation at 4° C, the mixtures were analyzed by FCS at room temperature. The autocorrelation curves from Cy5-labeled RNAs were analyzed to obtain the weighted average diffusion constant (<bold><italic>D</italic></bold>) of the RNAs in each mixture. In addition, we found that binding of Gag induced quenching of the Cy5 fluorophore; thus the fraction of RNA molecules bound to Gag could be estimated from the normalized fluorescence intensity in each reaction mixture. It has been shown that quenching of this fluorophore results from the steric stabilization of a non-fluorescent photon-induced Cy5 isomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Levitus and Ranjit, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stennett et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, by using FCS, we can determine, in a single experiment, changes in coarse-grained structure (i.e., overall size) of the RNA and the fraction of bound and free RNAs. First we will discuss the effects of Gag binding upon the overall structure of Gag/RNA complexes and then the contributions of the different domains of the polyprotein Gag to RNA binding affinity and specificity.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Gag binding causes RNA collapse</title><p>Binding of Gag to the tested RNAs resulted in an increase in the <bold><italic>D</italic></bold> of the RNAs. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> it can be seen that the <bold><italic>D</italic></bold> for each RNA increases as the concentration of Gag is increased, reaching a plateau at ≈ 50–100 nM Gag in the case of HIV-1 Ψ (monomeric and dimeric) and ≈ 200–250 nM Gag with MoMLV Ψ and GRPE RNAs. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref> shows that the diffusion coefficients (<bold><italic>D</italic></bold>) of the monomeric and dimeric HIV-1 Ψ RNAs were different enough to be resolved from each other by FCS and that the dimerization efficiency was ≈ 90%). Thus, the binding of Gag results in a decrease in the hydrodynamic radius of the RNA. This was somewhat unexpected, as the Gag/RNA complexes must have greater masses than the free RNAs, and implies that binding of Gag to the RNA causes a collapse in the RNA. The increase in the diffusion coefficient is not due to RNA degradation; upon digestion of the Gag/RNA complexes with Proteinase K, the <bold><italic>D</italic></bold> of the labeled RNA reverts to that of naked RNA (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>).

This reflects the fact that we could not detect binding beyond the last data-point shown on the graph: evidently, there are really two slopes with 8N Gag, but the second slope is extremely steep. On the one hand, for the dimeric HIV Ψ RNA at NaCl concentrations between 200 and 500 mM, the difference in the curves for 8N Gag and WT Gag is very small. (In fact, at 500–550 mM NaCl, the <bold><italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic></bold>s for 8N Gag/dimeric Ψ are smaller than for WT Gag (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s3">Figure 9—figure supplement 3</xref>)). On the other hand, the curve for 8N Gag/GRPE is shifted to higher <bold><italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic></bold> values. Thus, decreasing the strength of MA-RNA interactions has a minor impact on binding to the dimeric Ψ, but a large effect on binding to the control RNA. This confirms that MA-RNA interactions make a significant contribution to the electrostatic component of binding.</p><p>As mentioned before, when Gag-Gag interactions were weakened (by means of ablating the dimer interface with the WM mutation), the presence of tRNAs revealed binding specificity for the dimeric HIV-1 Ψ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In a similar fashion, increasing the ionic strength reveals the high binding specificity of this protein for the dimeric HIV1-Ψ (compare the black circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A versus 9B</xref>); we could not detect binding of WM Gag to the GRPE RNA at NaCl concentrations higher than 200 mM, while the WM Gag/Ψ RNA curve closely resembles that for wild-type Gag. However, the steep slope appears at ≈ 300 mM rather than ≈ 400 mM NaCl. This shift of the salt concentration for the second slope is a surprising result, especially when considering that both the MA and NC domains, which are known to interact with RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shkriabai et al., 2006</xref>), of this protein are identical to those of the wild-type protein. The lack of strong Gag-Gag interactions greatly decreased non-specific binding at salt concentrations slightly higher than physiological. In fact, comparing the plots for wild-type, 8N, and WM Gag shows that Gag-Gag interactions have a stronger contribution to non-specific binding than MA-RNA interactions.</p><p>We also asked whether the specific interactions between Gag and RNA are strong enough to permit binding when MA-RNA and Gag-Gag interactions are both weakened. To do so we combined the 8N and WM mutations in one protein (8N/WM Gag). The green diamonds in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref> show that binding of 8N/WM Gag to the dimeric Ψ exhibits the two-slope behavior. As expected, binding of this protein is considerably weaker than for the other proteins. In fact, we were not able to detect binding of this protein to the GRPE RNA at NaCl concentrations higher than 200 mM (see green diamonds in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). These results show that simultaneously decreasing MA-RNA, Gag-Gag and the overall electrostatic interactions is not enough to abolish nanomolar binding to Ψ, while it profoundly depresses binding to GRPE RNA.</p><p>The two zinc fingers in the NC domain are essential for selection of the viral RNA in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aldovini and Young, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gorelick et al., 1990</xref>) and there is evidence that they are required for specific binding in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fisher et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dannull et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berkowitz et al., 1993</xref>). Thus, we tested their contribution to binding at different salt concentrations by using a Gag mutant in which the two zinc fingers were disrupted by mutating the first two Cys residues from each finger to Ser (‘SSHC Gag’). These mutations destroy the ability of the NC domain to chelate zinc ions. The pink stars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A and B</xref> show that at 200 mM NaCl the <bold><italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic></bold>s of SSHC Gag for the dimeric HIV-1 Ψ and GRPE RNA, respectively, are not significantly different from those of WT Gag. However, increasing the salt concentration drastically interfered with the binding to both RNAs. Binding of SSHC Gag to the dimeric Ψ RNA was undetectable at NaCl &gt;300 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>) and to GRPE RNA at NaCl ≥250 mM NaCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). This salt-sensitivity demonstrates that the two zinc fingers are the major sources of non-electrostatic interactions (specific binding) and is fully consistent with the dramatic effects of zinc-finger mutations in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aldovini and Young, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gorelick et al., 1990</xref>). However, the fact that at 300 mM NaCl SSHC Gag binds detectably to the dimeric Ψ RNA, but not to the GRPE RNA, was somewhat unexpected. The implications of this result are considered in the discussion section.</p><p>To further analyze the contribution of the NC domain, we used a mutant protein (310 Gag) in which four positively charged amino acids between the two zinc fingers were mutated to alanines (<sup>29</sup>RAPRKKG<sup>35</sup> of the NC domain to <sup>29</sup>AAPAAAG<sup>35</sup>). The blue triangles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref> show that binding of 310 Gag to the dimeric Ψ exhibited one slope; as we could not detect binding at 500 mM NaCl, the second slope is extremely steep. As expected, we could not detect binding of GRPE RNA to this protein at salt concentrations above 200 mM NaCl (blue triangle in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). The extremely weak binding, if any, of the GRPE RNA to this protein at NaCl concentrations above 200 mM NaCl shows that Gag-GRPE interactions are almost exclusively electrostatic, and that these interactions depend upon the basic linker between the zinc fingers in NC. In contrast, the robust binding of 310 Gag to Ψ demonstrates that Gag-Ψ interaction has a very large non-electrostatic component and that the linker is not crucial for this interaction.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Retroviruses such as HIV-1 selectively package their gRNA during virus assembly, despite the presence in the cell of a very large excess of cellular mRNAs, which can also be packaged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Comas-Garcia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rulli et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Muriaux et al., 2001</xref>). The selective packaging of gRNA is due to the presence of the ‘packaging signal’ or ‘Ψ’ in the gRNA. Several previous reports have indicated that the HIV-1 Gag protein binds preferentially to RNAs containing this signal in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Webb et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abd El-Wahab et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernacchi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dannull et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berkowitz et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Damgaard et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Geigenmüller and Linial, 1996</xref>). In an effort to understand the mechanism of selective packaging of Ψ-containing RNAs, we have now performed a detailed analysis of the binding of recombinant HIV-1 Gag proteins to RNAs with or without Ψ.</p><p>Our findings can be very briefly summarized as follows. (1) binding of Gag to an RNA results in the physical collapse of the RNA and in quenching of the Cy5 fluorophore covalently linked to the 3’ end of the RNA; (2) in all cases examined, Gag binds cooperatively to RNAs; (3) the affinities of Gag for all the RNAs tested are all very similar to each other at physiological ionic strengths; however, (4) specificity for Ψ is revealed when affinities are measured in the presence of an excess of a competing irrelevant RNA; when Gag-Gag and/or Gag-RNA interactions are impaired by mutations in Gag; or (as previously reported by Webb <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Webb et al., 2013</xref>]) when the ionic strength is increased. The results show that selective packaging of gRNA cannot be explained on the basis of the affinity of Gag for Ψ. However, the binding affinities represent the sum of both specific and non-specific interactions; when non-specific interactions are attenuated, it becomes clear that binding to Ψ has a far higher specific component than binding to other RNAs.</p><p>The results obtained with mutant Gag proteins and with competing tRNA are particularly informative. We found that addition of excess tRNA interferes significantly more with binding to the control RNAs (lacking Ψ) than to either monomeric and dimeric HIV-1 Ψ RNAs. This is in agreement with a previous study showing that addition of an excess of a competitor RNA helps to reveal binding specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berkowitz et al., 1993</xref>). However, it has no detectable effect on the binding of 8N Gag (a mutant Gag in which basic residues in the MA domain have been replaced) to RNAs either with or without Ψ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5B</xref>). This shows that positively charged residues in MA play an important role in the binding to the non-Ψ RNAs and to tRNAs. This is consistent with the fact that the MA domain is mainly associated with tRNAs in the cytoplasm of virus-producing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kutluay et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We found that the SSHC mutation, disrupting the zinc-chelating fingers in NC, drastically decreases specific binding to Ψ, in excellent concordance with mutational studies in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aldovini and Young, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gorelick et al., 1990</xref>). However, this mutant Gag still retains some residual preference for Ψ, as demonstrated both by its <bold><italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic></bold> at 0.25 M NaCl and by the salt-resistance of the binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Thus, preferential binding of Gag to Ψ cannot be entirely attributed to the two zinc fingers of NC. The residual specificity of SSHC Gag for Ψ is evidently undetectable by most experimental techniques and is obviously inadequate for selective packaging in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aldovini and Young, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gorelick et al., 1990</xref>). One possible explanation for this result is that the zinc fingers are not the only source of non-electrostatic interactions and that other domains of Gag contribute to specific Gag/Ψ interactions. Nonetheless, it is also possible that SSHC Gag only engages in electrostatic interactions, but the dimeric Ψ is a better substrate for electrostatic interactions than GRPE RNA; for example, its 3-dimensional structure might give it a higher charge density per unit volume than that of GRPE RNA.</p><p>Interestingly, a Gag mutant in which four basic residues between the two zinc finger have been replaced with alanines (‘310’ Gag) retained significant affinity for Ψ, but its ability to bind the GRPE control RNA was drastically curtailed, as indicated by the salt-sensitivity of this interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). This salt-sensitivity suggests that just these four basic residues in NC (out of a total of 61 arginine and lysine residues in the ∆p6 Gag used here) make an important contribution to the electrostatic interactions with RNA; these electrostatic effects are particularly important in binding to GRPE RNA. Perhaps, by virtue of their location, these four basic residues help to maintain the proper conformation of the NC domain or control the placement of RNAs on this domain. Mutation of these residues partially interferes with selective packaging of gRNA and eliminates viral infectivity in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Poon et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wu et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the specific and non-specific interactions between Gag and RNA, the interactions between Gag molecules bound to an RNA molecule can also contribute to formation and stabilization of Gag/RNA complexes. The data with ‘WM’ mutant Gag, in which the Gag-Gag dimerization affinity in solution is reduced from <bold><italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic></bold> ~10 µM to <bold><italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic></bold> ~1 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Datta et al., 2007b</xref>), are especially striking. The binding of WM Gag to RNAs is still cooperative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), like that of WT and 8N Gag. Thus, Gag molecules, including those with the WM mutation, interact with each other when bound to RNA. It is important to note that in all of our titrations, the Gag concentrations were so low (generally ≤300 nM, always ≤600 nM) that Gag dimerization in solution is negligible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Datta et al., 2007b</xref>). The fact that the WM mutation does not reduce cooperativity suggests that the interactions between RNA-bound Gag molecules do not depend upon the dimer interface. While this is the only detectable interface for Gag-Gag interaction in solution, other interfaces (e.g., in the N-terminal domain of the CA domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">von Schwedler et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2008</xref>) and in SP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Datta et al., 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Datta et al., 2015</xref>) must also be used in virus assembly. Hence, some of these interfaces could be exposed and contribute to cooperativity when Gag binds RNA in our experiments.</p><p>We also found that the binding of WM Gag to the control RNAs was more sensitive to addition of a competitor RNA or increase in salt concentration than that of WT Gag, while the binding of the mutant to Ψ-containing RNA was relatively resistant to these challenges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). These results suggest that the specific Gag/HIV-1 Ψ interactions are strong enough to overcome the destabilization caused by weakening the protein-protein interactions through the dimer interface. In turn, the data imply that Gag-Gag interaction <italic>via</italic> this interface significantly strengthens the binding of WT Gag to the control RNAs.</p><p>Addition of competitor tRNAs also revealed that binding of Gag to RNA exhibits hysteresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We noted that hysteresis is greater with GRPE RNA than with monomeric HIV-1 Ψ RNA. This binding hysteresis is likely associated with the fact that re-equilibration of Gag/RNA complexes, upon addition of a second RNA, requires the dissociation of the initial complex. While binding is driven by Gag-nucleic acid interactions, dissociation of these complexes requires disrupting Gag-nucleic acid and Gag-Gag interactions. This implies that Gag re-equilibration, after addition of a second RNA species, must overcome the energetic barrier resulting from breaking Gag-Gag interactions. Therefore, the smaller degree of binding hysteresis for the HIV-1 Ψ RNA, compared to the GRPE RNA, implies that the energetic barrier for re-equilibration is lower in the presence of specific Gag-Ψ interactions.</p><p>The ability of a protein to collapse an RNA (i.e., reduce its hydrodynamic radius and increase its diffusion constant; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) has previously been reported with capsid proteins of other viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borodavka et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2013</xref>). Presumably, it occurs when the binding of positively charged regions of the protein to the RNA backbone reduces the electrostatic repulsion within the RNA; this activity very likely comes into play during assembly of the virus particle. The fact that the WM mutation profoundly reduces the ability of HIV-1 Gag protein to collapse RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), as well as the cooperativity of RNA collapse by WT and 8N Gag proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C</xref>), implies that protein-protein interaction (through the dimer interface) makes an important contribution to RNA collapse. The dependence of RNA collapse on protein-protein interactions is also consistent with recently described molecular dynamics simulations on RNA collapse by capsid proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Perlmutter and Hagan, 2015</xref>). It was interesting to note that the presence of excess yeast tRNA greatly reduced the magnitude of RNA collapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is even true with 8N Gag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), for which RNA binding per se is almost unaffected by tRNA addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). These observations suggest that tRNA is incorporated into the complexes of Gag and tagged RNA, reducing compaction, <italic>via</italic> one or more Gag domains other than MA.</p><p>Considered together, all of these results point to the following conclusions. The affinity of a Gag molecule for an RNA represents the sum of (I) non-electrostatic interactions; (II) electrostatic interactions; and (III) the interactions between two or more Gag molecules bound to a single RNA molecule. Interactions of the first type, mediated largely by the NC zinc fingers, impart specificity for Ψ. To a first approximation, the electrostatic interactions are presumably similar for different RNAs; our data show that the basic residues in the MA domain contribute significantly to these interactions. It seems likely that the basic character of the NC domain also plays a role in these interactions. The specificity for Ψ is revealed in the presence of mutations that reduce the strength of either the second or third types of interaction, or by addition of RNAs that compete for these interactions, or in an ionic environment that screens the second type of interaction.</p><p>Comparison of the effects of added tRNAs or increased ionic strength upon the apparent affinities of WT and 8N Gag for the labeled RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3 vs. 5B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8 vs. 9</xref>) shows that binding to Ψ and non-Ψ RNAs involves both MA and NC domains. This result does not appear to be consistent with a previous binding model in which binding of Gag to Ψ was suggested to involve only NC, while binding to a non-Ψ RNA is driven by interactions with both MA and NC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Webb et al., 2013</xref>). Webb and co-workers measured Gag/RNA equilibria by doing salt titrations of pre-mixed Gag/RNA complexes (at a fixed Gag:RNA ratio), while we titrated a fixed amount of RNA with varying concentrations of Gag at different salt concentrations. Presumably, the differences between the experimental approaches are responsible for the resulting discrepancy in binding models. It is somewhat surprising that the apparent affinity of 8N Gag for the dimeric HIV-1 Ψ between 500 and 550 mM NaCl is greater than that of WT Gag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s3">Figure 9—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, the interaction of the WT MA domain with RNAs is presumably almost exclusively electrostatic and is thus negligible at these high salt concentrations; we surmise that under these conditions, repulsion between positively charged WT MA domains of two or more RNA-bound Gag molecules raises the energetic cost of RNA-binding, and that this repulsion is reduced by the 8N mutations.</p><p>Previous studies on protein-nucleic acid binding show that the sensitivity of the binding to an increase in ionic strength is a direct reflection of the net number of charges participating in the binding (<bold><italic>Z<sub>eff</sub></italic></bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Webb et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Record et al., 1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rouzina and Bloomfield, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rye-McCurdy et al., 2015</xref>); in these experiments, plots of the logarithm of the <bold><italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic></bold> <italic>vs.</italic> logarithm of the monovalent ion concentration give a straight line, whose slope represents the <bold><italic>Z<sub>eff</sub></italic></bold>. However, in our experiments, these plots were bent rather than straight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>). According to the above mentioned studies on protein-nucleic acid interactions, the bent shape would imply that the <bold><italic>Z<sub>eff</sub></italic></bold> is different under the different ionic regimes. It seems likely that the change in slope reflects a conformational change in the Gag protein, which is known to assume very different conformations under different conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Datta et al., 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">2011b</xref>). Remarkably, the salt concentration at which this hypothetical change occurs is evidently determined in part by the identity of the RNA.</p><p>It might be proposed that the curves are really straight, and that our measurements in the lower salt concentrations are inaccurate at the very high affinities seen with WT Gag and Ψ RNA. In fact, the RNA concentration in these experiments (15 nM) is near the measured <bold><italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic></bold>s, and thus we cannot completely exclude the possibility that the actual <bold><italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic></bold> is even lower than our results indicate. However, it is important to note that the curve for WT Gag and GRPE RNA is also bent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), although the binding at each salt concentration is somewhat weaker than with Ψ RNA and we have no reason to doubt the accuracy of these measurements. Several other bent curves were also found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Furthermore, the fact that we were not able to measure a <bold><italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic></bold> after the last plotted point for 8N Gag/dimeric Ψ, 8N Gag/GRPE and 310 Gag/dimeric Ψ indicates that there is an abrupt change in the <bold><italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic></bold> at increased salt concentrations. Such an abrupt change is only possible if the curves for those protein and RNA combinations are bent.</p><p>It is particularly surprising that the curves exhibit steeper slopes at higher ionic strengths than at low ionic strength. One might naively expect that as the salt concentration is increased the electrostatic component decreases, ultimately reaching a point at which only the non-electrostatic component remains significant. This scenario would produce a curve with a steep slope (i.e., high salt sensitivity) at low salt and a shallow one at high salt; however, our plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>) show the reverse pattern. As we have mentioned before, the zinc fingers are primarily responsible for non-electrostatic binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Perhaps the change in slope reflects a change in the conformation of the NC domain, which in turn alters the non-electrostatic interactions of this domain. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> shows that the ‘upward bent’ curve for salt titration of WT Gag/dimeric Ψ (red line and circles) can be generated by using a model (blue line) in which the <bold><italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic></bold> is a weighted sum of the electrostatic interactions (black line and circles) and strong non-electrostatic interactions (solid green line). In the first binding mode (I) the conformation of Gag is such that binding is mostly non-electrostatic. In the second binding mode (II), the salt-induced conformational change in Gag gradually decreases the contribution of the non-electrostatic interactions (dotted green line). (The details of this model are explained in the supplementary information section.) Again, with 8N Gag/dimeric Ψ, 8N Gag/GRPE, and 310 Gag/dimeric Ψ, only a single slope is visible: this is because we could not detect binding at higher ionic strengths (0.6, 0.45 and 0.5 M NaCl, respectively). The <bold><italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic></bold>s at higher salt concentrations in these cases must be &gt;1 µM. In other words, these curves do have a second slope, but this slope is so steep that we could not make measurements at these high salt concentrations.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27055.023</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>The ‘upwards bent’ salt titration indicates that binding of Gag to RNAs has a very strong non-electrostatic component.</title><p>The concave or ‘upwards bent’ shape of the salt titration data for WT Gag/Ψ<sub>2</sub> (red circles) was obtained by using a model in which the observed <bold><italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic></bold> (blue line) is the weighted sum of strong non-electrostatic (green line) and electrostatic (black line) interactions.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Webb et al., 2013</xref>). Their experimental approach was somewhat different from ours; they could not have detected the bend in these curves, as the model to which they fitted their salt-titration data assumed a single slope. Interestingly, bent curves were also observed by Record <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Record et al., 1977</xref>), although their experimental system was different from ours in several ways.</p><p>While the majority of our experiments compared binding to dimeric Ψ RNA (the substrate for selective packaging in vivo) with binding to GRPE RNA, we also characterized binding to monomeric Ψ and to the MoMLV Ψ (RNAs containing MoMLV Ψ are not selectively packaged by HIV-1 Gag protein). In general, our data shows that binding of these two RNAs to Gag and its mutants is intermediate between the dimeric HIV-1 Ψ and the GRPE RNA. Under most experimental conditions the binding affinity of WT, as well as of most mutant Gag proteins, for the dimeric and monomeric HIV-1 Ψ were very similar to each other. Nonetheless, the dimeric RNA always exhibited a higher binding affinity than its monomeric counterpart. (Interestingly, the binding affinity for the dimeric HIV-1 Ψ was considerably higher than that for the monomeric Ψ in the tRNA competition experiments with WM Gag.) In fact, because the difference in the overall binding character between the monomeric and dimeric HIV-1 Ψ were small, we decided not to test the effects of RNA dimerization on the MoMLV Ψ. It was recently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kharytonchyk et al., 2016</xref>) that the precise start site of genomic RNA affects its ability to dimerize; our data suggest that the specific interaction of HIV-1 Gag with HIV-1 Ψ is enhanced by dimerization of the RNA, and would thus, in a genomic RNA molecule, be influenced by the base at which synthesis of a given RNA molecule was initiated.</p><p>What can these results tell us about the mechanism of selective gRNA packaging in vivo? Taken together, the data show that while Gag has similar affinities for different RNAs at near-physiological ionic strength, there are striking differences in the character of the binding: interaction with Ψ-containing RNA has a much larger specific, non-electrostatic component than that with the control RNAs. In addition, the cellular environment could certainly affect Gag-RNA and Gag-Gag interactions in profound ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Becker and Sherer, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lingappa et al., 2014</xref>), thus allowing for highly specific interactions with the gRNA. We have, however, suggested that Ψ-specific interactions could lower the energetic barrier required to nucleate particle assembly more efficiently than binding to other RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Comas-Garcia et al., 2016</xref>). This would explain selective packaging and is also consistent with the fact that in the absence of the gRNA, Gag assembles into particles and packages cellular RNAs. It is also consonant with data implying that the dimeric HIV-1 Ψ supports virion assembly more efficiently than cellular RNAs in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nikolaitchik et al., 2013</xref>).

For the competition experiments, the yeast tRNAs (Sigma-Aldrich, Stl Louis, MO USA) were incubated with the protein for about 10–20 min before the labeled RNAs were added (unless indicated otherwise). In all cases the tRNAs were added in a 50:1 (wt/wt) tRNA:RNA ratio. In all experiments the final concentration of the viral-derived RNAs was 15 nM. The samples were protected from the light whenever possible. The reactions were incubated in the dark overnight at 4°C. Each plot represents one experiment, but each experiment was performed at least twice. In the diffusion plots, the symbols and error bars represent the mean and standard deviation of 10 measurements.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and data analysis</title><p>All FCS measurements were done in a custom-made dual-color FCS instrument built around an inverted Olympus IX71 microscope with a UPLSAPO water immersion objective (60X, 1.2 NA, Olympus Corp. of Americas, Center Valley, PA USA) and with custom-designed optics. The emission fluorescence was detected using Single Photon Counting Module (SPCM-AQRH-16-FC, Excelitas Tech. Corp., Waltham, MA USA) through a multimode optical fiber that acted as a pin-hole. The Transistor-Transistor logic signal (TTL) high output from the SPCMs was collected using a 32-bit, 100Mhz counter card (PCIe-6323, National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA). An in-house LabView based control and acquisition interface was used for timestamping the photons and intensity trajectories were analyzed off-line to generate the autocorrelation curves. For the FCS measurements a 5 μL aliquot was placed between two 30 mm round glass slides (No. 1.5) and sealed with a 1 mm silicone sheet. All measurements were done at room temperature. Before starting the measurements, the FCS setup was calibrated by using a solution containing 10 nM Alexa Fluor 647. There are several diffusion coefficients reported for Alexa Fluor 647; therefore, we measured the diffusion coefficient of a AF647-labeled protein with known diffusion coefficient (lysozyme) to estimate the proper diffusion coefficient of the dye (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Based on these results we used a value of 300 μm<sup>2</sup>/s for the diffusion coefficient of Alexa Fluor 647 to calculate the confocal volume. It should be pointed out that both of the values for the diffusion of dye gave diffusion coefficients for the lysozyme that are greater than the reported values (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This implies that the diffusion coefficients that we are reporting for the RNA and Gag/RNA complexes are somewhat larger than they should be. The data was acquired for 10–20 s and each sample was measured at least 10 times. The data was binned at 1 MHz and the autocorrelation curves were fitted using the QtiPlot 0.9.9-rc15 software (Ion Vassilief, ProIndep Serv, Craiova, Romania). The details of the mathematical models used to describe the autocorrelation curves and to generate and fit the binding plots are in the supplementary information. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b</xref> shows the normalized autocorrelation function of Alexa Fluor 488-labeled HIV-1 WT Δp6 Gag (at 300 nM). The diffusion coefficient for Gag measured by FCS is ≈106 μm<sup>2</sup>/s, thus by using the Stokes-Einstein equation (which assumes a spherical volume) we obtained a hydrodynamic radius (<bold><italic>R<sub>h</sub></italic></bold>) ≈2.5 nm. Further, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> shows the normalized autocorrelation functions for the monomeric and dimeric HIV-1 Ψ, GRPE and MoMLV Ψ RNAs (panels A, B, C and D, respectively). The fact that the value of these autocorrelation functions, at lag times where large aggregates are to be expected (lag times between 0.01 and 0.1 s) is zero indicates that at 15 nM these RNAs do not form irreversible aggregates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="s4-7-1"><title>Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and data analysis</title><p>The autocorrelation function, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, can be written as:<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo><mml:mi>χ</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>The photo-physical properties of the fluorophores contribute to fluorescence fluctuations on time scales much faster than the characteristic diffusion time of macromolecules, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>&lt;&lt;</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>.

These two equations were used to obtain the fitting parameters for the shallow and steep slopes.</p><p>It should be noted that, because of the nature of the interaction of protein with the fluorophore, the quenching is all-or-none. That is, as mentioned in the main text, excitation of Cy5 induces a reversible conversion to a completely non-fluorescent state, evidently stabilized by steric interactions in the Gag-RNA complexes. This is distinct from the quenching experienced by many fluorophores, in which there is a change in emission spectra or the relaxation time of the dye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Levitus and Ranjit, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stennett et al., 2014</xref>). Since the conversion is all-or-none, there is a direct, linear relationship between the number of molecules quenched and the decrease in total fluorescence. Moreover, quenching eventually reaches a plateau, where further addition of Gag protein has no further effect on fluorescence; we interpret this to mean that at this plateau, all the RNA molecules are bound by one or more Gag molecules. This stoichiometry is taken as 100% bound RNA in the Gag titrations. Although these are the only assumptions we used in converting the quenching data into binding plots, it should be noted that a model positing cooperative binding gave a far better fit to the binding data than other models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2 – figure supplementary 1</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Binding model of the salt titrations</title><p>To explain the concave or ‘upward bent’ shape of these salt titrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>) we generated a simple model (blue line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) in which the salt titration data for SSHC Gag/Ψ<sub>2</sub> (black circles) was used to approximate the pure electrostatic component of binding of WT Gag to the dimeric Ψ (black line). The salt titration data for WT Gag/Ψ<sub>2</sub> (red circles) was used to represent the sum of both electrostatic and non-electrostatic interactions (red line).</p><p>This model assumes that there are two binding modes. In the first (lower salt) binding mode (I) the interaction between WT Gag and the dimeric Ψ is mostly non-electrostatic (solid green line). This assumption is based on the facts that between 0.2 and 0.4 M NaCl the salt-sensitivity of binding is minimal and that disruption of the zinc fingers (in SSHC Gag) greatly increases the salt sensitivity of binding. In the second binding mode (II) we assumed that the salt-dependent conformational change in Gag gradually reduces the strength of the non-electrostatic interaction (broken green line). This assumption is based on the high salt-sensitivity of this second binding mode.</p><p>To model the experimental data, measured affinity at each salt concentration was taken to be the sum of the electrostatic component (black line, taken from SSHC Gag binding) and a hypothetical non-electrostatic interaction (green line). In the first binding mode (I), the weighted sum of these two interactions was adjusted so that it produced the same slope and intercept as the experimental data; the weight of the non-electrostatic interactions was greater than the electrostatic one and both contributions were kept constant. In the second binding mode (II), the weight of the non-electrostatic interactions was reduced. The ratio of each interaction with respect of each other was chosen to obtain a slope and intercept similar to the experimental data.</p><p>It is important to point out that the goal of this model is not to fit the experimental data but to show that the concave or ‘upward bent’ shape of the salt-titrations indicates that binding of Gag to RNAs has a significant non-electrostatic component and that the strength of this interaction varies as the salt concentration is increased.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the NIH, National Cancer Institute, Center for Cancer Research; in part with funds from the Intramural AIDS Targeted Antiviral Therapy program; and in part with Federal funds from the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, National Institutes of Health, under contract HHSN26120080001E.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Gisela Storz (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jeremy Luban (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. In addition to the essential revisions noted below, it will be important for the Board and reviewers to understand the importance of the new conclusions you wish to draw.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper reports a variety of experiments that score Gag-RNA interactions, as measured by a fluorescence quenching assay, that probe the selectivity of Gag for the viral gRNA, as occurs in assembling virions. This area has a long history, but there remain unanswered questions about this selectivity. The work is carefully done and clearly explained. There are few dramatic new findings: most of the results are confirming earlier work, albeit with better readouts. There are new results concerning Gag-Gag interactions and effects of Gag mutations. Studies of the RNA are not included, except to test monomer and dimer RNAs.</p><p>The major gorilla-in-the-room problem is the high background of nonspecific binding manifest in Gag: in many simple in vitro binding experiments, no high selectivity is observed. Here we see that binding at physiological salts again shows no selectivity. Adding competitor tRNA reveals selectivity for short RNAs containing the packaging sequences, (as per earlier work). Mutations that reduce Gag-RNA interactions (MA mutations) help in revealing some selectivity. We now also learn that mutations in Gag that reduce Gag-Gag interactions (CA mutations) reveal some small selectivity, which is enhanced by addition of competitor. The nonspecific binding, and not the specific binding, seems to involve Gag-Gag multimers: Gag mutants with reduced Gag-Gag binding revealed a modest reduction in nonspecific binding (though only 2.5x), and no change in Gag-gRNA binding. High salt also reveals selectivity, phenocopying the CA mutations. The relevant salt concentrations tread a narrow window ledge of enhancing selective binding before all binding is lost.</p><p>The assays (by detecting changes in diffusion coefficient) show a new phenomenon going on in Gag binding: the condensation or &quot;collapse&quot; of the RNA. The Gag binding to nonspecific RNAs seems to induce this more effectively. It is unclear exactly what this means, and in particular how many Gags per RNA are involved.</p><p>All told these are nice data on a long-standing problem. The bottom line: revealing selective binding requires careful control of the conditions and settings. There are some new conclusions, if no groundbreaking upheavals of dogma.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>A number of clarifications, listed below, are in order:</p><p>1) Reagent validation: Although the lab has much experience in the purification of RNAs and Gag proteins, supplementary figures introduced at the beginning of the Results section to validate the reagents would be desirable. For RNAs, native gels would be useful. For proteins, gels of WT and mutant Gag proteins also would be useful. I'm less concerned about protein purity than about how much protein has aggregated or oligomerized irreversibly at the storage concentration of 20-40 uM.</p><p>2) MLV Psi analysis: As a dimeric RNA control, did the authors test a MLV Psi2 dimer ligand in their studies? If so, what were the results?</p><p>3) Fraction RNA bound calculation: As far as I can tell from Equation 8, the authors are assuming a linear proportionality of Gag binding to fluorophore quenching, i.e., that binding multiple Gag proteins to an RNA does not have a disproportionate quenching effect relative to binding a single Gag protein. If I am incorrect, the authors might add an explanatory sentence in the data analysis section. If the authors are assuming a linear proportionality, it would be helpful to know why this assumption is correct.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>: Relative to the HIV Psi1, MLV Psi, and GRPE ligands, the fitting of the cooperative binding curve to the diffusion data for the HIV Psi2 ligand appears to be poor.

These gels show that the in vitro transcripts are intact, without significant levels of early-termination products or degradation products. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1— figure supplement 1B</xref> shows a native gel as suggested by the reviewer, showing that the RNA is not aggregating significantly, even after being incubated for dimerization.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref> shows data from analytical ultracentrifugation of Gag at 1 μM. This protein was stored at 20 μM, thawed and diluted to 1 μM. This data shows that 97% of the absorbance corresponds to a sedimentation coefficient expected for monomeric Gag. Furthermore, it shows that there are no detectable aggregates due to freezing/thawing cycles.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref> shows the normalized autocorrelation function of Alexa Fluor 488-labeled HIV-1 WT Δp6 Gag (at 300 nM). As in the case of the RNAs the autocorrelation function shows that at this protein concentration there are no detectable aggregates that could have been produced during freezing. The diffusion coefficient for Gag measured by FCS is ≈ 106 μm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2</xref></sup>/s, thus by using the Stokes-Einstein equation (which assumes a spherical volume) we obtained a hydrodynamic radius (<bold><italic>R<sub>h</sub></italic></bold>) ≈ 2.5 nm. This shows that at under these experimental conditions Gag is monomeric and that there is no significant aggregation in solution. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref> shows a 4-12% NuPAPGE SDS-PAGE gel for WT and all the mutant Gag proteins.</p><p>Further, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> shows the normalized autocorrelation functions for the monomeric and dimeric HIV-1 Ψ, GRPE and MoMLV Ψ (panels A, B, C and D, respectively). The fact that the value of autocorrelation functions at lag times where large aggregates are to be expected (Lag times between 0.01 and 0.1 s) is zero indicates that at 15 nM these RNAs do not form irreversible aggregates that could have been caused by freezing and thawing cycles or by the RNA dimerization protocol.</p><p>Finally, this information has been added to the Materials and methods section (subsection “RNA in vitro transcription and RNA labeling”, subsection “Protein expression and purification”, and subsection “Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and data analysis”).</p><p><italic>2) MLV Psi analysis: As a dimeric RNA control, did the authors test a MLV Psi2 dimer ligand in their studies? If so, what were the results?</italic> </p><p>We did not test dimeric MoMLV Ψ in our studies. The main reason for this was that even for HIV-1 Ψ the difference in the binding character between monomeric and dimeric RNAs was small. In fact, the only condition where the monomeric HIV-1 Ψ showed a significantly impaired binding character was in the tRNA competition experiments using WM Gag. This has been addressed in the fifteenth paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p><italic>3) Fraction RNA bound calculation: As far as I can tell from Equation 8, the authors are assuming a linear proportionality of Gag binding to fluorophore quenching, i.e., that binding multiple Gag proteins to an RNA does not have a disproportionate quenching effect relative to binding a single Gag protein. If I am incorrect, the authors might add an explanatory sentence in the data analysis section. If the authors are assuming a linear proportionality, it would be helpful to know why this assumption is correct.</italic> </p><p>This is a crucial question. Our answer has two parts. First, because of the nature of the interaction of protein with the fluorophore, the quenching is all-or-none. That is, as mentioned in the manuscript (Results, third paragraph), excitation of Cy5 induces a reversible conversion to a completely non-fluorescent state, evidently stabilized by steric interactions in the Gag-RNA complexes. This is distinct from the quenching experienced by many fluorophores, in which there is a change in emission spectra or the relaxation time of the dye (see Levitus and Ranjit, 2011 and Stennett, Ciuba and Levitus 2014). Since the conversion is all-or-none, there is a direct, linear relationship between the number of molecules quenched and the decrease in total fluorescence.</p><p>The second part of the answer is to point out that the quenching eventually reaches a plateau, where further addition of Gag protein has no further effect on fluorescence; we interpret this to mean that at this plateau, all the RNA molecules are bound by one or more Gag molecules. This stoichiometry is taken as 100% bound RNA in the Gag titrations. Although these are the only assumptions we used in converting the quenching data into binding plots, it should be noted that a model positing cooperative binding gave a far better fit to the binding data than other models (Figure 1—figure supplement 6).</p><p>We have discussed these aspects of the data analysis in the Supplementary Information subsection “Fluorescence spectroscopy and data analysis”.</p><p><italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>: Relative to the HIV Psi1, MLV Psi, and GRPE ligands, the fitting of the cooperative binding curve to the diffusion data for the HIV Psi2 ligand appears to be poor. Why?</italic> </p><p>This is probably because the number of data points in the sigmoidal portion of the curve is very small. This increases the error of the fit. This issue has been addressed in the last paragraph of the subsection “Gag binding causes RNA collapse”.</p><p><italic>5) <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>: The authors have tended to ignore observed fluctuations in the Hill coefficients (nH) and, for the most part, seem to equate every nH of over 1.7 as being roughly equivalent. Is this the case? If not, the authors should explain why tRNA addition decreases the nH of WT Gag binding to HIV Psi1, but increases the nH of WM Gag binding to the same ligand. Other nH variations on the table also should be addressed.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers are correct that we have not distinguished between the different n<sub>H</sub> values we obtained. We acknowledge the imprecision in the measurements and note this in the last paragraph of the subsection “Gag binds to RNAs with high affinity but low specificity”.</p><p><italic>6) tRNA effect on D: The fact that tRNA addition marginally affected WT Gag binding to HIV Psi2, but also reduced &quot;RNA collapse&quot; is consistent with the binding of tRNAs to Gag-HIV Psi2 complexes (subsection “tRNAs reduce the degree of Gag-induced RNA collapse”), but a model for what is happening ought to be included in the Discussion.</italic> </p><p>We have added the following model to the Discussion: “It was interesting to note that the presence of excess yeast tRNA greatly reduced the magnitude of RNA collapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is even true with 8N Gag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), for which binding per seis almost unaffected by tRNA addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). These observations suggest that tRNA is incorporated into the complexes of Gag and tagged RNA, reducing compaction, viaone or more Gag domains other than MA.”</p><p><italic>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1A and 1C</xref>: Why is the Kd of the 8N Gag mutant for HIV Psi2 at 500 mM so much better than the Kd of WT Gag?</italic> </p><p>We have added the following explanation to the Discussion section: “It is somewhat surprising that the apparent affinity of 8N Gag for the dimeric HIV-1 Ψ between 500 and 550 mM NaCl is greater than that of WT Gag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s3">Figure 9—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, the interaction of the WT MA domain with RNAs is presumably almost exclusively electrostatic and is thus negligible at these high salt concentrations; we surmise that under these conditions, repulsion between positively charged WT MA domains of two or more RNA-bound Gag molecules raises the energetic cost of RNA-binding, and that this repulsion is reduced by the 8N mutations.”</p><p><italic>8) Defining the 310, SSHC, and 8N/WM mutants: This should be done in the first paragraph of the subsection “Decreasing NC-RNA or Gag-Gag interactions reveals specific binding at slightly higher than physiological salt concentrations”.</italic></p><p>We have now introduced these mutants in the first paragraph of the subsection “Decreasing NC-RNA or Gag-Gag interactions reveals specific binding at slightly higher than physiological salt concentrations”.</p><p><italic>9) WT Gag-HIV Psi2 binding complexes: Have the authors performed sedimentation or other experiments to determine the Gag:RNA stoichiometries?</italic> </p><p>We have not performed such experiments. The problem is that sedimentation experiments, as well as most biophysical techniques, require higher Gag concentrations; at these concentrations the Gag/RNA complexes will associate into virus-like-particles. We have addressed this at the beginning of the Results section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
