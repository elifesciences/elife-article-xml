multiple highly sophisticated immune evasion strategies. This includes the evasion from antibody mediated immune control by counteracting host Fc-gamma receptor (FcγR) mediated immune control mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). We have previously shown that HCMV avoids FcγR activation by concomitant expression of the viral Fc-gamma-binding glycoproteins (vFcγRs) gp34 and gp68. We now show that gp34 and gp68 bind IgG simultaneously at topologically different Fcγ sites and achieve efficient antagonization of host FcγR activation by distinct but synergizing mechanisms. While gp34 enhances immune complex internalization, gp68 acts as inhibitor of host FcγR binding to immune complexes. In doing so, gp68 induces Fcγ accessibility to gp34 and simultaneously limits host FcγR recognition. The synergy of gp34 and gp68 is compelled by the interfering influence of excessive non-immune IgG ligands and highlights conformational changes within the IgG globular chains critical for antibody effector function.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Human cytomegalovirus is a type of herpes virus that rarely causes symptoms in healthy people but can cause serious complications in unborn babies and in people with compromised immune systems, such as transplant recipients.</p><p>The virus has found ways to successfully evade the immune system, and once infected, the body retains the virus for life.

A hallmark of cytomegalovirus infection is the establishment of a lifelong persistence with recurring phases of latency and reactivation of productive infection and horizontal spread in presence of adaptive immune responses. HCMV encodes the largest known transcriptome of human viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stern-Ginossar et al., 2012</xref>), giving rise to an equally large antigenic proteome including a huge and varied arsenal of immunoevasins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berry et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hengel et al., 1998</xref>) that counteract immune recognition of infected cells facilitating virus persistence, shedding, and superinfection of sero-positive hosts. While primary HCMV infection of healthy individuals usually remains undetected, it can cause severe symptoms in the immunocompromised. Besides antiviral therapy involving nucleotide analogs, concentrated HCMV-immune IgG preparations (e.g. Cytotect) are used to prevent infection of immunocompromised patients including the prevention of congenital infection in primary infected pregnant women with varying degrees of success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kagan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Revello et al., 2014</xref>). Generally, HCMV is observed to withstand a humoral immunity even replicating and disseminating in the presence of highly neutralizing immune sera in vitro and clinical isolates of HCMV tend to disseminate via cell-to-cell spread, thus avoiding an encounter with neutralizing antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Falk et al., 2018</xref>). This, however, cannot fully explain the resistance of HCMV to a humoral response leading to virus dissemination across several organs. Notably, HCMV encodes a set of Fcγ-binding glycoproteins (viral FcγRs, vFcγRs) that have been shown to antagonize host FcγR activation by immune IgG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Corrales-Aguilar et al., 2014b</xref>). In this previous study, we showed that HCMV gp34, gp68 and HSV-1 gE/gI efficiently antagonize the activation of human FcγRs. By attacking the conserved Fc part of IgG, HSV-1 and HCMV are able to counteract potent antiviral immune responses including antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). As it has become increasingly evident that Fcγ mediated immune control is essential not only for the effectiveness of non-neutralizing but also neutralizing IgG antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DiLillo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Forthal et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Horwitz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Van den Hoecke et al., 2017</xref>), a mechanistic and causal analysis of this evasion process is highly warranted in the pursuit of better antibody based intervention strategies targeting herpesviruses and HCMV in particular. While several herpesviruses encode vFcγRs, HCMV is the only virus known so far that encodes more than one individual molecule with the capacity to bind Fcγ. Specifically, HCMV encodes four distinct molecules which share this ability: gp68 (<italic>UL119-118</italic>), gp34 (<italic>RL11</italic>), gp95 (<italic>RL12</italic>), and gpRL13 (<italic>RL13</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atalay et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Corrales-Aguilar et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cortese et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sprague et al., 2008</xref>). Turning to other species, mouse CMV (MCMV) encoded m138 has been shown to bind Fcγ, yet it has more prominently been associated with a variety of unrelated functions proving m138 not to be a strict homolog of the HCMV counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arapović et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lenac et al., 2006</xref>). We recently found Rhesus CMV (RhCMV) to encode an Fcγ-binding protein in the <italic>Rh05</italic> gene (<italic>RL11</italic> gene family) seemingly more closely related to its HCMV analog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kolb et al., 2019</xref>). This is supported by the fact that gpRh05, as HCMV vFcγRs gp34 and gp68, is able to generically antagonize activation of all macaque FcγRs. While it is clear that by targeting the invariant part of the key molecule of the humoral immune response, vFcγRs have the potential to manipulate a multitude of antibody mediated immune functions, their role in vivo has yet to be determined. While the function of HCMV vFcγRs gp34 and gp68 as antagonists of host FcγRs has been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Corrales-Aguilar et al., 2014b</xref>), the underlying mechanism(s) had not been addressed yet. In recent years it has been shown that gp68 and gp34 are able to engage in antibody bipolar bridging (ABB) forming ternary complexes consisting of antigen, antibody, and vFcγR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Corrales-Aguilar et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Corrales-Aguilar et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sprague et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, gp68 has been shown to bind IgG in a 2:1 ratio and has the ability to internalize and translocate IgG to lysosomal compartments, while gp34 has been shown to form predominantly homo-dimeric structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ndjamen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sprague et al., 2008</xref>). However, no studies have yet been performed in the context of HCMV infection investigating the coincident disposition of gp34 and gp68 at the plasma membrane and their functional interaction during the early and late phase of HCMV replication. Here, we show gp34 and gp68 to antagonize host FcγR activation by distinct but highly cooperative modes of Fcγ targeting, leading to efficient evasion from antibody mediated immune control by division of labor.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>gp34 and gp68 simultaneously bind to distinct regions on IgG. gp68 binding to IgG has been mapped to the CH2–CH3 interdomain region of Fcγ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sprague et al., 2008</xref>). Accordingly, in a first experiment we set out to narrow down the contact site of gp34 on IgG utilizing a methodology previously used to characterize HSV-1 gE and HCMV gp68 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sprague et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sprague et al., 2008</xref>). To this end we infected CV-1 cells with recombinant vaccinia viruses (rVACV) encoding either human FcγRIIA, FcγRI or HCMV vFcγRs gp34 and gp68 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sprague et al., 2008</xref>). After metabolic [<sup>35</sup>S]-Met/Cys labeling, Fcγ-binding proteins were precipitated from cell lysates using CNBr-Sepharose coupled with human IgG1-Fc in its wild-type form (wtFc) or as a mutated variant (nbFc) with a scrambled CH2–CH3 interdomain amino acid sequence designed and provided by P. Bjorkman (Caltech, California, USA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sprague et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sprague et al., 2008</xref>). Expectedly, gp68 was only able to bind wtFc but not nbFc whereas gp34, comparable to human FcγRI, retained binding to both wtFc and nbFc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). While the high affinity FcγRI does not require the CH2–CH3 region to bind to the lower hinge of IgG, FcγRIIA and FcγRIII show lower affinity to monomeric IgG and utilize additional distinct residues for binding to Fcγ, which include the CH2 region adjacent to the lower hinge region of IgG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shields et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sprague et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wines et al., 2000</xref>). Consequently, FcγRII exhibited reduced binding to nbFc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Since gp34 showed intact binding similar to host FcγRI but not FcγRIIA we surmised that gp34 binding involves the hinge region of monomeric IgG. To validate this assumption further gp34 binding to a variant form of hIgG1 with point mutations in the lower hinge region (Leu234Ala and Leu235Ala, named LALA) exhibiting deficient interaction with human FcγRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hessell et al., 2007</xref>) was analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Cell lysates were incubated with either B12 wild-type antibody recognizing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-encoded gp120 or a B12-LALA variant. PGS-precipitation of FcγRI/CD64, exclusively recognizing the hinge region on IgG, was almost abrogated by the mutations in the LALA variant. Similarly, gp34 was sensitive to the mutations, albeit to a lower extent than FcγRI/CD64. As expected, the interaction of gp68 with B12 was unaffected by the LALA point mutations. Next, as gp34 and gp68 recognize non-overlapping regions on IgG we set out to test, if both molecules are able to simultaneously associate with IgG. To this end, we generated C-terminal His- or strep-tagged variants of gp34 and gp68 that lack their respective transmembrane and cytosolic domains (soluble gp34 and gp68, or sgp34 and sgp68). These proteins were produced by transfected 293 T cells and secreted into the cell culture supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Supernatants of sgp34 and sgp68 producing cells were mixed with humanized anti-hCD20 IgG1 (Rituximab, or Rtx) before being precipitated via Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA-Sepharose beads. A non-Fcγ-binding point mutant of sgp34 (sgp34mtrp, W65F mutation) was identified and used as a control molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). When precipitating His-tagged sgp68 in the presence of monomeric IgG, we observed co-precipitation of sgp34 but no co-precipitation of sgp34mtrp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To further substantiate this observation, we designed an ELISA based setup using the same supernatants as above and performed the assay as depicted schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>. In brief, titrated amounts of strep-tagged sgp34 or sgp34mtrp were immobilized on a 96-well adsorption plate (1° vFcγR) via pre-coated biotin. 1° vFcγRs were then incubated with either Rtx (IgG1) or a Rtx IgA isotype and incubated with His6-tagged sgp68 followed by detection with an anti-His-HRP antibody. Here, we observed dose-dependent binding of sgp68 to titrated amounts of immobilized sgp34. sgp68 could only be detected in the presence of IgG1 but not IgA. Furthermore, sgp68 binding in the presence of IgG1 and sgp34mtrp in this setup does not exceed background levels. Taken together, we conclude that gp34 and gp68 are able to simultaneously bind to IgG with gp34 binding to the upper hinge region and gp68 binding to the CH2–CH3 interface domain on IgG.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>gp34 and gp68 simultaneously bind to IgG using distinct epitopes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) CV-1 cells were infected with rVACVs expressing gp34, gp68, or the host Fc-receptors FcγRIIA and FcγRI at a multiplicity of infection of 4 for 14 hr before metabolic labeling.

As gp34 and gp68 appear to have a redundant inhibitory function and are able to simultaneously bind to IgG we utilized a previously established FcγR activation assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Corrales-Aguilar et al., 2013</xref>) to assess their ability to antagonize FcγR activation individually or in combination.

Due to remarkably low conservation of <italic>RL12</italic> across HCMV strains, we focused on the well-conserved and previously described vFcγRs gp34 and gp68. Infected cells were incubated with titrated amounts of a HCMV-IgG hyperimmunoglobulin preparation (Cytotect) and co-cultured with BW5147 reporter cells expressing human FcγRIIIA as a chimeric molecule providing the ectodomain of the FcγR fused to the transmembrane domain and cytosolic tail of mouse CD3ξ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Corrales-Aguilar et al., 2013</xref>).

In line with previously published observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Corrales-Aguilar et al., 2014b</xref>) we found that FcγRIIIA activation is antagonized efficiently by a virus co-expressing both gp34 and gp68 while viruses expressing either gp34 or gp68 show only minor or no antagonistic potential when compared with a mutant lacking all vFcγRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The extent of FcγR antagonization is visualized by area under curve (AUC) comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> bottom panel). This showed no statistically significant effect for singular vFcγRs, but a strong and significant antagonization by both vFcγRs in combination. To further confirm this key finding we measured degranulation of primary NK cells in response to vFcγR expression to assess antagonization of ADCC. Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) from three donors were incubated with HCMV-infected opsonized human fibroblasts generated as above and CD107a positivity of NK cells was measured after 6 hr of co-culture. In line with the reporter cell assay, primary NK cell activation in response to target cells decorated with anti-HCMV antibodies was antagonized by a virus expressing both gp34 and gp68 with high significance, while the mutant viruses lacking gp34 or gp68 showed drastically lower antagonistic potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

When comparing the amino acid sequences of the cytosolic domains of gp34 and gp68 it is revealed that both molecules encode distinct sorting motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atalay et al., 2002</xref>) (source: AD169 pBAC-2 sequence). The cytosolic tail of gp68 harbors an YXXΦ motif seven aa downstream of the transmembrane domain. Such a motif has been described as a marker for lysosomal targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bonifacino and Traub, 2003</xref>) and is in line with the lysosomal translocation of gp68 shown in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sprague et al., 2008</xref>). In HCMV gB, a non-Fcγ-binding HCMV encoded envelope glycoprotein, the location of two such motifs is further away from the transmembrane domain indicating it being destined for general endocytosis rather than immediate degradation, which is shared by another HCMV vFcγR, gpRL13, found primarily in intracellular compartments as well as HSV-1 gE, forming a heterodimeric gE/gI vFcγR described to internalize IgG and recycle back to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bonifacino and Traub, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cortese et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ndjamen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sprague et al., 2004</xref>). Conversely, the cytosolic tail of gp34 encodes a di-leucine [D/E]XXX[LL/LI] motif which we find to be unique among surface-resident vFcγRs. Therefore we suspected gp34 and gp68 to possess different dynamics regarding IC internalization. As internalization studies in the context of HCMV infection proved not to be feasible due to lacking gp34- and gp68-specific antibodies for tracing, we aimed to establish a gain-of-function cell-based experimental model. To this end, we characterized the surface dynamics of vFcγR expressing transfected 293 T cells stably expressing a model antigen (hCD20) recognized by Rituximab (RTX). In order to manipulate internalization, we chose to replace the transmembrane and cytosolic domains of gp34 and gp68 with the according sequences from human CD4 (hCD4) as it contains a non-canonical di-leucine-based sorting motif (SQIKRLL) in its C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (CD4-tailed). To be recognized by AP-2 the serine residue upstream of the di-leucine motif in hCD4 needs to be phosphorylated in order to mimic the negatively charged glutamate or aspartate residues of a classical di-leucine motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pitcher et al., 1999</xref>). In a first experiment we ensured equal expression of the transfected constructs utilizing the polycistronic expression of GFP from a pIRES_eGFP expression vector to gate on transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). GFP-positive cells were also detected for Fcγ binding by a surface stain using a PE-TexasRed conjugated human Fcγ fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This revealed that upon recombinant expression, surface exposition of Fcγ binding gp68 is drastically increased when CD4-tailed although overall protein expression was comparable and all constructs bear original signal peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This can be attributed to the abrogation of its internalization evidenced by the fact that internalization of complete IC was drastically reduced with CD4-tailed gp68 when tracking hCD20/Rtx ICs using pulse-chase flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Conversely, while gp34 showed only mild differences in surface exposition when altered in the same way (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), it proved to rapidly internalize complete Rtx-CD20 IC only with its native cytosolic tail intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Given that both molecules spontaneously internalize non-immune IgG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), this could hint at different routes of trafficking following internalization. Specifically, as it has been shown that gp68 internalizes IgG-Fc translocating to the lysosomal compartment for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ndjamen et al., 2016</xref>), the difference seen for gp34 here suggests a recycling route as described for HSV-1 gE/gI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ndjamen et al., 2014</xref>). Further, while we also observe gp34 to more efficiently internalize even non-immune IgG, the still rapid internalization of non-immune IgG by gp68 seems not to translate to the internalization of IC regarding efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), again in line with a previously published observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ndjamen et al., 2016</xref>).

Therefore, we next set out to test if the antagonizing effect of membrane-resident gp68 on FcγR activation can be attributed to a block of host FcγR binding to cell surface IC rather than IC internalization. To test this hypothesis, we established a flow cytometry based assay using vFcγR transfected 293 T-CD20 cells opsonized with Rtx and assayed for FcγR binding using soluble His-tagged ectodomains of human FcγRs, which are sequence identical between FcγRs IIIA and IIIB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In this assay we compared gp34 and gp68 regarding their ability to interfere with FcγR binding to cell surface IC. Advantageously, CD4-tailed vFcγRs, besides circumventing confounding effects of internalization on our binding assay, closely mimic the relative surface density of gp34 and gp68 found on the plasma membrane of an HCMV-infected cell judged by human Fcγ binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Corrales-Aguilar et al., 2014b</xref>). To ensure equal density of antigen upon recombinant vFcγR expression, CD20 levels were directly measured and found only in the case of CD99 expression to be slightly reduced, which served as a non-Fcγ-binding control molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We found gp68 but not gp34 to significantly reduce binding of FcγRIIIA to cell surface immune complexes compared to CD99 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This finding can be explained with certain CH2–CH3 region residues of IgG playing a subordinate, yet significant role in FcγRIII binding to IgG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shields et al., 2001</xref>). Additionally, we found the effect of gp68 to be dependent on the accessibility of the CH2–CH3 interface region on IgG as pre-incubation with Protein G prevented the inhibition by gp68 and fully restored FcγRIIIA binding to Rtx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). These observations further narrow down the binding region of gp68 to involve the above-mentioned residues as opposed to Protein G which has been shown to not interact with these residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sauer-Eriksson et al., 1995</xref>). Finally, this conclusion is further substantiated by our observation that FcγRI, which binds to IgG independently of the above-mentioned residues in the CH2–CH3 interdomain region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shields et al., 2001</xref>), is not blocked by gp68 or gp34 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>gp68 blocks binding of human FcγRIII to immune complexes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) 293 T-CD20 cells were transfected with indicated constructs encoded on a pIRES_eGFP vector.

Uniformity of HCMV antigen expression and differential surface Fcγ binding indicating vFcγR expression between the different virus mutants was assured using a F(ab’)<sub>2</sub> preparation of purified human IgG containing HCMV-specific IgG, Cytotect, or a conjugated human Fcγ fragment (human Fcγ-Texas Red, TR), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). FcγR binding to opsonized-infected cells was detected by flow cytometry as described above and schematically depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>. Expectedly, as we observed stronger Fcγ binding to cells infected with gp68 proficient viruses compared to a gp34 expressing virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), we also found more total IgG bound to the surface of cells infected with a gp68 expressing HCMV virus compared to a gp34 expressing virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, upper panel). Along these lines, we find FcγRIII to bind gp68-bound non-immune IgG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), albeit at a markedly lower rate compared to immune IgG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) in line with FcγRs naturally showing higher affinity toward antigen-bound IgG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bruhns et al., 2009</xref>). As the Cytotect formulation contains an abundance of non-immune IgG, binding of host FcγR ectodomains as shown exemplarily in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> (lower panel) was normalized to levels of total surface bound IgG within each experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, upper panel). Evaluating the results from three independent experiments performed with independent virus preparations confirmed a strong relative reduction in FcγRIIIA binding to opsonized HCMV-infected cells in the presence of gp68, but not gp34 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This finding is in line with our previous gain-of-function experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) again showing an approximate 60% reduction in FcγRIII binding. While not further elaborated on in this study, we also measured binding of FcγRs I, IIA, and IIB/C in the same setup and observed that binding of FcγRI was only slightly reduced in the presence of either vFcγR, but clearly reduced in the presence of both molecules. Conversely, gp68 showed a similar effect on FcγRs IIA and IIB/C as observed for FcγRIII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). This indicates a comparable antagonistic mechanism of gp68 on FcγRs IIA and IIB/C but shows again FcγRI to be more resistant to gp68.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Cooperative antagonization of FcγR activation is achieved by combining gp68-mediated block of FcγR binding and subsequent gp34 internalization</title><p>While we delineated distinct mechanisms by which gp34 or gp68 are able to counteract FcγRII/III activation, we did not observe efficient antagonization of FcγR function by gp34 or gp68 individually in the context of HCMV deletion mutant infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Therefore, we next wanted to test the antagonistic potential of gp68 or gp34 individually in the absence of non-immune IgG and in a gain-of-function setting. To this end, we conducted an FcγR activation assay with Hela cells co-transfected with Her2 as a model antigen and the indicated vFcγRs followed by incubation with titrated amounts of anti-Her2 IgG1 mAb (herceptin, Hc) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Using this approach, gp68 or gp34 individually confirmed to antagonize FcγRIII activation. However, the more membrane resident gp68-CD4 showed a markedly stronger antagonistic effect compared to gp68wt, indicating a more prominent membrane-residence of gp68 to be beneficial regarding evasion from FcγR recognition despite its lower capacity to internalize ICs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Conversely, when comparing unaltered gp34 to its less internalized gp34-CD4 variant we observed an opposite effect indicating internalization to be a major condition of gp34 driven antagonization of FcγR activation. Next, in an approach mimicking HCMV immune sera we tested if the addition of non-antigen-specific IgG impairs the antagonization of FcγR activation by gp34 or gp68. To this end, we added 10 µg/ml TNFα-specific Infliximab (Ifx) IgG1 given concomitantly with the reporter cells and graded amounts of Hc IgG1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This showed that indeed the presence of an excess of non-immune IgG interferes with both gp68 and gp34 antagonization in a dose-dependent manner. As ultrapure monomeric IgG does not activate the reporter cells on its own, shown by the samples that were treated only with Ifx but not Hc, this effect can be attributed to displacement of immune IgG from the vFcγRs resulting in restoration of FcγRIII activation. Synergism between gp34 and gp68 was optimal at a 100:1 ratio of non-immune Ifx over Hc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, right panel) indicating that vFcγRs are particularly adapted to work in the presence of excess non-immune IgG, supporting our previous observation with human hyperimmunoglobulin Cytotect (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). On the other hand, host FcγRs have been shown to bind IgG immune complexes with a higher affinity compared to monomeric IgG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bruhns et al., 2009</xref>), limiting the efficacy of monomeric IgG in attenuating FcγR activation. Finally, we addressed cooperative antagonization by gp34 and gp68 in a loss-of-function approach in the context of HCMV infection. When using the humanized anti-HCMV mAb MSL-109 targeting HCMV gH, we found that low gH levels expressed on the surface of HCMV-AD169-infected cell are insufficient to detect FcγR triggering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). To overcome this experimental problem, we generated Her2-expressing BJ fibroblasts exhibiting high levels of Her2 on the cell surface. Infected Her2 BJ fibroblasts were opsonized with titrated amounts of Herceptin before cells were analyzed by FcγRIIIA reporter cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Although not statistically significant, this approach clearly demonstrated that compared to our observations with hyperimmunoglobulin Cytotect (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), natively expressed gp34 as well as gp68 are able to antagonize FcγRIIIA activation individually. When both vFcγRs were expressed by HCMV-infected cells, a markedly stronger antagonistic effect was seen (p=0.0252).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>gp34 and gp68 synergistically antagonize.</title><p>FcγRIIIA in the absence and presence of non-immune IgG and show cooperativity. (<bold>A</bold>) Increased membrane-residence enhances antagonistic potential of gp68 and reduces antagonistic potential of gp34.

This left the puzzling question as to why HCMV (and cytomegaloviruses in general) have developed a whole arsenal of antagonists, unlike other viral and microbial pathogens with only singular Fc-binding glycoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berry et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Corrales-Aguilar et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Falugi et al., 2013</xref>). However, when carefully examining their effect in a loss-of-function approach based on opsonized cells infected with a complete set of targeted HCMV gene deletion mutants, we convinced ourselves that gp34 and gp68 actually depend on one another to efficiently antagonize NK cell degranulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This is explained by a number of individual features of gp34 and gp68 that only in conjunction can amount to antagonistic efficiency.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>gp34 efficiently internalizes IC</title><p>While we find both, gp34 and gp68, able to internalize monomeric IgG as well as IC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), gp34 consistently shows more rapid internalization compared to gp68 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Consequently exchange of the cytosolic domain of gp34 leads to strongly reduced internalization and subsequently to a reduction in FcγR antagonization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Looking closely at the cytosolic domains of all identified cytomegalovirus vFcγRs reveals a unique [D/E]XXX[LL/LI] cytosolic motif present in gp34. Conversely, the HCMV FcγRs gp68, gp95, and gpRL13 all share only a cytosolic YXXΦ motif, as the recently identified RhCMV encoded vFcγR gpRH05 (<italic>RL11</italic> gene family) and its homologs which are conserved in Old World monkey CMV species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kolb et al., 2019</xref>). Further comparing the cytosolic sorting motifs between other membrane-resident glycoproteins of HCMV it seems that the YXXΦ motif of gp68 fulfills a more general purpose of limiting the overall surface exposure of concerned HCMV antigens (examples listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Corrales-Aguilar et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ndjamen et al., 2016</xref>). While the YXXΦ motif of gp68 lies within seven aa distance to the transmembrane domain, in line with it being translocated to lysosomal compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bonifacino and Traub, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ndjamen et al., 2016</xref>), the YXXΦ motif is additionally linked to specific targeting functions. For example, HSV-1 gE has been shown to bind in a pH-dependent manner not observed for any other HCMV encoded vFcγR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sprague et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sprague et al., 2008</xref>) which fits to it being destined for recycling rather than degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ndjamen et al., 2014</xref>). This is in line with its YXXΦ motif being more distant to its transmembrane domain within around seven amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bonifacino and Traub, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similar membrane-distal YXXΦ motifs also exist in the cytosolic domains of HCMV encoded gpRL13 and gB, but not the model antigen Her2 which we explored in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, perhaps explaining the limited synergistic inhibition that was observed. These findings highlight the di-leucine motif found in gp34 to be unique among other surface-resident glycoproteins expressed by HCMV and all other vFcγRs known in CMV family members including RhCMV and MCMV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kolb et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Thäle et al., 1994</xref>). It remains to be explored as to what the further consequences of this seemingly unique internalization route is. However, as we also find gp34 to be incorporated into the virion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Reinhard, 2010</xref>) it is tempting to speculate that the potent internalization of IC via gp34 has an additional role besides evasion from antibody-mediated attack of an infected cell.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>gp68 blocks binding of FcγRs II and III to IC</title><p>Although we find gp34 to efficiently internalize ICs from the cell surface, it does not manipulate host FcγR binding to ICs. This is remarkable given our data showing that gp34 binds to the hinge region of monomeric IgG, but implying that gp34 is not able to directly compete with host FcγRs for binding to IC on the plasma membrane when co-expressed with a target antigen. Conversely, gp68 binding to the CH2–CH3 interface domain also occupies a region on Fcγ that includes residues involved in FcγRII and FcγRIII binding to Fcγ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shields et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sprague et al., 2008</xref>). This could explain the ability of gp68 to efficiently limit binding of FcγRs II and III to cell surface IC without directly competing for a shared binding region at the hinge region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). The subordinate role of the above-mentioned residues on IgG regarding FcγRIII binding further ties into the observation that the blocking effect of gp68 is not total but more in line with the reported reduction of FcγRIII binding to IgG being approximately 40–70% when these residues are manipulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shields et al., 2001</xref>). Conversely, gp68 not showing a similar efficiency in blocking FcγRI binding to IC further supports this conclusion as FcγRI binding does not require the above mentioned CH2–CH3 region residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shields et al., 2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>gp34 and gp68 cooperatively antagonize FcγR activation</title><p>Taken together, we conclude that neither gp68 nor gp34 individually are able to efficiently antagonize FcγR activation by IgG-opsonized viral antigens in the physiological context of HCMV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), that is, in the presence of non-immune IgG mitigating their inhibitory potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Our data provide evidence that gp68 rather functions to increase IC accessibility to gp34 leading to efficient internalization of IC, presumably by a repeating process of gp34 recycling. This is supported by our observation that the ectodomain of gp68 is sufficient to increase the antagonistic efficiency of gp34 regarding FcγR activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Further, gp34 and gp68 are co-expressed at the cell surface throughout the protracted HCMV replication cycle and show simultaneous Fcγ binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Our findings imply that gp68 binding, as it does not use the same region as host FcγRs, evolved to ensure a consistent and evolutionary less vulnerable way of shifting Fcγ accessibility in favor of gp34. The idea that gp68 has not evolved to directly compete with host receptors for IgG binding is also supported by the finding demonstrating gp68 to possess a lower affinity to Fcγ when binding in a 2:1 ratio compared to host FcγRIIIA (K<sub>D1</sub>:470 nM and K<sub>D2</sub>:1.600 nM vs 700 nM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sprague et al., 2008</xref>). The concept of gp68 driven accessibility shift also does not require gp68 to completely block FcγR binding to IC as subsequent gp34-driven internalization is a continuous and fast process.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Beyond NK cells</title><p>In this study we mainly focused on the mechanisms by which gp34 and gp68 cooperate to antagonize CD16/FcγRIII as the primary receptor on NK cells associated with ADCC, one of the most powerful mechanisms of antibody-mediated virus control. However, it is already known that HCMV vFcγRs also antagonize activation of FcγRIIA (CD32) and FcγRI (CD64) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Corrales-Aguilar et al., 2014b</xref>) and we also consistently observed antagonization of the only inhibitory FcγR, FcγRIIB (unpublished observation).

Taken together with the data shown in this study that the underlying mechanism seems to be related between FcγRs IIA/B and III, we also speculate that more Fcγ-binding host factors might be antagonized by similar mechanisms involving vFcγRs.

The fact that the interaction of gp34 and gp68 was analyzed in the absence of gp95 (RL12) and gpRL13 (RL13) is a major limitation of our study. Synergies between other or even all four vFcγRs are also conceivable and subject to further investigation. Altogether, our findings analyze the first mechanistic details of HCMV evasion from antibody-mediated control utilizing its vFcγR toolset. This deeper insight into the inner workings of such a process has consequences for the future evaluation and optimization of antibody-based treatment strategies targeting HCMV disease. In particular, our data will support the development of targeted intervention strategies that neutralize the function of gp34 and gp68, to increase the efficiency of IVIg treatment in the

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Päivi Ojala as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>All three reviewers agreed that this work is very solid and interesting, giving important novel insights into immune evasion strategies by Human Cytomegalovirus with a focus on evasion from antibody mediated immune control. The authors show that HCMV counteracts Fc-gamma receptor (FcγR) mediated immune control through the viral Fc-gamma binding glycoproteins (vFcγRs) gp34 and gp68. Those viral proteins bind IgG simultaneously at topologically different Fcγ sites, and thereby efficiently antagonize FcγR activation of the host.</p><p>During our internal discussion, all three reviewers also agreed that the manuscript text shows some clear limitations. The text either needs to be adjusted or, if the authors insist on the cooperativity between gp34 and gp68, additional experiments need to be performed as outlined by reviewers 1 and 2. We all agreed to leave this decision to the authors.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) The data presented in gp34 and gp68 transfected cells demonstrate some cooperativity with FcR reactivation. However, the addition of a high concentration of pooled anti-CMV IgGs to virus infected cells using virus variants lacking gp34, gp68, or both gp34/gp68 did not show cooperativity. This point is very important for the manuscript, as it is currently written, and therefore requires modification of the text, adjustment of the conclusions, or additional experiments.</p><p>2) Many figures only show, at best, a 2 fold change and it should be discussed that limiting ADCC by these viral genes is not a major immune evasion strategy.</p><p>3) The nature of the viruses needs to be described in more detail/more clearly. The text, in its current form, overlooks the absence of all other viral FcRs as they are assessing the cooperativity of gp34/gp68.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Kolb et al., address a long-standing question regarding the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) IgG-Fc-binding functions. Two known virus-encoded Fc-gamma-binding receptors (vFcgRs), vRL11-encoded gp34 and UL119-118-encoded gp68 were previously shown by this group to prevent activation of cellular receptors for IgG. This manuscript now shows that these two synergize in antagonizing host FcgR activation such that &quot;gp34 enhances immune complex internalization and gp68 acts as inhibitor of host FcγR binding to immune complexes&quot;, revealing that these viral mimic block conformational changes within IgG that are crucial for Fc-mediated effector function. The major limitation of the work is the use of a parental virus that lacks other vFcgRs, which likely provides unencumbered phenotypes for gp34 and gp68 but is not the case with wild strains of HCMV. The limitations of the assay viruses must be fully disclosed and addressed in the manuscript.</p><p>Figure 1 clearly shows that the two viral proteins bind independently to IgG, with gp34 associating with the upper hinge region and gp68 associating with the immunoglobulin domain CH2-CH3 interface. The data are consistent with previous literature and are themselves clear and convincing.</p><p>Figure 2 seeks to demonstrate that antagonism by vFcgRs is cooperative using HCMV mutant viruses that are deficient in one or both, experiments performed a background of ∆RL12 (gp95-deficiency). AD169 lacks many genes that are naturally found in wild strains of HCMV and that might influence the results observed here, including RL13 (gpRL13) which is lost in every viral strain upon propagation in cultured cells. Thus, panel A labeling requires much more text support owing to the use of not just ∆RL12 but ∆RL12/∆RL13 (and whatever other genes are absent in AD169 background). For clarity, ∆RL11 (gp34-deficient), ∆UL119-118 (gp68-deficient) and ∆RL11/∆RL119-118 (double-deficient) terminology might be adopted for clarity. (NOTE: It would be important here to mention any specific role of UL12 (gp95) because mutant viruses appear to be RL11/RL12 double mutants. The same goes for the fact that RL13 is absent in this virus strain, although that might be an intractable issue.) Ambiguities would be resolved with experiments in a more fully competent strain of HCMV (such as in the conditional Merlin strain that retains RL13 as well as other genes that have gone missing in AD169). Further, statistical evaluations are necessary here to be sure that the appearance of a reduction in IL-2 production occurs only with the double mutant, and the y-axis should be labeled with the biologic protein being measured by ELISA as a surrogate for FcgRIII activation. Finally, the text should explain to the reader why antagonism by parental and either &quot;single mutant&quot; is associated with higher levels of IL-2 and lower NK cell CD107a positivity (panel B), which seem counterintuitive to this reviewer. These data seem to compare relevant mutants but do not allow the conclusion that &quot;that gp34 and gp68 antagonize FcγRs by cooperative modes of action&quot; without stating as well &quot;in the absence of other known vFcgRs encoded by RL12 and RL13. Finally, careful work with viral mutants in the absence of biophysical data makes any conclusion of &quot;cooperative modes of action&quot; premature.</p><p>Figure 3 examines the dynamics of gp34 and gp68 internalization, after replacing the transmembrane and cytosolic domains with CD4 domains, where differences compatible with the interpretation, &quot;gp34 compared to gp68 is mediating the efficient internalization of IC&quot; might be expressed better as &quot;native gp34 appears to be more efficient at internalizing IC than native gp68&quot;. Here, it is not clear why more work was not performed with a mix of native gp34 and CD4 modified gp68 as well as native gp68 and CD4 modified gp34 (with the mix of and CD4 modified gp68 and CD4 modified gp34 potentially useful as well). There may be cooperation here and the data presented only hint at the conclusion that the authors favor.</p><p>Figure 4 makes further use of CD4 modified gp34 and gp68 to maintain cell surface expression, and the conclusion, &quot;gp68 but not gp34 to significantly reduce binding of FcγRIIIA/B to cell surface immune complexes compared to CD99&quot; is warranted. Again, it seems combination of native proteins with CD4 modified proteins would add important information to the interpretations offered here.</p><p>Figure 5 returns to virus-infected cells to evaluate &quot;a strong relative reduction in FcγRIIIA/B binding to opsonized HCMV-infected cells in the presence of gp68, but not gp34&quot;, which is substantiated by the data shown.</p><p>Figure 6 addresses the issue of why authors &quot;did not observe efficient antagonization of FcγR activation by gp34 or gp68 individually in the context of HCMV deletion mutant infection&quot;. Using an assay set up in HeLa cells, &quot;gp68 or gp34 individually confirmed to antagonize FcγRIII activation&quot;, &quot;the more membrane resident gp68-CD4 showed a markedly stronger antagonistic effect compared to gp68wt&quot;, and &quot;internalization to be a major condition of gp34 driven antagonization of FcγR activation&quot;, which are substantiated. The authors then observe that &quot;the presence of an excess of non-immune IgG interferes with both gp68 and gp34 antagonization&quot; that is &quot;attributed to displacement of immune IgG from the vFcγRs resulting in restoration of FcγRIII activation&quot;. All of this data appears useful and appropriate.</p><p>Figure 7 goes on to show that the &quot;ectodomain of gp68 is sufficient to enhance the antagonistic effect of gp34&quot;, which gets at some of the concerns raised with earlier data where combinations would have probably brought this to light.</p><p>The overall conclusions are warranted, so long as it is clear to the reader that the virus being used lacks all other potentially relevant vFCgRs (when the double mutant is introduced, it would be appropriate to state that it lacks all known vFcgRs). In addition, it would be appropriate to divulge whether elimination of UL12 is necessary for these observations even if studies with conditional RL13 expression are not readily approachable and remains a mystery for future consideration. Limitations of the parental virus backbone should be an important topic for the Discussion. It is unlikely in this reviewer's eye that a set of mutants in fully WT (conditional) virus would behave the same as these particular set are shown to behave, thus discussion relating to clinical issues should be toned down.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript investigates the mechanism cytomegalovirus proteins gp68 and gp34 as an immune evasion strategy to limit Fc receptor-mediated antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. The study is based on previous findings characterizing gp34 and gp68 as viral evasins during a virus infection. The manuscript describes that gp34 and gp68 function in a synergistic manner by enhances immune complex internalization and as an inhibitor of FcγR binding to immune complexes, respectively. The manuscript systematically examines the function of gP34 and gp68 through virus infection and protein expression in transfected cells. Yet, the manuscript conclusion is based on only two-fold differences with the key conditions and virus studies do not demonstrate synergistic findings (Figure 2).</p><p>1) Figure 2 is a key experiment that demonstrates that the lack of gp34 and gp68 have an impact on FcyR activation. The data does not show cooperativity to down limit FcyR activation. The study should expand the kinetics of study and different concentrations of Cytotect as well as specific anti-CMV antibodies.</p><p>2) The study is based on previous publications and further define the mechanism of actions. However, the findings typically only demonstrate at most a 2-fold difference upon the expression of gp34 and gp68. This is mostly due to the analysis of using flow cytometry. The authors should include a more sensitive assay to define the function of gp34 and gp68 on FcyR activation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Kolb et al. builds on this laboratories 2014 publication showing that HCMV gp34 and gp68 are able to bind Fcg and in doing so, interrupt FcgR mediated activation signals including ADCC by NK cells. The paper demonstrates that gp34 and gp68 bind IgG at the same time and in doing so act in concert to mediate efficient prevention of FcgR activation by preventing cellular FcgR from binding the immune IgG and the removal of immune IgG/HCMV protein immune complexes from the cell surface, mediated by gp34. The apparent redundancy seen with HCMV immune evasion mechanisms is interesting and the clear indication from this work is that what might appear redundancy is actually not and more to do with efficient biological function with 2 viral proteins working in conjunction.</p><p>The manuscript is on the whole well written and the experiments set out in a logical fashion. The inclusion of cartoons to assist the reader in understanding the experimental set up is welcome. The results demonstrate simultaneous binding that the dual action of gp34/68 is required for efficient inhibition of FcgR activation the role of gp34 in internalization and then the role gp68 in FcgR blocking. While various antigen v FcgR models are used for these experiments HCMV infected cells have also been used. The effect of excess non HCMV immune IgG as would be seen in sera/ in vivo has also been considered.</p><p>The experiments have been carefully thought through and are well controlled appropriate statistical analysis has been performed and the data presented support the authors conclusions. I do not have any major concerns over this work.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63877.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) The data presented in gp34 and gp68 transfected cells demonstrate some cooperativity with FcR reactivation.

As we here observed a strong antagonization when both molecules are expressed, but not when either gp34 or gp68 are expressed alone, we hypothesized that there must be cooperative mode of action. We agree with reviewer that the observed synergism does not allow the conclusion that there is a mechanistic cooperation from different effects. To address the concerns of the reviewers, we changed the text and figure legend to not overstate the data and describe the effects seen in Figure 2 as “synergizing”. This adjustment expresses that we do not explicitly show cooperation in the sense of a molecular mechanism, but that a more than additive effect is observed. As the data strongly suggests cooperation, we then address this in the following experiments. In settings of reduced complexity, we finally confirmed cooperation and identified the opposing role of non-immune IgG as outlined in Figure 6. We added a new experiment in Figure 6C, showing synergy also in absence of non-immune IgG using a the mAb Herceptin in the context of HCMV infection by infecting newly generated Her2-expressing fibroblasts (see Results). This experiment also further supports the conclusions made in Figure 6B, that gp34 and gp68 individually show antagonization. Due to this experiment, Anne Halenius was added as a contributing author.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Many figures only show, at best, a 2 fold change and it should be discussed that limiting ADCC by these viral genes is not a major immune evasion strategy.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that some experiments show weak effects when looking at single values along a titration curve.

This type of evaluation considers differences in the presence of excess non-immune IgG and better illustrates the strength of the antagonistic effects mediated by gp34 and gp68.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The nature of the viruses needs to be described in more detail/more clearly.

In addition, we now clearly state the nature of the viral deletion mutants used in Figure 2 and the referring text and justify our decision. In brief, as we were specifically interested in the mechanisms behind the FcR-antagonists gp34 and gp68, we chose to exclude gp95 and gpRL13. Major arguments behind this decision were i) that gpRL13 is notoriously mutated in the HCMV genome upon cell culture passages and has not yet been described to antagonize FcR activation and ii) that gp95 is the most polymorphic gene of HCMV with only minor surface expression in the context of AD169 infection (Corrales-Aguilar et al., 2014). Due to remarkably little conservation of gp95 allelic forms across the strains of HCMV and its variable efficacy to inhibit host FcγRs, we did not consider this molecule when describing the mechanisms of the much more conserved and well-described vFcRs gp34 and gp68. A manuscript comparing gp95 alleles is currently in preparation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Kolb et al., address a long-standing question regarding the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) IgG-Fc-binding functions.

Further, as indicated by the new Figure 6—figure supplement 1, following a single target in internalization with a humanized mAb is limited by the low surface expression of gH in the context of infection.

However, the findings typically only demonstrate at most a 2-fold difference upon the expression of gp34 and gp68. This is mostly due to the analysis of using flow cytometry. The authors should include a more sensitive assay to define the function of gp34 and gp68 on FcyR activation.</p></disp-quote><p>– We agree that some experiments delineating molecular mechanisms using flow cytometry show weaker effects or when looking at single values along a titration curve. However, the functional read-out systems (e.g. the reporter cell assay as well as primary NK cell degranulation assay) demonstrates robust and significant differences (see Figure 2A and B).</p></body></sub-article></article>
