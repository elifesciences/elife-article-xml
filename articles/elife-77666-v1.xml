predictor of their immune function, and subsequently, their ability to control or avoid infection and ultimately contribute offspring to the next generation. However, the same genotype, subjected to different intrinsic and/or extrinsic environments, can also result in different phenotypic outcomes, which can be missed in controlled laboratory studies. Natural wildlife populations, which capture both genotypic and environmental variability, provide an opportunity to more fully understand the phenotypic expression of genetic variation. We identified a synonymous polymorphism in the high-affinity Immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptor (GC and non-GC haplotypes) that has sex-dependent effects on immune gene expression, susceptibility to infection, and reproductive success of individuals in a natural population of field voles (<italic>Microtus agrestis</italic>). We found that the effect of the GC haplotype on the expression of immune genes differed between sexes. Regardless of sex, both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory genes were more highly relatively expressed in individuals with the GC haplotype than individuals without the haplotype. However, males with the GC haplotype showed a stronger signal for pro-inflammatory genes, while females showed a stronger signal for anti-inflammatory genes. Furthermore, we found an effect of the GC haplotype on the probability of infection with a common microparasite<italic>, Babesia microti,</italic> in females – with females carrying the GC haplotype being more likely to be infected. Finally, we found an effect of the GC haplotype on reproductive success in males – with males carrying the GC haplotype having a lower reproductive success. This is a rare example of a polymorphism whose consequences we are able to follow across immunity, infection, and reproduction for both males and females in a natural population.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Microtus agrestis</italic></kwd><kwd>Fcer1a</kwd><kwd>phenotypic expression</kwd><kwd>inflammatory response</kwd><kwd>sex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000270</institution-id><institution>Natural Environment Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NE/L013452/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Begon</surname><given-names>Mike</given-names></name><name><surname>Bradley</surname><given-names>Janette E</given-names></name><name><surname>Jackson</surname><given-names>Joseph A</given-names></name><name><surname>Paterson</surname><given-names>Steve</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic variation can have multiple effects on different phenotypic traits in organisms living in the natural environment.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In order for an individual to control or avoid infection and ultimately contribute offspring to the next generation, they must have a well-functioning immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Møller and Saino, 2004</xref>). An individual’s immune function is in part determined by their genotype (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Paterson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wanelik et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Turner et al., 2011</xref>). Individuals within a population differ from each other in the genotypes they carry, with the potential for these different genotypes to affect the activity of different immune components, and thereby influence susceptibility to infection and reproduction and survivorship. Indeed, variability in immune responses to infection is well-characterized. The phenotypic expression of a genotype is dependent on the environment, including the sex of an individual (intrinsic environment) and exposure to infection (extrinsic environment). Since capturing genotypic and environmental variability in controlled laboratory studies is problematic, natural wildlife populations have been proposed as models in which to understand the phenotypic expression of genetic variation and its consequences for susceptibility to infection and reproduction.</p><p>Studies of natural populations have explored the effects of genotype on immune phenotype and have observed consequences for susceptibility to infection. Most notably, variability in the genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) has been associated with resistance to intestinal nematodes in domestic sheep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Paterson et al., 1998</xref>) and with resistance to malaria, hepatitis, and AIDS in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hill et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carrington et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thursz et al., 1997</xref>). The role of variability elsewhere in the genome, for shaping immune phenotype, has also been studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wanelik et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Turner et al., 2011</xref>). However, it remains challenging to follow the consequences of a genotypic effect for immunity, infection, and reproduction and to account for any sex-dependent expression of a genotype. This is because of the difficulty in obtaining phenotypic data across immune, infection, and reproductive traits, especially for large enough sample sizes to test for data-hungry genotype by sex interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ober et al., 2008</xref>). In many cases, sex and other environmental factors are considered as a confounding variable to be controlled for in order not to hide any subtle genetic associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Paterson et al., 1998</xref>). Other studies focus on a single sex for the sake of simplicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jackson et al., 2014</xref>). More recently, however, there has been a growing body of large-scale field studies of natural populations able to apply genetic and immunological methods to follow large numbers of individuals, exposed to a challenging environment and with varying genetic backgrounds, throughout their lives. This allows us to make a more complete assessment of the impacts of genotype throughout the life of an individual, whether male or female. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Graham et al., 2010</xref> found evidence for heritable variation in immunity associated with sex-dependent effects on Soay sheep reproduction. However, we know of no documented example of a polymorphism affecting immunity, susceptibility to infection, and reproduction in a natural population investigated in males and females. Here, we use a wild rodent, the field vole (<italic>Microtus agrestis</italic>), as a model in which to do this. Wild rodents, in particular, offer an opportunity to quickly follow large numbers of individuals throughout their lives, given their short lifespans. They also offer the opportunity to draw on the immunological and genetics resources developed for laboratory rodents, while providing a much more realistic ecological model of human populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Turner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Turner and Paterson, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated responses are associated with defense against helminths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gounni et al., 1994</xref>) and with allergy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tomassini et al., 1991</xref>). They are controlled by the high-affinity IgE receptor, FCER1, which is found on the surface of various immune effector cells, for example, mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Daeron and Nimmerjahn, 2014</xref>). In humans, naturally occurring polymorphisms in FCER1 are known to affect an individual’s serum IgE levels, with consequences for their susceptibility to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Weidinger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Granada et al., 2012</xref>) and their risk of developing inflammatory disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hasegawa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Potaczek et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Niwa et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, sex differences in serum IgE levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Weiss et al., 2006</xref>) and the incidence of IgE-mediated inflammatory disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2008</xref>) have been documented in humans, suggesting that any polymorphism in this pathway is likely to experience different contexts in males and females. Indeed, one study found evidence for a polymorphism in the <italic>Fcer1a</italic> gene (the alpha chain of FCER1) whose association with susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus (a chronic inflammatory disease) differed between males and females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yang et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In a previous study of a natural population of <italic>M. agrestis</italic>, we found that males carrying the GC haplotype of the <italic>Fcer1a</italic> gene expressed the transcription factor GATA3 at a lower level than males carrying non-GC haplotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wanelik et al., 2018</xref>). GATA3 is a biomarker of tolerance to macroparasites in mature males in our population (macroparasite infection gives rise to increased expression of GATA3, which gives rise to improved body condition and survival; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jackson et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we explore the effects of this GC haplotype further in both males and females to analyze the effect of genotype acting across immune gene expression, infection susceptibility and reproductive success.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We sampled a natural population of <italic>M. agrestis</italic> in Kielder Forest, Northumberland, UK, over 3 years (2015–2017) and across seven different sites. Our study involved a cross-sectional component (n = 317 destructively sampled voles) and a longitudinal component (n = 850 marked individuals monitored through time, with n = 2387 sampling points). We tested the consequences of the GC haplotype of the <italic>Fcer1a</italic> gene using both cross-sectional and longitudinal components of our study. As well as the GC haplotype (present at a frequency of 0.08), three other haplotypes were present in our study population: AC haplotype, AT haplotype, and GT haplotype, present at frequencies of 0.81, 0.10, and 0.01, respectively. The two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) composing the haplotype were found to be tightly linked (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.50; D’ = 0.70).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>The GC haplotype has effects on inflammation that differ between sexes</title><p>In humans, naturally occurring polymorphisms in the <italic>Fcer1a</italic> gene have previously been linked to inflammatory disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hasegawa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Potaczek et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Niwa et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, we used the cross-sectional component of our study to test the effects of the GC haplotype on inflammation in males and females. Differential gene expression (DGE) analysis was performed on unstimulated splenocytes taken from 53 males and 31 females assayed by RNASeq, with the aim of identifying individual genes that were differentially expressed between those individuals with and without a copy of the GC haplotype. This DGE analysis showed that the identity of top differentially expressed genes differed between the sexes. In males, the top differentially expressed immune gene was the cytokine, <italic>Il33</italic> (log fold change [logFC] = 2.76, p&lt;0.001, <italic>q</italic> &lt; 0.001; <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table2">Appendix 1—table 2</xref>) while in females it was the suppressor of cytokine signaling <italic>Socs3</italic> (logFC = 1.07, p&lt;0.001, <italic>q</italic> = 0.05; <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table3">Appendix 1—table 3</xref>). Looking at the ranking of each top differentially expressed immune gene in the opposite sex strengthens the case for differing effects in males and females, with <italic>Il33</italic> ranked markedly lower in females (rank = 8224/12904, logFC = 0.29, p=0.70, <italic>q</italic> = 1.00) and <italic>Socs3</italic> markedly lower in males (rank = 10886/12904, logFC = –0.05, p=0.84, <italic>q</italic> = 1.00). <italic>Il33</italic> is commonly associated with the anti-helminthic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liew et al., 2010</xref>) and <italic>Socs3</italic> with regulation of the immune response more broadly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carow and Rottenberg, 2014</xref>). Given the link between <italic>Il33</italic> and the antihelminthic response (and more generally, IgE-mediated responses and the antihelminthic response), we repeated the DGE analysis while controlling for cestode burden, but this had little effect on our results (same top differentially expressed immune genes; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table4">Appendix 1—table 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table5">Appendix 1—table 5</xref>), suggesting that these effects were not driven by differences in cestode infection.</p><p>Both <italic>Il33</italic> and <italic>Socs3</italic> also share an association with the inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carow and Rottenberg, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cayrol and Girard, 2014</xref>). While <italic>Il33</italic> positively regulates this response (appearing in the gene set GO:0050729), <italic>Socs3</italic> negatively regulates it (GO:0050728). To test whether these effects on the inflammatory response were limited to these genes or were more widespread, we performed a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) that looked at the rankings of all genes present in each of these gene sets (GO:0050729 and GO:0050728). This analysis showed that both gene sets were more highly relatively expressed in individuals with the GC haplotype than individuals without the haplotype, and that this was true for both males and females. However, males with the GC haplotype showed a stronger signal for genes that positively regulate the inflammatory response (GO:0050729: p=0.007; GO:0050728: p=0.04; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, upper panel) while females with the GC haplotype showed a stronger signal for genes that negatively regulate the inflammatory response (GO:0050728: p=0.001; GO:0050728: p=0.04; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lower panel).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Effects of GC haplotype (hGC).</title><p>Upper panel: males.

From this ex vivo assay, one can gain insight into the types of immune response that could be made to a pathogen in vivo (see 'Materials and methods' for details).

We estimated each individual's reproductive success by counting the number of offspring it produced according to this pedigree. We then tested the effects of the GC haplotype on this measure of reproductive success. We tried to run a single model with both sexes (as above) but resulting residual variances differed significantly between the sexes, which reflects the fact that male and female reproduction are inherently different traits. This made it impossible to formally test for a genotype by sex interaction, and so instead we ran a separate model for each sex. We found that males with the GC haplotype had an average of 2.2 fewer offspring than males without the haplotype (p=0.04; <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table12">Appendix 1—table 12</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, upper panel).

This begins to reveal how genotypic effects can have multiple effects on different phenotypic or life history traits for organisms living in the natural environment. Interestingly, effects often differed between sexes, with evidence for opposing effects in the sexes (unstimulated immune gene expression) and an effect present in one sex but not the other (stimulated immune gene expression, susceptibility to infection, and reproductive success). However, we cannot rule out that, in the case of susceptibility to infection and reproductive success, there was a smaller effect present in the opposite sex (in the same or opposite direction), which our analysis did not have sufficient power to detect.</p><p>In humans, naturally occurring polymorphisms in the high-affinity IgE receptor have previously been linked to inflammatory disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hasegawa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Potaczek et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Niwa et al., 2010</xref>). Our work is consistent with this and suggests differing effects of this polymorphism on the inflammatory phenotype of males and females. While males with the GC haplotype showed a pro-inflammatory bias, females with the haplotype showed an anti-inflammatory bias. A previous study on another polymorphism in the human ortholog of <italic>Fcer1a</italic> also found evidence for sex-dependent effects on inflammatory disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). In order to fully understand this genotype by sex interaction, it is important to consider background differences in the inflammatory phenotypes of males and females. Females in this study were pregnant for a large proportion of their lives (57% of post-juvenile females were pregnant or lactating at the time of capture in the longitudinal component of our study). In mammals, including humans, pregnancy has been shown to be a largely anti-inflammatory state, with pregnant females suppressing inflammation. This is to protect the fetus from attack by the mother’s immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wegmann et al., 1993</xref>). While testosterone in males has an anti-inflammatory effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bianchi, 2019</xref>), it also drives males to use more space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Davis et al., 2015</xref>) and to be more aggressive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martínez-Sanchis et al., 2003</xref>). These behaviors might increase their rates of contact with other individuals, and with their environment, and hence their likelihood of infection and subsequent immune stimulation. We suggest that the polymorphism may be exaggerating background sex differences in inflammatory activity. Sex hormones have been implicated in the differential expression of some autosomal genes in males and females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mayne et al., 2016</xref>), and could be driving these opposing effects. Some of the differences in immune phenotype that we observed may also be driven by difference in parasite infection (although we accounted for cestode burden in a follow-up analysis, we cannot rule this out).</p><p>The effect of <italic>Fcer1a</italic> polymorphism on inflammatory responses may also, in turn, affect individual susceptibility to infection. This is consistent with a previous association found between IgE-mediated responses and defense against helminths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gounni et al., 1994</xref>). Although we did not find an association between macroparasite burden (including cestode burden) and the GC haplotype in this study, in our previous study, we showed that males with the GC haplotype had a lower level of an immunological marker of tolerance to ticks, fleas, and adult cestodes (i.e., they were less tolerant) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wanelik et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we use data on infection incidence to show that, in a different context, the same haplotype is also associated with resistance to a microparasite, <italic>B. microti</italic>, in females. Although observational studies of this kind are not able to identify causal relationships, a realistic scenario is that females with the GC haplotype are more likely to be infected with <italic>B. microti</italic> (i.e., they are less resistant) as a result of a lower pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory cytokine ratio. Pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, IFN-γ, and TNF-α) may help to resist <italic>B. microti</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Djokic et al., 2018</xref>). A lack or imbalance of these cytokines may hamper this resistance. The panel of parasites that we have measured is not exhaustive, and previous studies have highlighted the important role of species interactions in the parasite community in driving infection risk in this study population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Telfer et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>B. microti</italic> may therefore represent a community of parasites, to which this haplotype affects resistance in females.</p><p>A fitness consequence of the GC haplotype was observed in reduced male reproductive success. A realistic scenario is that the larger cost incurred by males with the GC haplotype due to inflammation reduced their reproductive value, as reproducing and mounting a pro-inflammatory response are both costly activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sheldon and Verhulst, 1996</xref>). Another realistic scenario is that the positive effect of the GC haplotype on levels of oxidative stress (as indicated by a tendency for higher SOD1 activity) may have had a more detrimental effect in males, damaging sperm and reducing fertilizing success. Sperm competition can be an important feature in the reproduction of microtines, for example, meadow vole (<italic>M. pennsylvanicus</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Delbarco-Trillo and Ferkin, 2004</xref>), with males having to produce many sperm of high quality in order to successfully outcompete other males. Sperm are also highly susceptible to damage by reactive oxygen species (ROS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Losdat et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, the heightened level of oxidative stress may have impaired olfactory sexual signals, for example, excretion of major urinary proteins (MUPs) making males less attractive to females and negatively impacting on mating success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garratt et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Despite the immune system playing an important role in determining the health and reproductive fitness of an individual, natural selection has not converged on a single immune optimum. Instead, individuals in natural populations vary widely in their response to infection. Understanding why immunoheterogeneity is maintained is a key question in eco-immunology. Antagonistic selection, where a mutation is beneficial in some environmental contexts and harmful in others, is thought to be one mechanism by which balancing selection is generated, and genetic variation in immunity can be maintained within natural populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Graham et al., 2010</xref>). In samples collected between 2008 and 2010, we previously identified four haplotypes at this locus, GC, AC, AT, and GT, at frequencies of 0.12, 0.76, 0.07, and 0.05, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wanelik et al., 2018</xref>). Seven years on, these frequencies have remained relatively unchanged (0.08, 0.81, 0.10, and 0.01). The fact that the GC haplotype remains in the population, despite its detrimental effects on male reproductive success and female infection susceptibility, suggests that it may be under balancing selection.</p><p>In order to be under balancing selection though, the GC haplotype would need to confer some advantage. We were not able to find evidence for any such advantage in this study, but we can speculate on one. Microtines show cyclical population dynamics, alternating between a 'peak' phase (associated with good conditions and high vole densities) and a 'crash' phase (poor conditions and low vole densities). Selection pressures acting during these two phases will be very different. We found that the GC haplotype was associated with a pro-inflammatory bias in males, indicating higher investment in promoting inflammation. Thus, one possible scenario is that higher investment in promoting inflammation is disadvantageous in the 'peak' phase when the risk of parasitism is low due to dilution effects, and it pays not to waste energy mounting a stronger immune response that is unnecessary. However, it might be advantageous in the 'crash' phase when conditions are poor, and the risk of parasitism is high due to the time-lagged transmission of parasite infectious stages that have accumulated during the peak phase. Vole numbers were extremely low in our study area between 2012 and 2013 (indicating a 'crash phase'). In 2014, vole numbers began to increase and by the beginning of 2015 (the start of our study) had reached a peak. Although vole numbers declined throughout our study period, they never reached the extremely low numbers recorded in 2012–2013 (X. Lambin, personal communication, 2016). This suggests that we sampled in the region of a 'peak' phase, when this investment was disadvantageous, and that if we sampled during a true 'crash' phase we might detect an advantage to the GC haplotype in males.</p><p>There is a growing interest in human genomic (or precision) medicine, with the potential to use a patient’s genotypic information to personalize their treatment. What we have shown here demonstrates that considering genotype in isolation can be misleading as the same polymorphism can have different outcomes not only for the immune gene expression, but the susceptibility to infection and ultimate reproductive success of males and females.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>We studied <italic>M. agrestis</italic> in Kielder Forest, Northumberland, UK, using live-trapping of individual animals from natural populations.

Finally, adult voles breeding on first capture were assigned a birth date 6 weeks prior to capture (minimum age at first breeding) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Begon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burthe et al., 2010</xref>). Adult voles not breeding on first capture could not be assigned a birth date as it was not known whether they had previously bred or not. Virtually all samples (99%) were assigned a sex, and approximately half (54%) were assigned a birth month. As we sampled individuals from across seven different clear-cut areas of the forest, each several kilometers apart, these were assumed to be independent, closed populations with negligible dispersal. Site-specific pedigrees were therefore generated.</p><p>We assessed the accuracy of our reconstructed pedigrees by checking whether predicted parent–offspring pairs met expectations given the biology of <italic>M. agrestis</italic>. As expected, the majority of predicted parent–offspring pairs (87%) were born in the same year. We also expected parents and offspring to overlap in space. Again, as expected, the majority of predicted parent–offspring pairs (92%) were, at some point, found along the same transects (horizontal or vertical). We also inspected log10 likelihood ratios (LLRs) for parent pairs as recommended in the user manual for <italic>Sequoia</italic>. Almost all LLRs were positive (n = 698/720 or 97% of LLRs) indicating confidence in our assignments. Individuals with vs. without our haplotype of interest did not differ in their probability of appearing in a pedigree (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>χ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> = 0.09, d.f. = 1, p=0.76). For each individual that ended up in a pedigree, that is, with one or more relatives recorded (n = 652; site COL = 3; site BLB = 125; site GRD = 204; site CHE = 137; site RAV = 16; site SCP = 90; site HAM = 77), the number of offspring was counted to provide a measure of their reproductive success. Few individuals were first trapped as juveniles, with the majority trapped as adults that had already recruited into the population. Our measure of reproductive success then more closely resembles the number of recruited (rather than newborn) offspring per individual. Half of the individuals present in our pedigrees (n = 325) were found to have no offspring. We expect the majority of these to be true zeros (representing actual reproductive failure) as we generally sampled a large proportion of the total population within clear-cuts. We also minimized the chance of false zeros by excluding those individuals (e.g., at the periphery of a study grid) that did not end up in a pedigree because we identified no relatives (including offspring), likely because we had not sampled in the right place.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Not all individuals appeared in all datasets; therefore, sample sizes (reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) vary between analyses.

Only those individuals for which haplotype could be inferred with certainty could be included (n = 53 males and n = 31 females; none of which were known to have two copies of the GC haplotype, hence the choice of a dominant model). Samples from different sexes were analyzed together. To test whether the top differentially expressed genes differed between the sexes, we included a dummy variable with four levels (males with haplotype, males without haplotype, females with haplotype, females without haplotype) and inspected the contrasts of interest (males with versus without haplotype; females with versus without haplotype). As this was an exploratory analysis, used in conjunction with more targeted measurements of immune gene expression (see below), model specification was kept as simple as possible and no covariates were initially included. However, in a follow-up DGE analysis we controlled for a key parasite variable (cestode burden).</p><p>Having confirmed a sex-dependent effect of the GC haplotype on the expression of some inflammatory genes (see 'Results') in the initial DGE analysis, we ran separate DGE analyses for males and females and tested more broadly for enrichment of pro- and anti-inflammatory genes in our results; more specifically, the Gene Ontology terms ‘positive regulation of inflammatory response’ (GO:0050729; n = 143) and ‘negative regulation of inflammatory response’ (GO:0050728; n = 149). The aim here was to answer the question: are pro- or anti-inflammatory genes more highly ranked relative to other genes, when we compare individuals with and without the GC haplotype, and does this also differ between the sexes? This GSEA was performed using the R package limma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ritchie et al., 2015</xref>), and genes were ranked on log fold change.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>Haplotype association analyses</title><p>Following the exploratory DGE analysis, the GC haplotype was tested for associations with (i) gene expression assayed by Q-PCR to validate these results, (ii) macro- and microparasite infection to test whether the GC haplotype predicted an individual’s susceptibility to infection, and (iii) reproductive success to test whether the GC haplotype was associated with any reproductive costs. Given the well-established link between inflammation and oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reuter et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Collins, 1999</xref>), we also tested for an association between the GC haplotype and SOD1 activity.</p><p>For all analyses, this was initially attempted using the R package hapassoc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burkett et al., 2006</xref>) in order to maximize sample size (see below). Hapassoc infers haplotypes on the basis of data from single SNPs and allows likelihood inference of trait associations with resulting SNP haplotypes and other attributes. It adopts a generalized linear model framework and estimates parameters using an expectation–maximization algorithm. Hapassoc models assumed an additive genetic model. If the haplotype combination of an individual cannot, with certainty, be inferred from its genotyping data (i) because it is heterozygous at two or more markers or (ii) because it has missing data for a single marker, the approach implemented in hapassoc is to consider all possible haplotype combinations for that individual. Standard errors accounting for this added uncertainty are calculated using the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Louis, 1982</xref> method. We compared the GC haplotype against the other two major haplotypes (AC and AT). Another haplotype, the GT haplotype, was identified in the population but this was present at such low frequencies (frequency ≤ 0.01 among individuals for which haplotype could be inferred with certainty) that it was omitted from all analyses. Results reported in the text for macroparasites and SOD1 activity come from these hapassoc models.</p><p>However, there are some restrictions on model specification within hapassoc (e.g., random terms cannot be included, limited choice of error distributions), so this was followed up with regression models for some analyses. As in the DGE analysis, these regression models only included those individuals whose haplotype combination could be inferred with certainty. Results reported in the text for gene expression assayed by Q-PCR, microparasites, and reproductive success come from these regression models. Again, as in the DGE analysis, genotype was coded as the presence or absence of the GC haplotype (i.e., a dominant model). Regression models were run using the R package lme4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bates et al., 2015</xref>) or glmmADMB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Skaug et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fournier et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> provides a summary of (hapassoc or regression) model specifications. As we found evidence for sex-dependent effect in the initial DGE analysis, with the exception of the model for reproductive success (see below), all models included a genotype by sex interaction that was retained if it improved model fit. All models also accounted for other biological and technical covariates (the choice of which was informed by our previous work, the literature, and/or our experimental design). Full regression models (including all covariates and interactions of interest) were reduced using backward stepwise deletion of nonsignificant terms to minimize Akaike’s information criterion (AIC), following the drop1 function. This was not possible for hapassoc models. Summary tables, including all estimates, standard errors, and <italic>z</italic>-statistics, are included in Appendix 1. Associated significance values are also included in these tables, except for LMMs and GLMMs, for which significance values were based on LRTs and are reported in the main text. Throughout, residuals from regression models were checked for approximate normality and homoscedasticity, and all covariates were tested for independence using variance inflation factors (all VIFs &lt; 3).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-3"><title>Association between GC haplotype and immune gene expression assayed by Q-PCR</title><p>As we ran a total of 18 hapassoc models (one model per gene), the Benjamini and Hochberg method of correction was applied to all p-values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>). Resulting <italic>q</italic>-values (FDR-corrected p-values) are reported, alongside original p-values (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table6">Appendix 1—table 6</xref>). A hapassoc model including a genotype by sex interaction was tested against a null model without an interaction term. A Gamma error distribution and log link were used. Other covariates considered potential drivers of immune gene expression and included in both models were informed by our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jackson et al., 2011</xref>). These included snout-vent length (SVL), eye lens weight (categorized into seven intervals; SVL and eye lens weight capture the combined influence of age and historical growth trajectory), reproductive status (males were considered to be reproductively active if they had descended testes; females if they were pregnant or had perforate vaginas), and body condition (estimated by regressing body weight against life history stage, SVL, and its quadratic term). Site, year, and season (four levels, designated as spring [March and April], early summer [May and June], late summer [July and August], and autumn [September and October]) were included to account for any spatial and/or temporal autocorrelation. All covariates were included as fixed effects. We did not use a multidimensional approach (such as principal component analysis) because of limited redundancy in our panel of genes.</p><p>In order to confirm these results, an LMM was run for a single immune gene for which expression appeared to be associated with genotype (<italic>q</italic> = 0.037). The LMM included random terms for site and season, as well as assay plate number (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The latter was included to account for nonindependence due to immunological assaying structure. All other covariates were the same as the hapassoc model.

This combined measure of macroparasite burden was modeled using a hapassoc model with a Gaussian error distribution.</p><p>Microparasite infection status was assessed multiple times for the majority of individuals in the longitudinal component of the study (mean = 2.8; range = 1–11). Due to these repeated measures, microparasite infection could not be modeled using hapassoc. Instead, to test for an association between the GC haplotype and the probability of an individual being infected with a microparasite, we ran a GLMM with a binary response (infected or not), log link, and a random term for individual. Other covariates, considered potential drivers of both macro- and microparasite infection, were, again, informed by our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wanelik et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jackson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Taylor et al., 2018</xref>).

This is consistent with a previous study of the closely related common vole (<italic>Microtus arvalis</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). A Poisson error distribution was therefore deemed inappropriate, and it could not be modeled using hapassoc. Instead, to test for an association between the GC haplotype and reproductive success, we ran a GLM with a quasi-Poisson error distribution. This distribution has been previously used to model predictors of reproductive success in other organisms, and accounts for the overdispersion caused by excess zeros.</p><p>We only recorded a reproductive failure (i.e., zero reproductive success) for those individuals with some other familial relationship in our pedigree, purposefully omitting those individuals (e.g., at the periphery of a study grid) for which we may have recorded no relatives (including offspring) simply because we had not sampled in the right place. Therefore, we expect all (or most) of our zeros to represent actual reproductive failure. For this reason, zero-inflated models were deemed inappropriate.</p><p>As detailed in the 'Results,' we tried to run a single quasi-Poisson GLM with both sexes but resulting residual variances differed significantly between the sexes (F test to compare variances of two samples; p=0.02), making it impossible to formally test for a genotype by sex interaction. Instead, we ran a separate model for each sex. We included birth month as a covariate in this model, given that autumn-born voles (of the closely related common vole) have been shown to have a lower chance to reproduce than spring-born voles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Other covariates included in this model were whether or not an individual was culled for the cross-sectional component of this study (again, reducing the opportunity to reproduce), site, and the year in which an individual was most frequently captured (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In a follow-up analysis, we also controlled for <italic>B. microti</italic> and <italic>Bartonella</italic> spp. infection status. More specifically, we included the proportion of samples taken from an individual that were <italic>Babesia</italic>-positive and the proportion of samples taken from an individual that were <italic>Bartonella</italic>-positive. All covariates were included as fixed effects. Only a single female was trapped in one of the sites (COL) and consequently caused convergence problems in the female model. This female was therefore omitted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-6"><title>Association between GC haplotype and SOD1 activity</title><p>SOD1 activity was modeled using a hapassoc model with a Gaussian error distribution. Other covariates, considered potential drivers of SOD1 activity, were informed by the literature. Previous studies on wild rodents have shown that antioxidant levels increase with both reproductive effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garratt et al., 2011</xref>) and with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hindle et al., 2010</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jos van der Meer as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Temper claims to match statistics.</p><p>2. Exclude in vitro T cell stimulation tests of the FCER1A SNP or provide better justification for the assay (please see reviewer comments below).</p><p>3. Investigate potential confounding of IL-33 expression involving GC haplotype, IgE, and parasite burdens in a revised statistical analysis. For example, one reviewer suggests IL-33 should be included as an explanatory alongside all potential confounding variables such as parasite burdens, and the resulting fitted model estimate / z score for IL-33 be used to evaluate its importance.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In general, I would recommend you tone down the claims about sex-specific effects; actually, the results presented here are of interest regardless of whether they are sex-specific or not. Given that such effects are at best marginally significant, I think this is something that is better addressed in the Discussion, rather than claimed in the title.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– Please revise and expand reporting of the immune gene expression data (Il-33 is a type 2 cytokine, not normally considered pro-inflammatory). Much of the discussion of inflammatory vs anti-inflammatory requires more nuance – there are, at a minimum, antibacterial (IL-17), antihelminthic (IL-33, GATA3), and anti-inflammatory (SOC3) pathways being flagged up, and it would also be important to test antiviral responses (interferon-stimulated genes).</p><p>– Covariates detailed in Table 1 lack infection variables. These would be essential adjustments because the hypothesis is that all else being equal (i.e., at identical infection burdens, etc.), GC carriers should be more pro-inflammatory (males) or anti-inflammatory (females).</p><p>– The differential expression of Il33 (and any other genes/pathways of interest) should be followed up with statistical analysis to determine whether it is driven by worm infection, reproductive status, or other potential confounders in addition to / rather than haplotype. A GLMM containing covariates detailed in Table 1 + infection data would seem appropriate.</p><p>– Likewise, the effect of GC on male (and female?) reproductive success should be adjusted for the same potential confounders, like infection level.</p><p>– Figure 1A is quite uninformative. Please consider representing genes and top enriched pathways in a manner that allows readers to interpret the data.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Effects of an IgE receptor polymorphism acting on immunity, susceptibility to infection and reproduction in a wild rodent&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Jos van der Meer (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed.</p><p>(1) Reviewer 2 has pointed out that it is difficult to understand how Fcer1a could be linked to IL17a production. This finding should be backed in the manuscript by some reference to previous evidence, or it should be made clear that this result is unexpected and difficult to explain. Reviewer 2 also suggests removing the result, which is another option.</p><p>(2) Please see other suggestions by Reviewer 2 for improving clarity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have dealt with most of my comments in a satisfactory way, but there are still a few significant problems. In particular, the rationale for the experiment where T cells were stimulated ex vivo is highly unclear (see below for details).</p><p>The conclusions are now better matched by data, although there are still quite strong claims about sex-specific effects even though there are few formal tests of this (i.e. tests for sex-by-genotype effects). More problematic is that the justification (L 578-581) provided for the analysis of ex vivo stimulated T cells is very vague. The problem with this assay is as follows: I believe that in splenocytes, Fcer1a is mainly (only?) expressed on basophils and eosinophils; thus, an effect of a Fcer1a polymorphism needs to involve these cells in some way. In your assay you stimulated T cells (which are abundant in splenocytes) in a non-specific way. Of the 18 cytokines measured, you find an effect of Fcer1a polymorphism on expression of IL17a, which is produced by T cells (but not by eosinophils/basophils). The problem is that I just cannot see how the Fcer1a polymorphism (which should have an effect in basophils/eosinophils, but not in T cells) could be linked to IL17a production by T cells; this would need to involve signalling from activated T cells to basophils/eosinophils, and then Fcer1a polymorphism-dependent signalling from basophils/eosinophils back to T-cells to affect IL17a production; I guess it is not impossible, but I am unaware of anything like that. I think you need to provide a sound and specific rationale for this assay; just saying &quot;it could be acting indirectly on T-cells through various pathways, including via cytokine signalling, following Fcer1a expression by other cells&quot; (L578-581) is not enough.</p><p>The presentation of the DGE analysis and GSEA of unstimulated splenocytes is improved, but still a bit confusing (L 199-238): (i) I think it would be good to make clear in the Results that the DGE analysis and GSEA are based on comparing individuals with the GC haplotype vs all others (so that the reader does not have to go the MandM to find this), (ii) using the term &quot;top-responding&quot; (L 206) implies that you are measuring the transcriptional response to some treatment, while you are just comparing baseline expression of GC vs others in males and females (or have I misunderstood something?); use &quot;differentially expressed&quot; or something similar instead, (iii) similarly, using the term &quot;upregulated&quot; (L 231) implies you measured the transcriptional response to some treatment; use &quot;more highly expressed in individuals with GC…&quot; or similar.</p><p>When it comes to the ex vivo stimulation of T cells, I strongly suggest you remove these results (L240-254); they just don't make sense from an immunological point of view. Unfortunately, this is one of few analyses that actually shows a sex-by-genotype effects, so removing this would weaken the support for sex-specific effects of the Fcer1a polymorphism even further.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77666.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

As already mentioned above, we have tempered our claims about sex-specific effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– Please revise and expand reporting of the immune gene expression data (Il-33 is a type 2 cytokine, not normally considered pro-inflammatory). Much of the discussion of inflammatory vs anti-inflammatory requires more nuance – there are, at a minimum, antibacterial (IL-17), antihelminthic (IL-33, GATA3), and anti-inflammatory (SOC3) pathways being flagged up, and it would also be important to test antiviral responses (interferon-stimulated genes).</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our more detailed response above re. classification of genes. We now mention in the results that <italic>Il33</italic> is involved in the antihelminthic response , and <italic>Il17a</italic> is involved in the antibacterial response. No interferon-stimulated genes were flagged up in our analyses so these (and antiviral responses more broadly) are not mentioned.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Covariates detailed in Table 1 lack infection variables. These would be essential adjustments because the hypothesis is that all else being equal (i.e., at identical infection burdens, etc.), GC carriers should be more pro-inflammatory (males) or anti-inflammatory (females).</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the Reviewer’s concerns about our DGE analysis. As mentioned above in more detail, we have run an extra DGE analysis including cestode burden as a covariate (a parasite variable of relevance to IgE, as pointed out by the Reviewer). We found very similar results in this analysis, suggesting that the differences in immune gene expression that we see are not driven by cestode burden. We have presented the result of this extra DGE analysis as extra supplementary tables (see Appendix 1—table 4 and 5). We have also included the following caveat in our discussion:</p><p>“Some of the differences in immune phenotype that we observed may also be driven by difference in parasite infection (although we accounted for cestode burden in a follow-up analysis, we cannot rule this out).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The differential expression of Il33 (and any other genes/pathways of interest) should be followed up with statistical analysis to determine whether it is driven by worm infection, reproductive status, or other potential confounders in addition to / rather than haplotype. A GLMM containing covariates detailed in Table 1 + infection data would seem appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not measure the expression of <italic>Il33</italic> by QPCR, only by RNASeq. Therefore we have responded to these comments within our DGE analysis. As mentioned above, we have accounted for cestode burden in an extra DGE analysis. The addition of cestode burden had little effect on the results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Likewise, the effect of GC on male (and female?) reproductive success should be adjusted for the same potential confounders, like infection level.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we have run extra GLMs for both females and males which include two parasite variables: proportion of samples taken from an individual that tested positive for <italic>Babesia</italic> and proportion of samples taken from an individual that tested positive for <italic>Bartonella</italic>. We found no difference in the main results – males with the GC haplotype still have fewer offspring, suggesting that infection is not acting as a confounder. This additional analysis is mentioned in the text: “We ran the same models including microparasite variables, but this had little effect on our results (see Appendix 1—table 14 and 15), suggesting that these effects were not driven by differences in microparasite infection”, The model output is also included in the supplementary information, see Appendix 1—table 14 and 15. For the majority of those individuals with known reproductive success, we did not have data on macroparasite burden (which requires culling). However, given the lack of association between macroparasite burden and GC haplotype in cross-sectional animals, and the lack of effect of including cestodes in the DGE analysis, we don’t believe including macroparasite variables would change these results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 1A is quite uninformative.

We would expect most readers to be familiar with them. As such, we would like to keep Figure 1A as it is.

In particular, the rationale for the experiment where T cells were stimulated ex vivo is highly unclear (see below for details).</p></disp-quote><p>We are glad that we have satisfactorily addressed most of Reviewer 2’s comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The conclusions are now better matched by data, although there are still quite strong claims about sex-specific effects even though there are few formal tests of this (i.e. tests for sex-by-genotype effects). More problematic is that the justification (L 578-581) provided for the analysis of ex vivo stimulated T cells is very vague. The problem with this assay is as follows: I believe that in splenocytes, Fcer1a is mainly (only?) expressed on basophils and eosinophils; thus, an effect of a Fcer1a polymorphism needs to involve these cells in some way. In your assay you stimulated T cells (which are abundant in splenocytes) in a non-specific way. Of the 18 cytokines measured, you find an effect of Fcer1a polymorphism on expression of IL17a, which is produced by T cells (but not by eosinophils/basophils). The problem is that I just cannot see how the Fcer1a polymorphism (which should have an effect in basophils/eosinophils, but not in T cells) could be linked to IL17a production by T cells; this would need to involve signalling from activated T cells to basophils/eosinophils, and then Fcer1a polymorphism-dependent signalling from basophils/eosinophils back to T-cells to affect IL17a production; I guess it is not impossible, but I am unaware of anything like that. I think you need to provide a sound and specific rationale for this assay; just saying &quot;it could be acting indirectly on T-cells through various pathways, including via cytokine signalling, following Fcer1a expression by other cells&quot; (L578-581) is not enough.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added more justification, evidenced with nine new references, on this point, around the line numbers indicated. The reviewer is correct that expression of the Fcer1a protein in the high-affinity IgE receptor is mainly associated with cells like basophils or eosinophils – although such expression is sometimes reported, or considered to be important, in other cells. However, it should be kept in mind that the cells assayed here were derived ex vivo from a wild organism and were also cultured in a complex global mixture – within which the T-cells that were specifically stimulated would have initially occurred alongside other cell types bearing functional high-affinity IgE receptor. Thus, the stimulated T-cells would previously (in vivo) and during the assay (ex vivo) have been under the influence of high-affinity IgE receptor-bearing cells. Given the modern attitude to interaction networks between cells, and the known cytokine-producing and immunoregulatory properties of high-affinity IgE receptor-bearing cells – including demonstrated effects on helper T-cells in ex vivo co-culture and in in vivo models (see the new references) – it does not seem surprising, or unreasonable to expect, that there might be indirect interactions with T-cells. In the event, we did, in fact, find evidence of an effect of <italic>Fcer1a</italic> polymorphism on the responses in T-cell-stimulated cultures that corroborated our independent findings – and this provides its own justification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The presentation of the DGE analysis and GSEA of unstimulated splenocytes is improved, but still a bit confusing (L 199-238): (i) I think it would be good to make clear in the Results that the DGE analysis and GSEA are based on comparing individuals with the GC haplotype vs all others (so that the reader does not have to go the MandM to find this), (ii) using the term &quot;top-responding&quot; (L 206) implies that you are measuring the transcriptional response to some treatment, while you are just comparing baseline expression of GC vs others in males and females (or have I misunderstood something?); use &quot;differentially expressed&quot; or something similar instead, (iii) similarly, using the term &quot;upregulated&quot; (L 231) implies you measured the transcriptional response to some treatment; use &quot;more highly expressed in individuals with GC…&quot; or similar.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to point (i): We have now clarified in the Results that we compared individuals with vs. without the GC haplotype in the DGE analysis, by adding the following text:</p><p>“Differential gene expression (DGE) analysis was performed on unstimulated splenocytes taken from 53 males and 31 females assayed by RNASeq, with the aim of identifying individual genes which were differentially expressed between those individuals with and without a copy of the GC haplotype.”</p><p>We have done the same for the GSEA by editing/adding the following text in the Results:</p><p>“This analysis showed that both gene sets were more highly expressed in individuals with the GC haplotype than individuals without the haplotype, and that this was true for both males and females.”</p><p>In response to points (ii) and (iii): Throughout, we have replaced “top-responding” with “top differentially expressed”, and “upregulated” with “more highly relatively expressed in individuals with the GC haplotype” (or similar), as suggested by the Reviewer – adding the word ‘relatively’ to be precise (we report relative expression values, as detailed in the Materials and Methods).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>When it comes to the ex vivo stimulation of T cells, I strongly suggest you remove these results (L240-254); they just don't make sense from an immunological point of view. Unfortunately, this is one of few analyses that actually shows a sex-by-genotype effects, so removing this would weaken the support for sex-specific effects of the Fcer1a polymorphism even further.</p></disp-quote><p>This point has been addressed above – and more justification has been provided in the methods.</p></body></sub-article></article>
