Although nearly all animals are capable of some form of regeneration, the greatest regenerative capacity is found in the invertebrate species capable of rebuilding their entire body from small tissue fragments through a process called whole-body regeneration. In these highly regenerative systems, amputation injuries trigger morphogenesis on both sides of the amputation plane, leading to the reconstruction of all missing body parts. As a result, the two tissue fragments generated by an amputation will give rise to two morphologically identical individuals, even in cases where the two fragments need to regenerate entirely different structures. This raises the question of how the appropriate morphogenetic programs are activated in response to injury during whole-body regeneration.</p><p>Divergent morphogenetic outcomes during regeneration are driven by the differential activation of deeply conserved signaling pathways on either side of the amputation plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cary et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Holstein et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Owlarn and Bartscherer, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Srivastava et al., 2014</xref>). This results in patterning asymmetries that drive a divergence in gene expression in the two injury sites, leading to the regeneration of different structures. Currently, little is known about how these signaling pathways are reactivated during regeneration or how that reactivation is restricted to only one side of the amputation plane.</p><p>The canonical Wnt signaling pathway plays a central role in the positional specification of tissue regenerating along the primary body axis in several distantly related phyla, including cnidarians, acoels, and planarians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gurley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hobmayer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lengfeld et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Petersen and Reddien, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Srivastava et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stückemann et al., 2017</xref>). In these systems, amputations that transect the primary body axis (i.e., the oral-aboral axis in cnidarians or the anterior-posterior axis in planarians and acoels) induce new Wnt organizer formation on only one side of the amputation plane; in cnidarians, Wnt organizers form only at oral-facing wounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hobmayer et al., 2000</xref>), and in planarians and acoels, Wnt organizers form only at posterior-facing wounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gurley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Petersen and Reddien, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Srivastava et al., 2014</xref>). These similarities raise the possibility that injury-induced Wnt organizer formation is an ancestral feature of the metazoan wound response. However, establishing the plausibility of this hypothesis requires a thorough understanding of the regulation and function of injury-induced Wnt signaling in multiple distantly related animal regeneration models.</p><p>Wnt signaling has a similar function in specifying posterior tissue during regeneration in both acoels and planarians, but there appear to be marked differences in how the pathway is activated. During acoel regeneration, Wnt signaling is induced via the upregulation of the Wnt ligand <italic>wnt-3</italic> within 3 hr post amputation (hpa; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ramirez et al., 2020</xref>). This occurs only in posterior-facing injuries and requires the injury-responsive transcription factor (TF) Egr. In contrast, during planarian regeneration several positive regulators of canonical Wnt signaling, including the Wnt ligand <italic>wntP-1</italic>, are initially upregulated as part of an early generic response to all injuries and do not become restricted to posterior regeneration until between 24 and 48 hpa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gurley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Petersen and Reddien, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stückemann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wenemoser et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wurtzel et al., 2015</xref>); however, the secreted Wnt inhibitor <italic>notum</italic>, while also upregulated after all injuries, shows higher levels of upregulation in anterior-facing wounds by 6 hpa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Petersen and Reddien, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wurtzel et al., 2015</xref>). The TFs involved in upregulating <italic>wntP-1</italic> and <italic>notum</italic> in response to injury in planarians are not known. The differences between acoels and planarians suggest a lack of conservation in the gene regulatory networks that reactivate canonical Wnt signaling during bilaterian regeneration; however, it is unclear if this lack of conservation is the result of divergence from a shared ancestral state or because planarian and acoel regeneration evolved independently.</p><p>Cnidaria is the sister clade to bilateria and as such provides an informative context for questions related to the evolution of the metazoan wound response. <italic>Hydra vulgaris</italic> is a well-established cnidarian model that possesses an exceptional regenerative capacity, capable of fully rebuilding its body from tissue pieces containing as few as 300 cells, or ~1% of an adult polyp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shimizu et al., 1993</xref>). It has a simple body plan defined by a single oral-aboral axis, with tentacles and a hypostome at the oral end, referred to as the head, and adhesive cells at the aboral end, referred to as the foot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In intact <italic>Hydra</italic>, tissue polarity is dictated by two stable self-maintaining organizers, a head organizer and a foot organizer, that are found at the poles of the oral-aboral axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Webster, 1971</xref>). Although the molecular basis for the foot organizer is unknown, the <italic>Hydra</italic> head organizer is based on canonical Wnt signaling; the head organizer expresses multiple Wnt ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hobmayer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lengfeld et al., 2009</xref>), and Wnt signaling is necessary and sufficient for the specification of oral tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Broun et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gufler et al., 2018</xref>). Consistently, regenerating <italic>Hydra</italic> form new Wnt organizers at oral-facing, but not aboral-facing injuries within the first 12 hpa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">MacWilliams, 1983a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Petersen et al., 2015</xref>). Currently, there are conflicting data on the function and dynamics of Wnt signaling during cnidarian whole-body regeneration. In addition, the mechanism by which Wnt signaling is activated during regeneration is not well understood. These factors make it difficult to meaningfully compare the injury-induced Wnt signaling activity observed during <italic>Hydra</italic> regeneration to other whole-body regeneration models.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The initial transcriptional response to mid-gastric bisection is structure independent but diverges by 8 hr post amputation (hpa).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A diagram of the <italic>Hydra</italic> body plan.

Early grafting experiments in <italic>Hydra</italic> found that donor tissue fragments taken from recent head and foot amputations had an increased capacity to induce ectopic heads in host tissue, suggesting that head-specifying pathways are initially activated regardless of the structure being regenerated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">MacWilliams, 1983a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Müller, 1996</xref>). More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gufler et al., 2018</xref> found that several head-specific transcripts, including <italic>β-catenin</italic>, were initially upregulated during both head and foot regeneration in <italic>Hydra</italic>. They also reported that inhibiting TCF—the downstream transcriptional effector of Wnt signaling—prevented head and foot regeneration, raising the possibility that Wnt signaling may play an active role in both types of regeneration. In a pre-print manuscript, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wenger et al., 2019</xref> compared transcriptomic data collected during head and foot regeneration and found that transcriptional differences did not arise until between 4 and 8 hpa, indicating that the onset of head-specific transcription occurs several hours after wounding. However, these findings are contrasted by data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chera et al., 2009</xref>, who reported that injury-induced apoptosis—which they found occurred only at oral-facing amputations—leads to the activation of Wnt signaling during head but not foot regeneration by 1.5 hpa. These results appear inconsistent with reports of symmetric transcription during early head and foot regeneration as this would require that the dramatic asymmetries between the two types of regeneration at 1.5 hpa are not associated with any concomitant transcriptional changes.</p><p>The available data on <italic>Hydra</italic> regeneration leave significant gaps in knowledge that make it difficult to effectively understand the mechanisms underlying patterning during regeneration. In particular, the role of canonical Wnt signaling during <italic>Hydra</italic> regeneration remains incompletely characterized. Furthermore, it is unclear when and how canonical Wnt signaling genes, particularly Wnt ligands and negative regulators of Wnt signaling, are upregulated during head and foot regeneration following injury. We therefore sought to gain insight into these questions by comprehensively characterizing changes in chromatin accessibility and transcript abundance during the first 12 hr of head and foot regeneration—the period when new organizers are being formed. We found that the initial transcriptional response was indistinguishable during head and foot regeneration and included the symmetric upregulation of apoptotic markers and canonical Wnt signaling components. This was correlated with a symmetric increase in chromatin accessibility near predicted TCF binding sites, suggesting that Wnt signaling was initially activated during both head and foot regeneration. By 8 hpa, head and foot regeneration became transcriptionally distinct, which coincided with Wnt signaling transcripts becoming restricted to head regeneration. Inhibiting TCF delayed this transcriptional divergence genome-wide, suggesting a central role for canonical Wnt signaling during oral and aboral regeneration. A systematic analysis of chromatin accessibility data found that injury-induced Wnt component upregulation was likely driven by conserved injury-responsive basic leucine zipper (bZIP) TFs. In support of a link between the generic injury response and canonical Wnt signaling, we found that non-amputation injuries also triggered the upregulation of Wnt pathway components and could induce ectopic head formation when pre-existing organizers were removed. In addition, prolonged aboral-facing amputation injuries also induced ectopic head formation, but only after inhibitory signals from head-regenerating tissue were removed. Overall, these findings suggest that injuries initiate an oral patterning cascade regardless of the surrounding tissue context through the activation of canonical Wnt signaling, and that the outcome of this activation is regulated by long-range signals generated by organizers. These results also suggest that the upregulation of canonical Wnt signaling components may be part of an ancestral metazoan injury response.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The initial transcriptional response to injury does not depend on the structure being regenerated</title><p>To better understand the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms underlying positional divergence during head and foot regeneration in <italic>Hydra</italic>, we generated ATAC-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buenrostro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Corces et al., 2017</xref>) and RNA-seq libraries from polyps undergoing head and foot regeneration at 0, 3, 8, and 12 hr after mid-gastric bisection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">2</xref>).

ATAC-seq reveals accessible regions of chromatin, allowing us to identify active cis-regulatory elements genome-wide. In addition, comparing ATAC-seq data from different timepoints allows us to characterize changes in cis-regulatory element activity over the course of regeneration. The inclusion of RNA-seq data allows us to correlate changes in chromatin accessibility to changes in transcript abundance in nearby genes.

To do this, we identified transcripts and ATAC-seq peaks that changed in significantly different ways during the two types of regeneration (full differential gene expression results are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary files 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">2</xref>). At 3 hpa, although we detected extensive changes in chromatin accessibility and transcript abundance relative to uninjured controls, there were no significant differences in those changes when comparing head and foot regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>). However, by 8 hpa there was clear evidence of head and foot regeneration-specific transcriptional responses, with 63 transcripts and 464 peaks showing significant differences when comparing head and foot regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>). The number of transcriptional differences increased at 12 hpa, with 139 transcripts and 631 peaks exhibiting differential activation during the two types of regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G, H</xref>). We postulate that we observe a greater number of differentially activated peaks relative to transcripts because gene loci are often associated with multiple peaks. In addition, changes in certain individual cis-regulatory elements may not be sufficient to drive detectable differences in transcript abundance. Overall, our analysis demonstrates that the initial transcriptional response to amputation in <italic>Hydra</italic> does not depend on the structure being regenerated, and that transcriptional differences between head and foot regeneration begin to arise between 3 and 8 hpa.</p><p>To evaluate the congruence of our ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data, we used a hypergeometric enrichment test to determine if ATAC-seq peaks that were identified as head or foot regeneration-specific were significantly enriched near head or foot regeneration-specific gene loci. We found that structure-specific transcripts were significantly enriched in nearby structure-specific peaks (14.1-fold enrichment at 8 hpa, p=3.6e-25; 9.8-fold enrichment at 12 hpa, p=3.7e-40), demonstrating a meaningful correspondence between our ATAC-seq and RNA-seq datasets. We also compared our RNA-seq data with a previously released transcriptomic dataset of <italic>Hydra</italic> head and foot regeneration and found that there was a significant overlap in the head and foot regeneration-specific transcripts identified in the two studies (507-fold enrichment at 8 hpa, p~0; 35-fold enrichment at 12 hpa, p=1.11e-93) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wenger et al., 2019</xref>). We therefore found that the identification of transcriptional asymmetries during regeneration was highly reproducible across independent studies and across orthogonal next-generation sequencing methodologies.</p><p>We next used our chromatin accessibility data to identify candidate TFs that could plausibly underlie the observed transcriptional changes during regeneration. To do this, we used chromVAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schep et al., 2017</xref>) to systematically identify transcription factor binding motifs (TFBMs) throughout the genome and characterize how the aggregate chromatin accessibility near those motifs changed over the course of regeneration. Using this approach, we identified 32 TFBMs that were associated with significant variability in chromatin accessibility during the first 12 hr of regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>; TFBM sequences are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>). Consistent with our observation that the majority of transcriptional changes during head and foot regeneration were highly similar, we found that the large majority of injury responsive TFBMs had similar accessibility dynamics during oral and aboral regeneration. These data suggest that injury-responsive gene regulatory networks behave in a largely symmetric manner during early head and foot regeneration. Notably, we found that the TFBMs associated with increases in accessibility from 0 to 3 hpa included motifs associated with TFs known to play a role in the early injury response in bilaterians such as AP-1, Atf, and Egr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schäfer and Werner, 2007</xref>). The likely involvement of these TFs in <italic>Hydra</italic> regeneration suggests that they have an ancestral role in the metazoan wound response that predates the split of cnidaria and bilateria.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Mid-gastric bisection induces extensive apoptosis in oral and aboral-facing wounds by 3 hpa</title><p>Although our finding of an initially symmetric transcriptional response during head and foot regeneration is consistent with other transcriptional studies in <italic>Hydra</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gufler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wenger et al., 2019</xref>), it appears to be inconsistent with a previous report of extensive apoptosis occurring only at oral-facing amputations by 1 hpa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chera et al., 2009</xref>). Apoptosis induces dramatic changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sun et al., 2017</xref>), and asymmetric apoptosis would therefore be expected to result in dramatic transcriptional asymmetries during early head and foot regeneration. To reconcile these seemingly discrepant observations, we sought to characterize apoptosis during early head and foot regeneration using acridine orange, a previously validated stain for late-stage apoptotic cells in <italic>Hydra</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cikala et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kuznetsov et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Technau et al., 2003</xref>). In contrast to previous findings, we found no evidence of head regeneration-specific apoptosis at 1 hpa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J, L</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Rather, at this timepoint both head and foot regeneration exhibited limited apoptosis and appeared largely similar to uninjured controls. However, by 3 hpa, we observed extensive apoptosis throughout the body in both head and foot regenerating tissue fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K, M</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Consistent with this observation, our transcriptomic data showed that numerous apoptotic markers such as <italic>caspase-3c</italic>, <italic>bcl-like-6</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lasi et al., 2010</xref>), <italic>p53</italic>, and <italic>bax</italic> were upregulated in a similar fashion during head and foot regeneration at 3 hpa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B–I</xref>; the <italic>Hydra</italic> 2.0 genome gene model IDs for the gene names used throughout this study can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). These data indicate that amputations induce apoptosis in a symmetric manner at both oral and aboral-facing injuries by 3 hpa, consistent with a generic initial response to injury.

Therefore, to better understand how transcriptional symmetry is broken during regeneration, we looked for evidence of the reactivation of head and foot-specific pathways to identify the genes involved in the early stages of new head or foot organizer formation. This required that we first identify genes associated with uninjured head and foot tissue. To do this, we used a previously published single-cell RNA-seq atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Siebert et al., 2019</xref>) to identify genes that showed significantly different expression when comparing epithelial head cell clusters to epithelial foot cell clusters. We then characterized changes in the transcript abundance of these genes along with changes in chromatin accessibility in nearby peaks during regeneration.</p><p>At 8 hpa, the earliest time point in our dataset with transcriptional differences between head and foot regeneration, there were 55 transcripts and 426 peaks that showed significantly higher activation during head regeneration relative to foot regeneration. We found that 23/55 of the head regeneration-specific transcripts also exhibited head-specific expression in uninjured polyps, and 65/426 of the head regeneration-specific peaks were located near genes that exhibited head-specific expression in uninjured polyps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>). These early head-specific factors included previously characterized genes associated with the <italic>Hydra</italic> head such as <italic>wnt9/10c</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lengfeld et al., 2009</xref>), <italic>wnt3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hobmayer et al., 2000</xref>), <italic>brachyury1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Technau and Bode, 1999</xref>), <italic>naked cuticle</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Petersen et al., 2015</xref>), and <italic>sp5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vogg et al., 2019</xref>).

Because TCF constitutively binds to target loci and activates transcription in part by recruiting chromatin remodeling enzymes that increase chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cadigan, 2012</xref>), we interpret these data as indicative of a head regeneration-specific increase in TCF transcriptional activation. Thus, our analysis suggests that canonical Wnt signaling is activated in a head regeneration-specific manner by 8 hpa and is among the earliest asymmetries in gene regulatory network activity during regeneration, consistent with its important role in specifying oral tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Broun et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hobmayer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lengfeld et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>While examining the chromatin accessibility dynamics associated with TCF, we noted that although chromatin accessibility near TCF TFBMs increased in a head regeneration-specific manner from 8 hpa onward, at 3 hpa the TCF TFBM was associated with symmetric accessibility increases during both head and foot regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This raised the possibility that canonical Wnt signaling may be activated as part of the initial symmetric response to injury. To further explore the plausibility of this hypothesis, we used KEGG pathway annotations to systematically identify and characterize the expression dynamics of canonical Wnt pathway components during regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kanehisa and Goto, 2000</xref>).

Recent work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gufler et al., 2018</xref> found that the small molecule inhibitor iCRT14, which both inhibits the interaction between β-catenin and TCF and disrupts TCF binding to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gonsalves et al., 2011</xref>), blocked head and foot regeneration and prevented the downregulation of several head-specific transcripts during foot regeneration; however, because this study only characterized a small number of genes, the broader function of TCF in regulating transcription during regeneration remains incompletely understood. We therefore sought to characterize the impact of TCF inhibition during regeneration across the entire transcriptome by generating RNA-seq and ATAC-seq libraries from head and foot regenerating tissue fragments treated with iCRT14.</p><p>Before performing the regeneration timecourse experiments, we first validated that our iCRT14 treatment conditions yielded results consistent with previously published findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gufler et al., 2018</xref>).

We therefore proceeded with generating ATAC-seq and RNA-seq libraries from bisected animals undergoing either head or foot regeneration in the presence of 5 µM iCRT14, repeating the injury conditions used for our untreated sequencing libraries.

We also observed similar increases for the injury-responsive Egr TFBM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>).

To address this question, we identified head regeneration-specific transcripts that showed reduced upregulation in the presence of iCRT14. We found that TCF was required for the upregulation of numerous head-specific transcripts, including several Wnt signaling components such as <italic>sFRP</italic>, <italic>frizzled4/9/10</italic>, <italic>axin</italic>, and <italic>tcf</italic> itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E, F</xref>).

At 12 hpa, however, we began to see indications of context-dependent transcription in both our chromatin accessibility and transcriptomic data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E, F</xref>). These data therefore demonstrate a global delay in transcriptional divergence and suggest that TCF plays a critical role in the transition from the generic wound response to head and foot-specific transcription during regeneration.

A TF was considered to be a likely candidate if it matched the following criteria when comparing 0 and 3 hpa timepoints: (1) its binding motif was associated with an injury-induced increase in chromatin accessibility, (2) it was transcriptionally upregulated following injury, (3) its binding motif was significantly enriched in peaks that increased in accessibility following injury, and (4) its binding motif was found in predicted cis-regulatory elements near injury-responsive Wnt signaling components. Although these criteria do not definitively eliminate any given TF as a possible regulator, they can provide a basis for evaluating the relative plausibility of different candidates.</p><p>Our screen identified ETS, c/EBP, AP-1, and ATF TFBMs as candidate motifs driving injury-induced expression of at least one Wnt signaling component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Among our list of candidates, the ATF TFBM (also known as the cAMP response element [CRE])—which can be bound by the bZIP TFs Jun, Fos, CREB, and ATF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eferl and Wagner, 2003</xref>)—best matched our criteria. Of all TFBMs included in our analysis, the CRE TFBM was associated with the largest increase in accessibility from 0 to 3 hpa and showed the strongest enrichment in injury-responsive peaks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). These chromatin changes were also correlated with the upregulation of several bZIP TFs that are predicted to bind the CRE, including <italic>jun</italic>, <italic>fos,</italic> and two CREB-like TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>).

Overall, this analysis indicates that injury-responsive bZIP TFs are the most plausible regulators of canonical Wnt signaling components during the early generic wound response.

We therefore modified our approach by amputating head and foot tissue just prior to impalement. In the absence of pre-existing organizers, both 0 and 12 hr impalement injuries resulted in the formation of ectopic oral structures—ranging from single tentacles to fully formed heads—at one or both of the presumptive impalement sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, C</xref>).

These findings demonstrate that puncture wounds can induce ectopic head organizer formation, and that pre-existing organizers prevent injury-induced ectopic head formation in intact polyps.

However, the ectopic heads induced by impalement expressed Wnt pathway-associated transcripts at significantly higher levels than impaled tissue that did not form ectopic heads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Thus, the presence of pre-existing organizers inhibited the expression of injury-induced Wnt pathway genes, but it remains unclear when and how this inhibition occurred.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Regenerating heads can inhibit ectopic head formation at aboral-facing amputations</title><p>The role that pre-existing head and foot tissue played in preventing ectopic head formation following transverse impalement raised the question of why ectopic heads do not form at aboral-facing injuries when both the head and foot are amputated. We hypothesized that in such cases heads do not form at aboral-facing amputations because—although head patterning pathways are initially activated in both injuries—the oral-facing amputation recovers its ability to inhibit ectopic heads faster than the aboral-facing amputation, thus preventing ectopic head formation at the aboral pole. This hypothesis is consistent with the observations that regenerating heads gradually regain their inhibitory capacity over time and that head regeneration is faster when head amputations are located closer to the oral pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">MacWilliams, 1983a</xref>). We therefore sought to test if regenerating head tissue can prevent ectopic head formation at aboral-facing amputations.</p><p>To address this question, we first sought to increase the capacity for aboral-facing amputations to form ectopic heads by amputating both the head and aboral third of <italic>Hydra</italic> polyps and impaling the regenerating animals through the two resulting amputation injuries for 12 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). After impalement, we either let the animals recover unperturbed or we re-amputated the regenerating head promptly after the animals were removed from the fishing line. Thus, the former set of injury conditions prolonged both the oral and the aboral-facing amputations, while the latter set of conditions only prolonged the aboral-facing amputation. We found that when both amputations were prolonged there was no ectopic head formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F, G</xref>). However, when only the aboral-facing amputation was prolonged, head structures formed at both poles of the oral-aboral axis in ~61% of cases (13/23 animals). These findings demonstrate that prolonged aboral-facing amputation injuries can induce head formation, and that regenerating heads can inhibit ectopic head formation at aboral-facing amputations. Notably, foot regeneration occurred in all cases, such that one pole of the regenerated animal had a head while the other pole had both a foot and a full or partial head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). This therefore suggests that the specification of foot tissue during regeneration occurs independently from head specification.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Using RNA-seq and ATAC-seq, we have comprehensively characterized transcription during the first 12 hr of head and foot regeneration in <italic>Hydra</italic>. We found that the initial response to amputation at 3 hpa did not depend on the structure being regenerated and included widespread apoptosis and the upregulation of canonical Wnt signaling components at both oral- and aboral-facing wounds. During this initial response, we also observed symmetric increases in chromatin accessibility near predicted TCF binding sites, suggesting that Wnt signaling is activated during early head and foot regeneration. By 8 hpa, however, Wnt signaling component expression and chromatin accessibility near TCF TFBMs became specific to head regeneration. Inhibiting TCF delayed the onset of head and foot regeneration-specific transcription transcriptome-wide, demonstrating a central role for the Wnt-responsive TF during the two types of regeneration. We found that Wnt pathway components were also upregulated in non-regenerative puncture wounds, supporting the conclusion that these genes are part of the generic transcriptional response to injury. Furthermore, removing pre-existing organizers induced puncture wounds to form ectopic head organizers, and experimentally blocking wound closure for 12 hr increased the penetrance of this phenotype. This demonstrates that injury signals are capable of initiating head patterning, even in the context of non-amputation injuries. We also found that prolonged foot amputation injuries could induce ectopic head formation, and that this phenotype could be suppressed by regenerating head tissue. To our knowledge, our work is the first demonstration in any animal that injuries alone are sufficient to induce secondary axes.</p><p>Based on our findings, we propose the following model of Wnt signaling activity during <italic>Hydra</italic> regeneration: injuries activate canonical Wnt signaling regardless of the injury type, which has the potential to give rise to a new head organizer through an autocatalytic feed-forward loop; however, in the case of foot regeneration or non-amputation injuries, inhibitory signals from pre-existing head tissue or oral-facing amputations block the Wnt feed-forward loop and thus prevent ectopic head formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). A version of this model was originally proposed over 30 years ago based on an extensive body of research that used classical tissue manipulation techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gierer and Meinhardt, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kobatake and Sugiyama, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">MacWilliams, 1983a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Newman, 1974</xref>); however, this original model lacked an underlying molecular mechanism, relying instead on abstract theoretical actors to account for the injury-induced activation of head patterning—a phenomenon referred to as the ‘injury effect’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kobatake and Sugiyama, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">MacWilliams, 1983a</xref>).

However, we found no evidence of these early asymmetries. Instead, we found that the apoptotic and transcriptional response to amputation was indistinguishable between head and foot regeneration at 3 hpa. The recently reported finding that MAP kinases—highly conserved upstream regulators of wound repair and apoptosis—showed identical levels of activation during head and foot regeneration is also consistent with the existence of an initial generic response to injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tursch et al., 2020</xref>). Finally, our finding that TCF is required for the activation of foot-specific transcription during regeneration appears to be inconsistent with injury-induced Wnt signaling only occurring during head regeneration.</p><p>Our results highlight the existence of notable similarities in the transcriptional regulation of Wnt signaling components across distantly related regeneration models. In addition to <italic>Hydra</italic>, Wnt signaling components are upregulated as part of an early generic response to injury in the cnidarian species <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic> and <italic>Clytia hemisphaerica</italic> as well as in planarians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">DuBuc et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gurley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Petersen and Reddien, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schaffer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sinigaglia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stückemann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wurtzel et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, recent research has demonstrated that MAP kinase (MAPK) signaling is required for the upregulation of Wnt pathway components during the generic wound response in both planarians and <italic>Hydra</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Owlarn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tursch et al., 2020</xref>). Although the TFs that regulate Wnt components during regeneration in planarians are unknown, our systematic analysis of injury-responsive Wnt component regulatory sequences in <italic>Hydra</italic> found that all of the most plausible regulators of Wnt pathway genes during <italic>Hydra</italic> regeneration are TFs that are directly regulated by MAPK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Whitmarsh, 2007</xref>). This raises the possibility that MAPK-induced TFs are conserved regulators of Wnt pathway transcripts during regeneration. Both <italic>Nematostella</italic> and bilaterians diverged from <italic>Hydra</italic> over 500 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Erwin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Khalturin et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, these similarities span sizable evolutionary timescales and suggest the existence of deeply conserved aspects of the gene regulatory networks involved in the response to injury during regeneration.</p><p>There nonetheless exist important differences in the regulation of Wnt signaling during regeneration in bilaterians and <italic>Hydra</italic>. In planarians, Wnt signaling is restricted to tail regeneration through the head regeneration-specific upregulation of the Wnt inhibitor <italic>notum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Petersen and Reddien, 2011</xref>). In cnidarians, <italic>notum</italic> and canonical Wnt ligands are co-expressed in both uninjured and regenerating head tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Petersen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Siebert et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, in contrast to <italic>Hydra</italic>, pre-existing organizers do not appear to influence patterning during planarian regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Petersen and Reddien, 2011</xref>). In acoels, Wnt pathway components are not part of the generic transcriptional response to injury and are instead rapidly upregulated specifically at aboral-facing amputations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ramirez et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, the TF Egr is responsible for the injury-induced expression of <italic>wnt-3</italic> in acoels, but Egr does not appear to be a plausible regulator of injury-responsive Wnt pathway genes in <italic>Hydra</italic>. Thus, there are likely significant differences in the regulation of Wnt signaling during regeneration in <italic>Hydra</italic>, planarians, and acoels.</p><p>There also appear to be differences in the downstream effects of Wnt pathway gene upregulation during whole-body regeneration in <italic>Hydra</italic> and bilaterians. In planarians, there are conflicting reports on whether canonical Wnt signaling is activated as part of the generic response to injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stückemann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sureda-Gómez et al., 2016</xref>); however, knocking down Wnt signaling genes causes head regeneration to occur at both anterior and posterior-facing amputations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gurley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Petersen and Reddien, 2008</xref>), demonstrating that the upregulation of Wnt transcripts is not required for the specification of head tissue. Similar knockdown phenotypes have also been reported in acoels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Srivastava et al., 2014</xref>). This is in contrast to <italic>Hydra</italic>, where TCF inhibition blocks regeneration of both the oral and aboral ends. Our findings that TCF TFBM accessibility increased during both early head and foot regeneration and that non-amputation injuries could induce ectopic heads strongly suggest that the transcriptional upregulation of Wnt signaling components during the generic wound response is accompanied by the activation of Wnt signaling in <italic>Hydra</italic>. Furthermore, the finding that inhibiting TCF blocks head and foot regeneration indicates that this activation likely plays an important role in both types of regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gufler et al., 2018</xref>). However, further characterization of the Wnt pathway in <italic>Hydra</italic>, in particular the identification of direct Wnt pathway targets and the characterization of β-catenin protein dynamics during the early wound response, will be required to fully understand the role of Wnt signaling during <italic>Hydra</italic> regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>Hydra vulgaris</italic>)</td><td>AEP</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Martin et al., 1997</xref>; <break/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wittlieb et al., 2006</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>Hydra vulgaris</italic>)</td><td>105</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chapman et al., 2010</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>Hydra vulgaris</italic>)</td><td>Basel</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Technau and Holstein, 1995</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Tagment DNA Enzyme <break/>and Buffer Small Kit</td><td>Illumina</td><td>20034197</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Kapa mRNA-seq Hyper kit</td><td>Roche</td><td>KK8581</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>MinElute PCR Purification Kit</td><td>QIAGEN</td><td>28004</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>DNase Set</td><td>QIAGEN</td><td>79254</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>RNA Clean and Concentrator kit</td><td>Zymogen</td><td>R1017</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>iCRT14</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>SML0203</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>R</td><td>R</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_001905">SCR_001905</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Agencourt AMPure XP beads</td><td>Beckman Coulter</td><td>A63881</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>2X NEBNext master mix</td><td>NEB</td><td>M0541S</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>M-MLV RNase H Minus <break/>Point Mutant Reverse <break/>Transcriptase</td><td>Promega</td><td>M3682</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>SsoAdvanced universal <break/>SYBR green master mix</td><td>Bio-Rad</td><td>1725271</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Code and data availability</title><p>All code used in this study is available both as a git repository at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/cejuliano/jcazet_regeneration_patterning">https://github.com/cejuliano/jcazet_regeneration_patterning</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cazet and Juliano, 2021</xref>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:a541b634602578a7ea5b13fd6b785ac897a73209;origin=https://github.com/cejuliano/jcazet_regeneration_patterning;visit=swh:1:snp:7b6d3b2e63ad63fc8adaf701cd79327deed4f4d9;anchor=swh:1:rev:6e9b9067f0adf1bd223c5ee0194d75847fa18321/">swh:1:rev:6e9b9067f0adf1bd223c5ee0194d75847fa18321</ext-link>) and on Dryad at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.25338/B8S612">https://doi.org/10.25338/B8S612</ext-link>.

To track the original orientation of the oral-aboral axis of impaled tissue fragments, one end of the fishing line was marked with a permanent marker and all <italic>Hydra</italic> were impaled such that their aboral pole pointed towards the marked end of the fishing line. The number of ectopic tentacles was quantified 4 days post injury, and significant differences in the number of ectopic tentacles were determined using Student’s t-test in R.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Quantitative reverse transcription PCR</title><p>Transversely impaled Basel, AEP, or 105 strain <italic>Hydra</italic> were prepared as described above, with 15 polyps per biological replicate and a total of three biological replicates per treatment. The number of replicates was chosen based on the widely used standard of three biological replicates per treatment for qPCR experiments. For samples collected immediately after impalement, tissue surrounding the impalement site, corresponding to ~1/4 of the total polyp length, was collected for downstream RNA isolation.</p><p>To quantify gene expression in ectopic heads, Basel strain animals lacking pre-existing organizers were impaled for 12 hr and then left to recover. As a control, body column tissue was collected from animals that were impaled for 12 hr with their organizers intact after 4 days of recovery. Both the ectopic heads and the control tissue were collected 4 days post injury.</p><p>RNA purification was performed using the same protocol as described above for RNA-seq library preparation. cDNA was synthesized using 1 µg of purified RNA and Promega M-MLV RNase H Minus Point Mutant Reverse Transcriptase (M3682; Promega, Madison, WI) using the manufacturer’s recommended protocol for oligo dT-primed synthesis. cDNA was then diluted 1:3 in nuclease-free water for use in qPCR experiments.</p><p>Three technical replicates of 10 μl qPCR reactions per sample were prepared using Bio-Rad SsoAdvanced universal SYBR green master mix (1725271; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and were run on a CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (1855195; Bio-Rad). Cq values from technical replicates were pooled for subsequent analyses. <italic>rp49</italic> was used as an internal control to calculate ∆Cq values after first being found to give similar results across all treatments when compared to a second housekeeping gene, <italic>actin</italic>. Statistically significant differences in mRNA expression were calculated by performing an ANOVA on 2<sup>-∆Cq</sup> values followed by Tukey’s HSD test in R using the agricolae package.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Bruce Draper, Gary Wessel, Rob Steele, Bryan Teefy, Sergio Campos, Ben Cox, Thomas Holstein, Anja Tursch, Prashanth Rangan, Jeffrey Farrell, and Stefan Materna for critical reading of the manuscript; the members of the Juliano lab for their thoughtful input on this study; Vanessa Rashbrook, Emily Kumimoto, Siranoosh Ashtari, and Lutz Froenicke from the DNA Technologies and Expression Analysis Core at the UC Davis Genome Center (supported by NIH Shared Instrumentation Grant 1S10OD010786-01) for technical advice and assistance with library preparation and sequencing; and the Vincent J.

positional specification in <italic>Hydra</italic> using RNAseq and ATACseq to profile transcriptome/chromatin accessibility changes that occur within the first 12 hours after injury. Although the initial response appears similar, the oral/aboral injuries begin to diverge by 8 hrs after injury, with several components of the Wnt pathway more highly upregulated in oral vs aboral regeneration. As a potential mechanism for this divergence, TCF binding sites appear more open in oral vs aboral regeneration. A TCF inhibitor previously shown to block regeneration prolongs high expression of transcription factors fos, jun, creb, and AP-1, and there are CRE response elements upstream of these genes. In the final, very clever experiment of the paper, the authors prolong wound signaling in the presence/absence of tissue organizers and find that increased wound signaling increases the prevalence of head regeneration at wound sites. Overall, this paper makes an important contribution to our understanding of regeneration by providing a clear molecular explanation for an older descriptive model and confirms a general theme in metazoan regeneration that initial signaling is general, but that it gets refined by signals from the rest of the tissue.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Oral Regeneration Is the Default Pathway Triggered by Injury in <italic>Hydra</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The three reviewers agreed that this manuscript reports interesting observations and is a nice gene expression resource with some associated hypotheses but lacks the level of experimental insight that would provide a major advance in the field. The descriptive genomics/transcriptomics data sets are valuable but should be experimentally tested. The reviewers concluded that without further experiments to test specific requirements or regulatory logic, the present work is primarily adding correlative gene expression evidence to a previously known phenotypic result which dampened their enthusiasm. In addition, the conceptual interpretation of the results clings unnecessarily closely to the Gierer/Meinhardt framework and important findings since the publication of this framework have not been taking into consideration.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This very clearly written manuscript from Cazet et al. sets out to define the molecular logic of positional specification in <italic>Hydra</italic> using RNAseq and ATACseq to profile transcriptome/chromatin accessibility changes that occur within the first 12 hours after injury. Although the initial response appears similar, the oral/aboral injuries begin to diverge by 8 hrs after injury, with several components of the Wnt pathway more highly upregulated in oral vs aboral regeneration. As a potential mechanism for this divergence, TCF binding sites appear more open in oral vs aboral regeneration. A TCF inhibitor previously shown to block regeneration prolongs high expression of transcription factors fos, jun, creb, and AP-1, and there are CRE response elements upstream of these genes. In the final, very clever experiment of the paper, the authors prolong wound signaling in the presence/absence of tissue organizers, and find that increased wound signaling increases the prevalence of head regeneration at wound sites. Overall, this paper makes an important contribution to our understanding of regeneration by providing a clear molecular explanation for an older descriptive model, and confirms a general theme in metazoan regeneration that initial signaling is general, but that it gets refined by signals from the rest of the tissue.</p><p>1. The mechanisms are nicely described with bioinformatics, but functional experiments would really add significantly to the manuscript. For example, if the impaling experiment in Figure 5 is done in the presence of the TCF inhibitor, does it blunt the aberrant head regeneration? The increase in Wnt expression stimulated regardless of the presence of head/foot organizer tissue is an unsatisfying explanation, because the Wnts obviously increase dramatically in response to the injury. Perhaps this single timepoint is not the appropriate one to test; RT-qPCR timecourses may provide more resolution and identify some differences.</p><p>2. In the other <italic>Hydra</italic> strains that don't regenerate heads at the wound site, is there less Wnt/wntless/brachyury expression? Characterizing Wnt expression in these strains in response to injury would be both interesting, potentially useful, and may further strengthen the model.</p><p>3. The increased accessibility of TCF binding sites in head regeneration (Figure 2G) is beautiful, but would be more informative and compelling if placed in context. For example, Gehrke et al. included a comprehensive analysis of motifs in Hofstenia.</p><p>4. Use of the TCF inhibitor throughout assumes that the effect shown in the Gonsalves paper causes a similar effect in this lab, and is of similar penetrance. It is important to verify that the TCF inhibitor prevents both head and foot regeneration to provide confidence in the inhibition.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Owing to its spectacular ability to regenerate entire polyps from small tissue fragments, <italic>Hydra</italic> is a historically important model for animal regeneration. When polyps are bisected along their oral-aboral axis, an initial wound response occurs and is followed by either oral or aboral regeneration. In &quot;Oral Regeneration Is the Default Pathway Triggered by Injury in <italic>Hydra</italic>,&quot; Cazet and Juliano investigate the transcriptional mechanisms underlying this differential oral-aboral response to injury in <italic>Hydra</italic>. The authors utilize RNA-seq and ATAC-seq libraries to look at gene expression changes on a global scale, as well as drug inhibition studies to investigate the role of canonical Wnt signaling in the regenerative response. Their key finding is that Wnt signaling is activated as a component of the generalized injury response but only maintained in regenerating oral fragments, implying that aboral regeneration must entail a context specific repressive effect.</p><p>Overall, the genomic aspects of the work (RNA-seq and ATAC-seq) appear technically strong. My chief concerns, while not an expert in the field, surround the conceptual novelty and related to that, the degree of advance provided by the manuscript.</p><p>1. Conceptual novelty/degree of advance. The authors should make a stronger effort to differentiate this study from others, particularly Wegner et al. 2019 which really covers much of the same ground, defines the same oral-aboral transcriptional divergence time, and comes to some conceptually similar conclusions regarding the general injury response. It would also help general readers to point more explicitly toward the aspects of this work that are unique or different from what was previously known (eg Petersen et al. MBE 2015; Gufler et al. 2018 and the extensive literature on Wnt signaling in <italic>Hydra</italic> oral patterning/regeneration). As it reads now, the paper is well executed and may reflect a useful resource of -omics data for <italic>Hydra</italic> specialists, but the results are largely incremental and confirmatory of the long-known role of Wnt signaling in injury responses, regeneration, and body patterning throughout animals (eg Whyte et al. 2012).</p><p>2. Functional requirements for Wnt signaling. Gufler et al. (2018) utilized iCRT14 treatments to directly demonstrate a requirement for Wnt pathway activity in aboral regeneration. Here the authors use a similar paradigm to characterize the transcriptional changes that result from inhibiting Wnt signaling in oral and aboral fragments. Without further experiments to test specific requirements or regulatory logic, the present work is primarily adding correlative gene expression evidence to a previously known phenotypic result.</p><p>3. Wnt activation. To better understand how Wnt is regulated during regeneration, the authors looked for binding sites for known injury responsive TFs is cis regulatory regions of Wnt pathway components, and then correlated these sites with changes in chromatin accessibility during regeneration. A large number of such sites are identified and used to implicate bZIP TFs as &quot;likely playing a role&quot;, but no validation is provided (either loss of function studies or even transgenic reporter constructs with and without the elements proposed to drive injury-responsive expression). Without this level of experimentation, the present work is a great resource of gene expression data and possible new hypothesis but lacks the experimental component that would represent a major advance in the field.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This manuscript examines the interplay between wound polarity and gene expression during <italic>Hydra</italic> regeneration. Key points include i) the initial activation of Wnt pathway component expression irrespective of wound polarity, ii) the enrichment of bZIP binding sites in the promoters of multiple Wnt genes; iii) prolonged expression of early wound response transcription factors upon interference with Wnt signaling and iv) the induction of hypostome-like features in the <italic>Hydra</italic> foot upon experimental prevention of wound closure. Overall, the authors interpret their data as confirmation of a Gierer/Meinhardt model that was proposed 40 years ago.</p><p>Although the combination of RNAseq and ATACseq provides interesting glimpses of the underlying gene regulatory mechanisms, much of the data and analyses appear somewhat premature. This is especially the case for the latter parts of the manuscript that go beyond what is already known from published RNAseq studies (e.g., common wound response; upregulation of Wnt pathway components early during regeneration, timing of head organizer specification). Moreover, the conceptual interpretation of the results and the model the authors arrive at is overly narrow in parts. Altogether, this manuscript does report interesting observations, but would require extensive revisions to be suitable for publication.</p><p>1. The authors need to make their data more accessible.</p><p>Figures 1 and 3 require heat maps to illustrate i) the specific expression changes of all the IRTs and IRPs and ii) the identity of the underlying genes. This is essential for making the data broadly accessible to the community. Further, broadening the text perspective beyond Wnt &amp; usual suspects would make the manuscript a lot more engaging, i.e., by naming other genes with interesting expression dynamics or enrichment analyses of Wnt pathway components versus all differentially expressed genes or the genes that become upregulated upon Wnt inhibition in 4.</p><p>2. The manuscript takes an overly simplistic view of Wnt signaling.</p><p>a. Expression of Wnt signaling components does not equate pathway activation- this assumption is made at multiple points in the text and needs to be corrected.</p><p>b. Changes in the accessibility of TCF binding sites does not equate Wnt signaling. The authors disregard that TCF can bind either bind βCatenin or transcriptional repressors (e.g., Groucho). Hence the &quot;opening&quot; of TCF binding sites alone does not signify the activation of Wnt signaling, as it could merely reflect the establishment of Wnt sensitivity or even Wnt-independent gene repression. The authors also cite the molecular mechanism of action of iCRT14 in this context, which is relevant to the interpretation of their results.</p><p>c. The authors appear to entirely disregard the many different branches of Wnt signaling that could conceivably result in very different signals in spite of common expression of a subset of transduction components.</p><p>Alltogether, these considerations make the &quot;default activation of the head program&quot; a very tentative premise at best. Without a read-out of canonical Wnt signaling activity and comparison of signaling activity between tail and foot regenerating wounds, it is equally possible that the wound type independent expression of Wnt only establishes the potential for future pathway activity, with the actual initiation of signaling requiring a context-dependent trigger.</p><p>3. The conceptual interpretation of the results clings unnecessarily closely to the Gierer/Meinhardt framework and remains insufficiently tested.</p><p>a. Important findings since Gierer/Meinhardt are not cited or introduced, including for example the suggestion of wound-type specific responses already within the first hour after injury (Chera et al., 2009) or the recent report of dynamic, actin-mediated intrinsic tissue polarization (Livshits et al., 2017). These papers and their key findings need to be cited in the introduction and they need to be discussed in the context of an evaluation of the author's model in the discussion. Moreover, the authors missed that a wound-context independent activation of Wnt pathway transcription also occurs in planarians. This paper needs to be cited (Stuckemann et al., 2017) and the interpretation of wound type independent Wnt signaling in this study might also be of interest in contemplating the <italic>Hydra</italic> data.</p><p>b. Necessary tests of the present model include examination of the assumption that the inhibition of Wnt signaling is really sufficient for the conversion of an established head organizer into a foot organizer. This could be easily done by treating regenerating <italic>Hydra</italic> with iCRT14 post 8 h or when the putative Wnt signaling requirement in the initial wound response has passed. Further interesting validations/tests could include the examination of position-dependence of impalement-induced head formation along the body axis (does the efficiency increase with the distance to existing or former &quot;inhibitor sources&quot;? Are any injuries capable of inducing feet?) or qPCR comparisons of Wnt induction efficiency between the two <italic>Hydra</italic> strains.</p><p>c. The model disregards the organizing influence of the <italic>Hydra</italic> foot. As is, one might expect that pieces resulting from bisection and additional foot amputation might regenerate double heads (due to absence of the &quot;source&quot; of the long-range inhibitor). This is not observed. Also, the close spacing of the injury-induced double heads in Figure 5 is a problem for the Gierer/Meinhardt framework, as the inhibitor emanating from each head would be expected to interfere with the formation/maintenance of the other head organizer due to their close spacing.</p><p>4. Validation of the importance of bZIP binding motifs in Wnt promoter regions.</p><p>As is, this section reads very much like a &quot;just so&quot; story. First, the authors have to analyze the probability of bZIP binding motif occurrence per kb in the <italic>hydra</italic> genome. Second, they should examine the occurrence of the motif in non wound-sensitive promoters. Third, they have to demonstrate significant enrichment of the motif in wound-induced genes. The strong emphasis on the importance of the bZip binding motifs in the present manuscript further necessitates experimental validation- either in the manuscript itself or by citing published data in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Generic Injuries Are Sufficient to Induce Ectopic Wnt Organizers in <italic>Hydra</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

One misunderstanding we would like to point out: the CRE elements are found in the regulatory regions of the Wnt genes, not in the regulatory regions of the bZIP TFs (see Figure 4).

As such, we’d like to highlight the functional data that we included in our original submission, including the iCRT14-treated RNA-seq and ATAC-seq datasets presented in figure 3 and the tissue manipulation experiments presented in figure 5. These data allow us to functionally validate our use of chromatin accessibility data to quantify TCF transcriptional activity (figure 3A), to identify novel regulatory functions for TCF during regeneration (Figure 3B-H), and to demonstrate the sufficiency of injury to induce ectopic Wnt organizers (Figure 5).</p><p>We also agree that the addition of an experiment to determine if injury-induced ectopic head formation is TCF-dependent would improve the manuscript. Therefore we performed the experiment suggested by the reviewer and present the results in Figure 5—figure supplement 1A. We found that iCRT14 significantly reduced the number of ectopic tentacles formed after prolonged transverse impalement, thus demonstrating that the phenotype is TCF-dependent.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The increase in Wnt expression stimulated regardless of the presence of head/foot organizer tissue is an unsatisfying explanation, because the Wnts obviously increase dramatically in response to the injury.

However, in our original manuscript, it was not our intention to use these data to address that particular question. Rather, we were aiming to demonstrate that despite the different outcomes, the initial response was nonetheless the same. This was in service of our broader argument that injury-induced expression of Wnt pathway components is not sensitive to signals from the surrounding tissue context during the generic phase of the injury response (even if that generic phase is prolonged to last for 12 hours).</p><p>In interpreting the results of the impalement experiments, we worked under the assumption that the observation that one treatment condition resulted in ectopic head organizers and the other did not was sufficient evidence that the two conditions resulted in differences in Wnt signaling activity. Essentially, our position is that the extensive research on the role of Wnt signaling in head specification in <italic>Hydra</italic>​ ​ renders the alternative hypothesis (that head organizer formation did not result from differential Wnt signaling activity) implausible. We believe that the fact that aspects of our rationale were not made fully explicit in the original text contributed to the lack of clarity on this point. We hope that the extensive changes we made to our discussion of the impalement experiments help to make understanding our rationale more straightforward.</p><p>Although we still maintain that head formation can be taken as a reliable proxy for Wnt signaling activity and Wnt pathway gene expression, we nonetheless recognize that investigating later time points using qPCR could serve as a valuable validation of our underlying assumptions. We therefore characterized Wnt pathway gene expression four days after impalement in animals that did form ectopic heads and those that did not (Figure 5—figure supplement 1H). We found that ectopic heads expressed Wnt pathway genes at significantly higher levels than tissue lacking ectopic heads. This therefore demonstrates that pre-existing organizers downregulated Wnt pathway genes at some point following impalement, although it is unclear when or how.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

In our revised manuscript, we have included qPCR data showing that 12 hours of impalement resulted in the significant upregulation of Wnt pathway genes in both 105 and AEP strain animals (Figure 5—figure supplement 1F,G). Thus, while ectopic head formation is strain specific (we observe it in Basel and 105 animals but not AEP animals) the injury induced expression of Wnt pathway components following puncture wounds is not.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

In our revised manuscript, we have entirely changed the way in which we frame our data. The introduction in the revised text now states more clearly the current gaps in knowledge in the <italic>Hydra</italic> regeneration literature, and the Results section now includes more specific explanations of the novelty of our findings. We hope that these changes will provide the reader with a better understanding of this manuscript’s contribution to regeneration biology.</p><p>A critical point that we did not sufficiently stress in our original manuscript is that a generic role for Wnt signaling during an initial context-independent injury response in <italic>Hydra</italic> is not long known or well established. Indeed, the best known molecular model of <italic>Hydra</italic> regeneration claims that Wnt signaling is exclusively activated during head regeneration within 1 hour post amputation (Chera et al., 2009). In addition, recent work by Ramirez et al. (2020) reports that Wnt signaling is rapidly activated during tail, but not head regeneration in aceols. Our work is the first to document the upregulation of Wnt ligands and other Wnt signaling components in non-regenerative injuries and during foot regeneration in <italic>Hydra</italic>. We are also the first to characterize TCF activity during Hydra regeneration. These findings significantly impact not only our understanding of cnidarian regeneration, but also our understanding of the evolution of the metazoan wound response. In our revised manuscript, we now more clearly explain the importance and novelty of our findings on Wnt signaling during regeneration. In particular, we now extensively discuss both the Chera et al. and Ramirez et al. publications in our introduction and discussion. Furthermore, we provide new data that directly refutes the claim made in the Chera et al. paper that injury apoptosis occurs in oral-facing but not aboral-facing amputation injuries (Figure 1J-M, Figure 1—figure supplement 5).</p><p>The recently released pre-print from Wenger et al. (2019) does contain an RNA-seq dataset that overlaps with our own. Based on this RNA-seq data, the authors report the existence of an initial context independent transcriptional response to injury and estimate that transcription during head and foot regeneration diverge between 4 and 8hpa. These findings are highly consistent with the conclusions we draw in figure 1(C-H) of our manuscript. However, we wish to emphasize that our study goes far beyond these two observations and makes numerous additional contributions that are wholly distinct from the work of Wenger et al.</p><p>1. Wenger et al. do not report the initial context-independent upregulation of Wnt signaling components during the context-independent injury response in their paper. However, we did find that this phenomenon is supported by their data after performing our own analysis.</p><p>2. They do not characterize chromatin remodeling and are thus far more limited in their ability to shed light on transcriptional regulation during head and foot regeneration.</p><p>3. They do not explore potential mechanisms that drive the transcriptional divergence of head and foot regeneration, nor do they explore potential mechanisms driving injury-responsive Wnt expression.</p><p>4. Their study does not include the functional experiments included in our study (figures 3 and 5)</p><p>The Gufler et al. (2018) paper was the first to report that TCF is required for both head and foot regeneration in <italic>Hydra</italic> using the TCF/β-catenin inhibitor iCRT14. In addition, they show that TCF inhibition prevents the downregulation of 8 head regeneration-specific genes during foot regeneration. Based on these findings, they proposed that Wnt signaling may play a role during foot regeneration. In our work, we extend these initial findings by comprehensively characterizing chromatin accessibility and transcript abundance during head and foot regeneration in the presence of iCRT14. With these data we find that TCF is required for the divergence in expression of all transcripts during head and foot regeneration, not just the 8 head-specific genes reported in Gufler et al. In addition, we find that TCF is required for the proper downregulation of the injury response and for the upregulation of head and foot specific transcripts. These inhibitor-dependent changes in transcription demonstrate a causal relationship, and allow us to better understand TCF function during regeneration. Importantly, these findings are wholly novel and are not foregone conclusions that can be deduced from the work of Gufler et al. Finally, by using our chromatin accessibility data to characterize TCF transcriptional activation during regeneration, we are able to get a readout of Wnt signaling activity that is comparable to popular TCF-based reporter assays (e.g. TOPFLASH). Such a readout, in conjunction with our transcriptomic data, gives us significant insight into Wnt signaling activity during regeneration that was not possible given the limited molecular data presented in Gufler et al. In our revised manuscript, we now more clearly delineate which of the results from our iCRT14-treated RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data are recapitulations of previous findings (Figure 3 – —figure supplement 1) and which are novel to this study (Figure 3, Figure 3—figure supplement 2).</p><p>The Petersen et al. (2015) paper included a comprehensive transcriptomic characterization of head regeneration in <italic>Hydra</italic>. Because this study exclusively focused on head regeneration, it does not shed light on how head and foot regeneration diverge, which is the primary concern of our paper. In addition, all the points outlined above for Wenger et al. also apply.</p><p>While there are numerous other studies covering Wnt signaling’s role in <italic>Hydra</italic> patterning, they do not characterize the pathway outside the context of head specification during regeneration and homeostasis. Therefore, our work looking at Wnt signaling during foot regeneration and in response to non-amputation injuries is novel.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Functional requirements for Wnt signaling. Gufler et al. (2018) utilized iCRT14 treatments to directly demonstrate a requirement for Wnt pathway activity in aboral regeneration. Here the authors use a similar paradigm to characterize the transcriptional changes that result from inhibiting Wnt signaling in oral and aboral fragments. Without further experiments to test specific requirements or regulatory logic, the present work is primarily adding correlative gene expression evidence to a previously known phenotypic result.</p></disp-quote><p>Please refer to our response to the first comment for the ways in which our study is distinct from the work presented by Gufler et al. Briefly, these are the novel functional results arising from our iCRT14 experiments:</p><p>1.

To better understand how Wnt is regulated during regeneration, the authors looked for binding sites for known injury responsive TFs is cis regulatory regions of Wnt pathway components, and then correlated these sites with changes in chromatin accessibility during regeneration. A large number of such sites are identified and used to implicate bZIP TFs as &quot;likely playing a role&quot;, but no validation is provided (either loss of function studies or even transgenic reporter constructs with and without the elements proposed to drive injury-responsive expression). Without this level of experimentation, the present work is a great resource of gene expression data and possible new hypothesis but lacks the experimental component that would represent a major advance in the field.</p></disp-quote><p>We wholeheartedly agree that loss of function and reporter experiments would be ideal approaches for directly testing our hypothesis that Wnt signaling components are directly regulated by injury-responsive bZIP transcription factors. We have either attempted, or are currently attempting both types of experiments; however, we face significant technical hurdles presented by our model system. The <italic>Hydra</italic> research community is small, and lacks many of the tools that are readily available in more widely used model systems. Our lab is working on improving those tools, but we have only limited resources to address these significant challenges.</p><p>Currently, the best established protocol for gene knockdown in <italic>Hydra</italic> is to create a transgenic line that constitutively expresses a RNAi hairpin directed against the gene of interest. Although we have attempted to establish such knockdown lines for multiple injury-responsive bZIP transcription factors, we have failed to generate any KD positive transgenic lines. This can occur when a gene of interest is essential. Therefore perturbing the function of these transcription factors will likely first require the development of an inducible knockdown system in <italic>Hydra</italic>.</p><p>The only available method for transgenesis in <italic>Hydra</italic> (random insertion of injected circular DNA) makes performing reporter experiments difficult. We are currently unable to control where the injected plasmid breaks or where it is inserted in the genome. Reporter experiments therefore require a large number of injections for each construct being tested. We are currently attempting to generate lines to test the function of putative bZIP binding sites in the Wnt9/10c promoter, but this work is slow and has been hindered by the pandemic. Our plan is to present such data in a follow-up study.</p><p>Importantly, while the above experiments are necessary to test the hypothesis that bZIPs directly regulate Wnt components, they are not necessary for the broader conclusion of the paper, which is that injuries induce Wnt signaling outside the context of head amputation. Functional data supporting this conclusion is presented in figure 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This manuscript examines the interplay between wound polarity and gene expression during Hydra regeneration. Key points include i) the initial activation of Wnt pathway component expression irrespective of wound polarity, ii) the enrichment of bZIP binding sites in the promoters of multiple Wnt genes; iii) prolonged expression of early wound response transcription factors upon interference with Wnt signaling and iv) the induction of hypostome-like features in the Hydra foot upon experimental prevention of wound closure. Overall, the authors interpret their data as confirmation of a Gierer/Meinhardt model that was proposed 40 years ago.</p><p>Although the combination of RNAseq and ATACseq provides interesting glimpses of the underlying gene regulatory mechanisms, much of the data and analyses appear somewhat premature. This is especially the case for the latter parts of the manuscript that go beyond what is already known from published RNAseq studies (e.g., common wound response; upregulation of Wnt pathway components early during regeneration, timing of head organizer specification). Moreover, the conceptual interpretation of the results and the model the authors arrive at is overly narrow in parts. Altogether, this manuscript does report interesting observations, but would require extensive revisions to be suitable for publication.</p></disp-quote><p>We first wish to clarify a few apparent misunderstandings. Regarding point iv, we did not show the induction of hypostome-like features in the foot following prolonged injuries. Rather, we demonstrated that prolonged injuries could induce ectopic heads in body column tissue. We would also like to point out that, with the exception of <italic>β</italic>-<italic>catenin</italic>, our paper is the first to describe the upregulation of Wnt pathway genes during aboral regeneration and in response to non-amputation injuries. While the RNA-seq dataset presented in Wenger et al. does indeed show the upregulation of Wnt pathway genes during foot regeneration, we were only able to make that conclusion by performing our own analysis on their data, as they do not report this finding anywhere in their manuscript. We would also point out that the Wenger et al. data set is from a pre-print manuscript and has not undergone peer review.</p><p>We also wish to clarify that we are not claiming to confirm the original Gierer-Meinhardt model as it was proposed in the initial 1972 publication. Rather, our data provides a molecular basis for the observation made after the Gierer-Meinhardt model was proposed that injuring <italic>Hydra</italic> tissue promotes the formation of a new head organizer, which we refer to as the “oral induction model.” We do invoke a Gierer-Meinhardt type of reaction-diffusion system when presenting our model of patterning during regeneration, but our model incorporates numerous observations made after the original Gierer-Meinhardt publication.</p><p>Upon reflection, we believe that our decision to focus on the “oral induction model” as a way to frame our paper led to several issues in our manuscript that were highlighted by the reviewer’s comments. In particular, we did not adequately address the ambiguities and gaps in knowledge currently present in the <italic>Hydra</italic> regeneration literature on Wnt activity and Wnt pathway gene expression during head and foot regeneration. We also did not properly convey that resolving the question of Wnt pathway regulation during <italic>Hydra</italic> regeneration has important implications regarding the evolution of regeneration in metazoans, especially given the findings on Wnt regulation in acoels and planarians. We have made a significant effort to rework the text to address these issues. We now extensively discuss both the planarian and acoel regeneration literature in our introduction and discussion. We also directly address the model presented by Chera et al. (2000), both through modifications to the text and through the inclusion of additional experiments (Figure 1J-M, Figure 1—figure supplement 5). Our Results section has also been reworked to more clearly explain the novelty of our findings in the context of the pre-existing literature. In addition, please refer to our response to comment 1 from reviewer 2 for our in-depth explanation of the ways in which our study can be differentiated from other related works.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors need to make their data more accessible.</p><p>Figures 1 and 3 require heat maps to illustrate i) the specific expression changes of all the IRTs and IRPs and ii) the identity of the underlying genes. This is essential for making the data broadly accessible to the community.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that transparency is crucial when presenting scientific findings. We would like to highlight that we did make a meaningful effort to make our data accessible to readers. In particular, we included full results tables for the differential analyses we performed in Supplementary files 1 and 2. In addition, we made all code used in this study publicly available upon submission both on GitHub and Dryad. We also deposited both raw and processed data, including fastq files, peak files, read count matrices, and bigwig files on GSE and made these data publicly available upon submission.</p><p>We did inadvertently omit the results tables from the single cell structural enrichment analysis that were used to generate the plots in Figure 2A-D. We have now added these tables to Supplementary files 1 and 2. We have also added the tables that were directly used to generate all scatter plots and heatmaps throughout the manuscript as ‘source data’ files in our revised submission. We have also added Supplementary file 3, which includes results from our HOMER motif enrichment analysis and our chromVAR chromatin accessibility analysis.</p><p>We do not believe that the inclusion of heatmaps would be an effective way to make our data more accessible, as the number of peaks/transcripts being considered (hundreds to thousands in many cases) would either require that the heatmaps be excessively large or would render the gene labels too small to be legible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further, broadening the text perspective beyond Wnt &amp; usual suspects would make the manuscript a lot more engaging, i.e., by naming other genes with interesting expression dynamics or enrichment analyses of Wnt pathway components versus all differentially expressed genes or the genes that become upregulated upon Wnt inhibition in 4.</p></disp-quote><p>In writing this paper, we chose to primarily focus our attention on genes that had either been previously characterized in <italic>Hydra</italic> or were directly relevant to the paper’s main focus—the regulation of Wnt signaling during regeneration. Our intention was that readers with a broader curiosity in our data could easily identify other genes of interest using the supplementary tables we provided. This choice was based on the fact that we did not intend to present our work as a resource paper, but rather we sought to focus on a specific set of questions.</p><p>However, we would note that figures 1 and 3 are not exclusively focused on Wnt signaling. In figure 1 of our original manuscript, we highlighted the foot-specific transcription factors (<italic>distall-less</italic> and <italic>nk-2</italic>). In figure 3 we highlighted multiple genes that aren’t Wnt pathway components including <italic>prdl-a</italic>, <italic>gremlin-like</italic>, <italic>budhead</italic>, <italic>creb</italic>, <italic>fos</italic>, and <italic>jun</italic>. Additionally, we highlighted TCF-dependent changes in the accessibility of the injury responsive TRE and Erg transcription factor binding motifs. In our revised manuscript we additionally highlight two novel foot specific TFs that are among the first to be upregulated in a foot regeneration-specific fashion (<italic>gata-3-like</italic> and <italic>foxd2-like</italic>; lines 219-221). We also note that these foot TFs exhibit TCF-dependent expression during regeneration (Figure 3E,F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The manuscript takes an overly simplistic view of Wnt signaling.</p><p>a. Expression of Wnt signaling components does not equate pathway activation- this assumption is made at multiple points in the text and needs to be corrected.</p><p>b. Changes in the accessibility of TCF binding sites does not equate Wnt signaling. The authors disregard that TCF can bind either bind βCatenin or transcriptional repressors (e.g., Groucho). Hence the &quot;opening&quot; of TCF binding sites alone does not signify the activation of Wnt signaling, as it could merely reflect the establishment of Wnt sensitivity or even Wnt-independent gene repression. The authors also cite the molecular mechanism of action of iCRT14 in this context, which is relevant to the interpretation of their results.</p><p>c. The authors appear to entirely disregard the many different branches of Wnt signaling that could conceivably result in very different signals in spite of common expression of a subset of transduction components.</p><p>Alltogether, these considerations make the &quot;default activation of the head program&quot; a very tentative premise at best. Without a read-out of canonical Wnt signaling activity and comparison of signaling activity between tail and foot regenerating wounds, it is equally possible that the wound type independent expression of Wnt only establishes the potential for future pathway activity, with the actual initiation of signaling requiring a context-dependent trigger.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is important to acknowledge that expression of wnt signaling components does not equate to an increase in Wnt signaling activity, which is why we did so in our original manuscript: “Although canonical Wnt signaling components were upregulated during both head and foot regeneration, it was not clear if this resulted in the downstream activation of Wnt responsive transcription.”</p><p>We would also like to note that the language at line 163 of our original manuscript did not claim that the upregulation of Wnt pathway transcripts was evidence that the pathway was active, merely that it suggested that such a hypothesis was plausible.</p><p>However, we disagree with the reviewer that changes in TCF binding site accessibility can’t be used to characterize Wnt signaling activity. β-catenin/TCF transcriptional activation is driven in part through the recruitment of histone acetyl-transferases (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC302022/), which increase chromatin accessibility. Further, transcriptional repressors such as groucho inhibit transcription by decreasing chromatin accessibility through the recruitment of histone de-acetylases</p><p>(ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC316998/). Therefore, an increase in the accessibility of TCF binding sites would be an expected consequence of an increase in TCF transcriptional activation, not repression. Our updated manuscript clarifies this rationale. Furthermore, our iCRT14 data demonstrates that chromatin accessibility changes near TCF binding motifs during regeneration are TCF dependent (Figure 3A), providing validation for this approach.</p><p>While we recognize that Wnt signaling is highly complex, we do not believe that this fact prevents us from using our data to characterize canonical Wnt signaling. TOPFLASH—a TCF-based reporter construct—is a well-established and widely used method for assaying Wnt signaling activity. Our ATAC-seq analysis provides information that is comparable to TOPFLASH, as it measures TCF activity via TCF-dependent changes in chromatin accessibility. Therefore, despite the complexities of Wnt signaling, we argue that TCF transcriptional activation can provide a meaningful readout of Wnt signaling activity.</p><p>Although we maintain that the above rationale justifies our conclusions regarding Wnt signaling during regeneration, we nonetheless recognize that stating that Wnt signaling is activated during normal foot regeneration is a strong claim that would ideally be validated through multiple sources of evidence (such as characterizing β-catenin protein abundance and localization). We have therefore softened the language we use in discussing our ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data throughout our updated manuscript to be less definitive.</p><p>However, our primary conclusion that head formation is the default outcome promoted by injury does not hinge on how we interpret our sequencing data. Rather, the primary evidence for this conclusion is presented in Figure 5, where we demonstrate that prolonged injuries in the body column exclusively leads to ectopic head formation—despite the fact that mid-body column tissue is equally capable of regenerating either a head or a foot. In addition, because Wnt signaling is necessary and sufficient for head formation, our finding that prolonged puncture wounds and aboral amputations induce ectopic heads demonstrates that the generic injury response can induce Wnt signaling. We provide further support for this conclusion with the addition of data showing that iCRT14 significantly reduces the number of ectopic tentacles formed after prolonged injury, demonstrating that the phenotype is TCF-dependent.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The conceptual interpretation of the results clings unnecessarily closely to the Gierer/Meinhardt framework and remains insufficiently tested.</p><p>a. Important findings since Gierer/Meinhardt are not cited or introduced, including for example the suggestion of wound-type specific responses already within the first hour after injury (Chera et al., 2009) or the recent report of dynamic, actin-mediated intrinsic tissue polarization (Livshits et al., 2017). These papers and their key findings need to be cited in the introduction and they need to be discussed in the context of an evaluation of the author's model in the discussion. Moreover, the authors missed that a wound-context independent activation of Wnt pathway transcription also occurs in planarians. This paper needs to be cited (Stuckemann et al., 2017) and the interpretation of wound type independent Wnt signaling in this study might also be of interest in contemplating the Hydra data.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed above, we agree we should have included discussion of Chera et al., 2009 in our manuscript. We have addressed this issue in the revised text and now discuss the findings from Chera et al. throughout the manuscript. We have also added additional experimental evidence that directly addresses aspects of the Chera model (Figure 1J-M, Figure 1—figure supplement 5).</p><p>Regarding the data from Livshits et al. (2017), while their findings are interesting, we do not believe their work influences the interpretation of our data. Livshits et al. exclusively focused on how axis orientation is re-established in injury contexts when pre-existing positional information has presumably been lost (i.e. in very small tissue fragments). In contexts where a defined Wnt gradient is present, it is well established that Wnt signaling overrides cytoskeletal orientation. Furthermore, Livshits et al. do not perform any experiments that shed light on how the direction of polarity along the rebuilt axis is established. Their work therefore does not provide insight into the question of head vs. foot decisions in their chosen injury context. Our injury context does not cause the loss of the pre-existing axis and is primarily concerned with head vs. foot specification. Additionally, more recent research has called into question important aspects of the findings presented in the Livshits et al. study (pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32871156). We therefore argue that omission of Livshits et al. from our study does not meaningfully detract from the interpretation of our data.</p><p>We agree that findings from the planarian literature have interesting and important implications for the interpretation of our data. While we did cite the planarian literature (see list below), we did omit two important studies (Stuckmann et al., 2017 and Petersen and Reddien, 2009). We have rectified these omissions in our updated manuscript. More broadly, we have modified the text to more extensively discuss findings from bilaterian whole-body regeneration research in both the introduction and discussion.</p><p>Planarian papers cited in the original manuscript:</p><p>Owlarn and Bartscherer, 2016</p><p>Wurtzel et al., 2015</p><p>Wenemoser et al., 2012</p><p>Owlarn et al., 2017</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Necessary tests of the present model include examination of the assumption that the inhibition of Wnt signaling is really sufficient for the conversion of an established head organizer into a foot organizer. This could be easily done by treating regenerating Hydra with iCRT14 post 8 h or when the putative Wnt signaling requirement in the initial wound response has passed. Further interesting validations/tests could include the examination of position-dependence of impalement-induced head formation along the body axis (does the efficiency increase with the distance to existing or former &quot;inhibitor sources&quot;? Are any injuries capable of inducing feet?) or qPCR comparisons of Wnt induction efficiency between the two Hydra strains.</p></disp-quote><p>We wish to clarify an apparent misunderstanding mentioned by the reviewer. We are not claiming that inhibition of Wnt signaling is sufficient for conversion of an established head organizer into a foot organizer. We do claim that Wnt signaling is transiently activated during early foot regeneration, but in our discussion of this hypothesis we do not claim that this transient activation temporarily results in head organizer formation. Head and foot organizers are self-maintaining and insensitive to inhibitory signals from the surrounding tissue. If a true head organizer formed during foot regeneration it would always trigger ectopic head formation.</p><p>We believe that treating regenerating <italic>Hydra</italic> after 8 hours post amputation would likely not be informative, because our molecular data indicates that Wnt signaling has already been repressed in foot regenerates by this time point. In addition, we believe that exploring the effect of position along the oral-aboral axis on ectopic head formation would be largely redundant with results already published in the literature (in particular the MacWilliams studies from 1983), which extensively tested the influence of position on secondary axis formation in <italic>Hydra</italic> using grafting experiments.</p><p>To provide additional evidence on the induction of canonical Wnt signaling following aboral-facing amputations, we have added new experimental data in Figure 5E-G of the updated manuscript. In these experiments, we demonstrate that prolonging aboral-facing amputation injuries can induce ectopic head formation at the aboral pole, and that this can be inhibited by tissue undergoing head regeneration at the oral pole. Because Wnt signaling is necessary and sufficient for head organizer formation in <italic>Hydra</italic>, these data demonstrate that aboral injuries can induce Wnt signaling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. The model disregards the organizing influence of the Hydra foot. As is, one might expect that pieces resulting from bisection and additional foot amputation might regenerate double heads (due to absence of the &quot;source&quot; of the long-range inhibitor). This is not observed. Also, the close spacing of the injury-induced double heads in Figure 5 is a problem for the Gierer/Meinhardt framework, as the inhibitor emanating from each head would be expected to interfere with the formation/maintenance of the other head organizer due to their close spacing.</p></disp-quote><p>The question of why ectopic heads don’t form when both organizers are amputated is indeed interesting and highly relevant to our model. Our inclusion of the experiments in Figure 5E-G addresses this question by looking at this precise injury context. Within the context of our model, the lack of ectopic head formation can be accounted for through two observations: 1) regenerating head tissue gradually increases the amount of inhibition it produces throughout the course of regeneration, 2) head regeneration is faster the closer the amputation site was to the original head organizer. Thus, in cases where both organizers are amputated, the oral-facing amputation injury will recover its inhibitory capacity first, and will subsequently block head formation at the aboral-facing amputation (these points are discussed in the results). The data we present in Figure 5E-G are consistent with this model, as they demonstrate that aboral amputations can induce ectopic heads, but that this can be blocked by tissue undergoing head regeneration at the oral pole.</p><p>The close spacing of the injury induced ectopic heads in some transversely animals can also be readily incorporated into our model based on the observation that regenerating heads do not become an effective source of inhibition for some time after they have become committed to head formation (see the discussion in MacWilliams et al., 1983, doi.org/10.1016/0012-1606(83)90325-1). In transverse impalement experiments, both injury sites are at the same position along the oral-aboral axis, and so head organizer formation would be expected to have highly similar kinetics at the two injuries. Essentially, the difference in how long it takes the two organizers to form does not provide enough time for either nascent head to produce sufficient inhibition to block the other. As previously noted, once established, head organizers are self-sufficient and insensitive to inhibitory signals from the surrounding tissue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Validation of the importance of bZIP binding motifs in Wnt promoter regions.</p><p>As is, this section reads very much like a &quot;just so&quot; story. First, the authors have to analyze the probability of bZIP binding motif occurrence per kb in the hydra genome. Second, they should examine the occurrence of the motif in non wound-sensitive promoters. Third, they have to demonstrate significant enrichment of the motif in wound-induced genes. The strong emphasis on the importance of the bZip binding motifs in the present manuscript further necessitates experimental validation- either in the manuscript itself or by citing published data in a peer-reviewed journal.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that motif enrichment analyses would be an informative addition to the paper. We have in fact performed such analyses and found that CRE sequences are significantly enriched in wound responsive elements. We omitted that work in favor of using the chromVAR analytical approach, but we have now integrated it into our updated manuscript (Figure 4A; Supplementary file 3).</p><p>We also agree that, as originally presented, the consideration of only a single injury-responsive motif appears rather arbitrary. In our revised manuscript, we present a systematic analysis of all motifs that exhibited an injury induced increase in chromatin accessibility from 0 to 3 hpa (Figure 4A). Using this systematic approach, we find that while there are other motifs that could plausibly play a role in injury-induced Wnt upregulation, CRE-binding bZIPs remain the most likely candidate regulators.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions:</p><p>1. The authors now added acridine orange stainings to demonstrate that apoptosis is induced in head and foot regenerates, which is in contrast to what Chera et al. published in 2009. However, the acridine orange stainings have quite a bit of background and variability (and they are not quantified). As the Chera et al., data also looks convincing, the authors are encouraged to repeat a TUNEL staining that Chera et al., used. This would allow a better comparison between the differing results.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that repeating the published TUNEL staining experiment would be a helpful clarification regarding the discrepancy between our manuscript and Chera et al., 2009. Before using acridine orange, we did try TUNEL staining and found that the results were inconsistent and gave high background at early regeneration time points. For this reason, we turned to acridine orange as an alternative approach because it has been previously validated as specifically staining apoptotic cells based on nuclear morphology and was shown to mirror TUNEL staining in <italic>Hydra</italic> (Cikala et al., 1999; Kuznetsov et al., 2002). With acridine orange, we obtain very clear results so this is what we included in the manuscript. In preparing this revision, we did try the TUNEL staining again, but we still could not obtain reasonable results. It should be noted that we saw no evidence of asymmetric TUNEL staining in the experiments that we performed. Rather, the results showed high background and were inconsistent from animal to animal (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). It is important to point out that our RNA-seq results mirror our acridine orange results in that we see symmetric upregulation of genes involved in apoptosis in both head and foot regeneration. Therefore, we have two different lines of evidence that refute the published TUNEL results in Chera et al. In addition, we have added a citation to our manuscript for a recent pre-print article that included TUNEL staining at 2 hpa that also found no evidence of asymmetric apoptosis.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>TUNEL staining gives inconsistent results in uninjured and regenerating tissue.</title><p>Whole uninjured animals, or animals that were bisected and allowed to regenerate for 1 or 3 hours, were fixed and then stained using the ApopTag TUNEL kit (Σ-Aldrich, S7110).
