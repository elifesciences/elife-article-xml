The cellular mechanisms underlying mechanically induced hair-cell damage and subsequent repair are not completely understood. Hair cells in neuromasts of larval zebrafish are structurally and functionally comparable to mammalian hair cells but undergo robust regeneration following ototoxic damage. We therefore developed a model for mechanically induced hair-cell damage in this highly tractable system. Free swimming larvae exposed to strong water wave stimulus for 2 hr displayed mechanical injury to neuromasts, including afferent neurite retraction, damaged hair bundles, and reduced mechanotransduction. Synapse loss was observed in apparently intact exposed neuromasts, and this loss was exacerbated by inhibiting glutamate uptake. Mechanical damage also elicited an inflammatory response and macrophage recruitment. Remarkably, neuromast hair-cell morphology and mechanotransduction recovered within hours following exposure, suggesting severely damaged neuromasts undergo repair. Our results indicate functional changes and synapse loss in mechanically damaged lateral-line neuromasts that share key features of damage observed in noise-exposed mammalian ear. Yet, unlike the mammalian ear, mechanical damage to neuromasts is rapidly reversible.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mechanical damage</kwd><kwd>hair cell</kwd><kwd>ribbon synapse</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>repair</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC016066</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sheets</surname><given-names>Lavinia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC017166</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Indzhykulian</surname><given-names>Artur A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC006283</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Warchol</surname><given-names>Mark E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011912</institution-id><institution>Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sheets</surname><given-names>Lavinia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001290</institution-id><institution>Amelia Peabody Charitable Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sheets</surname><given-names>Lavinia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mechanically induced injury of zebrafish lateral-line organs shares key features of damage observed in noise-exposed mammalian ears, such as inflammation and synapse loss, yet, unlike mammals, rapidly repairs following damage.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hair cells are the sensory receptors of the inner ear and lateral-line organs that detect sound, orientation, and motion. They transduce these stimuli through deflection of stereocilia, which opens mechanically gated cation channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">LeMasurier and Gillespie, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Qiu and Müller, 2018</xref>) and drives subsequent transmission of sensory information via excitatory glutamatergic synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Glowatzki and Fuchs, 2002</xref>). Excessive mechanical stimulation, such as loud noise, can damage hair cells and their synaptic connections to afferent nerves. The degree of damage depends on the intensity and duration of the stimulus, with higher levels of traumatic noise producing structural damage to sensory epithelia, including hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cho et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nordmann et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Slepecky, 1986</xref>) and lower levels leading to various pathologies, including damage to the hair-cell mechanotransduction complex/machinery and stereocilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gao et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Husbands et al., 1999</xref>), misshapen hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bullen et al., 2019</xref>), synaptic terminal damage, neurite retraction, and hair-cell synapse loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fernandez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Henry and Mulroy, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kujawa and Liberman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Puel et al., 1998</xref>). In addition to directly damaging hair cells, excess noise also initiates an inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hirose et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kaur et al., 2019</xref>). Such inflammation is mediated by macrophages, a class of leukocyte that responds to injury by clearing cellular debris and promoting tissue repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wynn and Vannella, 2016</xref>).</p><p>The variety of injury and range of severity suggests multiple mechanisms are involved in hair-cell organ damage associated with exposure to strong stimuli. Also unknown are the cellular processes mediating repair following such trauma. While hair cells show a partial capacity for repair of stereocilia and synaptic connections, some sub-lethal damage to hair cells is permanent. Numerous studies of the mammalian cochlea suggest that a subgroup of inner hair-cell synapses are permanently lost following noise exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cho et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hickman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kujawa and Liberman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shi et al., 2013</xref>). Glutamate excitotoxicity is likely the pathological event that initiates noise-induced hair-cell synapse loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Puel et al., 1998</xref>), but the downstream cellular mechanisms are still undefined. Further, the cellular mechanisms that promote hair-cell synapse recovery following damage-induced loss are also not understood.</p><p>Zebrafish have proven to be a valuable model system for studying the molecular basis of hair-cell injury and repair. Zebrafish sensory hair cells are structurally and functionally homologous to mammalian hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coffin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kindt and Sheets, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sebe et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast to other vertebrate model organisms, zebrafish hair cells are optically accessible in whole larvae within the lateral-line organs. These sensory organs, called neuromasts, contain clusters of ~14 hair cells each and are distributed throughout the external surface of the fish to detect local water movements. Zebrafish can repair and regenerate damaged tissues, including lateral-line organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kniss et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xiao et al., 2015</xref>). This capacity for organ repair combined with optical accessibility allows us to study cellular and synaptic damage and repair in vivo following mechanical trauma.</p><p>In order to model physical damage to hair-cell organs in zebrafish lateral line, we developed a protocol to mechanically stimulate the lateral line of free-swimming 7-day-old larvae. Using this protocol, we were able to induce mechanical injury to lateral-line organs that resembled the trauma observed in the mammalian cochlea following acoustic overstimulation. We observed synapse loss in a subset of neuromasts that appeared morphologically intact, as well as hair-cell loss and afferent neurite retraction in a subset of neuromasts that appeared morphologically disrupted. Hair-cell mechanotransduction, as measured by uptake of the cationic dye FM1-43, was significantly reduced after mechanical injury. We also observed an inflammatory response similar to that observed in the mammalian cochlea after noise trauma. Remarkably, mechanically induced lateral-line damage appeared to rapidly recover; hair-cell number and morphology returned to normal within 4 hr following exposure, concurrent with clearance of cellular debris by macrophages. Additionally, neuromasts showed partial recovery of afferent innervation within 2 hr following exposure and completely recovered hair-cell morphology and FM1-43 uptake within 4 hr. Cumulatively, these results support that mechanically injured neuromasts show similar features of damage observed in noise exposed ears, yet rapidly repair.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mechanical overstimulation of zebrafish lateral-line hair cells</title><p>To mechanically damage hair cells of lateral-line organs in free-swimming 7-day-old zebrafish, we developed a stimulation protocol using an electrodynamic shaker to create a strong water wave stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The frequency used for mechanical stimulation was selected and further verified (see Method Details) based on previous studies showing 60 Hz to be within the optimal upper frequency range of mechanical sensitivity of superficial posterior lateral-line neuromasts, which respond maximally between 10and 60 Hz, but a suboptimal frequency for hair cells of the anterior macula of the inner ear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Levi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Trapani and Nicolson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Weeg et al., 2002</xref>). Dorsal-ventral displacement of a six-well dish at 60 Hz and acceleration of 40.3 m/s<sup>2</sup> (±0.5 m/s<sup>2</sup>) created water flow and disturbance of the water surface that was strong enough to trigger ‘fast start’ escape responses—a behavior mediated in part by zebrafish lateral-line organs to escape predation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> inset) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McHenry et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nair et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Intense water wave produced by shaker apparatus stimulates lateral-line hair cells and evokes a relevant behavior response.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The apparatus: a magnesium head expander holding a 6-well dish mounted on a vertically oriented electrodynamic shaker housed inside a sound-attenuation chamber.

To verify that the observed escape responses were mediated predominantly by flow sensed by lateral-line hair cells rather than hair cells of the macula, we exposed a group of larvae to low dose (3 µM) copper sulfate (CuSO<sub>4</sub>) for 1 hr to specifically ablate lateral-line hair cells, but leave hair cells of the ear intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Olivari et al., 2008</xref>). Following a 2 hour recovery after CuSO<sub>4</sub> treatment, we recorded fish behavior with a high-speed camera during the stimulus (1000 fps for 10 s) and compared the responses of fish with lesioned lateral-line organs with those of untreated control siblings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref> ). When subjected to intense water flow, we found that ‘fast start’ responses—defined as a c-bend of the body occurring within 15 ms followed by a counter-bend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burgess and Granato, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McHenry et al., 2009</xref>)—occurred significantly less frequently in larvae with ablated lateral line organs than in siblings with intact lateral line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and E</xref>; avg. ‘fast start’ responses:: 0.4 ( ± 0.1)/s in lateral-line ablated vs 1.5 ( ± 0.1)/s in control; three trials,10 s per trial; **p = 0.0043).

The 10-min break in exposure was introduced early on when establishing the stimulus duration because it appeared to enhance larval survival; it was therefore maintained throughout the study for consistency. Fish were euthanized and fixed immediately after exposure, then processed for immunohistofluorescent labeling of hair cells and neurons. Unexposed sibling fish served as controls. As posterior lateral-line (pLL) neuromasts have been shown to specifically initiate escape behavior in response to strong stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haehnel et al., 2012</xref>), analysis of the morphology of pLL neuromasts L3, L4, and L5 was conducted for exposed and control larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Initially, we divided the observed neuromast morphology into two categories: ‘normal’, in which hair cells were radially organized with a relatively uniform shape and size, and ‘disrupted’, in which the hair cells were misshapen and displaced to one side, with the apical ends of the hair cells localized anteriorly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>; see Methods Details for measurable criteria). Position of the neuromast along the tail was also associated with vulnerability to disruption; we observed a gradient of damage in the pLL from rostral to caudal that is L5 was more susceptible to disruption than L4, which was more susceptible to disruption than L3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>; Repeated measure One-way ANOVA *p = 0.0386, **p = 0.0049, *** = 0.0004).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Morphological changes in pLL neuromast hair cells exposed to strong water wave stimulus.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of a larval zebrafish.

Analysis of fixed specimens, as well as time-lapse imaging of living fish (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hirose et al., 2017</xref>), has demonstrated that macrophages migrate into neomycin-injured neuromasts and actively phagocytose the debris of dying hair cells. To determine whether a similar inflammatory response also occurs after mechanical injury to the lateral line, we characterized macrophage behavior after sustained stimulation. These studies employed Tg(<italic>mpeg1:yfp</italic>) transgenic fish, which express YFP in all macrophages and microglia. Fish were fixed immediately after exposure, or allowed to recover for 2, 4, or 8 hr. Control fish consisted of siblings that received identical treatment but were not exposed to mechanical stimulation.

Larval zebrafish lateral-line hair cells each have a hair bundle consisting of a single kinocilium flanked by multiple rows of actin-rich stereocilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kindt et al., 2012</xref>). To determine if our exposure protocol damaged apical hair-cell structures, we used confocal imaging and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to assess hair bundle morphology in both unexposed control larvae and larvae fixed immediately following sustained exposure. All neuromasts throughout the fish were evaluated, but to remain consistent with our fluorescence imaging results, we closely assessed the appearance of the caudal pLL neuromasts. We found the caudal neuromasts to be more damaged than the ones positioned more rostrally: the frequency of neuromasts with apparently disrupted appearance increased the closer its position to the tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is consistent with our fluorescence observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref> B) in which L5 neuromasts were more likely to be disrupted than more anteriorly positioned L3.</p><p>A closer examination of neuromast morphology revealed a difference of the kinocilia length and bundling. The neuromasts of the control fish carry a bundle of long (10–15 µm), uniformly shaped kinocilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A–E</xref>). In contrast, the neuromasts of the fish fixed immediately after sustained exposure often appear to carry much shorter kinocilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F–H</xref>, yellow arrows), which lack bundling and, in some cases, pointing to different directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9G and H</xref>). The apparent kinocilia length difference between control and overstimulated neuromasts suggests at least some kinocilia may undergo a catastrophic damage event at the time of stimulation, as their distal parts break off the hair cells. This is further supported by some examples of kinocilia with thicker, ‘swollen’ proximal shafts closer to the cuticular plate of the cell, some of which extend into a thinner distal part while others appear to lack the distal part completely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9I–K</xref>, yellow arrowheads). Accordingly, the average diameter of kinocilia at the level of the hair bundle (L2-5) was significantly larger than control, with a few kinocilia showing dramatically thicker widths ~ 2 x greater than the thickest control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9L</xref>; ***p = 0.0007). When measured ~3–5 µm above the bundle, the exposed neuromast kinocilia have a somewhat larger average diameter relative to control, but not as dramatic as observed at the base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9M</xref>; *p = 0.0243). Stereocilia bundles from both groups of animals carried tip links, but we were unable to systematically evaluate and quantify their abundance.

Using this method, we observed: (i) hair-cell synapse loss in a subset of stimulus exposed neuromasts with intact morphology, (ii) morphological displacement, hair-cell loss, and afferent deinnervation in a subset of mechanically disrupted neuromasts, (iii) an inflammatory response that peaked 2–4 hr following stimulus exposure, (iv) kinocilia and hair bundle damage, and (v) reduced FM1-43 uptake in all immediately following exposure. Remarkably, mechanically injured neuromasts rapidly recover following exposure; neuromast morphology, innervation, and mechanotransduction showed significant recovery within an hour, and most neuromasts were completely recovered within 4 hr post exposure.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Zebrafish lateral-line as a model for sub-lethal mechanical damage and noise-induced synapse loss</title><p>Mechanical damage to the zebrafish lateral line induced by strong water wave stimulus is observable immediately following exposure, is specific to the lateral-line organ, and appears to be rapidly repaired. These observations contrast with a recently published noise damage protocol for larval zebrafish which used ultrasonic transducers (40 kHz) to generate small, localized shock waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Uribe et al., 2018</xref>). They reported delayed hair-cell death and modest synapse loss that was not apparent until 48 hr following exposure, was not accompanied by decreased mechanotransduction, and was observed in the inner ear as well as the lateral-line organs. Some of the features of the damage they observed—delayed onset apoptosis and hair-cell death—may correspond to lethal damage following blast injuries. We propose features of the damage we observe with our stimulus protocol—reduced mechanotransduction, hair-cell synapse loss, and rapid inflammatory response—may correspond to sub-lethal noise-induced damage of hair-cell organs. Because of differences in the nature of the stimuli in these two studies, it is difficult to directly compare the pathological outcomes. Mechanical overstimulation in the Uribe et al., study was induced using ultrasonic (40 kHz) actuators. Such high frequencies are far outside those that are detected by lateral line neuromasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Levi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Trapani and Nicolson, 2010</xref>) supporting that cavitation in the water medium is likely causing the observed damage. In contrast, our study delivered a stimulus of high intensity 60 Hz water waves directly to the fish. This frequency is within the range of sensitivity of lateral line neuromasts of larval zebrafish and evoked a lateral-line mediated behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>) suggesting that the hair cells were being directly stimulated by the water motion. The present method more closely resembles the techniques that are typically used to study noise damage in the mammalian cochlea, where high-intensity acoustic energy causes hair cell and synaptic injury in specific regions of the cochlea that are best-responsive to the frequency of the stimulus. This idea is further supported by the observation that synapse loss in hair cells exposed to strong wave stimulation is greater when glutamate uptake is blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), suggesting a shared mechanism of glutamate excitotoxicity between noise-exposed mammalian ears and strong water wave stimulus exposed lateral-line organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sebe et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Disruption of neuromast morphology is a consequence of mechanical injury</title><p>Strong water wave exposure produced a percentage of pLL neuromasts that were morphologically ‘disrupted’. Several observations support that such ‘disrupted’ neuromasts represent mechanical injury to neuromast organs. One is that <italic>lhfpl5b</italic> mutant neuromasts, which lack mechanotransduction specifically in lateral-line hair cells, were comparably vulnerable to physical disruption as their wild-type siblings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Erickson et al., 2019</xref>). This finding supports that hair-cell activity during stimulation does not underly the physical displacement of hair cells observed following strong water wave stimulus. Additionally, physical disruption of the neuromast affects the whole organ—hair cells and their adjacent supporting cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This observation contrasts with what is observed in mammalian ears exposed to high intensity noise, where mechanical injury to outer hair cells is localized to stereocilia disruption and gross displacement of hair cells is not found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). Speculatively, displacement of hair cells in mechanically injured neuromasts may be due to loss of structural support from displaced supporting cells. As the lateral-line organs are superficially localized on the surface of the skin, some of the intense mechanical tension applied across the tail is likely coupled to neuromasts leading to the physical displacement of a subset of exposed neuromasts. Finally, we observed reduced FM1-43 uptake in ‘disrupted’ neuromasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10F</xref>) and measurable changes to kinocilia likely reflecting mechanical damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wagner and Shin, 2019</xref>). One notable limitation to using this model is that the evaluation of subtle and functionally relevant damage to hair-cell stereocilia, such as loss of tip links and damage to the actin core, is a significant challenge in zebrafish neuromasts due to their small size. Nevertheless, it is remarkable how rapidly mechanically disrupted lateral-line neuromasts regain normal morphology and FM1-43 uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). The superficial lateral line’s direct exposure to the environment may require more robust mechanisms for repair, unlike hair-cell organs of mammals which are encased in bone.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Hair-cell overstimulation and synapse loss</title><p>In contrast to de-innervation and modest hair-cell loss that we observed in mechanically disrupted neuromasts, we saw significant loss of hair-cell synapses in neuromasts that were exposed to strong water wave stimulus but not mechanically disrupted i.e. ‘normal’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Two notable observations were made in exposed neuromasts regarding synapse loss. First, loss of synapses in ‘normal’ exposed neuromasts was markedly more severe when synaptic glutamate clearance was inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), suggesting that synapse loss may reflect moderate hair-cell damage resulting from overstimulation of hair cells and excess glutamate accumulation. Involvement of glutamate signaling as a key mediator of noise-induced synapse loss has recently been reported in mice; loss of glutamate signaling prevents noise-induced synapse loss and pharmacologically blocking postsynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeable AMPA receptors protects against cochlear hair-cell synapse loss from moderate noise exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2019</xref>). Second, synapse loss occurred in neuromasts that appeared to be fully innervated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> B). This observation was initially surprising given that pharmacologically activating evolutionarily conserved Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeable AMPARs has been shown to drive afferent terminal retraction in the zebrafish lateral line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sebe et al., 2017</xref>). We propose that subtle damage to afferents in ‘normal’ exposed neuromasts may accompany synapse loss but not be apparent as loss of innervation, as single afferent processes innervate multiple hair cells of the same polarity within an individual neuromast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dow et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Faucherre et al., 2009</xref>). This idea is further supported by our observation that the relative frequency of synaptic debris (i.e. synaptic components that appear detached from afferent neurites) was higher in exposed neuromasts with ‘normal’ morphology relative to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). We speculate that synaptic debris observed in exposed neuromasts with ‘normal’ morphology may be the result of excitotoxic damage at synaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sebe et al., 2017</xref>) while synaptic debris observed in ‘disrupted’ neuromasts may reflect mechanical disruption of supporting cells and retraction of afferent innervation from a subset of hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and F</xref>).</p><p>In addition, glutamate signaling may not be the only driver of synapse loss resulting from excess stimulation. Studies in zebrafish and mice support that mitochondrial stress combined with excessive synaptic activity may also contribute to hair-cell synapse loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wong et al., 2019</xref>). Future work using this model to examine the effect of excess mechanical stimulation on mutants with reduced glutamate release or impaired glutamate clearance (to elevate or reduce glutamate in the synaptic cleft, respectively) combined with modified mitochondrial function may define the relative roles of glutamate excitotoxicity and hair-cell mitochondrial stress to synaptic loss.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Role of inflammation following mechanical injury to lateral-line organs</title><p>Our results indicate that mechanical injury to neuromasts evokes an inflammatory response. Prior studies of larval zebrafish have shown that macrophages reside near the borders of uninjured neuromasts and migrate into neuromasts after ototoxic injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hirose et al., 2017</xref>). We found that macrophages migrate into neuromasts within ~2 hr of mechanical injury, where they contact hair cells and, in some cases, engulf hair-cell debris. Although this macrophage response is similar to that which occurs after ototoxic injury to neuromasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carrillo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hirose et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Warchol et al., 2020</xref>), the extent of hair-cell loss after mechanical overstimulation is much less than the injury that occurs after ototoxicity. We observed macrophage entry in 30–40% of exposed neuromasts, despite modest hair-cell loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and D</xref>). It is possible that the morphological changes characteristic of mechanically injured neuromasts are accompanied by the release of macrophage chemoattractants. In addition, studies of noise exposure to the mammalian cochlea indicate that high levels of synaptic activity (without accompanying hair-cell loss) can evoke macrophage migration to the synaptic region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kaur et al., 2019</xref>). In either case, the signals responsible for such recruitment remain to be identified. The observation that macrophages had internalized immunolabeled hair-cell material further suggests that recruited macrophages engage in the phagocytosis of hair-cell debris, but it is not clear whether macrophages remove entire hair cells or target specific regions of cellular injury (e.g. synaptic debris; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In any case, our data indicate that the macrophage response to mechanical injury of zebrafish lateral-line neurons is similar to that which occurs after noise injury to the mammalian cochlea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Warchol, 2019</xref>) and suggests that zebrafish may be an advantageous model system in which to identify the signals that recruit macrophages to sites of excitotoxic injury.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Hair-cell synapse morphology following mechanical overstimulation</title><p>Immediately following mechanical overstimulation, the most pronounced morphological change we observed in hair-cell synapses was significantly enlarged PSDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D and E</xref>). Speculatively, PSD enlargement may be a consequence of reduced glutamate release from hair cells following sustained intense stimulation. Mice and zebrafish fish lacking hair-cell glutamatergic transmission have enlarged postsynaptic structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sheets et al., 2012</xref>), indicating that glutamate may regulate postsynaptic size. While our data do not directly support this idea, we speculate that reduced glutamatergic transmission in mechanically overstimulated neuromasts may be a consequence of transiently impaired mechanotransduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Alternatively, cholinergic efferent feedback, which has been shown to hyperpolarize lateral-line hair cells, may reduce hair-cell excitability during sustained strong wave exposure to protect against excess glutamate release, excitotoxic damage, and synapse loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carpaneto Freixas et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, presynaptic ribbons were not similarly enlarged, but instead showed a modest reduction in size following mechanical injury. Functional imaging of zebrafish lateral line has shown that a subset of hair cells in each neuromast are synaptically silent, and these silent hair cells can become active following damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). As ribbon size has been observed to correspond with synaptic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Merchan-Perez and Liberman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sheets et al., 2012</xref>), reduction in ribbon size may reflect recruitment of synaptically silent hair cells following mechanically induced damage. Future functional studies are needed to determine if mechanical overstimulation recruits more active hair-cell synapses, and to verify whether glutamate release from active synapses is reduced following mechanical overstimulation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Lateral-line neuromasts fully recover following mechanical damage</title><p>Previous studies indicate mammalian cochlear hair cells have some capacity for repair following sub-lethal mechanical damage, including tip-link repair and regeneration of a subset of ribbons synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Indzhykulian et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jia et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2019</xref>). But such ability is limited, and our understanding of hair-cell repair mechanisms is incomplete. By contrast, we observe complete recovery of neuromast morphology and innvervation following mechanical trauma to the zebrafish lateral line. The cellular mechanisms responsible for such repair are not fully defined, but may involve regulation of neurite growth, glutamate signaling, inflammation, and/or neurotrophic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kaur et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wan et al., 2014</xref>). Further study using this zebrafish model of mechanical overstimulation may provide insights that will assist in the development of methods for promoting complete hair-cell repair following damaging stimuli to the mammalian cochlea.</p><p>We also found that mechanical trauma resulted in a small degree of hair-cell loss in disrupted neuromasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), but that hair-cell numbers had recovered after 2 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The mechanism that mediates this recovery is not clear, but it is notable that a low level of hair-cell production normally occurs in lateral line neuromasts of larval zebrafish, as part of a process of ongoing turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cruz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Williams and Holder, 2000</xref>). In the present study, we observed a small amount of proliferation in neuromasts of both mechanically-damaged and control fish. Since mechanical damage did not increase the level of cell proliferation in neuromasts relative to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>), we believe this observed cell division is likely associated with the turnover process. Hair-cell regeneration in the vertebrate inner ear can also occur via direct phenotypic conversion of supporting cells into a replacement hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Warchol, 2011</xref>). While it is conceivable that transdifferentiation of supporting cells could occur within 2 hr of mechanical injury, such transdifferentiation has not been previously demonstrated in zebrafish lateral line neuromasts (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Thomas et al., 2015</xref>). Overall, these observations indicate that mechanical trauma does not increase the rate of hair-cell production within neuromasts, further supporting that neuromast recovery is largely due to hair-cell repair.</p><p>In summary, our data show that exposure of zebrafish lateral-line organs to strong water wave results in mechanical injury and loss of afferent synapses, but that these injuries rapidly recover. Our next steps will be to define the time course for synaptic recovery and to determine how lateral-line mediated behavior is affected by mechanically induced damage. Sub-lethal overstimulation of hair cells in the zebrafish lateral line provides a useful model for defining mechanisms of damage and inflammation and for identifying pathways that promote hair-cell repair following mechanically-induced injury.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AB</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ZIRC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:ZL1">ZL1</ext-link>ZFIN ID: ZDB-GENO-960809–7</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Tübingen</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ZIRC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:ZIRC_ZL57">ZIRC_ZL57</ext-link>ZFIN ID: ZDBGENO-990623–3</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>lhfpl5b<sup>vo35/vo35</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Erickson et al., 2019</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:ZIRC_ZL13656">ZIRC_ZL13656</ext-link>.05ZFIN ID: ZDB-GENO-200824–4</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>TgBAC(neurod1:EGFP</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Obholzer et al., 2008</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ZFIN ID: ZDB-ALT-080701–1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Tg(myo6b:actb1-EGFP</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kindt et al., 2012</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ZFIN ID: ZDB-TGCONSTRCT-120926–1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Tg(mpeg1:YFP</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Roca and Ramakrishnan, 2013</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ZFIN ID: ZDB-ALT-130130–3</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">lhfpl5b_ F</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Erickson et al., 2019</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PCR primer</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><named-content content-type="sequence">GCGTCATGTGGGCAGTTTTC</named-content>; Made by IDT</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">lhfpl5b_R</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Erickson et al., 2019</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PCR primer</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><named-content content-type="sequence">TAGACACTAGCGGCGTTGC</named-content>; Made by IDT</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">(Ribbon label: Mouse monoclonal anti-Ribeye b IgG2a)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sheets et al., 2011</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">(1:10,000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">(Ribbon label: Mouse monoclonal anti-panCtBP IgG2a)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Santa Cruz</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat.

An additional metal plate was fitted to the bottom of the multi-well dish to fill a small gap between the bottoms of the wells and the head expander to eliminate flexing of the well plate relative to the head expander. Vibrometry of the well bottoms and the head expander with a laser-Dopper vibrometer (OFV-2600 and OFV-501, Polytec, Irvine, CA) confirmed that the well plate and head expander motion were equal at stimulus frequencies. This experimental apparatus was housed in a custom sound-attenuation chamber. An Optiplex 3,020 Mini Tower (Dell) with a NI PCIe-6321, X Series Multifunction DAQ (National Instruments) running a custom stimulus generation program (modified version of Cochlear Function Test Suite) was used to relay the stimulus signal to a Brüel + Kjær LDS PA100E Amplifier that drove a controlled 60 Hz vibratory stimulus along the larvae’s dorsoventral axis (vertically). Two accelerometers (BU-21771, Knowles, Itasca, IL) were mounted to the head expander to monitor the vertical displacement of the plate. The output of the accelerometers was relayed through a custom accelerometer amplifier (EPL Engineering Core).

Particle volume and intensity were measured using the 3D object counter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bolte and Cordelières, 2006</xref>) using a lower threshold and a minimum size of 10 voxels. To normalize for differences in staining intensity across experimental trials, all volumes were divided by the median control volume in each trial for each individual channel. The number of particles above lower threshold was quantified using the ImageJ Maximum Finder plugin with a noise tolerance of 10 on maximum-intensity projections. Intact synapses were manually counted and defined as adjoining or overlapping maxima of Ribeye and MAGUK labels. The number of synapses per hair cell was approximated by dividing the number of intact synapses within a neuromast by the number of hair cells in the neuromast. Innervation of neuromast hair cells was quantified during blinded analysis by scrolling through confocal z-stacks of each neuromast (step size 0.3 µm) containing hair cell and afferent labeling and identifying hair cells that were not directly contacted by an afferent neuron i.e. no discernable space between the hair cell and the neurite. Hair cells that were identified as no longer innervated showed measurable neurite retraction; there was generally &gt;0.5 µm distance between a retracted neurite and hair cell. Stereocilia length measurements were obtained in ImageJ from interpolated 3D projections of z-stack images (step size 0.3 µm) containing phalloidin labeled hair bundles. Three independent measurements were obtained from the base to the tips of hair bundles at center of each neuromast, and the average length was calculated.</p><p>Quantitative data on macrophage response to mechanical injury were collected from the two caudal-most (‘terminal’) neuromasts. Confocal image stacks were obtained using a Zeiss LSM700 microscope and visualized using Volocity software. These image stacks were used to derive three metrics from each neuromast. First, the number of macrophages within 25 µm of a particular neuromast was determined by inscribing a circle of 25 µm radius, centered on the neuromast, and counting the number of macrophages that were either fully or partially enclosed by this circle. Next, the number of macrophages contacting a neuromast was determined by scrolling through the x-y planes of each image stack (1 µm interval between x-y planes, 15 µm total depth) and the counting macrophages that were in direct contact with Otoferlin-labeled hair cells. Finally, the number of macrophages that had internalized Otoferlin-labeled material (hair-cell debris) were counted and were assumed to reflect the number of phagocytic events. For each metric, the recorded number reflected the activity of a single macrophage, that is, a macrophage that made contacts with multiple hair cells and/or had internalized debris from several hair cells was still classified as a single ‘event.’</p><p>Subsequent image processing for display within figures was performed using Photoshop and Illustrator software (Adobe).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Scanning electron microscopy</title><p>To image hair-cell bundles, zebrafish larvae were exposed to strong water wave stimulus, then anesthetized in 0.12 % tricaine in E3 and immediately fixed in 2.5 % glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (Electron Microscopy Sciences) supplemented with 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Larvae were shipped overnight in fixative, then most of the fixative (~90–95%) was removed, replaced with distilled water, and samples were stored at 4 C. Next, larvae were washed in distilled water (Gibco), dehydrated with an ascending series of ethanol, critical point dried from liquid CO<sub>2</sub> (Tousimis Aurosamdri 815), mounted on adhesive carbon tabs (Ted Pella), sputter coated with 5 nm of platinum (Leica EM ACE600), and imaged on Hitachi S-4700 scanning electron microscope. Kinocilia diameter measurements were performed using ImageJ.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>A hierarchical linear model analysis with fish used as random effects was used to compare each of the measures between the conditions and groups. Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayessian Information Criterion (BIC) were used to identify the best fitted covariance structure. Tukey’s adjustment was used for the alpha level to avoid type I error inflation due to multiple comparisons. Estimated marginal mean differences and 95 % Confidence Intervals around them were explored and reported for quantification of effect size for group differences. Graphs for data visualization and additional statistical analyses were performed Prism 8 (Graphpad Software Inc). Mixed model analysis was used to compare time-series data. Statistical significance between synaptic ribbon and PSD volumes with was determined by Kruskal-Wallis test (one independent variable) or Mann–Whitney U test (one independent variable) and appropriate post-hoc tests. Based on the variance and effect sizes reported in previous studies, the number of biological replicates were suitable to provide statistical power to avoid Type II error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sebe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Uribe et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Methodology, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Writing - original draft</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (protocol no. 20–0158) and in accordance with NIH guidelines for use of zebrafish.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-69264-transrepform1-v2.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below. Although all three reviewers agreed that the study was thorough but felt the findings do not provide sufficient advances to be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In the manuscript titled &quot;Mechanical overstimulation causes acute injury followed by fast recovery in lateral-line neuromasts of larval zebrafish&quot; by Holmgren et al., the authors develop a method to overstimulate hair cells and determine some of the consequences of this overstimulation. The overarching goal of this work is to develop a model for noise-induced hair-cell damage in the zebrafish. The authors use the lateral line for their studies and stimulate hair cells using an electrodynamic shaker which generate significant aqueous agitation. The authors demonstrate physical damage to hair cells of the lateral line that are dependent on position of the neuromast. The damage includes alteration of afferent synapses, afferent neurite retraction, limited damage to hair bundles and a decrease in mechanotransduction.

Using an electrodynamic shaker, the authors induce quantifiable damage and death of hair cells after a two-hour treatment. They describe gross morphological changes of hair cells, changes in innervation and synapse distribution. In addition, they describe disruption of stereocilia and kinocilia, as well as reduced mechanotransduction-dependent uptake of FM1-43 dye. Damage is no longer detectable several hours after insult, demonstrating recovery.</p><p>1. While the findings are carefully measured and described the effects of insult on hair cells are relatively minor, with a change in hair cell number, extent of innervation or synapses per hair cell (Figures3 and 4) in the range of 10% reduction compared to control. One potential value of the model would be to use it to discover underlying pathways of damage or screen for potential therapeutics. However, with these modest changes it is not clear that there will be enough power to determine effects of potential interventions.</p><p>2. The most dramatic phenotype after shaking is a physical displacement of hair cells, described as disrupted morphology. However, it is not clear what the underlying cause of this change.

It is also not clear to what extent this displacement reveals more general principles of the effects of noise on hair cells. Additional discussion of underlying causes would be welcome.</p><p>3.

The authors claim that they only see a modest increase in SC EdU incorporation (&gt;0.5 SC/neuromast) following injury, but the decrease in HC number is also small (looks to be &lt;1 HC/neuromast from graph).

The authors use the lateral line for their studies and stimulate hair cells using an electrodynamic shaker which generate significant aqueous agitation. The authors demonstrate physical damage to hair cells of the lateral line that are dependent on position of the neuromast.

To confirm that 60 Hz was the optimal frequency to induce damage, we tested 45, 60, and 75 Hz at comparable intensities.

We have provided a more direct comparison in the Results section and addressed the differences in our protocols in-depth in the Discussion section.</p><p>Our damage protocol uses a stimulus within the known frequency range of lateral-line hair cells (60 Hz) that is applied to free-swimming larvae and evokes a behaviorally relevant response (fast start response). The damage is observable immediately following noise exposure, is specific to posterior lateral-line neuromasts, and appears to be rapidly repaired. Some features of the damage we observe—reduced mechanotransduction and hair-cell synapse loss—may correspond to mechanically induced damage of hair cell organs in other species. Notably, hair cell synapse loss in seemingly intact neuromasts is exacerbated by pharmacologically blocking synaptic glutamate clearance, supporting that the 60 Hz frequency stimulus is overstimulating neuromast hair cells directly and suggesting that the mechanism of synapse loss may be similar to inner hair cell synapse loss reported in mice following moderate noise exposures.</p><p>By contrast, the damage protocol published by Uribe et al. used ultrasonic transducers (40-kHz) to generate small, localized shock waves rather than directly stimulate neuromast hair cells. The damaged they reported—delayed hair-cell death and modest synapse loss with no effect on hair-cell mechanotransduction—was not apparent until 48 hours following exposure and not specific to the lateral-line organ.

We have tried to clarify that most of what we observe regarding recovery—restoration of neuromast shape, mechanostransduction, afferent contacts, and synapse number —reflect mechanisms of repair following mechanical damage (and, in the case of synapse loss, overstimulation) rather than regeneration. However, one feature of damage that may reflect rapid regeneration is restoration of hair cells number following mechanical injury. To experimentally determine whether proliferation contributed to hair cell generation, we assessed the incorporation of the thymidine analog EdU during a 4 hour recovery following mechanical overexposure in a transgenic line expressing GFP in neuromast supporting cells and observe a modest but not statistically significant increase in the number of proliferating supporting cells in neuromasts exposed to strong current stimulus, suggesting recovery of lost hair cells is not primarily due to renewed proliferation.</p><p>The number of hair cells that are lost and recover within several hours are low, i.e., typically ~1 hair cell/neuromast. We observed this consistently in all of our experiments, but the mechanisms responsible are not clear. Based on previous studies of hair cell regeneration in the lateral line, the recovery time appears too rapid to be caused by renewed proliferation, a notion that is further supported by our Edu studies. On the other hand, it is possible that a few supporting cells may undergo the initial phases of phenotypic change into hair cells during this short time period, and we speculate that such transdifferentiation may be responsible for the observed recovery. We should emphasize that this is a new observation and, at present, we do not fully understand the underlying mechanism. However, the focus of the present study is on mechanical damage, synaptic loss, and subsequent repair.

This complicates the interpretation, especially considering the authors own finding that a pre-exposure is protective.</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify—pre-exposure was not protective to hair-cell survival. Rather, in preliminary experiments, pre-exposure appeared to reduce larval mortality, and we have clarified that observation in the text of the Results and the Methods Details sections. We agree with the reviewer that comparing the two protocols based on differences in time distribution is complicated in that they also differ in total exposure time. For the purpose of clarity, we now focus on the sustained exposure in the main figures and created supplemental figures for the reduced damage still observed using periodic exposure, specifying that reduced damage may be the result of periodic time distribution of stimulus and/or less cumulative time exposed to the stimulus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The data on the mitochondrial ROS aspect seems not well integrated into the overall story.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the ROS story was not well integrated and incomplete. We have removed the data describing <italic>mpv17-/-</italic> mutants and mitochondrial disfunction from this manuscript. A more comprehensive report of <italic>mpv17-/-</italic> mutant mitochondrial function and morphological analysis of neuromasts following noise exposure will be described in a follow-up manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It is surprising that the hair bundle morphology was not assessed after recovery. This is crucial. Overall, it would be good to see some quantification of the SEM data, e.g. kinocilia length and number of splayed bundles.</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded the SEM image analysis to quantitatively access kinocilia morphology following exposure. We agree that assessment of recovery using live-imaging of hair bundles paired with subsequent SEM analysis will be informative, and we intend to perform those experiments in a future study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Behavioral recovery (measured as number of &quot;fast start&quot; responses) was also not assessed. This is essential for determining the functional relevance of the recovery.</p></disp-quote><p>We attempted to measure behavior recovery of lateral-line function by measuring “fast-start” responses immediately and several hours after recovery, and discovered that i) strong water current provided stimulation that was too intense to reveal subtle behavioral changes following lateral-line damage and recovery, and ii) when testing larvae immediately following sustained strong current exposures, it was difficult to discern if fewer “fast-start” responses were due to lateral-line organ damage or larval fatigue.</p><p>We agree that behavioral recovery is important to assay but acknowledge assessing lateral-line mediated behavior following mechanical damage will require a more sensitive testing paradigm that stimulates the lateral-line sensory organ with a relatively gentile, calibrated water flow stimulus. We are currently performing a follow-up study to this paper using a testing paradigm developed by a postdoctoral associate in our lab (Kyle Newton) that analyses subtle changes in larval orientation to water flow (rheotaxis) mediated by the lateral-line organ. Using this behavior paradigm, we will directly correlate morphological and functional recovery over time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– This reviewer is not yet convinced that this damage model displays enough commonalities to mammalian noise damage to justify the ubiquitous use of the term &quot;noise&quot; throughout the manuscript. It would be more prudent to use a more careful term along the lines of &quot;mechanical overstimulation-induced damage&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the term “noise” throughout the manuscript and replaced it with either “strong water current stimulus” or “mechanical overstimulation” where appropriate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Overall, there was a lack of experimental and analysis detail in the Results section. For example, how was afferent innervation quantified? Just counting GFP labeled contacts to hair cells?</p></disp-quote><p>Innervation of neuromast hair cells was quantified during blinded analysis by scrolling through confocal z-stacks of each neuromast (step size 0.3 µm) containing hair cell and afferent labeling and identifying hair cells that were not directly contacted by an afferent neuron i.e. no discernable space between the hair cell and the neurite. Hair cells that were identified as no longer innervated showed measurable neurite retraction; there was generally &gt;0.5 µm distance between a retracted neurite and hair cell. We have added this information to the Methods Detail section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There was also inconsistency in the use of two variations of the mechanical damage protocol, the time points at which repair was assessed, and whether the damage was quantified in all neuromasts or in normal vs. disrupted neuromasts separately, making the data difficult to interpret.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised our figure legends to clearly indicate when we are assessing damage in all exposed neuromasts (pooled) to control vs. comparative analysis of normal vs. disrupted neuromasts relative to control. In addition, we now focus on the sustained exposure in the main figures, which was the exposure protocol used for the time points in which repair and recovery were assessed.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All three reviewers appreciated the fact that you have made a good effort in revising the manuscript. However, the story has also changed from a noise-induced damage to a mechanical over-stimulation paradigm. While the Ihfp15b mutant results are interesting, it is not entirely clear how these results are applicable to noise-induced hearing loss in mammals. A point that could be better addressed in the Discussion. After an extensive discussion with the three reviewers, they have consolidated their main suggestions as follow:</p><p>Essential revisions</p><p>1) It would be important to determine whether the hair cells with severe bundle damage recover their bundle morphology or are replaced by transdifferentiation of SCs.</p></disp-quote><p>Our revised manuscript provides data that indicate disrupted neuromasts, which appear to correspond with damaged hair bundles in our SEM imaging experiments, are repaired rather than replaced following mechanical damage.</p><p>We performed time series experiments examining mechanotransduction and neuromast morphology 0-4 hours following strong water wave exposure, which are now reported in the revised Figure 10. We observed hair-cell mechanotransduction, as measured with FM1-43X uptake, was significantly reduced immediately following exposure. However, uptake of FM1-43X began to recover within 30 minutes and was fully restored after several hours. Notably, reduced FM1-43X uptake did not appear to correlate with stereocilia length. Recovery of FM1-43X fluorescence instead coincided with a relative decrease in the number of neuromasts that appeared “disrupted”, suggesting restoration of overall neuromast morphology. In addition, we expanded our evaluation of cell proliferation following 4 hours recovery and observed no significant increase in supporting cell EdU labeling in exposed neuromasts (Figure 11). Together, these observations suggest that neuromast hair cells disrupted by strong mechanical stimuli are generally repaired rather than replaced.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Statistical analyses of results should be incorporated per comments from Reviewer#2. It is important to know if the conclusions hold up across total neuromasts and fish. In this regard, this is a reference suggested by the Reviewer: Aarts E, Verhage M, Veenvliet JV, Dolan CV, van der Sluis S. A solution to dependency: using multilevel analysis to accommodate nested data. Nat Neurosci. 2014 Apr;17(4):491-6.</p></disp-quote><p>To accommodate nested data and ensure statistical rigor, our data has been reanalyzed by Dr. Dorina Kallogjeri, a research statistician affiliated with our department. Using an unconditional model, she determined ~35% of variability in hair cell number ~25% variability in innervation could be accounted for by the fish in the experiment. She therefore used a multilevel model to test statistical differences between conditions and groups. Tukey’s adjustment was used for the α level to avoid type I error inflation due to multiple comparisons.</p><p>In addition to updating our statistics and figures in the manuscript, we have included our raw data and her analysis in our resubmission.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The authors embark on a comprehensive characterization of damages suffered by the zebrafish lateral line organ in response to mechanical overstimulation. The ultimate goal is to establish this as a novel model for noise-induced hearing loss. The study describes significant overlap in the damage characteristics between mammals and fish, justifying this protocol as a (limited) but very useful model (due to the well-known advantages of the zebrafish system) to study the basic mechanisms of hair cell damage incurred by mechanical overstimulation.</p><p>The revision includes some valuable additions in response to the previous review, but many suggestions were deemed intractable in the given time period. The manuscript is therefore improved, but not to a level that this reviewer judges had hoped for.</p><p>– The quantification of changes in SEMs of hair bundle morphology following damage was a significant improvement from the original submission, but imaging or quantification of recovery, which would be an important addition to the manuscript, is still lacking. It would also be nice to see a quantification of splayed bundles and kinocilia length before and after recovery. The confocal images demonstrating the changes to the kinocilium following damage were a nice addition and might provide an easier way to quantify changes during the recovery process.</p></disp-quote><p>Quantification of phalloidin-labeled hair bundle length during recovery and in relation to FM1-43 uptake is now reported in revised Figure 10.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors decided that further investigation into the distinction of repair vs recovery (beyond SC EdU incorporation) is outside the scope of this study, but this reviewer thinks that it should have been further explored. The authors claim that they only see a modest increase in SC EdU incorporation (&gt;0.5 SC/neuromast) following injury, but the decrease in HC number is also small (looks to be &lt;1 HC/neuromast from graph). Directly addressing transdifferentiation of SCs through lineage tracing techniques would be informative.</p></disp-quote><p>It is notable that prior studies of hair cell regeneration in the zebrafish lateral line suggest that the underlying cellular mechanisms are slightly different from those that occur in the inner ears of other nonmammalian vertebrates. The ears of birds and amphibians can generate replacement hair cells either by asymmetric division of supporting cells or by nonmitotic transdifferentiation of supporting cells (Robertson et al., 2004). In contrast, regeneration of zebrafish lateral line hair cells appears to occur via the symmetric division of supporting cells, and no prior studies, to our knowledge, have shown evidence for either transdifferentiation or production by asymmetric proliferation.</p><p>To address the issue of hair cell addition, we examined supporting cell proliferation (via EdU labeling) along with cell fate using a transgenic line that expressed a stable fluorophore (GFP) in supporting cells. In these fish, transdifferentiation of supporting cells should result in the colocalization of GFP with the hair-cell marker otoferlin, either immediately after or at short time intervals after mechanical injury. It should be noted that this method will label <italic>both</italic> hair cells that arise from transdifferentiation as well as newly-differentiated hair cells that were created by the proliferation of (GFP-expressing) supporting cells. In mechanically-damaged fish, we observed such GFP colocalization within 1-2 hair cells in a small fraction of neuromasts (3/109 neuromasts; n=41 fish, examined at 0-2 hr after exposure). However, we also observed similar colocalization in unexposed (control) fish (1/49 neuromasts, n=24 fish), suggesting that addition of new hair cells (by whatever mechanism) is similar in both damaged and control fish. In addition, supporting cell proliferation (as quantified by EdU labeling; Figure 11) did not significantly differ in mechanically injured vs. control fish. Together, these observations suggest that the mechanical trauma did not affect the rate at which new hair cells are generated. Finally, since hair cells in zebrafish neuromasts undergo a slow rate of turnover (e.g., Williams and Holder, 2000) it is expected that a low level of hair cell addition will continuously occur in control and mechanically overstimulated larvae.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>I appreciate the extensive revisions Holmgren et al. have made to their previous manuscript, addressing many of the criticisms of the previous review. They include a clever new experiment using lhfpl5b mutants that have mechanosensory deficits specific to lateral line hair cells. Using these mutants, they demonstrate that the morphological disruption they observe after shaker treatment occurs in these mutants to the same degree as in wt fish.</p><p>However, this result does call into question whether the model is a functional one for noise damage. If mechanotransduction is not necessary, are the phenotypes observed really excitotoxicity? Do the reported changes in innervation and synapses also not require functional mechanotransduction?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe the data showing significant synapse loss in neuromasts with overall intact morphology (i.e. “normal”) and our observation that blocking glutamate uptake significantly worsens synapse loss specifically in “normal” neuromasts provide strong evidence that synapse loss is a consequence of excitotoxicity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I fear I was not clear enough on my previous point (#3 in response to reviewer 2):</p><p>Because afferent neurons innervate more than one neuromast and more than one hair cell per neuromast, measurements of innervation of neuromasts (Figure 3) or synapses per hair cell (Figure 4) cannot be assumed to be independent events. That is, changes in a single postsynaptic neuron may be reflected across multiple synapses, hair cells, and even neuromasts. This needs to be accounted for in experimental design for statistical analysis.</p><p>As measurements of innervation or synapse density are not independent, they cannot be treated as distinct instances (n's) in the statistical analysis. In these experiments the independent instances are going to be the number of fish, not hair cells. This issue extends to analysis in Figures7, 8 as well.</p></disp-quote><p>To accommodate nested data and ensure statistical rigor, we used a multilevel model to test statistical differences between groups.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I am somewhat confused about the conclusions from figure 4. Setting aside the issue of independence, the differences in synapses per hair cell are variably measured as significant or insignificant, suggesting that the analysis is underpowered. In addition, shouldn't the relevant comparisons in Figure 4E be between DMSA and TBOE, that is comparing each of control, shaken normal and shaken disrupted to the corresponding drug treatment?</p></disp-quote><p>We have included the appropriate comparisons in the updated Figure 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The goal of the manuscript is to present a new paradigm for damaging hair cells of the zebrafish lateral line using vibrational stimuli. A successful method would be important to the community as this goal has been difficult to achieve, and it would open up new avenues of research. The authors addressed some of my concerns from the last review but not all. The experiments they did perform are a screen of frequencies that damage the hair cells of the lateral line and improved the quality of an image (Figure 4). This is appreciated especially during the time of Covid.</p><p>They argue that 2 suggested experiments are not necessary: microphonic potentials and damage to the core of actin of stereocilia. I feel that they would improve the paper's quality, but I see their point about not including the microphonic potentials; however, they should at some level look at the damage to the actin core. This could be by TEM as suggested or it could be by phalloidin labeling. Both of these methods can be used to see gaps in the core of actin in mouse hair cells and maybe those of zebrafish.</p></disp-quote><p>While we were unable to discern damage to the actin core in zebrafish neuromast hair bundles using phalloidin labeling, we were able to characterize qualitative changes as well as quantify average stereocilia length in projected 3D image stacks. We used these data to determine how stereocilia morphology corresponds with FM1-43 uptake recovery in the revised Figure 10.</p><p>Overall, the present study’s aims were to evaluate mechanical damage in the zebrafish lateral line and to establish this injury paradigm as a model for the study of synaptic repair. A more detailed analysis of actin injury and repair would require considerable TEM imaging which, while we hope may be performed in future studies, is beyond the scope of the present study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another issue is the use of the word &quot;current&quot;. According to the dictionary (OED) current is defined as &quot;That which runs or flows, a stream; spec. a portion of a body of water, or of air, etc. moving in a definite direction.&quot; This is the way I see the word used in the scientific literature as well. I don't think what the authors are providing is a current. They should use a different term, perhaps, &quot;vibratory stimulus&quot; or &quot;water stimulus.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We have replaced the term “current” with “water wave” in the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
