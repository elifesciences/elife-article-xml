This approach has limitations when studying transporters for the low-abundant micromolecules, such as micronutrients, and may not reveal physiological functions of the transporters. While <sc>d</sc>-serine, a trace enantiomer of serine in the circulation, was discovered as an emerging biomarker of kidney function, its transport mechanisms in the periphery remain unknown. Here, using a multi-hierarchical approach from body fluids to molecules, combining multi-omics, cell-free synthetic biochemistry, and ex vivo transport analyses, we have identified two types of renal <sc>d</sc>-serine transport systems. We revealed that the small amino acid transporter ASCT2 serves as a <sc>d</sc>-serine transporter previously uncharacterized in the kidney and discovered <sc>d</sc>-serine as a non-canonical substrate of the sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporters (SMCTs). These two systems are physiologically complementary, but ASCT2 dominates the role in the pathological condition. Our findings not only shed light on renal <sc>d</sc>-serine transport, but also clarify the importance of non-canonical substrate transport. This study provides a framework for investigating multiple transport systems of various trace micromolecules under physiological conditions and in multifactorial diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>transporter</kwd><kwd>amino acid</kwd><kwd>kidney diseases</kwd><kwd>micronutrient</kwd><kwd>biomarker</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP22K06150</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wiriyasermkul</surname><given-names>Pattama</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007449</institution-id><institution>Takeda Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wiriyasermkul</surname><given-names>Pattama</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP21H03365</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nagamori</surname><given-names>Shushi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP21ek0310012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nagamori</surname><given-names>Shushi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP21gm0810010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nagamori</surname><given-names>Shushi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100020376</institution-id><institution>Gout and Uric Acid Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nagamori</surname><given-names>Shushi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004322</institution-id><institution>Shiseido Group</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nagamori</surname><given-names>Shushi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An unbiased approach unveils a non-canonical substrate of the known transporters, highlighting the mechanism behind the use of D-serine as a kidney biomarker.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Membrane transport proteins function to transport micromolecules such as nutrients, ions, and metabolites across membranes, thereby playing a pivotal role in the regulation of micromolecular homeostasis. To date, over 450 solute carriers (SLCs), 40 ATP-binding cassettes, 60 ATPase pumps, and 300 ion channels have been identified in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ranjan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">César-Razquin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Perland and Fredriksson, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bateman et al., 2021</xref>). Approximately 30% of membrane transport proteins remain uncharacterized. While some membrane transport proteins can be classified based on sequence similarities and transport substrates of well-studied family members, this approach is limited when it comes to discovering transporters for some micromolecules, such as micronutrients and their metabolites. Many of these micromolecules have not been extensively studied and do not fit into traditional nutrient types. Currently, the importance of micronutrients and gut microbiota-derived metabolites in health and disease has gained a high impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shenkin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vernocchi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2022</xref>), yet their responsible transporters are not well understood. Understanding the absorption and reabsorption mechanisms of dietary micronutrients and gut microbiota-derived metabolites will provide a key molecular process for controlling their dynamics and molecular activities.</p><p>This study aims to establish an approach to investigate the physiological function and pathological significance of transporters, particularly transport systems for trace micromolecules. As a paradigm, we investigated renal transport systems for <sc>d</sc>-amino acids, micronutrients derived mostly from the diet, and some from the gut microbiota. Amino acid transport systems have been well studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bröer, 2008a</xref>), but have focused on <sc>l</sc>-amino acids, which are macronutrients, leaving open the question of how <sc>d</sc>-amino acids are transported. We have developed two-dimensional high-performance liquid chromatography (2D-HPLC), which allows the segregation of <sc>l</sc>- and <sc>d</sc>-enantiomers in liquid biopsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Miyoshi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hamase et al., 2010</xref>). The importance of <sc>d</sc>-amino acids in renal function has received increasing attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sasabe et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kimura et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sasabe and Suzuki, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Inoue et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hesaka et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kimura et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Okushima et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Iwata et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Suzuki et al., 2022</xref>). <sc>d</sc>-Serine in the body fluid was discovered as a promising biomarker for acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to its clear association with kidney function in rodents and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sasabe et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kimura et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Inoue et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hesaka et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Okushima et al., 2021</xref>). Diseased-associated alterations in plasma and urinary <sc>d-</sc>/<sc>l-</sc>serine ratios suggest that renal <sc>d</sc>-serine transport systems are different and distinct from <sc>l</sc>-serine transport systems under physiological and pathological conditions. The transport of <sc>d</sc>-serine has long been found to take place at the proximal tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kragh-Hansen and Sheikh, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shimomura et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Silbernagl et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sasabe and Suzuki, 2019</xref>), yet the corresponding transporter has not been clearly elucidated.</p><p><sc>d-</sc>Serine is found at submillimolar levels in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hashimoto et al., 1992</xref>), where it acts as an obligatory physiological co-agonist of <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mothet et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Papouin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wolosker, 2018</xref>). Extensive studies of <sc>d</sc>-serine in the brain show that <sc>d-</sc>serine is transported by four plasma membrane transporters: ASCT1 (SLC1A4), ASCT2 (SLC1A5), Asc-1 (SLC7A10), and SNAT1 (SLC38A1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rosenberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Foster et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kaplan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bodner et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, <sc>d-</sc>serine is detected at low micromolar levels in the periphery, and little is known about its dynamics as well as transport systems. Mammals acquire <sc>d</sc>-serine by biosynthesis via serine racemase function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wolosker et al., 1999</xref>) and absorption from the diet and gut microbiota presumably via intestinal transport system(s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sasabe and Suzuki, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Inoue et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gonda et al., 2023</xref>). Similar to the renal epithelia, a <sc>d-</sc>serine transporter in the intestine is also unknown.</p><p>In this study, we integrated multiple analytical methods for the different biological hierarchies. We applied 2D-HPLC to quantify the plasma and urinary enantiomers of 20 amino acids of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) mice, a model of AKI and AKI-to-CKD transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sasabe et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fu et al., 2018</xref>). Membrane proteomics of the renal proximal tubules of the IRI mouse models was performed to explore the key molecules responsible for the alterations of <sc>d-</sc> and <sc>l-</sc>amino acid transport. With bioinformatics, cell-based screening, and cell-free transport analysis, we identified two types of <sc>d</sc>-serine transport systems in the kidney. Subsequently, ex vivo transport analyses from the normal kidney and the IRI model explained the transport mechanism of <sc>d</sc>-serine as a biomarker in kidney diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Amino acid metabolomics in plasma and urine of the renal IRI model</title><p>To understand kidney-associated alteration of enantiomeric amino acids, we measured <sc>l</sc>- and <sc>d</sc>-isomers of 20 amino acids in the body fluids of the IRI model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>). Dynamics of <sc>l</sc>- and <sc>d</sc>-enantiomers in the plasma were evaluated from the ratios of <sc>d</sc>-/<sc>l</sc>- enantiomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Among amino acids, only the ratios of plasma <sc>d-/l</sc>-serine were increased in a time-dependent manner from 4 to 40 hr after the ischemia-reperfusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). The elevation of plasma <sc>d-/l</sc>-serine ratios at early time points (4 hr–8 hr) was due to a sharp decrease of the <sc>l</sc>-isomer, while the rise of <sc>d-/l</sc>-serine ratios at late time points (20 hr–40 hr) was a result of a continuous acceleration of the <sc>d</sc>-isomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). The results of plasma <sc>d</sc>-serine were consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sasabe et al., 2014</xref>). In addition to <sc>d-</sc>serine, we detected certain amounts of <sc>d</sc>-alanine, <sc>d</sc>-proline, and <sc>d</sc>-methionine in the plasma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

method because of its high transfection efficiency. Similar to other several common cell lines, HEK293 cells express ASCT2 endogenously. However, we also examined other possible <sc>d</sc>-serine transport systems in HEK293 cells, aiming to reduce the transport background. Proteomic analysis of the membrane fractions from HEK293 cells identified amino acid transporters as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>. Transport activity of <sc>d</sc>-serine in HEK293 cells showed Na<sup>+</sup> dependency and ASCT2 substrate-mediated inhibition (<sc>l</sc>-Ser, <sc>l</sc>-Thr, and <sc>l</sc>-Met) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). Ben-Cys (<italic>S</italic>-benzyl-<sc>l</sc>-cysteine) and GPNA (<sc>l</sc>-γ-glutamyl-<italic>p</italic>-nitroanilide) inhibited <sc>d</sc>-serine transport in HEK293 cells similar to that of ASCT2-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bröer et al., 2016</xref>), but SLC38 inhibitor MeAIB (2-(methylamino)isobutyric acid) had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These results indicated that ASCT2 is the main <sc>d</sc>-serine transporter in HEK293 cells.</p><p>Due to the absence of any ASCT2-specific inhibitor and the compensatory transport mechanism that occurred in the ASCT2-deletion condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bröer et al., 2016</xref>), we avoided using the traditional cell-based transport assay for screening. Instead, we established a new screening method based on cell growth. Apart from the studies on <sc>d</sc>-serine biomarkers in kidney diseases, a previous study found that high concentrations (10–20 mM) of <sc>d</sc>-serine impaired the growth of a human proximal tubular cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Okada et al., 2017</xref>). We then tested whether high concentrations of <sc>d</sc>-serine affect HEK293 cell growth. Unlike <sc>l</sc>-serine which had no effect, <sc>d</sc>-serine reduced cell growth in a concentration-dependent manner with IC<sub>50</sub> of 17.4±1.05 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In the ASCT2 knockdown cells, the growth inhibition by <sc>d</sc>-serine was attenuated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), indicating that <sc>d</sc>-serine suppressing cell growth was caused by ASCT2-mediated <sc>d</sc>-serine transport.</p><p>Based on this finding, we utilized cell growth determination assay as the screening method even in the presence of endogenous ASCT2 expression. HEK293 cells were transfected with human candidate genes without ASCT2 knockdown. The transfected cells were treated with either 15 mM (near IC<sub>50</sub> concentration) or 25 mM (high concentration) <sc>d</sc>-serine for 2 days, and cell growth was determined. The positive control Asc-1-transfected cells showed a reduction in cell growth, confirming the effectiveness of this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). Among 10 candidates, PAT1 (SLC36A1) and B<sup>0</sup>AT3 (SLC6A18) showed higher cell growth than the mock cells, suggesting that PAT1 and B<sup>0</sup>AT3 may reduce <sc>d</sc>-serine influx mediated by endogenous ASCT2. In contrast, SMCT1 (SLC5A8) and SMCT2 (SLC5A12) extended the growth suppression after treatment with both 15 and 25 mM <sc>d</sc>-serine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).

Our membrane proteomics revealed that Asct2 was increased while Smct1 and Smct2 were decreased in both 4 and 8 hr IRI (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). We then examined the functional contributions of Asct2 and Smcts on the <sc>d</sc>-serine reabsorption during the pathology. Similar to those of the normal BBMVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>), <sc>d</sc>-[<sup>3</sup>H]serine transport in sham operation showed ibuprofen-sensitive in non-preloading and partly ibuprofen-sensitive in <sc>l</sc>-Gln preloading conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>: sham). <sc>d</sc>-[<sup>3</sup>H]Serine influx reduced sharply in the BBMVs of 4 hr IRI model, and the transport was ibuprofen-insensitive in both with and without <sc>l</sc>-Gln preloading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>: 4 hr IRI). Likely, this feature was due to the slight increase of Asct2 and the dramatic decrease of Smcts as observed in the proteome data (Asct2: 4 hr IRI/sham = 1.29 fold, Smct1: 4 hr IRI/sham = 0.59 fold; Smct2: 4 hr IRI/sham = 0.86 fold; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

The assay confirmed that BBMVs derived from 4 hr IRI model were not fully damaged, although the low influx was likely from the loss of protein expression during the injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>: amino acids, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). In the BBMVs of 8 hr IRI model, <sc>d</sc>-[<sup>3</sup>H]serine transport was exceedingly high in <sc>l</sc>-Gln preloading and it was ibuprofen-insensitive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>: <sc>l</sc>-Gln preloaded). These results could be explained by the continuing increase of Asct2 and decrease of Smcts as revealed by our proteomics (Asct2: 8 hr IRI/sham = 1.64 fold; Smct1: 8 hr IRI/sham = 0.62 fold; Smct2: 8 hr IRI/sham = 0.78 fold) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The slight increase in <sc>d</sc>-[<sup>3</sup>H]serine transport in non-preloaded 8 hr IRI BBMVs may be due to an unknown transporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>: no preload).

Most likely, the high reabsorption of <sc>d</sc>-serine during IRI resulted from the increase of Asct2, despite the decreases of Smct1 and Smct2.</p><p>For comparison with our proteome data, we analyzed the mRNA expressions of Asct2, Smct1, and Smct2 in proximal tubule clusters at the early IRI from the open-source snRNA-seq dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kirita et al., 2020</xref>). Consistent with our proteome data, Smct1 and Smct2 mRNA expressions were dramatically decreased, whereas Asct2 was increased since the early IRI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). The correlation of proteomics and transcriptomics suggested that the protein alterations of Asct2 and Smcts during the pathology emerged from transcriptional mechanisms rather than post-translational protein processing or protein degradation. When evaluating the extent of gene/protein alterations between the control and IRI conditions, we observed that the gene alterations of both Asct2 and Smcts, as revealed by snRNA-seq, are more pronounced than the protein alteration ratios obtained from proteomics. This discrepancy may stem from difficulty in the quantification method, especially for membrane transport proteins in label-free quantitative proteomics.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we presented an approach to investigate the transport systems for micronutrients and metabolites under physiological conditions and in multifactorial diseases. We selected AKI as a model study because AKI is known to target renal proximal epithelia and disrupt absorption/reabsorption systems that are the results of cooperative functions of multiple transporters. We utilized amino acid metabolomics to reveal a unique feature of the enantiomeric dynamics of serine in the AKI and analyzed membrane proteomes to obtain the <sc>d</sc>-serine transporter candidates. We then applied cell-based and cell-free transport assays to identify two <sc>d</sc>-serine transport systems: one was ASCT2 and the other consisted of unanticipated SMCTs (SMCT1 and SMCT2). Using ex vivo analysis of apical membrane-enriched renal proximal tubules, we showed that both transport systems contributed comparably to <sc>d</sc>-serine handling in the normal kidney, but ASCT2 became dominant in AKI, leading to the increase of <sc>d</sc>-serine in the blood. The alteration of two transport systems explained the dynamics of <sc>d</sc>-serine and suggested the transport mechanism behind the <sc>d</sc>-serine biomarker.</p><p>Several studies have reported the non-canonical substrates of membrane transport proteins, such as the recognition between amino acids, carboxylates, and amines among SLCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Metzner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Matsuo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schweikhard and Ziegler, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wei et al., 2016</xref>). Serine consists of a hydroxypropionic acid and an amino group at the α-carbon. Possibly, the hydroxypropionic acid on serine is the main part to interact with SMCTs because hydroxypropionic acid shares similar moieties to lactic acid and propionic acid which are the high-affinity substrates of SMCTs. The apparent K<sub>m</sub> of <sc>d</sc>-serine transport in SMCT1 is 3.39 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), which is within the range of known SMCT1 substrates (0.07–6.5 mM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ganapathy et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting that SMCT1 accepts <sc>d</sc>-serine in the same manner as other monocarboxylate substrates. Inhibition of <sc>d</sc>-[<sup>3</sup>H]serine transport by non-radioisotope-labeled <sc>d</sc>-serine in SMCT2 was less effective than in SMCT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Together with the previous report that SMCT2 had lower inhibition affinities for nicotinate, lactate, and butyrate than SMCT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Srinivas et al., 2005</xref>), we suggest that SMCT2 recognizes <sc>d</sc>-serine with lower affinity than SMCT1.</p><p>Kinetics analysis of <sc>d</sc>-serine transport revealed the high affinity by ASCT2 (K<sub>m</sub> 167 μM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Foster et al., 2016</xref>) and low affinity by SMCT1 (K<sub>m</sub> 3.39 mM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). In addition to transport affinity, the expression levels and co-localization of multiple transporters within the same cells are critical for elucidating the physiological roles of transporters or transport systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sakaguchi et al., 2024</xref>). In our proteome data, the chromatogram intensities of Smct1 (2.9×10<sup>9</sup> AU) and Smct2 (1.6×10<sup>8</sup> AU) were significantly higher than that of Asct2 (1.5×10<sup>7</sup> AU) in the control mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>: abundance in sham). While direct intensity comparisons between different proteins in mass spectrometry analyses are not precise, they can provide a general indication of relative protein amounts. This finding aligns with the snRNA-seq data, where Asct2 expression was found to be minimal, present in less than 10% of cell populations under both control and IRI conditions, suggesting that many cells do not express Asct2. Conversely, Smct1 and Smct2 show high and ubiquitous expression in control conditions, but their levels are markedly reduced in IRI conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Our ex vivo assays demonstrate that both ASCT2 and SMCTs mediate D-serine transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Consequently, Asct2 may contribute to D-serine reabsorption due to its high affinity. Meanwhile, Smcts, owing to their abundance particularly in cells lacking Asct2, likely play a significant role in D-serine reabsorption. Moreover, factors such as transport turnover rate (K<sub>cat</sub>) and the presence of local canonical substrates are also vital in defining the overall contribution of D-serine transport systems.</p><p>Several pieces of evidence support SMCT1 at S3 segment and SMCT2 at S1 + S2 segments on renal <sc>d</sc>-serine handling. First, our enantiomeric amino acid profile from the IRI model, which agrees with the previous reports in CKD patients and AKI animal models, suggested the existence of a stereoselective transport system for serine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sasabe et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kimura et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sasabe and Suzuki, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hesaka et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kimura et al., 2020</xref>). The system seems distinct from the known classical small amino acid transport systems and ASCT2. Second, previous studies indicated renal <sc>d</sc>-serine transport takes place at the proximal tubules by the distinct transport systems between S1+S2 and S3 segments. Both systems exhibited the characteristics of Na<sup>+</sup> dependency, electrogenicity, low affinity (mM range), and partial stereoselectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kragh-Hansen and Sheikh, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shimomura et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Silbernagl et al., 1999</xref>). These properties of the <sc>d</sc>-serine transport suit well to SMCTs and convince us of the contribution of SMCTs to renal <sc>d</sc>-serine transport in addition to ASCT2. Moreover, continuous administration of high doses of <sc>d</sc>-serine induces nephrotoxicity at the S3 segment of proximal tubules in normal animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Morehead et al., 1945</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Silbernagl et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hasegawa et al., 2019</xref>). It is most likely that the <sc>d</sc>-serine-induced proximal tubular damage is partly due to the absorption of <sc>d</sc>-serine by SMCTs, in particular by SMCT1 at the S3 segment. It is noted that SMCT2 is reported as a protein indicator for kidney repair during the injury. Prolonged SMCT2 down-expression indicates the failed repair of proximal tubular cells in IRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kirita et al., 2020</xref>). The significance of SMCT2, in turn, supports the merit of <sc>d</sc>-serine usage in AKI and CKD diagnosis.</p><p>Combining all the results, we propose the model of <sc>d</sc>-serine transport systems in renal proximal tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>)<sc>.</sc> In normal kidneys, the expression levels of SMCT2 at S1 + S2 segments and SMCT1 at S3 segment are high, whereas ASCT2 is low. Both SMCTs and ASCT2 are involved in <sc>d</sc>-serine reabsorption. Nonetheless, the net reabsorption levels appear to be relatively low due to the low affinities of SMCTs. It is likely that reabsorption at the S3 segment is dominated by SMCT1 function. The reabsorbed <sc>d</sc>-serine in proximal tubular cells is degraded into OH-pyruvate by <sc>d</sc>-amino acid oxidase (DAAO), thereby maintaining the low plasma <sc>d</sc>-serine but high urinary <sc>d</sc>-serine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>: normal). In pathological conditions such as AKI and CKD, the expression levels of SMCT1 and SMCT2 decrease dramatically while ASCT2 increases. The high affinity and ubiquitous expression of ASCT2 suggest the increased <sc>d</sc>-serine reabsorption in all proximal tubular segments. Together with the in-part reduction of DAAO activity during the pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sasabe et al., 2014</xref>), the excess reabsorbed <sc>d</sc>-serine may lead to a high plasma <sc>d</sc>-serine level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>: IRI).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Proposed model of D-serine transport systems in renal proximal tubules.</title><p>The model summarizes the contributions of ASCT2, SMCT1, and SMCT2 to D-serine transport in renal proximal tubules.

This observation suggested the differential renal handling of <sc>d-</sc>serine compared to <sc>l-</sc>serine. While we identified SMCTs as a <sc>d</sc>-serine transport system, it has been reported that <sc>l-</sc>serine reabsorption is mediated by B<sup>0</sup>AT3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Singer et al., 2009</xref>). We propose that the alterations in plasma and urinary <sc>d-</sc>/<sc>l-</sc>serine ratios are the combined outcomes of: (1) transport systems for <sc>l</sc>-serine and (2) transport systems for <sc>d</sc>-serine. In normal kidneys, the low plasma <sc>d-</sc>/<sc>l-</sc>serine ratios could result from the efficient reabsorption of <sc>l-</sc>serine by B<sup>0</sup>AT3, coupled with the DAAO activity that degrades intracellular <sc>d-</sc>serine reabsorbed by SMCTs. In IRI conditions, our enantiomeric amino acid profiling revealed low plasma <sc>l-</sc>serine and high urinary <sc>l-</sc>serine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2B</xref>).

These observations suggest that the low <sc>l-</sc>serine reabsorption in IRI is a result of B<sup>0</sup>AT3 reduction.</p><p>In proteomics, some transporters including ASCT2 were found to be increased in the AKI conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), yet the mechanism behind this change is still unclear. snRNA-seq study revealed that the cell clusters in all proximal tubular segments during early AKI were drastically different from the healthy kidney suggesting that the new distinct cell clusters in AKI were de novo synthesized for the repair process, as early AKI is a reversible condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kirita et al., 2020</xref>). ASCT2 was found to be only one type of small amino acid transporter which was increased during AKI conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). ASCT2 was reported to be highly expressed in proliferative cells and stem cells and played a key role in the regulation of mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway and glutamine-mediated metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Formisano and Van Winkle, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kandasamy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Scalise et al., 2018</xref>). We postulate that ASCT2 is a nascent transporter to provide small amino acids and glutamine for cell growth, as a molecular mechanism in de novo cellular synthesis for the recovery processes.</p><p>Besides ASCT2 and SMCTs, other transporters may contribute to <sc>d</sc>-serine handling in the kidney. Influxes of <sc>d</sc>-[<sup>3</sup>H]serine in the Na<sup>+</sup>-free condition of the normal mouse BBMVs accounted for ~30% of total uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>). These are the results of the experimental background of non-specific accumulation of radiotracers and probably also Na<sup>+</sup>-independent transporter(s). In BBMVs from 8 hr IRI model, <sc>d</sc>-[<sup>3</sup>H]serine uptake without preloading suggested the existence of Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent transporters during the injury. In the <sc>d</sc>-serine transporter screening, we found that PAT1 and B<sup>0</sup>AT3 attenuated <sc>d</sc>-serine-mediated growth inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>).

Imaging was detected using a KEYENCE BZ-X710 microscope. Images were color-adjusted using ImageJ ver. 1.51 (NIH). Images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> were subjected to deconvolution process in Fiji/ImageJ2 ver. 2.9 prior to color adjustment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Analysis of Smcts and Asct2 from the open-sourced dataset of snRNA-seq of the IRI model</title><p>The dataset of snRNA-seq used is created from the mice after IRI and published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kirita et al., 2020</xref>. The snRNA-seq dataset (GSE139107), which has already processed by zUMIs and SoupX, was downloaded from GEO, a public functional genomics data repository (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barrett et al., 2013</xref>). The dataset revealed percentage of mitochondrial UMI counts of each cell (calculated by <italic>PercentageFeatureSet</italic> function of Seurat) to be &lt;0.01% in more than 94% cells in each cluster. From the ‘GSE139107_MouseIRI.metadata’, we annotated the expression of Smct1, Smct2, and Asct2 in proximal tubule segments 1–3 (S1, S2, and S3) at the early stages of IRI (4 and 12 hr) compared to the control mice. Downstream analyses including normalization, scaling, and visualization were performed by Seurat v3.2, an R package designed for quality control, analysis, and exploration of single-cell RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>). After selecting the cells in S1, S2, and S3 from the datasets (control, 4 hr IRI, and 12 hr IRI), we merged the data of the cells in the same cluster. The data were then calculated as log-normalized values by <italic>NormalizeData</italic> function and scaled by <italic>ScaleData</italic> function of Seurat. Visualization of the expression data was performed using Seurat plug-in of R software and ggplot2 plug-in of R software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wickham, 2010</xref>). Dot plots of gene expression in each cluster after log-transformation and scaling were created by <italic>Dotplot</italic> function of Seurat.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>founder and CEO of KAGAMI Inc, a startup company working on chiral amino acids analysis and research for medical applications</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>A patent (WO/2021/132691) has been applied by KAGAMI Inc, Nara Medical University,and NIBIOHN with P.W., S.M., P.K., T.K., M.Mit., and S.N. as inventors based on this research.

Here, the authors convincingly show that D-serine is transported in the kidney by the neutral amino acid transporter ASCT2 and as a non-canonical substrate for the sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter SMCTs. Although both transport D-serine, this important study further shows in a mouse model for acute kidney injury that ASCT2 has the dominant role.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The paper combines proteomics, animal models, ex vivo transport analyses and in vitro transport assays using purified components. The exhaustive methods employed provide compelling evidence that both transporters can translocate D-serine in the kidney.</p><p>Weakness:</p><p>In the model for acute kidney injury the SMCTs proteins were not showing a significant change in expression levels and were rather analysed based on other, circumstantial evidence. Although its clear SMCTs can transport D-serine its physiological role is less obvious compared to ASCT2.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.92615.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript &quot;A multi-hierarchical approach reveals D-1 serine as a hidden substrate of sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporters&quot; by Wiriyasermkul et al. is a resubmission of a manuscript, which focused first on the proteomic analysis of apical membrane isolated from mouse kidney with early ischemia- reperfusion injury (IRI), a well-known acute kidney injury (AKI) model. In a second part, the transport of D-serine by Asct2, Smct1, and Smct2 has been characterized in detail in different model systems, such as transfected cells and proteoliposomes.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>A major problem with the first submission was the explanation of the link between the two parts of the manuscript: it was not very clear why the focus on Asct2, Smct1 and Smct2 was a consequence of the proteomic analysis. In the present version of the manuscript, the authors have focused on the expression of membrane transporters in the proteome analysis, thus making the reason for studying Asct2, Smct1 and Smct2 transporters more clear. In addition, the authors used 2D-HPLC to measure plasma and urinary enantiomers of 20 amino acids in plasma and urine samples from sham and ischaemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) mice. The results of this analysis demonstrated the value of D-serine as a potential marker of renal injury. These changes have greatly improved the manuscript and made it more convincing.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>More than weakness I would speak of discussion points: I have a few suggestions that may help to make the paper more accessible to a general audience.</p><p>(1) In the Introduction, when the authors introduce the term &quot;micromolecules&quot;, it would be beneficial to provide a precise definition or clarification of what they mean by this term. Adding a brief explanation may help the reader to better understand the context.</p><p>(2) In line 91, I suggest specifying that this is a renal IRI model.</p><p>(3) Lines 167-168 state that Asct2 is localised to the apical side of the renal proximal tubules. Is there any expression of Asct2 in other nephron segments?</p><p>(4) Lines 225-226: Have the authors expressed the candidate genes in HEK293 cells with ASCT2 knockdown?</p><p>(5) lines 254-255: why was D-serine transport enhanced by ASCT2 knockdown in FlpInTR-SMCT1 or 2 cells?</p><p>(6) line 265: The low affinity of SMCT1 for D-serine alone makes it an unlikely transporter for urinary D-serine.</p><p>(7) line 316: The authors state that there is a high tubular D-serine reabsorption in IRI and in line 424 that there is an inactivation of DAAO during the pathology. This suggests that there is a reabsorption of D-serine mediated by a transport system in the basolateral membrane domain of proximal tubular cells. Do the authors have any information about this transporter?</p><p>(8) in lines 462-463, the authors state: &quot;It is suggested that PAT1 is less active at the apical membrane where the luminal pH is neutral&quot;. However, the pH of urine in the proximal tubules is normally acidic due to the high activity of NH3. I suggest rewording this sentence.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.92615.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The main objective of this work has been to delve into the mechanisms underlying the increment of D-serine in serum, as a marker of renal injury.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>With a multi-hierarchical approach, the work shows that Ischemia reperfusion injury in kidney causes a specific increment in renal reabsorption of D-serine that, at least in part, is due to the increased expression of the apical transporter ASCT2. In the way, the authors revealed that SMCT1 also transports D-serine.</p><p>The manuscript also supports that increased expression of ASCT2, even together with the parallel decreased expression of SMCT1, in renal proximal tubules underlies the increased reabsorption of D-serine responsible of the increment of this enantiomer in serum in a murine model of ischemia reperfusion injury.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Remains to be clarified whether ASCT2 has substantial stereospecificity in favor of D- versus L-serine to sustain a ~10-fold decreased in the ratio D-serine/L-serine in the urine of mouse under ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI).</p><p>It is not clear how the increment in the expression of ASCT2, in parallel with the decreased expression of SMCT1, results in increased renal reabsorption of D-serine in IRI.</p><p>I am satisfied with the changes the authors have introduced in the text of the revised version of their manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article

We acknowledge the reviewer's observation that the changes indicated by our proteomic results are not markedly pronounced. To reinforce our findings, we have incorporated an analysis of gene alterations at the single-cell level (snRNA-seq) from the publicly accessible IRI mouse model data (Figure supplement 7). The snRNA-seq data align with our proteomic data in terms of the general trend of gene/protein alterations, but reveal more substantial changes in both ASCT2 and SMCTs. These discrepancies might stem from the different quantification methods used, suggesting a possible underestimation in our label-free proteomic quantification. The differences we see between the functional changes in transporters and their quantification in proteomics can be explained by the unique challenges posed by membrane proteins. Post-translational modifications and the complex nature of multiple transmembrane domains often impact the accurate measurement of these proteins in proteomic studies. This complexity can lead to a mismatch between the actual functional changes occurring in the transporters and their perceived abundance or alterations as detected by proteomic methods (Figure 4A) (Schey KL et al. Biochemistry 2015, doi: 10.1021/bi301604j). However, this label-free quantitative proteomics approach is well-suited for our study, given its screening efficiency, compatibility with animal models, and the absence of a labeling requirement. We may consider incorporating alternative quantitative proteomic methods in future for a more thorough comparison. We have included these considerations in lines 351-356 of the revised manuscript.</p><p>Manuscript lines 351-356</p><p>“When evaluating the extent of gene/protein alterations between the control and IRI conditions, we observed that the gene alterations of both Asct2 and Smcts, as revealed by snRNAsequencing, are more pronounced than the protein alteration ratios obtained from proteomics.

We suggest that ASCT2 contributes to D-serine reabsorption because of its high affinity and SMCTs (SMCT1 and SMCT2) would play a role in D-serine reabsorption in the cells without ASCT2 expression. In addition, we included other factors (the turnover rate and the presence of local canonical substrates) that may determine the capability of D-serine reabsorption. We have included this suggestion in the Discussion lines 386-404.</p><p>Manuscript lines 386-404</p><p>“Kinetics analysis of D-serine transport revealed the high affinity by ASCT2 (Km 167 µM) (Foster et al., 2016) and low affinity by SMCT1 (Km 3.39 mM; Figure 5E). In addition to transport affinity, the expression levels and co-localization of multiple transporters within the same cells are critical for elucidating the physiological roles of transporters or transport systems (Sakaguchi et al., 2024). In our proteome data, the chromatogram intensities of Smct1 (2.9 x 109 AU) and Smct2 (1.6 x 108 AU) were significantly higher than that of Asct2 (1.5 x 107 AU) in control mice (Table 1: abundance in Sham). While direct intensity comparisons between different proteins in mass spectrometry analyses are not precise, they can provide a general indication of relative protein amounts. This finding aligns with the snRNA-seq data, where Asct2 expression was found to be minimal, present in less than 10% of cell populations under both control and IRI conditions, suggesting that many cells do not express Asct2. Conversely, Smct1 and Smct2 show high and ubiquitous expression in control conditions, but their levels are markedly reduced in IRI conditions (Figure supplement 7). Our ex vivo assays demonstrate that both ASCT2 and SMCTs mediate D-serine transport (Figure 7B). Consequently, Asct2 may contribute to D-serine reabsorption due to its high affinity, whereas Smcts, owing to their abundance, particularly in cells lacking Asct2, likely play a significant role in D-serine reabsorption. Moreover, factors such as transport turnover rate (Kcat) and the presence of local canonical substrates are also vital in defining the overall contribution of Dserine transport systems.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript &quot;A multi-hierarchical approach reveals D-1 serine as a hidden substrate of sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporters&quot; by Wiriyasermkul et al. is a resubmission of a manuscript, which focused first on the proteomic analysis of apical membrane isolated from mouse kidney with early Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury (IRI), a well-known acute kidney injury (AKI) model.

In addition, the authors used 2D-HPLC to measure plasma and urinary enantiomers of 20 amino acids in plasma and urine samples from sham and Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury (IRI) mice. The results of this analysis demonstrated the value of D-serine as a potential marker of renal injury.

Considering the alteration of D-/L-serine ratios, there are several factors including protein expression levels at both apical and basolateral sides, properties of the transporters (e.g. transport affinities, substrate stereoselectivities), and the expression of DAAO (D-amino acid oxidase) which selectively degrades D-amino acids. Moreover, the mechanism becomes more complicated when the transport systems of L- and D-enantiomers are different and have distinct stereoselectivities as in the case of serine. Future studies are required to complete the mechanism. However, we would like to explore the mechanism based on the current knowledge.</p><p>From this study, we identified ASCT2 and SMCTs (SMCT1 and SMCT2) as D-serine transport systems. We showed that SMCT1 prefers D-serine. Although we did not analyze ASCT2 stereoselectivity, based on the previous studies, ASCT2 recognizes both D- and Lserine with high affinities and slightly prefers L-enantiomer (Km of 18.4 µM) for L-serine in oocyte expression system (Utsunomiya-Tate et al. J Biol Chem 1996) and 167 µM for Dserine in oocyte expression system (Foster et al. Plos ONE 2016), and the IC50 of 0.7 mM for L-serine and 4.9 mM for D-serine (in HEK293 expression systems, Foster et al. PLOS ONE 2016). The proteomics showed an increase of ASCT2 (1.6-fold increase) and a decrease of SMCTs (1.7-fold decrease in SMCT1, and 1.3-fold decrease in SMCT2) in IRI conditions. The table below summarizes D-serine transport by ASCT2 and SMCTs.</p><p>In the case of L-serine, ASCT2 and B0ATs (in particular B0AT3) have been revealed as L-serine transport systems in the kidneys (Bröer et al. Physiol Rev 2008; Singer et al. J Biol Chem 2009). Proteomics showed that B0ATs have higher expression levels than ASCT2 supporting the idea that B0ATs are the main L-serine transport system (Table S1: Abundance of B0AT1 = 1.34E+09, B0AT3 = 2.13E+08, ASCT2 = 1.46E+07). In IRI conditions, B0AT3 decreased 1.8 fold and B0AT1 decreased 1.1 fold. From these results, we included the contribution of B0ATs in L-serine transport in Author response table 1.</p><table-wrap id="sa4table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Transport systems</th><th>Normal condition</th><th/><th>IRI</th><th/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top">L-serine</td><td align="left" valign="top">D-serine</td><td align="left" valign="top">L-serine</td><td align="left" valign="top">D-serine</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">SMCTs</td><td align="left" valign="top">-</td><td align="left" valign="top">+</td><td align="left" valign="top">-</td><td align="left" valign="top">-</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">ASCT2</td><td align="left" valign="top">++</td><td align="left" valign="top">+</td><td align="left" valign="top">+++</td><td align="left" valign="top">++</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">B^(0)ATs</td><td align="left" valign="top">++++++</td><td align="left" valign="top">(-?)</td><td align="left" valign="top">+++</td><td align="left" valign="top">(-?)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">DAAO</td><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top">Degrade D-<break/>serine</td><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top">No additional<break/>role</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Taken together, we suggest that high ratios of D-/L-serine in IRI conditions are a combinational result of (1) increase of D-serine reabsorption by ASCT2 enhancement and SMCTs reduction and (2) decrease of L-serine reabsorption by B0ATs. We have included this suggestion in the Discussion lines 438-451.</p><p>Manuscript lines 438-451</p><p>“The enantiomeric profiles of serine revealed distinct plasma D/L-serine ratio, with low rations in the normal control but elevated ratios in IRI, despite the weak stereoselectivity of ASCT2 (Figure 1B). This observation suggested differential renal handling of D-serine compared to L-serine. While we identified SMCTs as a D-serine transport system, it has been reported that L-serine reabsorption is mediated by B0AT3 (Singer et al., 2009). We propose that the alterations in plasma and urinary D/L-serine ratios are the combined outcomes of: (1) transport systems for L-serine, and (2) transport systems for D-serine. In normal kidneys, the low plasma D/L-serine ratios could result from the efficient reabsorption of L-serine by B0AT3, coupled with the DAAO activity that degrades intracellular D-serine reabsorbed by SMCTs. In IRI conditions, our enantiomeric amino acid profiling revealed low plasma L-serine and high urinary L-serine (Figure supplements 1B, 2B). Additionally, the proteomic analysis indicated a reduction in B0AT3 levels (4h IRI/sham = 0.56 fold; 8h IRI/sham = 0.65 fold; Table S1). These observations suggest that the low L-serine reabsorption in IRI is a result of B0AT3 reduction.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>This is a thorough study that was reviewed previously under the old system.

However, Km at mM range is widely accepted for several low-affinity amino acid transporters such as proton-coupled amino acid transporter PAT1 (Km = 2 – 5 mM; Miyauchi et al. Biochem J 2010), cationic amino acid transporter CAT2A (Km = 3 – 4 mM; Closs et al. Biochem 1997), and large-neutral amino acid transporter LAT4 (Km = 17 mM; Bodoy et al. J Biol Chem 2005). In the kidneys, many compounds are well-known to be reabsorbed by the low-affinity but high-capacity (high-expression) transporters. Similarly, D-serine was reported to be reabsorbed by the low-affinity transporter (Kragh-Hansen and Sheikh, J Physiol 1984; Shimomura et al. BBA 1988; Silbernagl et al. Am J Physiol Renal Physiol 1999). Moreover, amino acid profile showed urinary D-serine in the range of 100 – 200 µM (Figure supplement 2). This concentration range could drive SMCT1 function (Figure 5). Combined with the high and ubiquitous expression of SMCT1, we propose that SMCT1 is a low-affinity but highcapacity D-serine transporter in the kidneys.</p><p>snRNA-seq is a method that can directly compare the expression levels between different genes within the same cells. From Figure supplement 7, expression of SMCT1 is much more abundant than ASCT2. ASCT2 was presented in less than 10% of cell population.

Proximal tubule (PT) is the first and the main region to maintain acid-base homeostasis in the kidney.

Although ion fluxes in PT is to maintain the pH homeostasis, the pH regulation in both luminal and intracellular PT cells is highly dynamic.

In the discussion, the main argument to sustain this hypothesis is the higher apparent affinity for D-serine of ASCT2 (&lt;200 uM Km) versus SMCT1 (3.4 mM Km). In the Discussion section (page 18- 1st complete paragraph), the authors indicate that the Mass Spec intensities of SMCT1 and 2 are two and one order of magnitude higher respectively than that of ASCT2. This suggests that SMCT1 is clearly more expressed than ASCT2 in control conditions. IRI increments ASCT2 protein expression in brush-border membrane vesicle from kidney 1.6 folds and decreases that of SMCT1 0.6 folds. How this fold changes, even taking into account the lower Km of ASCT2 versus SMCT1 would explain the dramatic changes in the D-/L-serine ratios in plasma and urine in IRI? The authors might discuss whether other transport characteristics, even unknown (e.g., a higher turnover rate of ASCT2 vs SMCT1), would also contribute to the higher D-serine reabsorption in IRI.</p><p>SMCT1 shows some enantiomer selectivity for D- vs L-serine.

Moreover, factors such as transport turnover rate (Kcat) and the presence of local canonical substrates are also vital in defining the overall contribution of D-serine transport systems.”</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>As for the dramatic alterations of D/L-serine ratios juxtaposed with minimal changes in ASCT2 and SMCTs expression level, we cautiously refrain from drawing a definitive conclusion regarding the entire mechanism. This caution is grounded in the scientific understanding of a comprehensive elucidation of both L-serine transport systems and D-serine transport systems at both apical and basolateral membranes. Nevertheless, we would like to suggest a mechanism at the apical membrane based on the current knowledge.</p></list-item></list><p>For D-serine transport systems, we found ASCT2 and SMCTs contributions in this study. Meanwhile, L-serine was previously reported to be mediated mainly by the neutral amino acid transporters B0AT3 (in particular B0AT3; Bröer et al. Physiol Rev 2008; Singer et al. J Biol Chem 2009). Hence, the mechanism behind the alterations of D/L-serine ratios should include B0AT3 functions as well. In IRI conditions, B0AT3 decreased 1.8 fold. We suggest that high ratios of D-/L-serine in IRI conditions are a combined outcome of (1) increase of D-serine reabsorption by ASCT2 enhancement and SMCTs reduction, and (2) decrease of L-serine reabsorption by B0AT3. We have included this suggestion in the Discussion lines 438-451.</p><p>Manuscript lines 438-451</p><p>“The enantiomeric profiles of serine revealed distinct plasma D/L-serine ratios, with low ratios in the normal control but elevated ratios in IRI, despite the weak stereoselectivity of ASCT2 (Figure 1B). This observation suggested the differential renal handling of D-serine compared to L-serine. While we identified SMCTs as a Dserine transport system, it has been reported that L-serine reabsorption is mediated by B0AT3 (Singer et al., 2009). We propose that the alterations in plasma and urinary D/Lserine ratios are the combined outcomes of: (1) transport systems for L-serine, and (2) transport systems for D-serine. In normal kidneys, the low plasma D/L-serine ratios could result from the efficient reabsorption of L-serine by B0AT3, coupled with the DAAO activity that degrades intracellular D-serine reabsorbed by SMCTs. In IRI conditions, our enantiomeric amino acid profiling revealed low plasma L-serine and high urinary L-serine (Figure supplements 1B, 2B). Additionally, the proteomics analysis indicated a reduction in B0AT3 levels (4h IRI/sham = 0.56 fold; 8h IRI/sham = 0.65 fold; Table S1). These observations suggest that the low L-serine reabsorption in IRI is a result of B0AT3 reduction.”</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>In the case of Asc-1, it was reported to be a D-serine transporter in the brain (Rosenberg et al. J Neurosci 2013). Suzuki et al. 2019 showed the increase of Asc-1 in cisplatin-induced tubular injury. Notably, the mRNA of Asc-1 is predominantly found in Henle’s loop, distal tubules, and collecting ducts but not in proximal tubules, and its protein expression level is dramatically low in the kidney (Human Protein Atlas: update on Jun 19, 2023). Furthermore, in this study, Asc-1 expression was not detected in the brush border membrane proteome. Consequently, we have decided not to include Asc-1 in the Discussion of this study, which primarily focuses on the proximal tubules.</p></list-item></list></body></sub-article></article>
