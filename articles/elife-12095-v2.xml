pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12095.001</object-id><p>GPIHBP1 is a glycolipid-anchored membrane protein of capillary endothelial cells that binds lipoprotein lipase (LPL) within the interstitial space and shuttles it to the capillary lumen. The LPL•GPIHBP1 complex is responsible for margination of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins along capillaries and their lipolytic processing. The current work conceptualizes a model for the GPIHBP1•LPL interaction based on biophysical measurements with hydrogen-deuterium exchange/mass spectrometry, surface plasmon resonance, and zero-length cross-linking. According to this model, GPIHBP1 comprises two functionally distinct domains: (1) an intrinsically disordered acidic N-terminal domain; and (2) a folded C-terminal domain that tethers GPIHBP1 to the cell membrane by glycosylphosphatidylinositol. We demonstrate that these domains serve different roles in regulating the kinetics of LPL binding. Importantly, the acidic domain stabilizes LPL catalytic activity by mitigating the global unfolding of LPL's catalytic domain. This study provides a conceptual framework for understanding intravascular lipolysis and GPIHBP1 and LPL mutations causing familial chylomicronemia.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12095.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12095.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12095.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Fat is an important part of our diet. The intestines absorb fats and package them into particles called lipoproteins. After reaching the bloodstream, the fat molecules (lipids) in the lipoproteins are broken down by an enzyme called lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which is located along the surface of small blood vessels. This releases nutrients that can be used by vital tissues – mainly the heart, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissues. LPL is produced by muscle and adipose tissue, but it is quickly swept up by a protein called GPIHBP1 and shuttled to its site of action inside the blood vessels.</p><p>Mutations that alter the structure of LPL or GPIHBP1 can prevent the breakdown of lipids, resulting in high levels of lipids in the blood. This can lead to inflammation in the pancreas and also increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Many earlier studies have examined the properties of LPL, but our understanding of GPIHBP1 has been limited, mainly because it has been difficult to purify GPIHBP1 for analysis.</p><p>Using genetically altered insect cells, Mysling et al. were able to purify two different forms of GPIHBP1 – a full-length version and a shorter version that lacked a small section at the end of the molecule known as the acidic domain. This revealed that the opposite end of the molecule – called the carboxyl-terminal domain – is primarily responsible for binding LPL and anchoring it inside blood vessels. Once LPL is bound to GPIHBP1, the acidic domain of GPIHBP1 helps to stabilize LPL. If GPIHBP1’s acidic domain is missing then LPL is more susceptible to losing its structure, rendering it incapable of breaking down the lipids in the blood.</p><p>Mysling et al. describe a new model for how LPL and GPIHBP1 interact that explains how specific mutations in the genes that encode these proteins interfere with the delivery of LPL to small blood vessels. In the future, this could help researchers to develop new strategies to treat people with high levels of lipids in their blood.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12095.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12095.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>familial chylomicronemia</kwd><kwd>lipolysis</kwd><kwd>hyperlipidemia</kwd><kwd>intrinsically disordered protein</kwd><kwd>HDX-MS</kwd><kwd>surface plasmon resonance</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Leducq Transatlantic Network</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant 12CVD04</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beigneux</surname><given-names>Anne P</given-names></name><name><surname>Loren</surname><given-names>Fong G</given-names></name><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>Stephen G</given-names></name><name><surname>Ploug</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL090553</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>Stephen G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL087228</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>Stephen G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Intravascular triglyceride hydrolysis by lipoprotein lipase is crucial for delivering lipid nutrients to vital tissues, such as the heart, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>For nearly six decades, we have known that lipoprotein lipase (LPL), a triglyceride hydrolase secreted by myocytes and adipocytes, is essential for the lipolytic processing of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) in the bloodstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Korn, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Young and Zechner, 2013</xref>). LPL-mediated processing of TRLs occurs along the capillary lumen, and LPL is readily released from the surface of capillaries with polyanionic compounds such as heparin. LPL contains an N-terminal domain (NTD) for catalysis and a C-terminal domain (CTD) that is essential for lipid binding. LPL is active as a head-to-tail homodimer, and several lines of evidence suggest that the CTD of one LPL monomer delivers triglyceride substrates to the NTD of the partner monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kobayashi et al., 2002</xref>). In the presence of certain LPL mutations (e.g., mutations in the catalytic triad or mutations that prevent LPL dimerization), the processing of TRLs is markedly impaired, leading to severe hypertriglyceridemia (familial chylomicronemia) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brahm and Hegele, 2015</xref>).</p><p>For decades, the mechanism by which LPL traversed endothelial cells to reach the luminal surface of capillaries—as well as LPL’s binding site within capillaries—were enigmas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 2015</xref>). These uncertainties have been addressed by the discovery of a novel LPL binding protein of capillary endothelial cells, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high density lipoprotein–binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1). GPIHBP1 binds LPL within the interstitial spaces and transports LPL across endothelial cells to its site of action in the capillary lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Beigneux et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davies et al., 2010</xref>). In the absence of GPIHBP1, LPL does not reach the capillary lumen, and there is no margination of TRLs along the surface of capillaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goulbourne et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>GPIHBP1 is a member of the LU (Ly6/uPAR) protein domain family, which includes CD59, SLURP1, C4.4A, TGF-β receptors, and uPAR. The hallmark of this protein family is a three-finger–fold with a defined disulfide pairing motif involving eight highly conserved cysteines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ploug, 2003</xref>). Members of the LU domain family are widespread in the animal kingdom and occur as secreted proteins (e.g. SLURP1), integral membrane proteins (TGFβ receptors), and glycolipid-anchored proteins (e.g. CD59, GPIHBP1, C4.4A, uPAR). During evolution, the LU domain has evolved to serve many different purposes in mammals: GPIHBP1 transports LPL; CD59 inhibits complement activation; TGFβ receptors are involved in cytokine signaling; TEX101 regulates fertility; and uPAR focuses plasminogen activation on cell surfaces. Although detailed structure–function relationships have been elucidated for a few mammalian LU domain proteins (e.g. TGFβ receptors, CD59, uPAR), progress in understanding the biochemistry and biophysics of protein interactions for the majority of LU domain proteins, including GPIHBP1, has lagged behind, largely because of the need for highly purified recombinant protein preparations.</p><p>In our opinion, GPIHBP1 represents one of the more intriguing mammalian LU domain proteins from both a functional and a structural point of view. First, GPIHBP1 function is tightly linked to human disease as a variety of loss-of-function mutations in GPIHBP1 have been encountered in humans with familial chylomicronemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beigneux et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buonuomo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Olivecrona et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Plengpanich et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rios et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Surendran et al., 2012</xref>). The majority of these disease-causing mutations impair the folding of the LU domain, leading to multimerized and dysfunctional GPIHBP1 molecules on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beigneux et al., 2015</xref>). In a comprehensive screening of GPIHBP1 mutants, one mutant (GPIHBP1<sup>W89S</sup>) was found to have markedly impaired LPL binding despite being monomeric, suggesting that it retained the native folding of its LU domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beigneux et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beigneux et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, several mutations in the CTD of LPL (e.g. C418Y, first identified in a patient with chylomicronemia) have no effect on catalysis but abolish the ability of LPL to bind to GPIHBP1 (and thus prevent LPL transport across endothelial cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Henderson et al., 1996</xref>). Amino acid numbering throughout this article refers to the first residue in the mature protein.</p><p>Second, GPIHBP1 is unique from a structural perspective. Among the entire LU protein family, only very few proteins have N-terminal extensions (e.g. GPIHBP1 and the spermatid marker SP-10). In the case of GPIHBP1, the N-terminal extension is highly enriched in acidic residues, with 21 of 26 consecutive amino acids in human GPIHBP1 being aspartic acid or glutamic acid. Early studies in cell culture suggested that GPIHBP1’s acidic domain is important for GPIHBP1•LPL interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gin et al., 2008</xref>), but a detailed study of the functional impact of the acidic domain on LPL function has been lacking. One of the impediments to progress is that a large fraction of the GPIHBP1 produced by transfected mammalian cells is misfolded and in the form of multimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beigneux et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, we used highly purified proteins and a combination of hydrogen–deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), surface plasmon resonance (SPR), zero-length cross-linking, and LPL activity assays to elucidate LPL•GPIHBP1 interactions both kinetically and dynamically. Our studies show: (1) that the kinetics of LPL•GPIHBP1 interactions are controlled by both the LU domain and the acidic domain of GPIHBP1; and (2) that the acidic domain is intrinsically disordered and is responsible for stabilizing the catalytic activity of LPL by inhibiting the inherent instability and subsequent unfolding of LPL’s catalytic domain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Production and purification of recombinant soluble GPIHBP1</title><p>A secreted version of human GPIHBP1<sup>1–131</sup> was produced in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells as a fusion protein with uPAR domain III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, this protein proved to be prone to an internal cleavage after Arg<sup>38</sup> during enterokinase-mediated removal of the uPAR tag. This unexpected cleavage event markedly reduced the yields of purified GPIHBP1<sup>1–131</sup>. Alignments of multiple primate GPIHBP1 sequences revealed that Arg<sup>38</sup> is not conserved during evolution. In GPIHBP1 from <italic>Nomascus leucogenys,</italic> which is 94% identical to human GPIHBP1, the residue corresponding to Arg<sup>38</sup> is Gly<sup>38</sup>. Based on these homology considerations, we therefore expressed and purified a modified protein in which Arg<sup>38</sup> was replaced with Gly; this construct yielded high levels of pure GPIHBP1<sup>1–131/R38G</sup> along with moderate amounts of a truncated GPIHBP1<sup>34–131/R38G</sup>. That truncated protein was the result of an additional cleavage after Arg<sup>33</sup>. Both GPIHBP1<sup>1–131</sup> and GPIHBP1<sup>34–131</sup> (lacking the acidic domain) were purified to homogeneity by cation-exchange chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Importantly, both proteins were monomeric with no traces of aggregation, as judged by analytical size-exclusion chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This homogeneity is a noteworthy achievement because earlier studies had shown that GPIHBP1 is highly susceptible to multimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beigneux et al., 2015</xref>). The anomalous partitioning of GPIHBP1<sup>1–131</sup> during size-exclusion chromatography is most likely a consequence of a large Stokes radius caused by the presence of an intrinsically disordered N-terminal peptide (see next section). Consistent with this assumption, GPIHBP1<sup>34–131</sup>, which lacks the acidic domain, eluted with the expected hydrodynamic volume for a globular protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12095.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Model of human GPIHBP1.</title><p>Panel <bold>A</bold> shows a cartoon representation for glycolipid-anchored human GPIHBP1.

In particular, we observed markedly reduced deuterium uptake within strands D and E of GPIHBP1 when it formed a complex with LPL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This shift in the dynamics likely reflects a transition to a state with increased secondary structure and/or a direct engagement in a ligand-binding interface. The fact that the HDX-MS analysis of GPIHBP1 identified β-strand D as a candidate binding interface for LPL was not entirely unexpected given that a previous mutagenesis study had shown that individual alanine replacements of Thr<sup>85</sup>, Ser<sup>87</sup>, or Trp<sup>89</sup> in β-strand D impaired LPL binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beigneux et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, two missense mutations involving β-strand D have been associated with chylomicronemia in humans (i.e. Ser<sup>87</sup>→Pro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buonuomo et al., 2015</xref>] and Thr<sup>88</sup>→Arg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Surendran et al., 2012</xref>]). Mutating residues within strand E of GPIHBP1 had little impact on LPL binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beigneux et al., 2011</xref>). The reduced deuterium uptake that we recorded for strand E in the presence of LPL probably relates to a higher propensity for β-sheet formation in the setting of the GPIHBP1•LPL complex. Strand E is one of the most versatile structures in LU proteins; it can adopt a random coil (snake venom α-neurotoxins), a β-strand (uPAR domains I and II), or an α-helix (CD59, Prod1, and uPAR domain III) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kriegbaum et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, the deuterium uptake in the intrinsically disordered N-terminal acidic domain did not change with LPL binding. That finding suggests that the acidic domain either does not participate in the binding interaction or more likely is involved in very transient binding events with LPL (interactions that do not lead to the formation of stable hydrogen bonds).</p><p>From the same set of experiments, we also extracted data concerning the effects on LPL by comparing the differential deuterium uptake between unoccupied LPL and LPL in complex with either intact GPIHBP1<sup>1–131</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) or its N-terminal acidic domain peptide GPIHBP1<sup>1–33</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To minimize possible confounding effects from the inherent instability of unoccupied LPL, we only included deuterium uptake values for 10 and 100 s for the three different states of LPL. Comparing these states, we identified residues 402–419 in the CTD of LPL as the most likely interaction site for the LU domain of GPIHBP1 (shown in blue in the butterfly plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This assignment is based on the fact that GPIHBP1<sup>1–131</sup>, but not GPIHBP1<sup>1–33</sup>, attenuates the deuterium uptake in this particular region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Two missense mutations in or close to this segment (C418Y and E421K) were identified in patients with chylomicronemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Henderson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Henderson et al., 1996</xref>), and follow-up studies showed that both mutations impaired GPIHBP1 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Voss et al., 2011</xref>). It is possible that additional regions in the CTD of LPL are involved in GPIHBP1 binding but escaped detection in our HDX-MS experiments due to the lower level of sequence coverage for the CTD (69%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The impact of the acidic domain peptide (GPIHBP1<sup>1–33</sup>) on LPL deuterium uptake was less pronounced than with intact GPIHBP1<sup>1–131</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>), consistent with a more dynamic interaction (i.e. a shorter residence time of the peptide on LPL). Notwithstanding the more transient interaction, we did nevertheless observe that GPIHBP1<sup>1–33</sup> reduced deuterium uptake in LPL peptides spanning residues 279–293 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), which is localized in the domain interface between the NTD and CTD of LPL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). It is noteworthy that this region contains one of the heparin-binding sites in LPL enriched in basic residues (Arg<sup>281</sup>, Lys<sup>282</sup>, Arg<sup>284</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hata et al., 1993</xref>) and therefore represents a potential binding partner for GPIHBP1’s acidic domain.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Kinetic rate constants for the interaction between GPIHBP1 and LPL</title><p>To dissect the individual contributions of the folded LU domain and the intrinsically disordered acidic domain on the binding kinetics with LPL, we developed and optimized a SPR assay to measure this interaction. In brief, we used a BiacoreT200 to measure the binding kinetics between soluble, monomeric GPIHBP1 and either LPL’s CTD or intact LPL that had been captured on a CM4 sensor chip with an immobilized anti-LPL monoclonal antibody, 5D2. This antibody is well suited to capture and display both LPL and the CTD in a defined orientation because it recognizes both proteins with high affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Using this SPR setup, we found that full-length GPIHBP1<sup>1–131/R38G</sup> binds the CTD of LPL with a K<sub>D</sub> of 0.12 ± 0.04 µM, whereas GPIHBP1<sup>34–131/R38G</sup> binds with a K<sub>D</sub> of 1.41 ± 0.76 µM (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The robustness of the assay is apparent by the repeat analyses of 250 nM GPIHBP1 at the end of each multi-cycle segment (blue curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and 3C</xref>). In parallel, we analyzed the ability of soluble GPIHBP1 to bind to a CTD carrying a single amino acid substitution (C418Y). As noted earlier, the C418Y mutation is known to abolish LPL binding to GPIHBP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Henderson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Voss et al., 2011</xref>). When the LPL CTD<sup>C418Y</sup> was captured on immobilized mAb 5D2 (85 RU ~ 5 fmols/mm<sup>2</sup>), it lacked the ability to bind GPIHBP1<sup>1–131</sup> or GPIHBPB1<sup>34–131</sup>, even at concentrations as high as 1 µM (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). As an additional control, we tested the ability of GPIHBP1<sup>1–131/W89S</sup> to bind the CTD of LPL. Earlier studies had shown that glycolipid-anchored GPIHBP1<sup>W89S</sup> on the surface of transfected CHO-K1 cells has little or no capacity to bind LPL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beigneux et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beigneux et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Plengpanich et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with those studies, the SPR measurements revealed negligible binding of GPIHBP1<sup>1–131/W89S</sup> to the CTD of LPL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that the intrinsically disordered acidic domain of GPIHBP1 has little effect on the affinity of the LPL•GPIHBP1 interaction in the absence of a functional LU domain.</p><p>Kinetic assessment of the SPR binding data reveals that the 5–10-fold difference in the equilibrium binding constants between GPIHBP1<sup>1–131</sup> and GPIHBP1<sup>34–131</sup> could be accounted for by the differences in their association rate constants: <italic>k<sub>on</sub></italic> = 1.04 × 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>–1</sup>s<sup>–1</sup> for GPIHBP1<sup>1–131</sup><italic>versus</italic> a <italic>k<sub>on</sub></italic> = 0.10 × 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>–1</sup>s<sup>–1</sup> for GPIHBP1<sup>34–131</sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

Removal of the single N-linked glycosylation in GPIHBP1<sup>1–131</sup> had no significant impact on the kinetic rate constants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). As these analyses were conducted with the R38G mutation in GPIHBP1 (which was introduced to optimize purification yields), we tested whether this mutation affects the binding kinetics between LPL and GPIHBP1. To liberate intact, wild-type GPIHBP1<sup>1–131</sup>, we performed a partial cleavage of 7 mg RS-DIII-ent-GPIHBP1 with 0.05 U enterokinase/mg protein, which resulted in 70% cleavage of the fusion protein. A sufficient amount of this full-length GPIHBP1<sup>1–131</sup> was purified by ion-exchange chromatography to allow subsequent kinetic analyses by SPR. The kinetics for the interactions between mAb 5D2-captured CTD or LPL and wild-type GPIHBP1<sup>1–131</sup> were similar to those measured with GPIHBP1<sup>1–131/R38G</sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Thus, the R38G mutation does not significantly affect the properties of the GPIHBP1 interaction with LPL.</p><p>A similar kinetic assessment for the binding of LPL homodimers by multi-cycle titration was, however, inherently challenging because the conditions required to regenerate mAb 5D2 between cycles progressively reduced the capturing capacity of the sensor chip. To minimize this confounding factor, we performed a single-cycle kinetic titration of the interaction between GPIHBP1 and full-length LPL dimers captured by mAb 5D2. To be confident that the captured LPL was in a properly folded and homodimeric state, we initially performed a kinetic titration with two LPL-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb 4-1a, which binds within residues 5–25 in LPL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bensadoun et al., 2014</xref>] and mAb 5D2, which binds to residues 380–400 in the CTD of LPL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 1998</xref>]). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, both antibodies bound immobilized LPL when analyzed by a single-cycle titration protocol. Calculation of their binding capacities [R<sub>max</sub> = 200 RU for mAb 4-1a (1.3 fmols/mm<sup>2</sup>) and R<sub>max</sub> = 309 RU for mAb 5D2 (2.1 fmols/mm<sup>2</sup>)] revealed molar surface-binding capacities that were similar to the surface density of the captured LPL homodimer (R<sub>900sec</sub> = 203 RU [2.0 fmols/mm<sup>2</sup>]). Because mAb 5D2 is used as both capture and detection agent in this experiment, our data suggest that the majority of the captured LPL on the sensor chip was in the form of homodimers.</p><p>The single-cycle kinetic titrations revealed fast <italic>k<sub>on</sub></italic> values for GPIHBP1•LPL interactions. The <italic>k<sub>off </sub></italic>values for the LPL complexes with GPIHBP1<sup>1–131</sup> and GPIHBP1<sup>34–131</sup> were 5-fold slower than those for the corresponding CTD interaction, which indicates that GPIHBP1 forms a tighter complex with full-length LPL (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and 4C</xref>). To supplement the real-time binding kinetics recorded by SPR, we measured the equilibrium binding constants for the interaction between GPIHBP1<sup>1–131/R38G</sup> and LPL in solution by microscale thermophoresis (MST) with a Monolith NT.115 (NanoTemper Technologies GmbH; Germany). In these studies, 5 nM Alexa-647–labeled GPIHBP1<sup>1–131/R38G</sup> or GPIHBP1<sup>34–131/R38G</sup> were incubated with increasing concentrations of LPL<sub>2</sub> (10 pM to 350 nM). The binding isotherms were then calculated from the shifts in the thermophoresis of the fluorophore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). With this experimental approach, we determined a K<sub>D</sub> of 5.7 nM for the LPL•GPIHBP1<sup>1–131/R38G</sup> interaction and a K<sub>D</sub> of 147 nM for the GPIHBP1<sup>34–131/R38G</sup> interaction. All things considered, we find that data with this solution-based assay aligns excellently with the binding affinities determined kinetically by SPR.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12095.013</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Equilibrium binding constants of the GPIHBP1•LPL interaction by microscale thermophoresis.</title><p>The microscale thermophoresis signals for the interaction of LPL with 5 nM Alexa Flour-647–labeled GPIHBP1<sup>1–131/R38G</sup> (panel <bold>A</bold>) and GPIHBP1<sup>34–131/R38G</sup> (panel <bold>B</bold>) were recorded in quadruplicates for two-fold dilution series of unlabeled LPL<sub>2</sub> (10 pM to 350 nM).

We found: (1) that the N-terminal acidic domain of GPIHBP1 is intrinsically disordered; (2) that the acidic domain has a major effect on the association rate constant for the GPIHBP1•LPL interaction; (3) that the time-dependent decay of LPL activity is associated with a global unfolding of LPL’s catalytic domain; (4) that the acidic domain of GPIHBP1 preserves the catalytic activity of LPL by mitigating global unfolding of the catalytic domain; and (5) that two discrete interaction sites in the LPL•GPIHBP1 complex cooperate to promote ligand binding and stabilization of LPL catalytic activity.</p><p>Our findings have allowed us to conceptualize a model for unoccupied GPIHBP1 in which the N-terminal acidic domain is intrinsically disordered and the remainder of the protein (i.e. GPIHBP1<sup>34–131</sup>) adopts the prototypical three-finger-fold characteristic of LU domain proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This model was initially suggested by the observation that full-length GPIHBP1 (GPIHBP1<sup>1–131</sup>) exhibits an unexpectedly large hydrodynamic volume (as judged by its elution profile in size-exclusion chromatography [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>]), whereas a truncated GPIHBP1 lacking the acidic domain (GPIHBP1<sup>34–131</sup>) elutes at the expected position for a folded globular protein. The atypical elution profile for the full-length GPIHBP1 is indicative of a large Stokes radius and is one of the hallmarks of intrinsically disordered proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Uversky, 2012</xref>). Further evidence for the disordered nature of the acidic domain is provided by its highly dynamic state as measured by HDX-MS. Our model offers potential insights into the interplay between GPIHBP1 and LPL during LPL mobilization and TRL processing in vivo. In GPIHBP1-deficient mice, the LPL in tissues is mislocalized to the interstitial spaces and never reaches the luminal surface of capillary endothelial cells. It is noteworthy that the LPL in GPIHBP1-deficient mice remains sequestered in the interstitial space, presumably bound to negatively-charged heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davies et al., 2010</xref>). This interaction is thought to be driven by electrostatic interactions and is characterized by fast kinetic rate constants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lookene et al., 1996</xref>), presumably creating a dynamic reservoir of LPL within the interstitial spaces. In wild-type mice, newly secreted LPL likely binds to the same HSPGs but then moves to GPIHBP1 on capillary endothelial cells. We propose that the intrinsically disordered and markedly acidic N-terminal extension of GPIHBP1 plays an important role in mobilizing HSPG-bound LPL within the interstitial spaces through long-ranged electrostatic interactions, thereby driving LPL into association with endothelial cells. This model for LPL mobilization by GPIHBP1 is consistent with the kinetic rate constants that we determined for GPIHBP1•LPL interactions, which are 10-fold faster for intact GPIHBP1<sup>1–131</sup> than for GPIHBP1<sup>34–131</sup> lacking the acidic domain.</p><p>Since the difference in <italic>k<sub>on</sub></italic> for GPIHBP1<sup>1–131</sup> and GPIHBP1<sup>34–131</sup> is observed for both intact LPL and LPL’s CTD alone, we propose that an electrostatic 'encounter complex' is initially established between GPIHBP1’s acidic domain and the basic residues in LPL’s CTD. This encounter complex then guides the maturation of the interaction, facilitating a tighter binding interface between GPIHBP1’s LU domain and residues 402–419 in LPL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The cross-linking that we documented between residues 1–33 of intact GPIHBP1<sup>1–131</sup> and Lys<sup>416</sup>, Lys<sup>424</sup>, and Lys<sup>430</sup> in the CTD of LPL is consistent with this initial encounter/maturation model. The electrostatic component of this model is in accordance with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reimund et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The existence of a dual binding mechanism is also consistent with the available mutagenesis data. First, the importance of the positively charged heparin-binding sequences in LPL’s CTD has been demonstrated by reduced binding of hLPL<sup>K403A;R405A;K407A;K413A;K414A</sup> to GPIHBP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gin et al., 2008</xref>). Second, there is ample evidence for the involvement of additional CTD sequences—apart from positively charged residues—in the binding of LPL to the LU-domain in GPIHBP1. For example, two missense mutations in LPL (C418Y and E421K), first identified in patients with chylomicronemia, have no effect on heparin binding but abolish binding to GPIHBP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Henderson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Henderson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Voss et al., 2011</xref>). Lending support to this two-step binding mechanism is the fact that the acidic domain plays little or no role in the stability of established GPIHBP1•LPL complexes. The <italic>k<sub>off</sub></italic> values for GPIHBP1<sup>1–131</sup> and GPIHBP1<sup>34–131</sup> are comparable, regardless of whether the binding is to LPL’s CTD (<italic>k<sub>off </sub></italic>= 0.1 s<sup>–1</sup>) or to full-length LPL (<italic>k<sub>off </sub></italic>= 0.02 s<sup>–1</sup>).</p><p>A different two-site interaction model between GPIHBP1 and LPL was recently proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reimund et al., 2015</xref>), which suggested that a single molecule of GPIHBP1 binds two LPL homodimers. This conclusion was based on SPR studies in which GPIHBP1 (from the medium of transfected CHO cells) had been captured onto chips coated with the anti-GPIHBP1–specific mAb 11A12. To obtain reliable fits for the LPL-binding profiles recorded by SPR and reduce nonspecific binding of LPL, these authors performed their analyses at 4°C and in the presence of 0.4–0.6 M NaCl. In the current study, the SPR data were obtained under more physiologic conditions (20°C in 0.15 M NaCl), and the binding profiles fit well to a simple 1:1 interaction model (i.e. GPIHBP1+LPL<sub>2</sub>⇆ GPIHBP1•LPL<sub>2</sub>). A likely explanation for the discrepancy between the two studies is the different designs of the SPR studies. The current study measured the binding of purified, monomeric GPIHBP1 in solution to purified LPL that had been captured by mAb 5D2 thereby avoiding the inherent difficulties in having LPL as a soluble analyte. The earlier study measured the interaction between LPL in solution to mouse GPIHBP1 (from the medium of transfected CHO cells) that had been captured on mAb 11A12. We now know the GPIHBP1 secreted from transfected CHO-cells contains significant amounts of dimers and multimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beigneux et al., 2015</xref>), a factor that would further complicate the interpretation of these SPR data.</p><p>An intriguing finding in the current study was the observation that LPL undergoes a time-dependent global unfolding of its catalytic N-terminal domain, as judged by the loss of stable secondary structure in HDX-MS studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This transition into a pre-molten globule–like conformation of LPL’s catalytic domain provides a plausible structural explanation for the time-dependent decline in LPL catalytic activity at room temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Osborne et al., 1985</xref>). It is noteworthy, however, that unfolding of the catalytic domain in LPL proceeds with only one-half the rate of the parallel loss of catalytic activity. That observation is consistent with a model where the unfolding of one LPL molecule in the homodimer would lead to the inactivation of both subunits.</p><p>From our HDX-MS analyses of GPIHBP1•LPL complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), it is apparent that only one region in LPL responds to the presence of the acidic domain GPIHBP1<sup>1–33</sup>, and that is located at the interface between the CTD and the catalytic domain (represented by the peptide spanning residues 279–290) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The involvement of this 'interdomain interface' of LPL in binding GPIHBP1<sup>1–33</sup> was bolstered by zero-length cross–linking studies. The interaction between LPL Lys<sup>298</sup> (in close spatial proximity to peptide 279–290) and GPIHBP1’s acidic domain was covalently trapped by EDC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The fact that the acidic domain interacts with the domain interface of LPL in the setting of a mature GPIHBP1•LPL complex likely carries functional implications. Indeed, the stabilization of the catalytic domain of LPL by GPIHBP1<sup>1–131</sup> was primarily mediated by GPIHBP1<sup>1–33</sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). We suspect that the stabilization of LPL’s 'interdomain interface' by GPIHBP1’s acidic domain serves to limit protein dissociation/unfolding of the partner monomers of an LPL homodimer. Genetic evidence provides circumstantial support for the importance of a properly assembled interdomain interface for LPL activity. Certain homozygous missense mutations that are associated with reduced LPL activity and chylomicronemia [LPL<sup>E410V</sup>, LPL<sup>G409R</sup>, and LPL<sup>S259R</sup> in humans; LPL<sup>G412R</sup> in cats) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Foubert et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ginzinger et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kassner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Previato et al., 1994</xref>)] are located at the interdomain interface in close spatial proximity to the proposed binding site in LPL<sup>279–290</sup> for GPIHBP1<sup>1–33</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). All mutations alter the electrostatics of the interface. In future studies, it will also be very interesting to investigate if the accelerated inactivation of LPL by ANGPTL4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sukonina et al., 2006</xref>) involves this interdomain region and the extent to which GPIHBP1 protects LPL from ANGTPL4-mediated inactivation.</p><p>From a practical point of view, our discovery that the acidic domain stabilizes the conformation of LPL by mitigating unfolding could prove to be helpful in future efforts to define the structure of LPL by X-ray crystallography. We suspect that incubating LPL with peptides derived from GPIHBP1’s acidic domain could promote stabilization of LPL, increase its conformational homogeneity, and enhance the likelihood of growing well-diffracting crystals for X-ray structure determination.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Purified proteins and reagents</title><p>Bovine LPL was purified from fresh bovine milk by heparin-Sepharose, hydroxyapatite, and Superdex HR200 size-exclusion chromatography as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng et al., 1985</xref>).

Desalting was performed by applying a flow of 300 µL/min buffer A (0.23% [v/v] formic acid [FA]) to an ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 1.7-μm, 2.1 × 5 mm Vanguard Pre-Column by an Agilent 1260 Infinity Quaternary pump (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Peptides were separated on a 1.0 × 100 mm ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 1.7-μm analytical column by a 12-min gradient from 95% buffer A to 50% buffer B (0.23% [v/v] FA in acetonitrile) at a flow of 40 µl/min. Proteins were digested online with an Upchurch guard column (1.0 × 20 mm, IDEX, Oak Harbor, WA) packed with agarose-immobilized pepsin (Thermo Scientific Pierce, Rockford, IL). Peptides from peptic digests were identified from DDA MS/MS runs using ProteinLynx Global Server v2.4 (Waters) and MassAI v1.07 (MassAI Bioinformatics, Stenstrup, DK, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.massai.dk">http://www.massai.dk</ext-link>). Deuterium incorporation for intact proteins and peptides was quantified with DynamX V2.0 (Waters).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Homology modeling and disorder prediction for GPIHBP1</title><p>Human GPIHBP1 (UniProt id: Q8VI16) without the N- and C-terminal signal sequences was used for a homology search with the program HHPred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Soding, 2005</xref>). To find suitable reference structures, the PDB database was used to generate a multiple sequence alignment with human GPIHBP1; the top five highest-ranking proteins (PDB entries: 20l3, 2h7z, 2h5f, 3neq, 1hcp) were selected as templates for homology modeling with MODELLER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sali et al., 1995</xref>).

The cross-linking reaction was terminated by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer; samples were subsequently reduced and alkylated before analysis by SDS-PAGE to assess the formation of covalent complexes.

Gel pieces were cut into smaller pieces, washed twice in 50% ethanol (v/v) and shrunk with 96% (v/v) ethanol. The shrunken gel pieces were then swollen in a 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) 0.1 M NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> solution and incubated for 45 min at 56°C. After reduction, the solution was cooled to room temperature. The excess DTT solution was removed and replaced with a 55 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) 0.1 M NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> solution followed by incubation for 30 min in the dark at room temperature. Excess IAA solution was removed; the gel pieces were washed twice in 50% ethanol (v/v) and the gel pieces were shrunken again using 96% (v/v) ethanol. Finally, the gel pieces were rehydrated on ice with a 100 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> solution containing 12.5 ng/µl trypsin. After 45 min, excess trypsin solution was removed and replaced with 100 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>, and the gel pieces were then incubated at 37°C overnight. The supernatant containing tryptic peptides was recovered the next day. Remaining peptides in the gel were extracted by adding 5% (v/v) formic acid, incubating for 15 min, and then adding an equal volume of acetonitrile and incubating for an additional 15 min. This supernatant was combined with the original supernatant and the entire pool dried in a vacuum centrifuge. Prior to analysis, the tryptic digest was resuspended in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and desalted using solid-phase extraction in a pipet tip packed with Oligo R3 reversed phase resin (Applied Biosystems). The column was subsequently washed with 0.1% (v/v) TFA; the bound sample was eluted with 0.1% (v/v) TFA in 70% (v/v) acetonitrile and then dried in a vacuum centrifuge.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Reversed-phase nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS</title><p>The samples were resuspended in 0.1% (v/v) FA and loaded onto an EASY-nLC system (Thermo Scientific) with a two-column setup.

The peptides were eluted with an organic solvent gradient from 95% phase A (0.1% [v/v] FA) to 25% phase B (0.1% [v/v] FA, 95% [v/v] acetonitrile) over 80 min, followed by a 10-min gradient to 50% phase B at a flow rate of 250 nl/min. The eluted peptides were analyzed with a Q-Exactive HF mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific), operated in the positive ionization mode with data-dependent acquisition. Each MS scan was acquired at a resolution of 60,000 FWHM followed by 20 high-resolution HCD-MS/MS scans of the most intense ions.

Searches against a database containing bovine LPL and GPIHBP1 R38G were performed with the following parameters: Precursor mass tolerance 10 ppm, MS/MS mass tolerance of 0.05 Da, tryptic cleavage allowing up to two missed cleavage sites, and carbamido-methylation of cysteine as a fixed modification. The following variable modifications were allowed: oxidation of Met; phosphorylation of Ser, Thr, and Tyr; and N-glycosylation of Asn-X-Ser/Thr/Cys. Peptide cross-links between Lys and Asp/Glu, with a resulting loss of water, were allowed. Cross-links were considered to be true if they had a score above 20 and the MS/MS spectra either contained fragment ion series originating from both peptides or contained peaks that represented cross-linked fragment ions.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The coordinates for the model of human LPL were provided by Dr. Z.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Harry Dietz (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>Tobias Walter (peer reviewer) has agreed to reveal his identity; the other two reviewers remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript from Ploug et al. investigates structural properties and interactions of purified GPIHBP1 and LPL using hydrogen-deuterium exchange, surface plasmon resonance, zero length crosslinking and enzyme activity assays. The authors use results of these studies in conjunction with homology modeling to propose a two-domain model for GPIHBP1 and its interaction with LPL. The model is further informed by studies of mutant proteins associated with hyperchylomicronemia. The authors propose that GPIHBP1 is comprised of a disordered acidic N terminal domain connected to a prototypical LU domain that mediates glycolipid anchoring to the plasma membrane. Both domains of GPIHBP1 are found to influence interactions with LPL, with the N-terminal interaction domain suggested to stabilize the catalytic domain of LPL and reduce loss of enzymatic activity upon warming to 20 degrees C. The authors interpret their findings with respect to the requirement of GPIHBP1 to move LPL from its site of secretion to the capillary lumen where it carries out lipolysis of triglyceride rich lipoproteins.</p><p>All three reviewers found the manuscript to be an important contribution to the understanding of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein metabolism. One reviewer commented, 'The investigation is a tour-de-force in uncovering the structural aspects of the interaction of GPIHBP1 with lipoprotein lipase.' A second reviewer commented, 'Besides highlighting the physiological role of this protein pair, this study is interesting for revealing a biochemical mechanism that coulFn1d be used to regulate lipases'.</p><p>While the overall impression was that the studies were performed at a high level of rigor and that the conclusions appear solid, two concerns were raised that would need to be satisfactorily addressed for acceptance.</p><p>1) Kinetics of the GPIHBP1-LPL interaction rely exclusively on SPR measurements; these measurements can be affected by the surface binding of ligands and the specific orientation of the protein. Thus, it would be important to independently assay binding constants in a solution assay. For steady state measurements, ITC could work; otherwise, the new knowledge of binding sites could be used for FRET measurements etc.</p><p>2) This is somewhat less important, but much of the paper relies on the analysis of a GPIHBP1 mutant. The authors point out that there are organisms where the mutated residue is found in the wild type protein, arguing this residue change is neutral. However, there are other changes in the homologue protein and it remains formally possible (although unlikely) that the mutant version of the protein does not behave the same way as the wild type. Maybe there is enough of the wt protein that can be expressed for competition experiments (with the mutant)? Alternatively can the authors show expressing the wt and mutant protein in CHO cells (as done before) that both alleles encode proteins with similar binding affinities. For instance, one could mix cells with WT and mutant GPIHBP (labeled with a fluorophore), incubate with LPL and assess binding in the same reaction.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12095.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Kinetics of the GPIHBP1-LPL interaction rely exclusively on SPR measurements; these measurements can be affected by the surface binding of ligands and the specific orientation of the protein.

For steady state measurements, ITC could work; otherwise, the new knowledge of binding sites could be used for FRET measurements etc.</italic> </p><p>We agree that recording high-content, real-time binding kinetics with surface plasmon resonance is a challenging task, particularly if one of the binding partners is a hydrophobic, unstable, heparin-binding protein such as LPL. For this reason, we spent considerable time and effort (before performing any measurements) to optimize the SPR assay conditions so as to avoid confounding effects from the SPR matrix. Nevertheless, we agree with the reviewers that an additional approach involving equilibrium binding kinetics would be useful to validate/substantiate our SPR data. One technology that we previously considered for such studies was microscale thermophoresis (MST). MST is a solution-based micro-method that allows a high degree of freedom in choosing the optimal buffer conditions. In new experiments, we labeled GPIHBP1 with 1.3 Alexa-647 fluorophores per GPIHBP1 molecule. We used a neutral pH during labeling chemistry to favor the modification of the α-amino group of the N-terminal acidic domain, and we made sure that the labeled protein remained monomeric. Using the MST approach, we measured a K<sub>D</sub> of 5.7 nM for GPIHBP<sup>1–131/R38G</sup> and 147 nM for GPIHBP1<sup>34–131/R38G</sup> for equilibrium LPL–GPIHBP1 binding. These data are entirely consistent with the findings and the conclusions drawn from the SPR analyses—although the absolute values differ slightly. In the revised manuscript, we have described the new data in the Results section (subsection “Kinetic rate constants for the interaction between GPIHBP1 and LPL”, last paragraph), added a new Figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), and expanded the Methods section accordingly (subsection “Equilibrium binding constants of the GPIHBP1•LPL interaction by microscale thermophoresis”).</p><p><italic>2) This is somewhat less important, but much of the paper relies on the analysis of a GPIHBP1 mutant. The authors point out that there are organisms where the mutated residue is found in the wild type protein, arguing this residue change is neutral.

For instance, one could mix cells with WT and mutant GPIHBP (labeled with a fluorophore), incubate with LPL and assess binding in the same reaction.</italic> </p><p>We agree that introducing a mutation to obtain a better yield of full-length GPIHBP1 could represent a possible confounding factor (even though homology considerations suggested that the risk was low). We have therefore produced the D3-ent-GPIHBP1 with the wild-type sequence and liberated GPIHBP1 with very low amounts of enterokinase (0.05 U/mg). The full-length wild-type GPIHBP<sup>1–131</sup> was then purified by cation-exchange chromatography and used for SPR studies of GPIHBP1 binding to full-length LPL and LPL’s carboxyl-terminal domain. These new data recapitulate those recorded for the R38G mutant; thus, the R38G substitution has no significant impact on GPIHBP1–LPL binding kinetics. The new data have been added to <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and are discussed in the Results section (subsection “Kinetic rate constants for the interaction between GPIHBP1 and LPL”, third paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
