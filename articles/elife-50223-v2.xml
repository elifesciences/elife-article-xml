tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, the responses are not durable, and the magnitude of tumor regression is variable, suggesting the existence of genetic modifiers of EGFR dependency. Here, we applied a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening to identify genetic determinants of EGFR TKI sensitivity and uncovered putative candidates. We show that knockout of <italic>RIC8A</italic>, essential for G-alpha protein activation, enhanced EGFR TKI-induced cell death. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that RIC8A is a positive regulator of YAP signaling, activation of which rescued the EGFR TKI sensitizing phenotype resulting from <italic>RIC8A</italic> knockout. We also show that knockout of <italic>ARIH2</italic>, or other components in the Cullin-5 E3 complex, conferred resistance to EGFR inhibition, in part by promoting nascent protein synthesis through METAP2. Together, these data uncover a spectrum of previously unidentified regulators of EGFR TKI sensitivity in EGFR-mutant human NSCLC, providing insights into the heterogeneity of EGFR TKI treatment responses.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cancer is caused by cells growing and dividing uncontrollably as a result of mutations in certain genes. Many human lung cancers have a mutation in the gene that makes the protein EGFR. In healthy cells, EGFR allows a cell to respond to chemical signals that encourage healthy growth. In cancer, the altered EGFR is always on, which allows the cell to rapidly grow without any control, resulting in cancer.</p><p>One approach to treating these cancers is with drugs that block the activity of mutant EGFR. Although these drugs have been very successful, they do not always succeed in completely treating the cancer. This is because over time the cancer cells can become resistant to the drug and start forming new tumors. One way that this can happen is if random mutations lead to changes in other proteins that make the drug less effective or stop it from accessing the EGFR proteins. However, it is unclear how other proteins in cancer cells affect the response to these EGFR inhibiting drugs.</p><p>Now, Zeng et al. have used gene editing to systematically remove every protein from human lung cancer cells grown in the laboratory to see how this affects resistance to EGFR inhibitor treatment. This revealed that a number of different proteins could change how cancer cells responded to the drug. For instance, cells lacking the protein RIC8A were more sensitive to EGFR inhibitors and less likely to develop resistance. This is because loss of RIC8A turns down a key cell survival pathway in cancer cells. Whereas, cancer cells lacking the ARIH2 protein were able to produce more proteins that are needed for cancer cell growth, which resulted in them having increased resistance to EGFR inhibitors.</p><p>The proteins identified in this study could be used to develop new drugs that improve the effectiveness of EGFR inhibitors. Understanding how cancer cells respond to EGFR inhibitor treatment could help determine how likely a patient is to develop resistance to these drugs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CRISPR screen</kwd><kwd>EGFR TKI resistance</kwd><kwd>GPCR signaling</kwd><kwd>RIC8A</kwd><kwd>YAP signaling</kwd><kwd>ARIH2-CUL5 complex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Functional genomic screening reveals new synthetic lethality with and modes of resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeted therapy in EGFR-mutant human lung cancer.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) being the most common subtype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bray et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Herbst et al., 2018</xref>). Activating mutations in the kinase domain of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are present in about 10% to 40% of NSCLC patients, most frequently in-frame deletions in exon 19 (ex19 del) and a missense arginine-to-leucine mutation at codon 858 (L858R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sharma et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pao and Chmielecki, 2010</xref>). The approval and use of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as erlotinib and gefitinib, have provided therapeutic breakthrough and achieved clinical success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kobayashi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rosell et al., 2012</xref>). However, the responses of EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients to EGFR TKIs are rarely complete with variable duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kobayashi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rosell et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that other factors could modulate the dependency of mutant EGFR and thus influencing EGFR TKI efficacy. Moreover, acquired resistance inevitably develops, leading to disease progression in almost all patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pao and Chmielecki, 2010</xref>).</p><p>A growing number of studies have been focusing on the understanding of mechanisms underlying EGFR TKI resistance, involving a variety of genetic and non-genetic alterations in signaling pathways and cell state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sequist et al., 2011</xref>). Secondary EGFR on-target mutations, most frequently T790M mutation, account for about half of relapsed tumours with acquired resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kobayashi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sequist et al., 2011</xref>). Resistance can also result from reactivation of key downstream signaling pathways originally inhibited by EGFR TKIs, such as PI3K-AKT and RAS-MEK-ERK pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chong and Jänne, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Niederst and Engelman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Camidge et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rotow and Bivona, 2017</xref>). For instance, resistance has been associated with amplification or activation of MET, HER2, FGFR and AXL, as well as PIK3CA mutation or loss of PTEN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Engelman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Engelman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sos et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Takezawa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ware et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, activation of NF-kB and YAP signaling pathways also confers resistance to EGFR TKIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bivona et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hsu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chaib et al., 2017</xref>). Non-genetic alterations, such as histological transformation from NSCLC to small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), have also been reported in relapsed tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sequist et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, accumulating evidence has suggested that small subpopulations of cancer cells can evade lethal drug treatment by entering a drug tolerant ‘persister’ (DTP) state and serve as a founder for acquiring heterogeneous drug-resistance mechanisms upon long-term drug treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sharma et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ramirez et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, the mechanisms of EGFR TKI resistance elucidated to date can encompass multiple mechanisms simultaneously in one patient or even tumour, creating significant obstacles for designing better treatment strategies for patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pao and Chmielecki, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chong and Jänne, 2013</xref>). Moreover, a number of EGFR TKI-resistant tumours lack known resistance mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sequist et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting the existence of previously unrecognized mediators of EGFR TKI efficacy.</p><p>In order to better understand the incomplete response of EGFR-mutant NSCLC to EGFR TKI as well as identify prospective mechanisms of resistance, we conducted a genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 genetic screen in a human NSCLC cell line harbouring activating EGFR mutation. By generating EGFR TKI resistance, we identified a number of genes, when deleted, enhanced or reduced EGFR TKI sensitivity and consequently prevented or accelerated development of EGFR TKI resistance, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening reveals genetic modifiers of EGFR TKI sensitivity in EGFR-mutant NSCLC</title><p>HCC827, a very commonly used EGFR-mutant NSCLC cell line, harbors ex19 del in EGFR and is highly sensitive to EGFR TKI treatment. Generation of a dose-response curve upon 3 days’ erlotinib exposure yielded the IC<sub>50 </sub>25.6 ± 3.6 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, even with high dose of erlotinib (1 µM and above), about 30% of the cells could still survive this initial pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Examination of the cell proliferation in the presence of DMSO control or 1 µM erlotinib over a 30 day period using IncuCyte demonstrated that HCC827 cells were still able to proliferate at a low rate when exposed to high dose of erlotinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Additionally, colony formation assay also confirmed the existence of a small fraction of viable cells after 9 days’ erlotinib treatment, referred to as ‘drug tolerant persister’ (DTP) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Thereafter, the DTP cells commenced cell proliferation in the presence of erlotinib, yielding colonies of cells referred to as ‘drug tolerant expanded persister’ (DTEP) cells or drug resistant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These data suggested that EGFR inhibition in the cultured cells mimics clinical observations of the incomplete response and/or innate resistance to EGFR TKI treatment, allowing the assay window to screen for mediators of EGFR TKI sensitivity. We aimed to systematically identify genetic modifiers that regulate the response of EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells to EGFR TKI treatment by applying a genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screening approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We introduced a pooled lentiviral single guide RNA (sgRNA) library targeting 18,360 genes (five sgRNAs per gene) into HCC827 cells with constitutive Cas9 expression (HCC827-Cas9) and treated these cells with DMSO or erlotinib. We intentionally applied high dose of erlotinib (1 µM) to allow the survival of a small subpopulation of DTP cells and development of drug resistance in the long-term. This strategy ensured that genes whose deletion synergize with or confer resistance to erlotinib could be negatively or positively selected from the screen, respectively, following erlotinib treatment compared to DMSO treatment. Three weeks post-treatment, cells were harvested and subjected to next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify differential sgRNA representation between DMSO and erlotinib treated populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Differential sgRNA representation was evaluated in the form of log2 fold change between the erlotinib- and DMSO-treated samples. A robust z score was calculated using the median and mean-absolute deviation for the calculated fold changes across the entire sgRNA library. To provide a qualitative assessment of the screen performance, we plotted the <italic>P</italic> values calculated by the redundant small interfering RNA (siRNA) activity (RSA) test, representing the probability of a gene hit based on the collective activities of multiple sgRNAs per gene, against Q1- and Q3-based z scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening identifies determinants of EGFR-TKI sensitivity in EGFR-mutant NSCLC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cell viability assessment by CellTiter-Glo assay of HCC827 cells treated with serial dilutions of erlotinib for 72 hr.

Indeed, across a panel of EGFR-mutant NSCLC cell lines, loss of <italic>RIC8A</italic> resulted in an increase in YAP phosphorylation at Ser127 site, an indicator of YAP inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In line with this finding, loss of <italic>RIC8A</italic> significantly suppressed the expression of YAP target genes in all tested cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Together, these data demonstrate that RIC8A positively regulates YAP signaling in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells. Moreover, overexpression of YAP-5SA in representative HCC827 cell line blocked the effect of <italic>RIC8A</italic> loss on YAP signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>). Importantly, YAP activation itself conferred resistance to EGFR inhibition and blocked <italic>RIC8A</italic> loss-induced synthetic lethality with EGFR inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H–4J</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that loss of <italic>RIC8A</italic> synergizes with EGFR inhibition by attenuating YAP signaling in lung cancer.</p><p>To dive deeper into the connection between RIC8A and YAP signaling, we speculated that RIC8A positively regulates YAP signaling via Gα-Rho/Rac axis. We first tested whether RHOA inhibition could confer synthetic lethality with EGFR inhibition. Indeed, loss of <italic>RHOA</italic> increased YAP phosphorylation at Ser127 site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>), decreased YAP-target gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>), and induced synthetic lethality with EGFR inhibition in HCC827 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Then we examined whether RHOA activity is reduced by <italic>RIC8A</italic> loss. Unfortunately, after many attempts, we observed little decrease in the active RHOA signal upon <italic>RIC8A</italic> loss using a RHOA G-LISA Activation Assay Kit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D–E</xref>). However, this could be due to the fast dynamics of RHOA activation-inactivation cycle, making it difficult to capture the real-time changes in RHOA activity upon <italic>RIC8A</italic> loss. In addition, <italic>ARHGAP29</italic>, encoding a Rho GTPase activating protein, was previously reported to be a YAP target gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Qiao et al., 2017</xref>). We observed that <italic>RIC8A</italic> loss caused significant decrease in the expression of <italic>ARHGAP29</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2F</xref>), which could provide a negative-feedback mechanism to alleviate the decrease of RHOA activity resulting from <italic>RIC8A</italic> loss. Therefore, we believe our inability of detecting RHOA activity changes is most likely due to both technical reasons and the negative-feedback mechanism. Consistently, we observed a morphological alteration in HCC827 cells upon <italic>RIC8A</italic> loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2G</xref>) and the decrease of Cofilin phosphorylation that is downstream of the RHOA-ROCK signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2H</xref>), indicating that loss of <italic>RIC8A</italic> indeed negatively impacted the output from RHOA activation. Moreover, treatment with Y-27632, the inhibitor of Rho-associated kinase ROCK, also induced synthetic lethality with EGFR inhibition in HCC827 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2I–J</xref>). Taken together, these data suggested the RIC8A-Gα-RHOA-YAP signaling axis is involved in the regulation of EGFR TKI sensitivity in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells. Admittedly, RIC8A might regulate YAP signaling through other effectors, and comprehensive understanding of the signaling between RIC8A and YAP warrants future characterizations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title><italic>ARIH2</italic> loss confers resistance to EGFR TKI in vitro and in vivo</title><p>To further validate the possible role of ARIH2 in EGFR TKI resistance, we introduced into HCC827 cells two independent sgRNAs targeting <italic>ARIH2</italic> and confirmed the <italic>ARIH2</italic> knockout efficiency by western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

We first focused on METAP2, the abundance of which increased most upon <italic>ARIH2</italic> loss, and ectopically overexpressed a hemagglutinin (HA) tagged METAP2 (HA-METAP2) in HCC827 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). A long-term colony formation assay of the vector- and HA-METAP2-expressing HCC827 cells demonstrated that METAP2 overexpression confers resistance to EGFR inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–F</xref>). Given its role in regulating global protein synthesis, we sought to assess de novo protein synthesis in both vector- and METAP2-overexpressing cells by L-azido-homoalanine (AHA) labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). EGFR inhibition by erlotinib treatment drastically inhibited nascent protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>), in line with its effect on overall growth inhibition. Importantly, cells with METAP2 overexpression exhibited increased protein synthesis, compared to vehicle-expressing cells, when challenged by erlotinib treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Furthermore, loss of <italic>ARIH2</italic>, which is able to increase METAP2 protein level, also increased nascent protein synthesis upon EGFR inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Together, these data suggest that <italic>ARIH2</italic> loss confers resistance to EGFR inhibition, at least in part, by maintaining higher protein synthesis rate through METAP2.</p><p>Next, we investigated how ARIH2 regulates METAP2 protein level. EGFR inhibition did not alter METAP2 protein level in both control and <italic>ARIH2</italic>-deficient HCC827 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>), ruling out the possibility that METAP2 is a downstream effector of EGFR which could be regulated by ARIH2. Proteasome inhibitor (Bortezomib) treatment increased METAP2 protein abundance in HCC827 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>), suggesting that METAP2 protein level is regulated by the proteasome-dependent degradation pathway. Moreover, bortezomib induced METAP2 protein level increase was only observed in control cells but not in <italic>ARIH2</italic>-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>), indicating that proteasome-mediated METAP2 protein degradation is dependent on ARIH2. We further attempted to examine METAP2 ubiquitination in HCC827 cells. Unfortunately, we were unable to detect endogenous METAP2 protein ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G</xref>), likely due to that the METAP2 ubiquitination level is too low to be detected or ARIH2 regulates METAP2 degradation indirectly. Next, we also wondered whether ARIH2 regulates METAP2 protein translation/synthesis. Specifically, we assessed de novo METAP2 protein synthesis in control or <italic>ARIH2</italic>-deficient HCC827 cells by AHA labeling followed by streptavidin pulldown and showed that loss of <italic>ARIH2</italic> increased nascent METAP2 protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>), suggesting that ARIH2 indeed regulates METAP2 protein translation. As a control, EGFR protein synthesis remained unchanged upon <italic>ARIH2</italic> loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>). Taken together, these data demonstrate that ARIH2 is capable of regulating both protein translation and protein degradation of METAP2. Future studies are required to gain a comprehensive picture of the regulation of METAP2 protein level by ARIH2.</p><p>Lastly, we ectopically overexpressed HA-ALDOA or HA-PSAT1 in HCC827 cells as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L</xref>). Long-term colony formation assays showed that overexpression of ALDOA or PSAT1 is capable to promote resistance to EGFR inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6M–N</xref>). Thus, we concluded that loss of ARIH2 confers resistance to EGFR inhibition in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells by integrating multiple mechanisms.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Understanding and overcoming resistance to EGFR TKIs remain a major challenge in NSCLC. Several studies have previously employed loss- or gain-of-function screens to profile genetic interactions with mutant EGFR in NSCLC cells to look for synthetic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bivona et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Bruin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sharifnia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lantermann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liao et al., 2017</xref>). However, they utilized either small interfering RNA (siRNA) or short hairpin RNA (shRNA) approach or focused on small subsets of genes (such as tumor suppressors, oncogenes and genes encoding kinases), and identified distinct genetic modifiers of EGFR TKI sensitivity. Herein in this study, we presented an unbiased genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screening strategy to systematically capture the breadth of genetic modifiers of mutant EGFR dependency in NSCLC. We purposely selected HCC827, a cell line with high sensitivity to EGFR TKI, and generated resistance by applying clinically relevant concentration of erlotinib for a sustained period, allowing the identification of both negative and positive regulators of EGFR TKI sensitivity simultaneously. Our genome-wide CRISPR screen successfully revealed a number of known causative genes and signaling pathways associated with EGFR TKI resistance, such as YAP signaling, PI3K-mTOR signaling and RAS-MAPK signaling pathways, reinforcing their significance in mediating mutant EGFR dependency in NSCLC. More importantly, we uncovered a list of previously unrecognized genes whose deletion caused synthetic lethality with or conferred resistance to EGFR TKI treatment, broadening our understanding of EGFR signaling regulation. Importantly, we determined the copy number of these genes by searching the database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cansar.icr.ac.uk/cansar/cell-lines/HCC-827/copy_number_variation/no%20signal/">https://cansar.icr.ac.uk/cansar/cell-lines/HCC-827/copy_number_variation/no%20signal/</ext-link>) and did not find gain of copy numbers for any of the genes studied herein, ruling out the false positive possibility of artifacts from targeting genes in amplicons.</p><p>Among those newly identified mutant EGFR dependencies, GPCR/G-protein signaling module stood out as a strong vulnerability with EGFR inhibition. Particularly, genetic ablation as well as pharmacological antagonism of the LPARs strongly sensitized EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells to EGFR inhibition. Interestingly, LPAR signaling has been shown to contribute to malignancy and chemotherapy resistance in various tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hashimoto et al., 2016</xref>). Molecularly, GPCRs initiate downstream signaling cascades through activating heterotrimeric G proteins consisting of Gα subunit (G12/13, Gq/11, Gi/o, or Gs) and Gβγ heterodimer in concert with other effector proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dorsam and Gutkind, 2007</xref>). Importantly, inactivation of GPCR related effectors, such as RIC8A, PKN2, GNB2 (encoding Gβ2 subunit) or GNA13 (encoding Gα13 subunit), strongly synergized with EGFR inhibition in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells, revealed by our CRISPR screen. Furthermore, loss of <italic>KCTD5</italic>, a previously reported negative regulator of Gβ protein stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brockmann et al., 2017</xref>), promoted resistance to EGFR inhibition. Together, these findings suggest that EGFR-mutant NSCLC depends on parallel GPCR signaling to modulate mutant EGFR addiction. <italic>RIC8A</italic>, the most prominent synergy hit from our screen, possesses dual functions as a molecular chaperone required for nascent Gαq/i/13 protein folding and initial membrane association as well as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Gαq/i/13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nishimura et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gabay et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kant et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, LPAR signaling coupled with G12/13 has been shown to activate YAP pathway in HEK293A cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, majority of human uveal melanomas, driven by activating mutations in Gαq/11 proteins, depend on YAP signaling for tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yu et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>Ric-8A</italic> gene deletion significantly suppressed tumorigenesis in a mouse model of oncogenic Gαq-driven melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Patel and Tall, 2016</xref>), implying its regulation of YAP signaling pathway. Here, we extended the regulation of YAP pathway by GPCR and G proteins to RIC8A, and demonstrated, for the first time, that RIC8A positively regulates YAP signaling to modulate EGFR TKI sensitivity in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells. Therefore, targeting RIC8A might be promising to prevent EGFR TKI resistance in lung cancer. YAP signaling pathway has also been shown to mediate resistance to other targeted therapies, such as RAF and MEK inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lin et al., 2015</xref>). Whether targeting RIC8A could inhibit YAP signaling and consequently enhance treatment response in those circumstances is of great interest and awaits future investigation.</p><p>On the other hand, reduced NF1 (neurofibromin) expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Bruin et al., 2014</xref>) or loss of PTEN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sos et al., 2009</xref>) has been observed in clinical specimens with acquired resistance to EGFR TKI treatment. Both of them strongly scored as resistance hits in our CRISPR screen. Among other positively selected hits, <italic>ARIH2</italic>, <italic>CUL5</italic>, <italic>RNF7</italic> and <italic>UBE2F</italic>, falling into an ubiquitination related functional module, significantly stood out. Cullin-RING ligases (CRLs), comprising the largest subfamily of E3 ubiquitin ligases, are activated by ligation of the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 to a conserved cullin lysine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lamsoul et al., 2016</xref>). The NEDD8-conjugating enzyme UBE2F, via specific interaction with E3 ligase RNF7 (also known as RBX2), specifically neddylates and consequently activates cullin-5 (CUL5), but not other cullin proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2009</xref>). ARIH2 (also known as TRIAD1), a member of the RING-in-between-RING (RBR) E3 ubiquitin ligase family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dove and Klevit, 2017</xref>), binds to and is activated specifically by activated CRL5 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kelsall et al., 2013</xref>). ARIH2 is essential for embryogenesis and has been shown to modulate inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kawashima et al., 2017</xref>). The association of CRL5 complex with cancer biology has started to emerge. For instance, <italic>CUL5</italic> deficiency has been shown to promote SCLC metastasis by stabilizing integrin β1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, CRL5 complex also plays important roles in modulating multiple aspects of the cellular response to heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Samant et al., 2014</xref>). Here, for the first time, we emphasized the importance of ARIH2-CRL5 complex in mediating EGFR TKI resistance in NSCLC. Through a proteomics study, we identified METAP2 (methionine aminopeptidase 2), a protein that has been shown to be involved in NSCLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shimizu et al., 2016</xref>), the abundance of which was dramatically increased upon <italic>ARIH2</italic> loss. We further demonstrated that increased METAP2 level was, at least in part, responsible for the drug resistance phenotype resulting from <italic>ARIH2</italic> loss. However, identification of direct substrates of ARIH2-CRL5 complex as well as elucidating their involvement in EGFR TKI resistance remains to be studied more systematically in the future.</p><p>In summary, while clinical studies are necessary to confirm these newly revealed dependencies of mutant EGFR in NSCLC, our genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 genetic screen together with validation and mechanistic studies expanded the understanding of the heterogeneity of EGFR TKI responses in lung cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Human cancer cell lines were originated from the CCLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barretina et al., 2012</xref>), banked at Novartis Cell Bank, authenticated by single-nucleotide polymorphism analysis and routinely tested as mycoplasma-free.

Illumina sequencing libraries were generated using PCR amplification with primers specific to the genome integrated lentiviral vector backbone sequence. The resulting Illumina libraries were purified using 1.8x SPRI AMPure XL beads (Beckman Coulter) following the manufacturer’s instructions and qPCR quantified using primers specific to the Illumina sequences using standard methods.

The R software package DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Love et al., 2014</xref>) was used to evaluate differential sgRNA representation in the form of log2 fold change between the erlotinib-treated and DMSO-treated samples for EGFR-TKI screen. A robust z-score was calculated using the median and mean-absolute deviation for the calculated fold changes across the entire sgRNA library. For gene-based hit calling, the sgRNAs were ranked by the robust z-score, and the statistical significances for each gene enriched toward higher rank (RSA up) and the lower rank (RSA down) were evaluated using the Redundant siRNA Activity (RSA) algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">König et al., 2007</xref>). The RSA score is a statistical score (log10 (<italic>P</italic> value)) representing the probability of a gene hit based on the collective activities of multiple sgRNAs per gene. It is a measure of how significantly the rank order of sgRNAs against a given gene differs from the population of other sgRNAs in the library. Selected hits were searched against STRING database version 11.0 for mapping protein interaction network and Reactome database version 67 for pathway analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Short-term cell proliferation assay</title><p>Cells were seeded in 384-well microplates (Corning #3570) at a density of 1,000 cells in 30 µl of complete cell culture medium per well and allowed to adhere overnight.

To make the rationale of our screen design more understandable to the general readers of the paper, we added some HCC827 cell characterization data before introducing our CRISPR screen in our revised manuscript (new Figure 1A-C). HCC827, a very commonly used EGFR-mutant NSCLC cell line, harbors ex19 del in EGFR and is highly sensitive to EGFR-TKI treatment. We first validated its high sensitivity to erlotinib by generating a dose-response curve upon 3 days’ drug exposure, with the IC50 25.6 ± 3.6 nM (new Figure 1A). However, with the clinically-relevant concentration (1 µM) or even higher concentrations, there are still about 30% of the cells that could survive this initial pulse (new Figure 1A). We further monitored the cell proliferation in the presence of DMSO control or 1 µM erlotinib in a 6-well tissue culture plate over a 30-day period using the IncuCyte instrument, and showed that the HCC827 cells were still able to proliferate at a low rate when exposed to high dose of erlotinib (new Figure 1B). Additionally, colony formation assay also confirmed the existence of a small fraction of viable cells after 9 days’ 1 µM erlotinib treatment, referred to as “drug-tolerant persister” (DTP) cells (new Figure 1C). Thereafter, the drug-tolerant cells commenced cell proliferation in the presence of drug, yielding colonies of cells referred to as “drug-tolerant expanded persister” (DTEP) cells or drug resistant cells (new Figure 1C). These data suggested that EGFR inhibition in the cultured cells mimics clinical observations of the incomplete response and/or innate resistance to EGFR-TKI treatment, allowing the assay window to screen for mediators of EGFR-TKI sensitivity that can either prevent or promote the development of drug resistance. Therefore we believe it is the beauty of the screen design with high dose of erlotinib, rather than being a bottleneck.</p><p>Regarding the library diversity and sgRNA representation, we have now performed additional data analysis to show more details of the screen results (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-C). Since we did not collect samples after a short erlotinib exposure (referred to as “initial pulse” by the reviewers), we analyzed data from the original library pool and the endpoint of the screen. As expected, deep sequencing 21 days after DMSO treatment revealed a significant reduction (left shift of the curve) in the diversity of sgRNAs (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1A), due to the depletion of sgRNAs targeting essential genes. Erlotinib treatment further resulted in the left shift of the curve (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1A), due to the depletion of sgRNAs targeting the synthetic lethal genes. After 21 days of erlotinib treatment, the sgRNA distribution was significantly different when compared with DMSO-treated cells (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1B-C), enabling the identification of sgRNAs targeting genes that regulate EGFR-TKI sensitivity, such as RIC8A and ARIH2 (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The reviewers would like to see rescue experiments for the RIC8 and ARIH2 and for the follow-up experiments to include a second sgRNA. In addition, the authors should state whether they determined the copy number of these genes since they have previously reported on artefacts from targeting genes in amplicons.</p></disp-quote><p>To perform the rescue experiments, we generated constructs expressing HA tagged Cas9/sgRNA-resistant RIC8A (HA-RIC8A-mut) or ARIH2 (HA-ARIH2-mut) and then performed colony formation rescue experiments. As shown in new Figure 3—figure supplement 1B, overexpression of HA-RIC8A-mut rescued the effect from RIC8A KO in colony formation assay. Similarly, overexpression of HA-ARIH2-mut rescued the effect from ARIH2 KO in colony formation assay (new Figure 5—figure supplement 1). For the follow-up experiments involving RIC8A and ARIH2 knockout, we included two independent sgRNAs for all the new experiments that we performed (see below in this rebuttal letter). We also determined the copy number of these genes by searching the database (https://cansar.icr.ac.uk/cansar/cell-lines/HCC-827/copy_number_variation/no%20signal/) and did not find gain of copy numbers for any of the genes studied in the current manuscript. In particular, the copy number of RIC8A or ARIH2 in HCC827 cell line is 2. We included this statement in the Discussion section of our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) For the RIC8A experiments, further experiments are need to understand how the YAP1 pathway is regulated. Is this solely due to affecting phosphorylation and what kinases are involved. In general, the studies concerning mechanisms are less developed. For example, it would beneficial to show whether the RIC8A, ARIH2 and METAP2 are involved in regulating TKI sensitivity in EGFR wild type expressing NSCLC cell lines and normal cell lines should be examined.</p></disp-quote><p>RIC8A functions as a biosynthetic chaperone and guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for a subset of Gα proteins, which is important for Gα-coupled GPCR signaling activation. It has been well established that GPCR signaling coupled with Gα proteins activates YAP signaling which involves Rho/Rac-mediated cytoskeleton remodeling and regulation of the activity of kinases upstream of YAP, such as MST and LATS, resulting in the de-phosphorylation of YAP (Yu et al., 2012; Ma et al., 2019). Our study, for the first time, demonstrated that RIC8A mediates EGFR-TKI sensitivity by regulating the YAP signaling. To dive deeper into the connection between RIC8A and YAP signaling, we speculated that RIC8A positively regulates YAP signaling via signaling through Gα-Rho/Rac axis. We first tested whether RHOA inhibition could confer synthetic lethality with EGFR inhibition. As shown in the new Figure 4—figure supplement 2A-C, knockout of RHOA decreased YAP-target gene expression and induced synthetic lethality with EGFR inhibition in HCC827 cells. Then we examined whether RHOA activity is reduced by RIC8A KO. Unfortunately, after many attempts, we observed little decrease in the active RHOA signal upon RIC8A KO using a RhoA G-LISA Activation Assay Kit (Cytoskeleton Cat.# BK124) (new Figure 4—figure supplement 2D-E; panel D shows the western blots using whole cell lysate; panel E shows the active RHOA signal determined by the kit). However, this could be due to the fast dynamics of RHOA activation-inactivation cycle, making it difficult to capture the real-time changes in RHOA activity upon RIC8A KO. In addition, <italic>ARHGAP29</italic>, encoding a Rho GTPase activating protein, was previously reported to be a YAP target gene (Qiao et al., 2017). We observed that RIC8A KO caused significant decrease in the expression of <italic>ARHGAP29</italic> (new Figure 4—figure supplement 2F), which could provide a negative-feedback mechanism to alleviate the decrease of RHOA activity resulting from RIC8A KO. Therefore, we believe our inability of detecting RHOA activity changes is most likely due to both technical reasons and the negative-feedback mechanism. Detection of active small GTPase is notoriously difficult, and this is well known in the field. Consistently, we observed a morphological alteration in HCC827 cells upon RIC8A KO (new Figure 4—figure supplement 2G) and the decrease of Cofilin phosphorylation that is downstream of the RHOA-ROCK signaling (new Figure 4—figure supplement 2H), indicating that RIC8A KO negatively impacted the output from RHOA activation. Moreover, treatment of Y-27632, the inhibitor of Rho-associated kinase ROCK, also induced synthetic lethality with EGFR inhibition in HCC827 cells (new Figure 4—figure supplement 2I-J). Taken together, these data suggested the RIC8A-Gα-RHOA-YAP signaling axis as a mediator of EGFR-TKI sensitivity in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells. Admittedly, RIC8A might regulate YAP signaling through other effectors, and comprehensive understanding of the signaling between RIC8A and YAP warrants future characterizations, which is beyond the scope of the current study.</p><p>To assess whether RIC8A, ARIH2 and METAP2 are involved in regulating EGFR-TKI sensitivity in EGFR-WT NSCLC cell lines and normal cells, we selected three EGFR-WT NSCLC cell lines (A549, NCI-H1299 and NCI-H460) and one normal human bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B. These cell lines were engineered to stably express Cas9 protein for the purpose of CRISPR-Cas9 mediated gene editing. We knocked out RIC8A using two independent sgRNAs in all four cell lines, and examined the sensitivity of control and RIC8A KO cells to EGFR-TKIs (erlotinib and gefitinib) by generating the dose-response curves as well as performing the colony formation assays. As shown in the new Figure 3—figure supplement 2A-P, loss of RIC8A had no effect on the EGFR-TKI sensitivity in EGFR-WT NSCLC cell lines or normal cells. Similar experiments were also done for ARIH2 with the observation that loss of ARIH2 had no effect on the EGFR-TKI sensitivity in EGFR-WT NSCLC cell lines or normal cells, although ARIH2 KO led to the increase of METAP2 protein abundance (new Figure 5—figure supplement 3A-P).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) For the experiments involving ARIH2, whether ARIH2 inhibits METAP2 translation or regulating METAP2 degradation should be further investigated. Also iIs METAP2 a downstream effector of EGFR? The relative expression level of ARIH2, RIC8A and MERAP2 in EGFR wild type and mutant expressing NSCLC cell lines or tumors should be compared.</p></disp-quote><p>First, we tested whether ARIH2 regulates METAP2 degradation. We treated HCC827 cells with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and observed increase of METAP2 protein abundance (new Figure 6I), suggesting that METAP2 protein level is regulated by the proteasome-dependent degradation pathway. Moreover, bortezomib induced METAP2 protein level increase was only observed in control cells but not in ARIH2 KO cells (new Figure 6J), suggesting that proteasome-mediated METAP2 protein degradation is dependent on ARIH2. We further attempted to examine METAP2 ubiquitination in HCC827 cells. Unfortunately, we were not able to detect endogenous METAP2 protein ubiquitination even in the control cells (new Figure 6—figure supplement 1G), likely due to that the METAP2 ubiquitination level is too low to be detected or ARIH2 regulates METAP2 degradation indirectly.</p><p>Next, we tested whether ARIH2 regulates METAP2 protein translation. Specifically, we assessed de novo METAP2 protein synthesis in control or ARIH2 KO cells by L-azido-homoalanine (AHA) labeling followed by streptavidin pulldown. Consistent with our previous findings (Figure 6G-H), ARIH2 KO did not increase the global protein synthesis in the absence of EGFRi (new Figure 6K). However, we observed that knockout of ARIH2 increased METAP2 protein synthesis, suggesting that ARIH2 indeed regulates METAP2 protein translation. As a control, EGFR protein synthesis remained unchanged upon ARIH2 KO (new Figure 6K). Taken together, these new data demonstrated that ARIH2 is capable of regulating both protein translation and protein degradation of METAP2. Future studies are definitely required to gain a comprehensive picture of the regulation of METAP2 protein level by ARIH2.</p><p>To test whether METAP2 is a downstream effector of EGFR, we treated HCC827 cells with EGFRi erlotinib. As shown in new Figure 6—figure supplement 1E-F, erlotinib treatment did not alter the METAP2 protein level in both control and ARIH2 KO cells, indicating that the likelihood of METAP2 being a downstream effector of EGFR is low.</p><p>Lastly, as suggested by the reviewers, we examined the expression levels of RIC8A, ARIH2 and METAP2 in a panel of EGFR-mutant and EGFR-WT NSCLC cell lines (new Figure 6—figure supplement 1D). They are all ubiquitously expressed and their expression levels vary among different cell lines. We cannot draw any solid conclusion from this experiment though.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Details and data supporting the formation of a drug-resistant state (Figure 1, Figure 3) are missing. Is the screen being performed in a cell state in which all of the cells would have become resistant? How long does resistance take to form, and what fraction of cells die before this state is reached? Drug resistance and re-sensitization are of strong interest, but these are important details and should be substantiated and shown clearly. Similarly for Figure 5D it would be nice to see a full curve for cell loss, etc during DTP formation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added the details, particularly the days of DMSO or EGFR-TKI treatment, for all the colony formation assays presented in our manuscript. For questions regarding the screen and the formation of drug resistance, please refer to our response to point 1. To show the full growth curve during DTP formation, we monitored the proliferation of control or ARIH2 KO cells in the presence of DMSO control or 1 µM erlotinib over a 9-day period. As shown in the new Figure 5D, exposure of erlotinib resulted in growth arrest of both control and ARIH2 KO cells, whereas the ARIH2 KO cells exhibited higher proliferation rate when compared with control cells in the presence of erlotinib.</p></body></sub-article></article>
