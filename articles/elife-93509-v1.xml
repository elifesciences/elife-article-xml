Impaired context processing is a hallmark of several neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, and addiction. While sex differences in the prevalence and manifestations of these disorders are well established, potential sex differences in context processing remain uncertain. Here, we examined sex differences in the contextual control over cue-evoked reward seeking and its neural correlates, in rats. Male and female rats were trained in a bidirectional occasion-setting preparation in which the validity of two auditory reward-predictive cues was informed by the presence, or absence, of a visual contextual feature (LIGHT: X+/DARK: X−/LIGHT: Y−/DARK: Y+). Females were significantly slower to acquire contextual control over cue-evoked reward seeking. However, once established, the contextual control over behavior was more robust in female rats; it showed less within-session variability (less influence of prior reward) and greater resistance to acute stress. This superior contextual control achieved by females was accompanied by an increased activation of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) compared to males. Critically, these behavioral and neural sex differences were specific to the contextual modulation process and not observed in simple, context-independent, reward prediction tasks. These results indicate a sex-biased trade-off between the speed of acquisition and the robustness of performance in the contextual modulation of cued reward seeking. The different distribution of sexes along the fast learning ↔ steady performance continuum might reflect different levels of engagement of the OFC, and might have implications for our understanding of sex differences in psychiatric disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Pavlovian conditioning</kwd><kwd>context</kwd><kwd>occasion-setting</kwd><kwd>cognitive control</kwd><kwd>orbitofrontal cortex</kwd><kwd>sex differences</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007183</institution-id><institution>University of California, Santa Barbara</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Academic Senate</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Keiflin</surname><given-names>Ronald</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Rodent model of context-dependent discrimination reveals sex-biased tradeoff between speed of acquisition and robustness of contextual control over cue-elicited reward seeking, linked to orbitofrontal cortex activation.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pavlovian learning is often conceived as the formation of a binary association between two events, where event #1 (the stimulus) evokes the anticipation of event #2 (the outcome). Under this naive definition, the background circumstances (the context) in which those events occur play little role. However, this simple form of learning is often augmented by higher-level cognitive systems that allow animals (including humans) to learn and retrieve context-specific associations (e.g., the word ‘<italic>shot</italic>’ might evoke different representations in a bar vs. a vaccine clinic) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gershman, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Swartzentruber, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fraser and Holland, 2019</xref>). This process is referred to as ‘contextual-gating’ (the context acting as a ‘gatekeeper’ in the selection of the appropriate associative memory).</p><p>Deficits in contextual gating are observed in several neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD), and substance use disorders (SUD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Maren et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Vermeulen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Elman et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hemsley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Servan-Schreiber et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liberzon and Abelson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Frith and Happé, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jones et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chatham et al., 2012</xref>), and may contribute to the intrusive thoughts and maladaptive (situation-inappropriate) behaviors that characterize these disorders. Importantly, the prevalence and symptomatology of these disorders vary between sexes. For example, the incidence of schizophrenia and ASD is higher in men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Santos et al., 2022</xref>) while women are more at risk of developing SUD or PTSD following initial drug use or trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Towers et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tolin and Foa, 2006</xref>). This disparity might be due, in part, to subtle sex differences in executive strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baron-Cohen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Grissom and Reyes, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Geary, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andreano and Cahill, 2009</xref>). Stress, a contributing factor in all aforementioned disorders, can further exacerbate these sex differences, resulting in sex-specific cognitive vulnerabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Geary, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andreano and Cahill, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Goldfarb et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mazure et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bangasser et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Klein and Corwin, 2002</xref>). Sex differences in executive functions and sensitivity to stress have been reproduced in animal models using behavioral assays of attention, impulsivity, spatial navigation, and working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Grissom and Reyes, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Orsini and Setlow, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shansky et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Papaleo et al., 2012</xref>). Whether these sex differences extend to the contextual gating of associative predictions remains unknown.</p><p>In animal models, the contextual gating of associative predictions can be studied in occasion-setting preparations. In positive occasion-setting, animals learn that a ‘target’ cue (X) results in a reward outcome (+) only when that cue is accompanied by a specific ‘feature’ such as a specific context (A); the same cue presented in absence of this contextual feature remains without consequence (A:X+/X−). Conversely, in negative occasion-setting, a target cue results in reward, except when accompanied by a specific feature (A:X−/X+). In both preparations, the contextual feature is thought to hierarchically modulate (positively or negatively) the association between the target cue and the outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fraser and Holland, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bonardi et al., 2017</xref>). Strong evidence for this hierarchical modulation is the fact that a contextual feature can simultaneously function as a positive modulator for one target cue and as a negative modulator for another target cue (A:X+/X−/A:Y−/ Y+). In such bidirectional occasion-setting procedures all cues and contexts have equal probabilities of reward, therefore, accurate reward predictions cannot be achieved via simple associative summation but instead require the context-informed hierarchical gating of associative predictions (i.e., context-gated associative predictions).</p><p>Compared to simple forms of associative learning, the neural bases of context-gated associative predictions (or occasion-setting) remain severely understudied. Although recent studies have implicated the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in occasion-setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fraser and Janak, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Meyer and Bucci, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shobe et al., 2017</xref>), most of the behavioral and neurobiological occasion-setting studies have exclusively used male subjects and/or did not explicitly address sex as a biological variable.</p><p>Therefore, the purpose of this study was twofold: (1) investigate sex differences in the (bidirectional) contextual gating of reward prediction and its sensitivity to stress, and (2) investigate sex differences in OFC engagement during the contextual gating of reward predictions. We found that female rats were slower than males to acquire context-gated reward seeking. However, once established, context-gated performance was more stable in females; it showed less variability within a session and was more resistant to acute stress. Moreover, we showed that this superior contextual control achieved by females was accompanied by an increased activation of the OFC.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Male and female rats were randomly assigned to one of four Pavlovian discrimination tasks outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>. In these tasks [adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Delamater et al., 2010</xref>], all rats were exposed to two auditory cues (X and Y, 10 s) presented within two distinct, alternating, visual contexts (LIGHT and DARK; 2 min). All rats received similar amount of reward, and produced a similar behavioral response (magazine approach). However, the different reward contingencies featured in these tasks presumably promoted the emergence of different associative architectures for reward prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In the <bold><italic>Ctx-dep. O1</italic></bold> task, cue X was rewarded only in the LIGHT context and cue Y was rewarded only in DARK context; all rewarded trials resulted in the same outcome (O1). Accurate reward prediction in this task critically relies on the context-informed hierarchical modulation associative predictions (i.e., occasion-setting). In the <bold><italic>Simple discrimination</italic></bold> task, cue X was always rewarded and cue Y was never rewarded, regardless of context. In the <bold><italic>No discrimination</italic></bold> task both cues X and Y were probabilistically rewarded in both contexts. Finally, the <bold><italic>Ctx-dep. O1/O2</italic></bold> task featured similar contingencies as <italic>Ctx-dep. O1</italic>, with the exception that the two rewarded trials (LIGHT: X and DARK: Y) resulted in two different outcomes (O1 and O2, respectively). In this case, not only might the visual context promote the hierarchical modulation of associative predictions (as in <italic>Ctx-dep. O1</italic>), but the context might also contribute to context-sensitive performance via simple (nonhierarchical) associations. Indeed, the use of differential outcomes allows for distinct context–outcome associations (LIGHT → O1 and DARK → O2), as well as distinct cue–outcome associations (X → O1 and Y → O2). On a given trial, if the cue and context tend to activate the same outcome representation, the converging cue- and context-evoked excitations can add up. As a result, context-sensitive performance could potentially be achieved via simple (nonhierarchical) summation process. Therefore, while rats trained in <italic>Ctx-dep. O1/O2</italic> might engage a combination of associative processes to achieve context-sensitive behavior (including hierarchical and nonhierarchical associations), only rats trained in the <italic>Ctx-dep. O1</italic> task critically and unambiguously rely on hierarchical associations to achieve context-sensitive behavior.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Sex differences in the acquisition of context-gated but not context-independent reward predictions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Apparatus and general task design.

In contrast, female rats maintained high discrimination performance throughout the session and recent rewards had little to no effect on their discrimination accuracy. The mechanisms for the reward-induced decrease in discrimination accuracy (here observed primarily in males) are not fully understood. Rewards might temporarily lower the threshold for behavioral responding, resulting in stronger responding to weakly predictive cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kuchibhotla et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, reward delivery might decrease discrimination accuracy by increasing the predictive value of the cue (and context) present during reward delivery. These direct cue → outcome (and context → outcome) associations compete with hierarchical associations for the control of behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bradfield and Balleine, 2013</xref>), potentially affecting responding on the next trial (e.g., a rewarded LIGHT: X+ trial might increase the value of cue X and promote responding during the following DARK: X− trial; the same logic could be applied to the influence of the context). Further investigation is required to determine the precise mechanism(s) by which reward disrupt discrimination performance in the context-dependent discrimination task.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Acute stress disrupts context-gated reward seeking in male but not female rats</title><p>Stress affects several cognitive processes (e.g., selective attention, spatial navigation, working memory), often in a sex-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Papaleo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beiko et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Shansky et al., 2006</xref>). However, the effect of stress on contextual modulation, and possible sex-differences in this effect, have not been formally tested. Therefore, we tested the effect of an acute stress (90 min restrain) on discrimination performance (expressed as discrimination ratio), in a subset of animals from all training groups (<italic>Ctx-dep O1</italic>: <italic>n</italic> = 11F + 15M; <italic>Simple discrimination</italic>: <italic>n</italic> = 6F + 6M; <italic>No discrimination</italic>: <italic>n</italic> = 8F + 8M; <italic>Ctx-dep O1/O2</italic>: <italic>n</italic> = 7F + 7M) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

Male and female rats were trained on a context-dependent discrimination task (<italic>Ctx-dep. O1</italic>) in which a contextual feature informs the validity of two reward cues (i.e., bidirectional occasion-setting). Overall, males acquired context-gated behavior faster than females. However, once established, contextual control over behavior was more robust in females; it was more stable within a session (less influence of prior reward) and more resistant to acute stress. This superior contextual control achieved by females was accompanied by elevated c-Fos expression in all OFC subregions (medial, ventral, and lateral). Critically, no sex differences (behavioral or neurobiological) were observed among animals trained on simpler discrimination tasks that do not engage contextual gating (<italic>Simple Discrimination</italic>, <italic>No discrimination</italic>, <italic>Ctx-dep. O1/O2</italic>). These results add to the growing body of literature on sex differences in motivated behaviors and value-based decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Grissom and Reyes, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Orsini and Setlow, 2017</xref>). Most of these sex differences were observed in behaviors informed by binary associations between cues (or actions) and rewards. To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate sex differences in the context-informed hierarchical gating of associative predictions, a process that is largely independent from binary associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fraser and Holland, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bonardi et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>For <italic>Ctx-dep. O1</italic>, the context (LIGHT or DARK chamber) is an occasion-setter, that is, a stimulus that modulates the response to a target cue, presumably by gating the retrieval of the appropriate cue → outcome association. However, our task differs from classic occasion-setting preparations in several ways. Historically, Pavlovian modulation has been studied in preparations in which the modulating stimuli (the occasion-setter) exerts unidirectional modulation, either potentiating (A:X+/X−) or reducing (A:X−/X+) the response to the target cue. In such preparations, the occasion-setter might also establish a direct association (excitatory or inhibitory) with the outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gershman, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Urcelay and Miller, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brandon and Wagner, 1991</xref>), thereby entangling the contributions of hierarchical modulation and direct stimuli-evoked predictions. To circumvent this issue, occasion-setting preparations commonly introduce a temporal gap (5–30 s) between the termination of a discrete occasion-setting stimulus and its target cue. This approach has generally been successful in limiting direct associations between the occasion-setter and the outcome, instead promoting hierarchical modulation processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ross and Holland, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Holland, 1998</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bowers and Timberlake, 2017</xref>). This temporal gap however introduces a working-memory requirement (animals must remember if the target cue was preceded by the occasion-setter) which complicates results interpretations.</p><p>Here, we used a bidirectional occasion-setting preparation with a single reward outcome (<italic>Ctx-dep. O1</italic>) as an alternative approach to investigate contextual modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Delamater et al., 2010</xref>). In this paradigm, a contextual feature (e.g., LIGHT) positively modulates one target association (LIGHT: X+/DARK: X−) and negatively modulates another association (LIGHT: Y−/DARK: Y+). Critically, there are no direct informative associations between contextual feature and the single reward outcome (rewards are equally frequent in the LIGHT or DARK contexts), so accurate discrimination necessitates hierarchical modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bonardi et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, the contextual feature precedes and overlaps with the target cue, thereby eliminating working-memory requirements. Thus, sex differences observed in <italic>Ctx-dep. O1</italic>, strongly indicate sex differences in hierarchical (context-informed) associative modulations. Alternatively, males and females might differ in terms of attentional resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jentsch and Taylor, 2003</xref>). Indeed, unlike <italic>Simple Discrimination</italic> or <italic>No discrimination</italic> tasks, <italic>Ctx-dep. O1</italic> requires high multimodal attention (animals must simultaneously attend to the visual context and auditory cues). However, no sex differences were observed in context-dependent discrimination with two outcomes (<italic>Ctx-dep. O1/O2</italic>), a task that shares similar attentional requirements with <italic>Ctx-dep. O1</italic>, but does not necessarily engage hierarchical contextual modulation. Indeed, in <italic>Ctx-dep. O1/O2</italic>, both the visual context and the auditory target cue are relevant, however the use of differential outcomes presumably allows animals to solve the task via simple (nonhierarchical) summation processes, rats simply adding up the converging context- and cue-evoked predictions. The possibility of a nonhierarchical solution to the discrimination problem might explain why almost all rats trained in the <italic>Ctx-dep. O1/O2 task</italic> learned the discrimination and at much faster rate compared to <italic>Ctx-dep. O1</italic> (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Delamater et al., 2010</xref> for alternative explanation of the differential outcome effect). Together, these results indicate that the sex differences observed here are not attributable to simple associative, motivational, working-memory, or attentional processes, but are specific to the neurocomputational operations required for the hierarchical, contextual control of behavior. Note that there is no a priori reason to believe that the nature of these computations differ between sexes (no sex differences in the fundamental mechanisms of context-gated predictions). Rather male and female rats appear to differ slightly in the learning rate and magnitude/robustness of these computations. Moreover it remains to be determined if the sex differences in context-gated reward seeking are specific to the sensory modalities employed here or if those sex differences extend to other sensory modalities.</p><p>Sex differences in context-dependent behaviors have previously been reported in fear conditioning preparations where females often display generalized fear responses that evade precise contextual control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Day et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Greiner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Keiser et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Trask et al., 2020</xref>). Elevated baseline anxiety and fear reactivity in females might contribute to this relative failure to regulate fear responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blanchard et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dalla and Shors, 2009</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Scholl et al., 2019</xref>). However, we show here that reduced contextual control in females (at least in the early stages of acquisition) is not limited to aversive behaviors but extends to appetitive, reward-seeking behaviors. This suggests a broader, domain-general, delay in the engagement of contextual, top–down regulation processes in female rodents. This is consistent with higher sign-tracking tendencies in female rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Stringfield et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Peterson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fuentes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pitchers et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hughson et al., 2019</xref>) – another form of appetitive behavior that reflects reduced top–down cognitive control (opposed to goal-tracking behavior) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sarter and Phillips, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Flagel and Robinson, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">María-Ríos and Morrow, 2020</xref>). Note that the reduced top–down contextual control displayed by females in our study was limited to delayed acquisition. Provided sufficient training, females actually established more robust contextual control over cue-evoked reward seeking than males.</p><p>The biological basis for the delayed acquisition of contextual control in females is unknown. Although estrous cycle had no effect on the <italic>expression</italic> of context-dependent behavior in female discriminators, fluctuating sex hormones (and resulting neurobiological changes) could have contributed to the slower <italic>acquisition</italic> of contextual control in females. Indeed, learning the hierarchical contextual rules for reward prediction is a complex and lengthy process that probably requires distributed plasticity across several brain regions including the striatum, amygdala, hippocampus, and neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fraser and Holland, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lee and Lee, 2013</xref>). Estrous cycle affects synaptic physiology and plasticity at all these sites via changes in dopamine reuptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Morissette and Di Paolo, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Calipari et al., 2017</xref>), neuronal excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alonso-Caraballo and Ferrario, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clemens et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shanley et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Scharfman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blume et al., 2017</xref>), spine density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Woolley et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beeson and Meitzen, 2023</xref>), gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Knoedler et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Duclot and Kabbaj, 2015</xref>), or neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mahmoud et al., 2016</xref>). This dynamic neurobiological environment might constitute a challenge for females attempting to solve the <italic>Ctx-dep. O1</italic> task, and might contribute to their delayed acquisition of contextual control. Interestingly, this dynamic neurobiological environment might also contribute to the more stable performance ultimately achieved by females. Indeed, in deep learning models, the injection of random ‘noise’ in (artificial) neural networks during training is commonly used to build redundancy and increase network performance and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Srivastava et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). This ‘<italic>robustness through perturbations</italic>’ approach often comes at the expense of learning speed, similar to what we observed in females. Alternatively, or in addition, androgens (male sex hormones) – known to contribute to the male advantage on certain spatial tasks – might have contributed to males’ faster acquisition of contextual control in this task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dohanich et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Spritzer et al., 2011</xref>). The role of these hormonal factors, as well as potential non-gonadal sex differences, in the trade-off between learning speed and performance stability remains to be confirmed experimentally.</p><p>Regardless of the precise mechanism, our results indicate that, compared to male rats, female discriminators ultimately achieved more stable contextual control over cued reward seeking; their context-dependent discrimination performance was less affected by trial history (recent rewards) or by acute stress. This relative resilience of females trained in the <italic>Ctx-dep. O1</italic> task is consistent with studies showing that females, while more sensitive to the arousing and anxiogenic effects of stress, are more resilient to the disrupting effects of stress on executive functions and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bangasser et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Papaleo et al., 2012</xref>).

More generally, the OFC is proposed to encode task structure including context-dependent contingencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mizrak et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wilson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Farovik et al., 2015</xref>). Accordingly, the OFC appears critical for decision-making when optimal choices require knowledge of the broader task structure (i.e., when stimuli cannot be taken at face value) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bradfield et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Takahashi et al., 2011</xref>). Although causality remains to be established, our data suggest that the increased orbitofrontal engagement displayed by females might contribute to their resilient contextual regulation of behavior.</p><p>The root causes of the behavioral and neural sex differences in context-gated reward prediction are largely unknown and not addressed in this study. In principle, all the sex differences reported here (speed of acquisition, robustness of performance, and OFC activation) might be independent and engage different mechanisms. Alternatively, some of these effects might be causally related. Our result show that, for a comparable level of context-dependent discrimination, females show an increased engagement of the OFC compared to males (higher number of c-Fos-immunoreactive neurons). This suggests a denser (less sparse) coding of context-dependent contingencies in females’ OFC. Denser coding is generally associated with slower discrimination learning but superior fault tolerance (i.e., better resistance to noise or disturbance) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Spanne and Jörntell, 2015</xref>), exactly what we observed in females, suggesting a potential unifying mechanism for the sex differences reported here.</p><p>The contextual regulation of behavior is at the heart of cognitive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chatham et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Miller and Cohen, 2001</xref>). Deficits in this process are integral to the pathophysiology of numerous neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Maren et al., 2013</xref>). Although extrapolation of animal data to humans requires caution, our findings of a superior OFC engagement by female rats during context-informed hierarchical control of reward seeking is consistent with human [f]MRI studies showing larger OFC grey matter volume in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liu et al., 2020</xref>) and superior OFC activation in females during the regulation of emotional responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Welborn et al., 2009</xref>). The behavioral and neural sex differences observed here might offer insight into the biological sex differences observed in certain disorders. For instance, the initial delay in establishing contextual control observed here in females might contribute to the rapid progression of SUD or PTSD observed in women following initial drug use or trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Towers et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tolin and Foa, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Becker and Chartoff, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Olff, 2017</xref>). Conversely, the more stable contextual control ultimately achieved by females after extended training observed here might contribute to the better prognosis for women following behavioral and cognitive treatments for these disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Olff, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Walitzer and Dearing, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Galovski et al., 2013</xref>), and might be due, in part, to increased OFC engagement.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Subjects were male and female Long Evans rats (Charles Rivers), 8–10 weeks at arrival. Rats were housed in same-sex pairs in a temperature-controlled vivarium (22°C) with a 12-hr light/dark cycle; behavioral experiments were conducted during the light cycle. Rats were given free access to water in their homecage for the duration of the experiments. After a week of acclimation to the colony room, rats were mildly food restricted to maintain ~95% of age-matched free-feeding weights. All experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with UCSB Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees and the US National Institute of Health guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Apparatus</title><p>Behavioral training was conducted in 12 identical conditioning chambers enclosed in individual sound- and light-attenuating cubicles (Med Associates, St. Albans, VT). Six chambers were dedicated to male subjects and six chambers were dedicated to female subjects; animals of both sexes were trained simultaneously. A recessed reward delivery port was located at the center of the front panel and was connected to a pellet dispenser and a syringe pump for liquid reward delivery (syringe pump located outside of the sound-attenuating cubicle). Subjects’ presence in the reward port was detected by the interruption of an infrared beam. Two ceiling-facing chamber lights located on the front and back internal walls of the cubicle provided diffuse chamber illumination and were used to manipulate the background visual context. Auditory stimuli were delivered via a white noise speaker and a clicker (76 dB each), located in the back and front panel, respectively. A fan mounted on the cubicle provided ventilation and low background noise. A computer equipped with Med-PC software (Med Associates) controlled all experimental programs and data collection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Rewards</title><p>Food rewards consisted of a 45-mg banana-flavored food pellet (BioServe Dustless Precision Pellets, F0059 formula) or a 0.17-ml bolus of sweetened chocolate milk (2 parts chocolate Nesquik + 1 part water + 5% sucrose wt/vol) delivered over 3 s. These rewards are highly discriminable but equicaloric and were equally preferred by rats in preliminary studies. The identity of the rewarding outcomes was counterbalanced within behavioral tasks and within sexes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Discrimination training</title><p>Rats were randomly assigned to one of four Pavlovian discrimination conditions: Context-dependent discrimination with single outcome (<italic>Ctx-dep. O1</italic>, <italic>n</italic> = 30F + 32M), Context-dependent discrimination with dual outcome (<italic>Ctx-dep. O1/O2</italic>, <italic>n</italic> = 14F + 14M), Simple discrimination (<italic>Simple</italic>, <italic>n</italic> = 12F + 22M), or No Discrimination (<italic>NoDiscr</italic>., <italic>n</italic> = 8F + 8M). Animals were individually placed in the conditioning chambers for 80 min training sessions 5–6 days/week. During each session, the visual background – the local context – alternated every 2 min between flashing houselights (0.25 s on, 0.25 s off; LIGHT context) or darkness (DARK context). Within each context phase, two 10 s auditory cues, X or Y (white noise or clicker, counterbalanced), were presented individually, in two separate trials, and were potentially followed by reward. The presentation of each cue within a context phase was selected semi-randomly, so that the identity of the first cue had no incidence on the identity of the second cue (i.e., the same cue could repeat twice within a context phase, so the outcome of the first trial did not inform the outcome of the second trial). Each session consisted of 40 context cycles and 80 cue presentations (i.e., 80 trials) with an average intertrial of 50 ± 20 s (rectangular distribution). The reward contingencies in each task are outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. During the acquisition period, unless specified otherwise (cf. <italic>Ctx-dep. O1</italic>), each behavioral training session consisted of an equal proportion of each trial type (20* LIGHT: X; 20* DARK: X; 20* LIGHT: Y; 20* DARK: Y).</p><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Context-dependent discrimination with single outcome (Ctx-dep. O1)</title><p>In this task, the reward-predictive validity of each cue was informed by the context, so that cue X was rewarded only in LIGHT context and cue Y was rewarded only in the DARK context. All rewarded trials resulted in the same reward outcome (O1). Considered individually, both cues and both contexts have equal probabilities of resulting in the same outcome, therefore accurate performance in this task cannot be understood in terms of summed associative strength between cues and contexts. Instead, accurate performance in this task critically relies on contextual modulation (i.e., occasion-setting). During the first 35 training sessions, rats experienced an equal number of rewarded and unrewarded trials (20 trials for each context/cue combination per session). On the 36th session and for the remainder of the experiment, the relative proportion of rewarded trials was reduced (10* LIGHT: X+; 30* DARK: X−; 30* LIGHT: Y−; 10* DARK: Y+) in an effort to promote discrimination. After 72 training sessions, animals that failed to reach a discrimination criterion were excluded from the rest of the study (discrimination criterion: time in port during rewarded cue ≥1.5* time in port during non-rewarded cue, for both cues, for a minimum of four out of five consecutive sessions).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>Simple discrimination</title><p>Cue X was always rewarded and cue Y was never rewarded, regardless of the context.

During the acquisition period, the probability of reinforcement was 50% for each cue/context combination. Presumably, this training protocol promotes reward prediction via simple associative learning (context-independent predictions) although the reward cues retain some ambiguity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-4"><title>Context-dependent discrimination with dual outcome (Ctx-dep.

O1</italic>, with the exception that the two rewarded trial types (LIGHT: X and DARK: Y) resulted in two different food outcomes (O1 and O2, respectively). This has profound implications for the learning processes engaged in the task. The delivery of different outcomes in different contexts allows for distinct context–outcome associations (LIGHT → O1 and DARK → O2), as well as distinct cue–outcome associations (X → O1 and Y → O2). These different associative structures could potentially facilitate discrimination performance via simple summation process.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Assessment of estrous cycle</title><p>Estrous cycle phases were monitored via vaginal cytology for a subset of females (<italic>n</italic> = 10) over 15 consecutive days (sessions 66–80). Immediately after the behavioral session, the tip of a saline-moistened cotton swab was inserted into the vagina and rotated to dislodge cells from the vaginal wall. Swabs were immediately rolled onto a glass slide, and the samples were preserved with a spray fixative (M-Fix, MilliporeSigma) without allowing the cells to dry. Slides were then stained with a modified Papanicolau staining procedure as follows: 50% ethyl alcohol, 3 min; tap water, 10 dips (×2); Gill’s hematoxylin 1, 6 min; tap water, 10 dips (×2); Scott’s water, 4 min; tap water, 10 dips (×2); 95% ethyl alcohol, 10 dips (×2); modified orange-greenish 6 (OG-6), 1 min; 95% ethyl alcohol, 10 dips; 95% ethyl alcohol, 8 dips; 95% ethyl alcohol, 6 dips; modified eosin azure 36 (EA-36), 20 min; 95% ethyl alcohol, 40 dips; 95% ethyl alcohol, 30 dips; 95% ethyl alcohol, 20 dips; 100% ethyl alcohol, 10 dips (×2); xylene, 10 dips (×2); coverslip immediately. Samples were observed with light microscopy (×4). Four criteria were used to determine the specific estrus cycle: (1) cell density, (2) percentage of nucleated epithelial cells, (3) cornified epithelial cells, and (4) percentage of leukocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cora et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Goldman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Karim et al., 2003</xref>). Each sample was independently rated by two trained observers (S.P. and A.M.), blind to the behavioral data. Inter-rater agreement was high (88.2%). Only behavioral sessions for which both raters agreed on the estrous phase were selected for analysis. As a result, two to four behavioral sessions were considered for each subject at each phase of the estrous cycle. Behavioral data on these sessions were averaged to express a single data point for each rat at each stage of the estrous cycle. Females that did not show a regular cycle were excluded from the analysis (<italic>n</italic> = 2).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Acute restraint stress</title><p>Before testing the effect of acute stress on discrimination performance, the relative proportion of rewarded trials was adjusted in all groups to match the proportion of rewarded trials in the context-dependent discrimination with a single outcome (<italic>Ctx-dep. O1</italic>). As a result, rewarded cues became less frequent and represented only 1/4 of the trials. For all groups, these rewarded trials were equally distributed across both contexts. After five to six sessions of adjustment to these new conditions, we tested the effect of an acute stress on discrimination performance in a subset of animals from all training groups (Ctx-dep. O1: M <italic>n</italic> = 15, F <italic>n</italic> = 11; Simple discrimination: M <italic>n</italic> = 6, F <italic>n</italic> = 6; No discrimination: M <italic>n</italic> = 8, F <italic>n</italic> = 8; Ctx-dep. O1/O2: M <italic>n</italic> = 7, F <italic>n</italic> = 7). Acute stress was induced by restraining rats in standard Plexiglas rat restraint tubes (Plas Labs, Inc) for 90 min, in a novel brightly lit room. To account for the size differences between male and females, two different sized restrainers were used (65 and 50 mm internal diameter for male and female restrainers, respectively). After placing the rats in the tube, the length of the restrainer was adjusted to immobilize the rat without causing pain or interfering with animals’ breathing. After 90 min of restraint, the rats were returned to their homecage and left undisturbed for 5 min before being placed in the conditioning chambers for a normal behavioral session. This restraint procedure is a well-established stressor in rodents, known to produce robust behavioral and physiological effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Shansky et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Babb et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lovelock and Deak, 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>cFos immunofluorescence</title><p>Following stress test, animal were retrained for five to six sessions, under standard conditions (no stress; equal number of rewards for all training groups; rewarded trials = 1/4 of all trials). After their last behavioral session, animals remained in the conditioning chambers for 40 min (120 min total); they were then deeply anesthetized with a lethal dose of Euthasol and perfused transcardially with ice-cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate buffer (PB). Brains were extracted, post-fixed (4% PFA overnight) and cryoprotected (30% sucrose + 0.1% sodium azide, 1× PBS) until processed for immunostaining. Brains were frozen and sectioned into 40 μm with a sliding cryostat (Leica CM1860). Free floating coronal sections were washed for 10 min in PBS, followed by a 2-hr incubation in a blocking solution (5% Normal Goat Serum [NGS], 0.2% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS) at room temperature. Sections were then incubated with rabbit anti-cFos (1:1000, Cell Signaling, CAT#: 2250) and mouse anti-NeuN (neuron-specific protein; 1:2000 or 1:3000, Novus, CAT#: NBP1-92693) primary antibodies, in the blocking solution, for 20 hr at 4°C. Following primary antibody incubation, sections were washed in PBS three times for 10 min and then incubated with anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated secondary antibody (far-red) (1:250, Jackson ImmunoResearch, CAT#: 111-605-144) and anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (green) (1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch, CAT#: 115-545-003) for 90 min at room temperature. Sections were then washed in PBS three times for 10 min, mounted on slides and immediately coverslipped with a hardset mounting medium (Vector laboratories CAT#: H-1700). Images were acquired at a ×10 magnification, using a Keyence BZ-X fluorescence microscope.</p><p>Brain regions of interest for c-Fos-immunoreactive neurons quantification included the medial, ventral, and lateral orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC, vOFC, and lOFC). Additionally, two control regions were included, for which we did not expect task-specific activation: the jaw primary motor (M1J) and somatosensory cortex (S1J). These regions of interests were manually isolated from the original images, using only the green/NeuN channel (the far-red/c-fos channel was temporarily disabled for blinding purposes). A custom ImageJ script (National Institutes of Health) was then used to count c-Fos-positive neurons in the selected regions and normalize this count to the surface area of the selected region (c-Fos-positive neurons/mm<sup>2</sup>). For each brain region, c-Fos-positive neurons were counted bilaterally from 2 to 4 sections per animal and a mean count was computed for each animal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were collected over three replication cohorts, each composed of approximately equal number of male and female rats. Cue-evoked reward seeking was quantified primarily as the percentage of time a rat spent in the food cup during the last 5 s of cue presentation, when anticipatory food cup behavior is more reliably observed and less contaminated by orienting behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Holland, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Holland, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Holland, 2000</xref>). The percentage of time in port during the 5 s epoch prior cue onset is shown but not analyzed. Discrimination accuracy was expressed as a discrimination ratio, defined as the time in port during rewarded trials divided by the total time in port during all trials. A ratio of 0.5 indicates equal responding during rewarded and non-rewarded trials (i.e., no discrimination) whereas a ratio of 1 indicates responding exclusively during rewarded trials (i.e., perfect discrimination). Time in port and discrimination ratio during acquisition were aggregated in four-session bins. These longitudinal RM were analyzed with LMM with a Restricted Maximum Likelihood estimation method. All covariance structures were explored and the best fitting model was determined by the lower Akaike information criterion score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Duricki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">West, 2009</xref>). The selection of a covariance structure influenced the degrees of freedom of the model, possibly resulting in non-integer values. The remaining of the analyses consisted generally of mixed-models RM-ANOVAs with Sex and/or Task as a between-subject factor, and Trial history, Stress, or Brain region as within-subject factors. The Geisser–Greenhouse correction was applied when data lacked sphericity, possibly resulting in non-integer degrees of freedom. Post hoc or planned contrast pairwise comparisons were carried with Bonferroni-corrected <italic>t</italic>-tests. When appropriate, nonparametric tests were conducted and consisted of the Kruskal–Wallis <italic>H</italic> test followed by post hoc Bonferroni-corrected Dunn’s pairwise comparisons. All tests were two-tailed, significance was assessed against a type I error rate of 0.05. Statistical analyses were conducted with SPSS Statistics package (version 28.0.0.0; IBM SPSS).

The authors find no sex differences in context-irrelevant tasks, and no such differences in tasks in which the context signals that different cues will earn different outcomes. They do find sex differences, however, when a single outcome is given and context cues must be used to ascertain which cue will be rewarded with that outcome (Ctx-dep O1 task). Specifically, they find that males acquired the task faster, but that once acquired, performance of the task was more resilient in female rats against exposures to a stressor. Finally, they show that these sex differences are reflected in differential rates of c-fos expression in all three subregions of rat OFC, medial, lateral and ventral, in the sense that it is higher in females than males, and only in the animals subject to the Ctx-dep O1 task in which sex differences were observed.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>• Well written</p><p>• Experiments elegantly designed</p><p>• Robust statistics</p><p>• Behaviour is the main feature of this manuscript, rather than any flashy techniques or fashionable lab methodologies, and luckily the behaviour is done really well.</p><p>• For the most part I think the conclusions were well supported, although I do have some slightly different interpretations to the authors in places.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The authors have done an excellent job of addressing all previous weaknesses.

Periods of cue A alternated with periods of cue B, which signaled the opposite relationship, cue X is nonreinforced and cue Y is reinforced. This is a conditional discrimination problem in which the rats learned to approach the food cup in the presence of each CS conditional on the presence of the third background cue. The comparison groups consisted of the same conditional discrimination with the exception that each CS was paired with a different reinforcer. This makes the problem easier to solve as the background is now priming a differential outcome. A third group received simple discrimination training of X reinforced and Y nonreinforced in cues A and B, and the final group were trained with X and Y reinforced on half the trials (no discrimination). The results were clear that the latter two discrimination learning procedures resulted in rapid learning in comparison to the first. Rats required about 3 times as many 4-session blocks to acquire the bi-conditional discrimination than the other two discrimination groups. Within the biconditional discrimination group, female and male rats spent the same amount of time in the food cup during the rewarded CS, but females spent more time in the food cup during CS- than males. The authors interpret this as a deficit in discrimination performance in females on this task and use a measure that exaggerates the difference in CS+ and CS_ responding (a discrimination ratio) to support their point. When tested after acute restraint stress, the male rats spent less time in the food cup during the reinforced CS in comparison to the female rats, but did not lose discrimination performance entirely. The was also some evidence of more fos positive cells in the orbitofrontal cortex in females. Overall, I think the authors were successful in documenting performance on the biconditional discrimination task, showing that it is more difficult to perform than other discriminations is valuable and consistent with the proposal that accurate performance requires encoding of conditional information (which the authors refer to as &quot;context&quot;). There is evidence that female rats spend more time in the food cup during CS-, but this I hesitate to agree that this is an important sex difference. There is no cost to spending more time in the food cup during CS- and they spend much less time there than during CS+. Males and females also did not differ in their CS+ responding, suggesting similar levels of learning, A number of factors could contribute to more food cup time in CS-, such as smaller body size and more locomotor activity. The number of food cup entries during CS+ and CS- was not reported here. Nevertheless, I think the manuscript will make a useful contribution to the field and hopefully lead readers to follow up on these types of tasks. One area for development would be to test the associative properties of the cues controlling the conditional discrimination, can they be shown to have the properties of Pavlovian occasion setting stimuli? Such work would strengthen the justification/rationale for using the term &quot;context&quot; and &quot;occasion setter&quot; to refer to these stimuli in this task in the way the authors do in this paper.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Nicely designed and conducted experiment.</p><p>Documents performance difference by sex.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Overstatement of sex differences.</p><p>Inconsistent, confusing, and possibly misleading use of terms to describe/imply the underlying processes contributing to performance.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.93509.4.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Peterson</surname><given-names>Sophie</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, Santa Barbara</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Santa Barbara</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Maheras</surname><given-names>Amanda</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, Santa Barbara</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Santa Barbara</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Brenda</surname><given-names>Wu</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, Santa Barbara</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Santa Barbara</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chavira</surname><given-names>Jose</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, Santa Barbara</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Santa Barbara</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Keiflin</surname><given-names>Ronald</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, Santa Barbara</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Santa Barbara</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Stress response in males versus females: The authors argue that the contextual control over behaviour was more robust in female rats as females show less within session variability and greater resistance to stress.

Although not measured in this study, the ACTH and cortisol responses are actually greater in females during restraint. To the extent that “stress induction” is interpreted as “HPA axis activation”, this strongly suggests that the stress induction in males and females was at least comparable, if not greater in females.</p><p>We have added a few sentences (in the Result and Method section) to highlight this important point.

These rats might be relying on direct context-outcome and cue-outcome associations and adding (or summing up) the converging expectations.
