detection by the vomeronasal organ (VNO). Urine, a rich source of ethologically relevant chemosignals, conveys detailed information about sex, social hierarchy, health, and reproductive state, which becomes accessible to a conspecific via vomeronasal sampling. So far, however, numerous aspects of social chemosignaling along the vomeronasal pathway remain unclear. Moreover, since virtually all research on vomeronasal physiology is based on secretions derived from inbred laboratory mice, it remains uncertain whether such stimuli provide a true representation of potentially more relevant cues found in the wild. Here, we combine a robust low-noise VNO activity assay with comparative molecular profiling of sex- and strain-specific mouse urine samples from two inbred laboratory strains as well as from wild mice. With comprehensive molecular portraits of these secretions, VNO activity analysis now enables us to (i) assess whether and, if so, how much sex/strain-selective ‘raw’ chemical information in urine is accessible via vomeronasal sampling; (ii) identify which chemicals exhibit sufficient discriminatory power to signal an animal’s sex, strain, or both; (iii) determine the extent to which wild mouse secretions are unique; and (iv) analyze whether vomeronasal response profiles differ between strains. We report both sex- and, in particular, strain-selective VNO representations of chemical information. Within the urinary ‘secretome’, both volatile compounds and proteins exhibit sufficient discriminative power to provide sex- and strain-specific molecular fingerprints. While total protein amount is substantially enriched in male urine, females secrete a larger variety at overall comparatively low concentrations. Surprisingly, the molecular spectrum of wild mouse urine does not dramatically exceed that of inbred strains. Finally, vomeronasal response profiles differ between C57BL/6 and BALB/c animals, with particularly disparate representations of female semiochemicals.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>olfaction</kwd><kwd>vomeronasal organ</kwd><kwd>chemosensory system</kwd><kwd>chemosignaling</kwd><kwd>vomeronasal sensory neurons</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>368482240/GRK2416</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spehr</surname><given-names>Marc</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>378028035</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ben-Shaul</surname><given-names>Yoram</given-names></name><name><surname>Spehr</surname><given-names>Marc</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001663</institution-id><institution>Volkswagen Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I/83533</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spehr</surname><given-names>Marc</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001736</institution-id><institution>German-Israeli Foundation for Scientific Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1-1193-153.13/2012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ben-Shaul</surname><given-names>Yoram</given-names></name><name><surname>Spehr</surname><given-names>Marc</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Parallel chemical and physiological profiling of conspecific chemosensory communication in mice identifies both common and unique strategies for vomeronasal signaling of sex and strain.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In rodents and most other mammals, the accessory olfactory system controls conspecific chemical communication during social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brennan and Zufall, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dulac and Torello, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mohrhardt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tirindelli et al., 2009</xref>). Ethologically meaningful chemostimuli that trigger stereotypic social and sexual behaviors are predominantly detected by the vomeronasal organ (VNO), a tubular sensory structure at the anterior base of the nasal septum. In a crescent-shaped medial neuroepithelium, the VNO harbors approximately 100,000–200,000 vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wilson and Raisman, 1980</xref>), each extending a single unbranched apical dendrite that terminates in a paddle-shaped swelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mohrhardt et al., 2018</xref>). At the dendritic tips, microvilli are immersed in mucus that fills a central luminal canal, which extends via the vomeronasal duct into the nasal cavity. During social investigatory behavior, which in mice primarily involves periods of intense licking and sniffing of both facial and anogenital regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Luo et al., 2003</xref>), semiochemicals are sucked into the VNO lumen. Upon binding to cognate vomeronasal receptors (VRs), the chemical signal is transduced into electrical VSN activity and, ultimately, neuronal discharge.</p><p>Behaviorally relevant natural chemostimuli are, typically, complex blends of compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wyatt, 2017</xref>) in various bodily secretions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albone, 1984</xref>). By far, the most widely studied secretion in animal chemosensory research is urine (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mohrhardt et al., 2018</xref>, and references therein), which is a rich source of semiochemicals that serves a well-established function in social communication. While we still lack a comprehensive molecular description of this broadband vomeronasal stimulus, previous work has identified several putative semiochemicals in mouse urine and other bodily secretions, which activate VSNs and cover many structural groups and feature dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chamero et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doyle et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hurst et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kimoto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Leinders-Zufall et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leinders-Zufall et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nodari et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Novotny, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Overath et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rivière et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Röck et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sturm et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wyatt, 2017</xref>). Prominent molecularly identified VSN stimuli include various sulfated steroids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Celsi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haga-Yamanaka et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haga-Yamanaka et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Isogai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nodari et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Turaga and Holy, 2012</xref>), which could reflect the dynamic endocrine state of an individual.</p><p>So far, virtually all research on vomeronasal physiology is based on urinary stimuli derived from inbred laboratory mice (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bansal et al., 2021</xref>). This facilitates standardization across studies but, while VSN sex and strain selectivity has previously been explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">He et al., 2008</xref>), it remains unclear whether secretions collected from inbred mice accurately represent the potentially more ethologically relevant stimuli found in the wild. In fact, while wild <italic>Mus musculus</italic> populations exhibit several-fold higher levels of genetic variation than those in human populations, commonly studied inbred strains of laboratory mice derive from a limited set of founders. Therefore, such strains contain only a small subset of the genetic variation that is present in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Phifer-Rixey and Nachman, 2015</xref>). Classical inbred strains of house mice are genetic mosaics of the three main wild subspecies, <italic>M. m. domesticus</italic>, <italic>musculus</italic>, and <italic>castaneus</italic>, which started to diverge ∼350,000–500,000 years ago. However, the genomes of prominent inbred strains, such as C57BL/6 or BALB/c, are predominantly derived from <italic>M. m. domesticus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wade and Daly, 2005</xref>). The mitochondrial genomes of both laboratory strains are identical, implying a common descent along the maternal line. Given their overlapping geographical distribution, wild house mice subspecies have also undergone secondary contact and hybridization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duvaux et al., 2011</xref>), which has diversified their genetic landscape.</p><p>Laboratory inbreeding, which has been ongoing for more than 100 years for C57BL/6 and BALB/c strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Phifer-Rixey and Nachman, 2015</xref>), may have affected the chemical composition of bodily secretions and, consequently, their information content. Indeed, both within and between strains, laboratory mice lack variation in major urinary protein (MUP) patterns typically found among wild mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheetham et al., 2009</xref>). This inbred homogeneity could have important implications for research investigating, for example, social recognition or mate choice: if there are marked qualitative and/or quantitative differences in chemical composition of secretions and, accordingly, in the neuronal representations of wild as compared to inbred derived stimuli, one might question the conclusions based on a large body of work using inbred secretions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bansal et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>On the recipients’ end, the level of chemosensory information available from con/heterospecific secretions is determined by individual VR expression profiles. Across strains, VR repertoires vary as a function of both genetics and experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duyck et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ibarra-Soria et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wynn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Xu et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, it is unclear whether receptor arrays in laboratory strains, despite hundreds of generations of inbreeding and domestication (‘microevolution’) in a laboratory environment, have retained selectivity for more ethologically relevant wild-derived stimuli. Moreover, it remains uncertain whether VR tuning profiles enable VSNs to capture key ethological features from molecular concentration differences between sex- and strain-specific secretions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">He et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leinders-Zufall et al., 2000</xref>). Together, four key biological questions arise from these lines of reasoning: (i) Do VSN response profiles reflect the global molecular content of urine (i.e. are these neurons sensitive to many/most compounds) or, by contrast, is the VNO a highly selective molecular detector (responding to just a few select molecules)? (ii) Are VSN response profiles strain-specific? (iii) Which semiochemicals provide information about sex and/or strain? (iv) Is there something unique about wild mouse secretions and/or the VSN response profiles they trigger?</p><p>Here, to address these unresolved issues, we combine a robust VSN activity assay with comparative molecular profiling of sex- and strain-specific mouse urine from two inbred laboratory strains and wild mice. Our study provides molecular portraits of these secretions. We report that large fractions of generic urine compounds are shared among both male and female mice of all genetic backgrounds. We further show that the urinary ‘secretome’ in wild mice does not differ dramatically from that found in laboratory strains. Surprisingly, while male urine contains much higher protein concentrations, females secrete a larger variety of proteins (including MUPs). For proteins common to all strains, concentrations are relatively low in C57BL/6, moderate in BALB/c, and high in wild animals. However, despite this concentration bias, there is no overrepresentation of wild-selective proteins. Notably, both the volatile organic compound (VOC) and protein profile of urine, each provides sufficient information to decode a given sex/strain combination (with protein content exhibiting stronger discriminative power). Moreover, we identify a rich lipocalin repertoire in urine, which alone could allow chemosensory discrimination of sex/strain combinations.</p><p>A key strength of this study is the use of the exact same stimuli as previously employed to investigate sensory representations in the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bansal et al., 2021</xref>), the first central processing stage along the accessory olfactory pathway. Our previous work demonstrated that AOB representations of ethologically relevant urine stimuli are similar for male mice from two different inbred strains (C57BL/6 and BALB/c), despite potential differences in VR repertoires. In addition, we found that wild mouse stimuli elicit responses that, although not identical, are nevertheless qualitatively similar to those from commonly used inbred strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bansal et al., 2021</xref>). VSN activity analysis now enables us to ask whether these features also manifest in the VNO and, thus, to assess (i) whether the information inherent in a sex- and strain-specific urinary secretome is accessible via vomeronasal sampling; and (ii) if, on the population level, VSN sensory representations differ between strains. Comparing responses from male C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice (as done previously on AOB level; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bansal et al., 2021</xref>), our data demonstrate that recipient strain identity is reflected by their VSN activity patterns. Moreover, when exposed to stimuli from different strains, large VSN fractions (often &gt;50%) respond to only one stimulus, suggesting a substantial degree of selective sampling. Together, our study reveals selective and strain-dependent representations of urine chemical content, a surprising scarceness of selective responses to wild stimuli, as well as remarkably rich and sex/strain-specific molecular profiles that likely preserve most of the biologically relevant information.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In mice, the VNO is the predominant sensory structure mediating conspecific chemical communication. In this study, by comparing samples derived from two inbred strains (BALB/c and C57BL/6) as well as from wild mice, we pursue four main questions: (i) Which chemical components in mouse urine – a major source of semiochemicals – distinguish sex and/or strain? (ii) To what degree has inbreeding affected the chemical composition of urine (i.e. how unique are wild mouse secretions)? (iii) How much of the sex- and strain-specific chemical information in urine is accessible to a conspecific via vomeronasal sampling (i.e. how selective are VSN response profiles)?

Our experimental design followed a standard pairwise comparison paradigm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Pairs of pooled stimuli differed either in the donors’ sex (male <italic>versus</italic> female) or in their genetic background (BALB/c, C57BL/6, or wild). We repeated brief (10 s) alternating stimulus presentations twice at 180 s inter-stimulus intervals that ensured recovery from VSN adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wong et al., 2018</xref>). Experiments concluded with a brief exposure to elevated extracellular K<sup>+</sup> (<bold>S<sub>3</sub></bold>) to depolarize neurons and test for integrity of each neuron’s spike generation machinery. Dependent on their individual urine response profiles, VSNs were categorized as either specialists (selective response to one stimulus) or generalists (responsive to both stimuli). Overall, we recorded &gt;43,000 K<sup>+</sup>-sensitive neurons, of which a total of 16,715 VSNs (38.4%) responded to urine stimulation. Of these urine-sensitive neurons, 61.4% displayed generalist profiles, whereas 38.6% were categorized as specialists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c and d</xref>). As a measure of intrinsic signal variability, we calculated reliability indices that quantify the similarity (or lack thereof) of two successive responses to the same stimulus (with small values reflecting high reliability; see Materials and methods). We analyzed both Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>) and integrals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>) as measures of response magnitude. For both generalist and specialist VSNs, response reliability indices are normally distributed around zero. While the distribution of reliability indices derived from response integral measurements is somewhat broad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>), indices based on signal amplitudes proved relatively homogeneous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>).

Since the chemical composition of both stimuli should be similar, we expected that the vast majority of urine-sensitive VSNs will display generalist response profiles. That was indeed the case. Less than 2% of VSNs showed stimulus selectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b and c</xref>). Moreover, response indices (reflecting a bias toward either of the paired stimuli) are normally (and narrowly) distributed around zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b and c</xref>). Both observations confirm a low level of biological and experimental noise in this setting. Thus, our assay is well suited to detect and compare VSN sensory responses upon pairwise stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Sex-specific stimuli elicit distinct VSN sensory representations</title><p>We next investigated how sex differences are reflected in VSN response profiles. When challenged with male <italic>versus</italic> female urine from C57BL/6 animals, the fraction of specialist neurons more than doubled to 5% of all K<sup>+</sup>-sensitive neurons. Notably, female urine recruited more specialist neurons than male urine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). We then asked whether this pattern is correlated with the chemical compositions of male and female urine. In-depth molecular analysis of urine content via two-dimensional gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GCxGC-MS) as well as nanoliquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (nLC-MS/MS) identified a total of 1006 molecules (detected in ≥3 out of 10 male or female samples, respectively), of which approximately 40% are low molecular weight VOCs, while 60% are proteins. Roughly half of the molecules in either group are found in both male and female urine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Unexpectedly, while we hardly identify any male-specific proteins in C57BL/6 urine, we find a large fraction of female-specific proteins. We asked whether this phenomenon is (i) a distinct feature of C57BL/6 mice, (ii) common among inbred laboratory strains, or (iii) also observed in wild animals. Therefore, we included urine samples from both BALB/c and wild mice in extended molecular profiling. In both groups, we observed similarly increased levels of female-specific proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). The total amount of protein, however, is substantially enriched in male urine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). Our data thus suggest that, while females secrete a larger variety of proteins, overall concentrations are comparatively low.</p><p>Finally, we asked whether common compounds (i.e. molecules identified in both male and female urine) show concentration disparities between sexes and, if so, how such differences are reflected in VSN response profiles. When VSNs were challenged with male <italic>versus</italic> female C57BL/6 urine, 19% of all K<sup>+</sup>-sensitive neurons responded to both stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Here, again, response preference indices are narrowly distributed and center around zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>). By contrast, analogously calculated concentration indices (see Materials and methods) that can reflect potential disparities are distributed more broadly and non-normally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>). This apparent incongruence between nonpreferential generalist sensitivity and relatively large chemical concentration differences indicates that VSN responses (at least in C57BL/6 males) do not simply reflect the information theoretically available via concentration differences between male and female same-strain stimuli. One explanation for this is that common ligands are not well represented by the observed general concentration disparities. Alternatively, it may be that even low concentrations fully activate a given VSN, and thus concentration differences are not reflected by response strengths. Notably, a broad and non-normal distribution of concentration indices among molecular components of male <italic>versus</italic> female urine is also found in samples from both BALB/c and wild mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Chemical characterization of urine content identifies distinctive molecular signatures of sex and strain</title><p>Which differences in chemical composition (i.e. which molecules) characterize sex/strain-specific secretions and may thus provide information about sex and strain to a recipient? Molecular profiling of urine content provides a unique opportunity to address this question and identify enriched compounds (i.e. present in ≥6 of 10 individual samples) with the potential capacity to signal an animal’s sex, strain, or both. Adopting this more conservative criterion, we detected 208 enriched VOCs and 264 enriched proteins. Almost half of all VOCs (47.6%) and about one-third of all proteins (31.4%) are found in all six sex/strain combinations tested and are, thus, considered generic mouse urine components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a and b</xref>). Moreover, a total of 33 compounds (10 VOCs, 23 proteins) were identified across all strains, but in a sex-specific fashion. Similarly, 22 molecules (10 VOCs, 12 proteins) revealed strain selectivity, independent of sex. Notably, a large fraction of compounds, i.e., 34.1% of all VOCs (71/208) and 22.3% of proteins (59/264), were detected exclusively in one of the six sex/strain combinations. Only 18 of the 208 VOCs (8.7%) could not be categorized as either generic or specific (for either sex or strain, or a unique sex/strain combination). Among the 82 proteins that showed sex specificity, either across strains (23 proteins) or as part of a unique sex/strain combination (59 proteins), the vast majority (89.0%) was found in female samples. For VOCs, however, the opposite picture emerged. Here, 52 of 81 sex-specific compounds (64.2%) were selectively detected in male samples. Together, chemical profiling revealed (i) that large fractions of urine content are shared among both laboratory and wild mice; (ii) that roughly one-third of urinary VOCs and one-fourth of proteins are exclusively found in a given sex/strain combination; and (iii) that male and female mice might have adopted different chemical secretion strategies to signal their sex.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Chemical profiling of urine content identifies unique sex- and strain-specific molecular fingerprints.</title><p>(<bold>a, b</bold>) Matrix layout for all intersections of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) (<bold>a</bold>) and proteins (<bold>b</bold>) among the six sex/strain combinations, sorted by size.

variables (i.e. molecules) for sex or strain classification. Training Random Forest classifiers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Breiman, 2001</xref>), we obtained feature significance scores, the ‘Gini importance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Breiman, 2001</xref>), that provide relative relevance rankings of the individual variables. Here, we list the 20 most informative VOCs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) and proteins that discriminate sex and strain, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a and b</xref>), along with the abundance of the corresponding top 5 molecules (VOCs or proteins) for each of the six sex/strain combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c–f</xref>). Notably, major urinary protein 20 (Mup20/darcin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Roberts et al., 2010</xref>), fatty acid-binding protein 5 (Fabp5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Furuhashi and Hotamisligil, 2008</xref>), and <italic>N</italic>-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase (Galns) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hori et al., 1995</xref>) exhibit substantial power to discriminate sex across strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b and f</xref>). While Mup20 and Galns are considerably more abundant in male urine, Fabp5 appears to be specific for female samples. Strain discrimination, on the other hand, is optimal with protein-tyrosine kinase 2-beta (Ptk2b) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lev et al., 1995</xref>), RNase T2 (Rnaset2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Thorn et al., 2012</xref>), prosaposin (Psap) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">O’Brien and Kishimoto, 1991</xref>), lymphocyte antigen 6A-2/6E-1 (Ly6a) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">van de Rijn et al., 1989</xref>), and superoxide dismutase 1 (Sod1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McCord and Fridovich, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b and d</xref>). Specifically, Ptk2b is detected exclusively in C57BL/6 mice. Ly6a is absent in BALB/c animals, whereas Rnaset2 is largely missing in both C57BL/6 and wild mice. With proteins exhibiting stronger discriminative power than VOCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c–h</xref>), future studies will have to focus on these proteins to identify potential functions as vomeronasal chemosignals.</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>List of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that – according to Random Forest classification and resulting Gini importance scores – display the most discriminative power to classify samples by sex (top; related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>) or strain (bottom; related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>).</title><p>As for several compounds listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, many VOCs that display high relative rankings of individual variable relevance are common metabolites.

However, individual variability in protein and VOC content was significantly higher in wild mice than in both laboratory strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>). We confirmed secretion of previously reported putative semiochemicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hurst et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kaur et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leinders-Zufall et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Novotny, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roberts et al., 2012</xref>), including both VOCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b</xref>) and proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2c</xref>) in both wild and laboratory mice. Notably, however, all Mups (including Mup20) and most such VOCs were found in samples from either sex, albeit at male-biased concentrations for Mup3, Mup17, and Mup20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2c</xref>). The only compounds showing male-specific secretion are 2-sec-butyl-4,5-dihydrothiazole and farnesenes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b</xref>), which have previously been implicated as facilitators of female mouse puberty acceleration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Novotny, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Notably, we find a rich repertoire of 27 lipocalins in mouse urine. When based exclusively on lipocalin content, hierarchical clustering groups individual samples into a set of clusters that, with very few exceptions (5 out of 60), correspond to the six sex/strain combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). This finding, therefore, demonstrates the power of urinary lipocalins for potential chemosensory discrimination of sex and/or strain.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>VSNs are more selective for strain than for sex</title><p>Next, we challenged neurons with stimulus pairs from two same-sex/different-strain combinations and asked whether VSN response profiles reflect the molecular fingerprint of corresponding urine samples (e.g. male C57BL/6 <italic>versus</italic> male BALB/c; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). We analyzed a total of 17,416 K<sup>+</sup>-sensitive VSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a–f</xref>). Again, we distinguished between specialist VSNs that responded exclusively to one stimulus, and generalists, which responded to both stimuli. Along the same lines, we categorized either strain-specific or broadly detected VOCs and proteins. Several conclusions emerge from these classifications: (i) With one exception (i.e. upon stimulation with male C57BL/6 <italic>versus</italic> wild stimuli; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), roughly half of all urine-sensitive VSNs are generalists – a result consistent with our finding that generally ~50% of urine molecules are shared among compared strains. Accordingly, the fraction of strain-selective (specialist) responses is considerably larger than observed for sex-specific responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). (ii) In female urine, BALB/c-specific proteins are substantially underrepresented, a fact not reflected by VSN response profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d and f</xref>). (iii) Surprisingly, the amount of strain-specific molecules in wild mouse urine does not vastly exceed that in inbred strains; and (iv) accordingly, selective VSN responses to wild stimuli are by no means more common (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b, c, e, and f</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Selective vomeronasal sensory neuron (VSN) response profiles upon stimulation with strain-specific signatures.</title><p>Quantitative comparison between VSN responses to paired stimuli and their respective chemical signatures.

For sex-dependent cues, as mentioned above, this could indicate that semiochemical concentration differences carry only limited information. Next, we therefore asked whether strain-specific concentration differences between urine samples exist and, if so, whether such differences can convey information about strain. In total, we recorded strain-independent generalist responses from 3366 VSNs in male C57BL/6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In all but one experimental condition (i.e. when comparing male stimuli from BALB/c <italic>versus</italic> wild mice), response preference indices were normally distributed and well fit by relatively narrow Gaussian curves that centered around zero. By contrast, chemical analysis revealed that many compounds identified in urine from both strains differ substantially in concentration. For proteins, in particular, strong concentration disparities exist in all strain combinations analyzed. In both male and female samples, concentrations of common proteins are relatively low in C57BL/6, moderate in BALB/c, and high in wild animals. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, this concentration bias toward wild proteins does not translate into any dramatic overrepresentation of proteins selectively found in wild male and/or female urine. In fact, the massively skewed distributions of protein concentration indices are not reflected by generalist VSN profiles. The latter better match VOC concentration distributions, which generally display broad, yet Gaussian shapes. We conclude that VSN population response strength might not be so strongly affected by strain-dependent concentration differences among common urinary proteins. In that case, it would appear somewhat unlikely that individual VSN activity provides fine-tuned information about distinct semiochemical concentrations. Alternatively, as some (or even many) of the identified proteins could not serve as vomeronasal ligands at all, generalist VSNs might sample information from only a subset of compounds which, in fact, are secreted at roughly similar concentrations.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Strain-dependent concentration imbalances exert relatively mild effects on vomeronasal sensory neuron (VSN) population response homogeneity.</title><p>Comparison of male C57BL/6 generalist VSN response preferences, upon stimulation with paired urine stimuli from different strains, with strain-dependent concentration imbalances among volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and proteins, respectively.

An important question, of course, is whether the response profiles we observed are themselves recipient strain-dependent. Thus, we next aimed to assess the extent to which our findings generalize to VSN populations from another laboratory animal strain. We therefore repeated all six pairwise same-sex/different-strain stimulation experiments, using acute VNO slices from male BALB/c mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Categorization as generalist or specialist VSNs revealed that proportions differed significantly between VSNs from BALB/c <italic>versus</italic> C57BL/6 mice, albeit at varying degrees. Similar to C57BL/6 neurons, selectivity of BALB/c neurons to wild-derived stimuli was rather rare. In fact, (i) compared to an average specialist rate of 11.2% ± 6.6% (mean ± SD) calculated over all 13 binary stimulus pairs (n=26 specialist types), we observed only few specialist responses upon stimulation with urine from wild females (2% and 3%, respectively), and (ii) we found comparatively few generalist signals when wild-derived female urine was among the paired stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e and f</xref>). This striking insensitivity is not observed in VSNs from C57BL/6 mice, suggesting substantial differences in VR expression between the two inbred laboratory strains. Notably, we can rule out that the observed differences result from differential sampling along the VNO’s anterior-to-posterior axis since, for each experiment, we routinely sample and average across slices cut along the organ’s entire anterior-to-posterior length (see Materials and methods).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Vomeronasal representation of female semiochemicals differs between inbred strains.</title><p>Comparison of vomeronasal sensory neuron (VSN) response profiles between male BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice.

In total, we recorded generalist responses from 1741 BALB/c neurons. When plotting response preference indices, we noticed less homogeneous distributions than previously observed in C57BL/6 mice. Five of the six histograms showed multiple peaks and thus could not be fitted by a single Gaussian, whereas the only histogram adhering to a normal distribution was comparatively broad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>). As observed in C57BL/6 neurons, the skewed distributions of protein concentration indices were not reflected by BALB/c generalist VSN profiles. Comparison of generalist VSN response histograms between BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1c and d</xref>) revealed strong and consistent differences upon stimulation with female stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1d</xref>). While single Gaussians around zero characterize C57BL/6 generalist distributions upon stimulation with female stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1d</xref>), several prominent peaks emerged when fitting histograms derived from BALB/c VSNs. Notably, for some generalist BALB/c neurons, wild-derived female stimuli are less potent than their inbred strain counterparts. This finding either indicates reduced concentrations of the corresponding molecules in wild urine (rendering most proteins unlikely candidates; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a and b</xref>), or suggests some yet to be determined form of cooperativity upon receptor-ligand interaction. Together, for both generalist and specialist VSNs, vomeronasal representation of female semiochemicals differs considerably between the two inbred mouse strains.</p><p>In the present study, we have established a robust VSN activity assay that allows pairwise comparison of neural selectivity and response strength upon stimulation with chemically defined natural stimuli. In-depth chemical analysis of sex- and strain-specific individual urine samples revealed that (i) large fractions of urine content are shared among mice of all sex/strain combinations; (ii) the amount of molecules selectively found in wild mouse urine does not dramatically exceed the urinary secretome of inbred strains; (iii) across strains, female-specific proteins vastly outnumber the male-specific variety, while (iv) overall protein concentration is substantially enriched in male urine; (v) concentrations of common proteins are relatively low in C57BL/6, moderate in BALB/c, and high in wild animals; (vi) both secreted VOC and protein profiles provide sufficient information to distinguish sex, strain, or both; and (vii) the rich urinary lipocalin repertoire alone might allow chemosensory discrimination of sex and/or strain.</p><p>When asking how much of this chemical information is accessible to inbred male mice via vomeronasal sampling, we observe that (i) VSN population response profiles do not reflect the global molecular content of urine, suggesting that the VNO functions as a rather selective molecular detector; (ii) selective VSN responses to wild stimuli are by no means more common (in fact, selectivity to wild-derived stimuli is rather rare); (iii) VSN generalist signal strength is unlikely to encode semiochemical concentrations across the entire range of compounds; (iv) male BALB/c neurons display striking insensitivity when challenged with urine from wild females; and, thus, (v) vomeronasal representation of female semiochemicals differs considerably between inbred strains.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Urine is the primary source of social chemosignals among mice (and, in fact, many other mammals) and contains both ‘fixed’ (i.e. genomic) information about strain, sex, individual identity, genetic histocompatibility and background, as well as ‘variable’ (i.e. metabolic) information on current social, reproductive, and health status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hurst, 2005</xref>). The ability to glean ethologically meaningful information from chemosensory sampling of urine (or any conspecific bodily secretion) depends on (i) the specific (semio)chemical composition of a urine sample, and (ii) the sensory apparatus used for sampling. For most mammals, the VNO is the key chemosensory structure involved in detecting conspecific chemical cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mohrhardt et al., 2018</xref>). The virtually universal use of inbred laboratory mice in research aimed at understanding VNO physiology – as both the donors of stimuli and the experimental subjects employed in these studies – could have resulted in misconceptions and biased notions about vomeronasal signaling and, thus, conspecific chemical communication. If that were the case, one might question the relevance and ethological validity of conclusions drawn from a large body of work using inbred secretions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bansal et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we addressed this issue from both a chemical ecology and a physiological perspective. In-depth comparative molecular profiling of urine from two classical laboratory strains as well as wild mice reveals several shared features, but also qualitative and quantitative differences in composition. Furthermore, we observe substantial differences in vomeronasal representations of stimuli between C57BL/6 and BALB/c sensory neuron populations.</p><p>For analytical purposes, we separate the urinary ‘volatilome’ and proteome. In chemosensory research, this distinction has often been conceptualized as general (i.e. airborne) odors, which activate the main olfactory system, <italic>versus</italic> vomeronasal stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mucignat-Caretta et al., 2012</xref>). This notion, however, is misleading since organic compounds with low molecular weight and high vapor pressure (i.e. VOCs) in bodily secretions do not instantly evaporate, of course. Rather, they are readily accessible for vomeronasal sampling upon direct contact during investigatory behavior. Notably, our chemical profiling approach omits (sulfated) steroids, other non-volatile small organic molecules, which have previously been identified in mouse urine as VSN stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nodari et al., 2008</xref>). Caution should thus be exerted to not attempt to fully explain VSN response specificity based on VOC and protein content alone.</p><p>For both urinary VOCs and proteins, large fractions are shared among both male and female mice of either genetic background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a and b</xref>). Such compounds could be considered generic (mouse) urine components and might not even serve any chemosensory signaling functions. Notably, both the urinary volatilome and proteome on their own, each entail sufficient information to discern an individual’s sex and strain, with protein content exhibiting stronger discriminative power. The protein that is most informative for discriminating between sexes is, perhaps not surprisingly, Mup20 (darcin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Roberts et al., 2010</xref>). This well-described ‘maleness signal’ had previously been reported to elicit innate attraction and generate a conditioned place preference in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Demir et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roberts et al., 2012</xref>), whereas, in males, Mup20 promotes aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kaur et al., 2014</xref>). Chemosensory roles of the second and third best protein determinants of sex discrimination are basically unexplored. Fabp5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Furuhashi and Hotamisligil, 2008</xref>) and Galns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hori et al., 1995</xref>) are substantially enriched in female and male urine, respectively. Fatty acid-binding proteins, including Fabp5, are evolutionary conserved intracellular lipid chaperones that coordinate cellular lipid trafficking and signaling and are thus linked to metabolic and inflammatory pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Furuhashi and Hotamisligil, 2008</xref>). <italic>N</italic>-Acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase (Galns) on the other hand is a lysosomal hydrolase. Five urinary proteins – Ptk2b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lev et al., 1995</xref>), Rnaset2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Thorn et al., 2012</xref>), Psap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">O’Brien and Kishimoto, 1991</xref>), Ly6a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">van de Rijn et al., 1989</xref>), and Sod1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McCord and Fridovich, 1969</xref>) – display pronounced strain-dependent differences in concentration. None of these have previously been attributed a chemosensory function. Challenging the mouse VNO with purified recombinant protein(s) will help elucidate whether such functions exist.</p><p>Proteomic profiling revealed three additional, rather unexpected findings: First, while male urine contains much higher protein concentrations, females of a given strain secrete a larger variety of proteins (including MUPs). In fact, we do not find a single protein that is exclusively detected in males across strains. By contrast, 23 urinary proteins, while present in all three strains, are found only in females. In line with these observations, only one additional Mup (i.e. Mup21) made the list of the 20 most informative proteins that discriminate sex. In general, our data provide little evidence for a sparse molecular code of (fe)maleness. Rather, the concept of ‘signature mixtures’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ben-Shaul, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kahan and Ben-Shaul, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stopková et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wyatt, 2017</xref>), which emphasizes a combinatorial ratio code instead of mere presence/absence phenomena, gains traction. Second, we identify a surprisingly rich lipocalin repertoire in urine, which alone could allow chemosensory discrimination of sex/strain combinations. Within a total of 27 lipocalins, individual patterns allow hierarchical clustering into sex/strain-specific groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). These data, thus, support the notion that the lipocalin ‘code’, if relevant, is combinatorial. Third, regarding its molecular spectrum, the urinary ‘secretome’ in wild mice does not differ dramatically from the repertoire found in laboratory strains. To paraphrase this generally reassuring conclusion: while inbreeding could have dramatically modified the nature of chemical secretions and, consequently, their perception by other mice, inbred chemostimuli are largely representative of (potentially) ethologically more relevant wild chemosignals. Notably, however, while mean VOC and protein concentrations show similar distributions across sex/strain combinations, individual variability is strongly increased in wild mouse urine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>). Accordingly, this finding confirms previous reports of increased individual variation in wild mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beynon et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheetham et al., 2009</xref>). Another inherent factor that could account for differences in urine secretions among each of the groups, and particularly for comparisons between inbred and wild stimuli, is the microbiome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bansal et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moudra et al., 2021</xref>). Yet, we stress that all urine donors were housed in the same facility and fed with the same diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bansal et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Some limitations of our study need to be acknowledged. Regarding stimuli, the six secretion sets we used do not cover the entire coding capacity of the accessory olfactory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Isogai et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, for VSN response profiling, stimulus samples were pooled across 10 individuals in each of the 6 sex/strain categories. While pooling stimuli reduces individual variability across samples (e.g. regarding fluctuating physiological states), relevant stimulus aspects could be masked. Thus, given the increased chemical variability we observed among individual wild urine samples, pooling might obscure distinctive molecular features of wild mouse secretions. The same holds true for estrus cycle-dependent female stimuli. Because we did not monitor the estrus stage of female urine donors, mixes likely contain samples across the entire cycle. This is relevant as VSN responses may be affected by a donor’s cycle stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bansal et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cichy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Uchida et al., 2014</xref>). Another limitation stems from the use of male inbred mice as experimental subjects. The rationale behind this experimental strategy is to allow for comparisons with our previous study on AOB response profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bansal et al., 2021</xref>), which used the exact same settings (see below). Nonetheless, future efforts will have to reveal (i) whether our main findings apply to female recipients; and (ii) if our observations generalize to other inbred, outbred, or wild mouse strains. As we recently declared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bansal et al., 2021</xref>), the latter considerations underscore the importance of recording from wild recipients. While this endeavor presents significant practical challenges, it remains an important goal for future studies.</p><p>A surprising, but overall reassuring observation is that responses to wild and inbred stimuli are qualitatively similar. Strikingly, and somewhat counterintuitively, selective VSN responses to wild stimuli are rather rare. This does not result from a generally reduced compound content in wild urine as molecular profiling revealed comparably rich chemical portfolios in wild and inbred samples alike. Rather, we speculate that inbreeding over hundreds of generations in laboratory settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Phifer-Rixey and Nachman, 2015</xref>) has resulted in ‘microevolutionary’ pressure to maintain sensitivity to signals from same- or similar-strain individuals. Indeed, compared to the C57BL/6 reference genome, genetic variability within VR repertoires is massively increased among wild-derived mice (particularly of the <italic>M. musculus</italic> subspecies) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wynn et al., 2012</xref>). Among the approximately 200 orthologous receptor genes compared, BALB/c genes display 184 non-synonymous and just one private (i.e. unique to a given strain) single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). By contrast, VR genes of the wild-derived <italic>M. musculus</italic> PWK/PhJ strain show 789 non-synonymous SNPs and 508 private SNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wynn et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Initially, we asked whether VSN response profiles reflect the global molecular content of urine or, by contrast, if the VNO serves as a rather selective semiochemical detector. Our findings support a high level of selectivity. When challenged with same-sex/different-strain stimuli, large VSN fractions selectively respond to just one stimulus. Intriguingly, this fraction of strain-selective specialists is considerably larger than observed for sex-specific responses. In line with the notion of highly selective vomeronasal sampling is our observation that the concentration differences between compounds shared among strains, which are often substantial, are not reflected by similarly pronounced differences in response strength among generalist VSNs. There are several, not necessarily mutually exclusive explanations for this finding: First, concentration could simply not be a read-out parameter for VSNs, which would support previous ideas of concentration-invariant VSN activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leinders-Zufall et al., 2000</xref>). Second, the concentrations in freshly released urine could just exceed the dynamic tuning range of VSNs since, particularly for VOCs, natural signals (e.g. in scent marks) must be accessible to a recipient for a prolonged amount of time (sometimes days). A similar rationale could explain the increased protein concentrations in male urine, since male mice use scent marking to establish and maintain their territories and urinary lipocalins serve as long-lasting reservoirs of VOCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hurst et al., 1998</xref>). Third, generalist VSNs might sample information only from a select subset of urinary compounds, which, given their role as biologically relevant chemosignals, might be released at tightly controlled (and thus similar) concentrations. In fact, in the most extreme scenario, several compounds that do display substantial strain- and/or sex-specific differences in concentration might not act as chemosignals at all. Forth, to some extent, different response profiles could be attributed to non-volatile small organic molecules such as steroids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nodari et al., 2008</xref>), which were beyond the focus of our chemical analysis.</p><p>While, compared to wild-derived mice, the genetic differences in VR repertoires between C57BL/6 and BALB/c animals appear rather modest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wynn et al., 2012</xref>) (see above), vomeronasal representation of female semiochemicals differs considerably between both inbred strains. We conclude that, even in closely related inbred mice, strain-to-strain VR variation must be prominent, an idea supported by various reports of differences in genetic VR makeup across strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lilue et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miller et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Park et al., 2011</xref>). With monoallelic VR expression and 184 described non-synonymous SNPs between C57BL/6 and BALB/c receptor genes, it is likely that even individuals of the same strain express functionally different arrays of VSNs. Adding another layer of complexity, state- and experience-dependent changes in VSN sensitivity have recently been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Xu et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>By adopting the same experimental design (i.e. using the same sets of stimuli in male C57BL/6 <italic>versus</italic> BALB/c mice) in both this study on VSN response profiles and our previous analysis of sensory representations in the AOB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bansal et al., 2021</xref>), we provide a unique comparative perspective on signal transformation along the initial processing nodes of the accessory olfactory pathway. We observe several differences in representations of ethologically relevant urine stimuli between the VNO and AOB. Notably, while stimulus representations across the two inbred recipient strains were very similar in AOB recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bansal et al., 2021</xref>), we here observe clear differences in VSN activity, particular upon stimulation with female stimuli. Moreover, a substantial fraction of AOB neurons were selective to wild rather than inbred stimuli, whereas relatively few VSNs showed such selectivity. Consistent with the elaborate wiring patterns within the AOB, these observations imply the presence of non-trivial transformations between VSN and AOB representations. Understanding the exact nature, purpose, and neuronal substrates of these transformations remains an important topic for future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All animal procedures were approved by local authorities at RWTH Aachen University, were performed in accordance with local Animal Care and Use Committees’ regulations, and in compliance with European Union legislation (Directive 2010/63/EU) and recommendations by the Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations.

For each experiment, we routinely prepared VNO slices along the organ’s entire anterior-to-posterior axis (not including the most anterior tip, where the VNO lumen tapers into the vomeronasal duct, and the most posterior part, the lumen ‘‘twists’’ toward the ventral aspect and its volume decreases; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hamacher et al., 2024</xref>). This usually yields ~7 slices per individual experiment/session. Therefore, we routinely sample and average across the entire VNO anterior-to-posterior axis for each experiment. Slices were transferred to a submerged, chilled, and oxygenated storage chamber with circulating <bold>S<sub>2</sub></bold> until use.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging</title><p>In vitro imaging of VSN activity in acute coronal VNO slices was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wong et al., 2018</xref>).

Individual numbers of cells/experiments (n) are denoted in figures and/or captions. Since, for each experiment, we prepare slices along the VNO’s anterior-to-posterior axis (see above), we routinely sample and average across the entire VNO anterior-to-posterior axis for each experiment. Data were analyzed offline using Leica LAS AF 2.4 (Leica Microsystems), ImageJ 1.51n (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health, USA), MATLAB R2017b (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA), and Excel (Microsoft, Seattle, WA, USA) software. If not stated otherwise, results are presented as box-and-whisker plots, where boxes represent the first-to-third quartiles and whiskers represent the 10th and 90th percentiles, respectively. Outliers (1.5 IQR) are plotted individually. The central band represents the population median (P<sub>0.5</sub>). Statistical analyses were performed using unpaired t-tests, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, and two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests (as dictated by data distribution and experimental design). Tests and corresponding p-values that report statistical significance (≤0.05) are individually specified in figure captions.</p><p>For individual cell analysis, regions-of-interest were defined to outline essentially all depolarization-sensitive (<bold>S<sub>3</sub></bold>) somata per field of view, based on DIC imaging of cell morphology at rest. After movement correction (StackReg/Rigid Body transformation plugin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Thévenaz et al., 1998</xref>] in ImageJ) of time-lapse image stacks, changes in relative fluorescence intensity were calculated as ΔF/F and measured in arbitrary units. Neurons were classified as ‘responsive’ when showing stimulus-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations in somata according to the following three criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fluegge et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wong et al., 2018</xref>): (i) exposure to high extracellular K<sup>+</sup> concentrations (50 mM; <bold>S<sub>3</sub></bold>) induced a robust Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient; (ii) for at least one stimulation with diluted urine, a transient increase in fluorescence intensity was observed during the stimulation period; and (iii) the signal peak intensity exceeded the average prestimulation baseline intensity plus two standard deviations for a continuous period of at least 3 s (I<sub>resp</sub> &gt;I<sub>baseline</sub> + 2 × SD(I<sub>baseline</sub>)). All responses were normalized to positive controls (i.e. responses evoked by elevated extracellular K<sup>+</sup>).

First, we performed sPLS-DA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rohart et al., 2017</xref>) to detect potential sources of variation in quantile normalized datasets. Next, for pairwise comparisons, data reduction eliminated all table entries (rows) if a given metabolite or protein was detected only in ≤3 individuals in both groups. However, if a compound was found in samples from ≥4 individuals in a group (e.g. in males or females), we included the full table entry (row). Accordingly, a chemical is considered ‘unique’/group-specific if found in ≥4 individual samples from one group, but is missing in all 10 samples of the other group. For calculation of sexual dimorphism, we used the power law global error model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pavelka et al., 2004</xref>) to detect differentially expressed/abundant proteins and VOCs. To detect the importance of significant molecules in discriminating either sex or strain, we used a machine learning technique – Random Forest for Classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Breiman, 2001</xref>) (implemented in R software) – and inferred feature importance scores (Gini importance; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Breiman, 2001</xref>) that provide relative rankings of individual variable relevance. nLC-MS/MS proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Perez-Riverol et al., 2022</xref>) partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD042324.

The authors performed live Ca2+ imaging (CAL520 dye) of VSNs in acute vomeronasal organ (VNO) slices to determine how VSNs are tuned to pairs of stimuli that differ in their origin (e.g. male C57BL/6 versus male BALB/c urine, male C57BL/6 versus female C57BL/6, etc.). For each pair of tested odorants, the results measure the proportion of VSNs that respond to both stimuli (&quot;generalists&quot;) or just one of the two (&quot;specialists&quot;), as well as metrics of tuning preference and response reliability. The authors find in most cases that generalists make up a larger proportion of responsive VSNs than specialists, but several pairwise comparisons showed a high degree of strain selectivity. Notably, the authors evaluated VSN tuning in both male C57BL/6 and male BALB/c VNOs, finding strain-dependent differences in the representation of mouse urine. Alongside these measurements of VSN tuning, the authors report results of mass spectrometry analyses of volatiles and proteins in the same urine samples. These analyses indicated a number of molecules in each category that vary across sex and strain, and therefore represent candidate vomeronasal ligands. However, this study did not directly test whether any of these candidate molecules drives VSN activity. Overall, this work provides solid information related to mouse vomeronasal chemosensation.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>A strength of the current study is its focus on characterizing the neural responses of the VNO to urine derived from wild mice. The majority of existing vomeronasal system research has relied on the use of inbred strains for both neural response recordings and investigations of candidate vomeronasal system ligands. Inbreeding in laboratory environments may alter the chemical composition of bodily secretions, thereby potentially changing the information they contain. Moreover, the more homogeneous nature of inbred strains could be critical when studying the AOS mediated social aspects. If there exist noticeable differences in the chemical composition of secretions from wild animals compared to inbred strains, this would suggest that future research must consider natural sources of candidate ligands outside of inbred strains. This work identifies some intriguing differences, worthy of further exploration, between the urine composition of wild mice versus inbred mice, as well as disparities in how the VNO responds to urine from these different sources. However, the molecular composition and VNO responsiveness to wild mouse urine was found to be highly overlapping with inbred mouse urine, supporting the continued investigation of candidate ligands found in inbred mouse urine.</p><p>Another positive aspect of this work is its use of the same set of stimuli as a previous study by the same authors (Bansal et al., 2021) in the downstream accessory olfactory bulb. The consistency in stimulus selection facilitates a comparison of information processing of sex and strain information from the sensory periphery to the brain. Although comparisons between the two connected regions are not a focus of this work, and methodological differences (e.g., Ca2+ imaging versus electrophysiology) may introduce caveats into comparisons, the support of &quot;apples to apples&quot; comparisons across connected circuits is critical to progress in the field.</p><p>Finally, this study directly measured VSN tuning in both male C57BL/6 and male BALB/c VNOs, finding subtle but important differences in the representation of mouse urine in these two recipient strains. Given that there is a long history of behavioral research into strain-specific differences in social behavior, this research paves the way for future studies into how different mouse strains detect and process social chemosignals.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>One of the primary objectives in this study is to ascertain the extent to which the response profiles of VSNs are specific to sex and strain. The design of these Ca2+ imaging experiments uses a simple stimulus design, using two interleaved bouts of stimulation with pairs of urine (e.g., male versus female C57BL/6, male C57BL/6 versus male BALB/c) at a single dilution factor (1:100). This introduces two significant limitations: (1) the &quot;generalist&quot; versus &quot;specialist&quot; descriptors pertain only to the specific pairwise comparisons made and (2) there is no information about the sensitivity/concentration-dependence of the responses.</p><p>The functional measurements of VSN tuning to various pairs of urine stimuli are presented alongside mass spectrometry-based comparisons. However, the mass spectrometry-based analysis was performed separately from VSN tuning experiments/analysis. The juxtaposition of these measurements may give some readers the impression that VSN tuning measurements were integrated with molecular profiling (i.e., that the molecular diversity was causally related physiological responses). This is a hypothesis raised by the parallel studies, but not a supported conclusion of the current work.</p><p>The impact of mass spectrometry findings is acknowledged to be limited to nonvolatile organic compounds and proteins/peptides, and that it is possible that few of these candidate molecules are active in the VNO. Moreover, it remains possible that the VSN responses are driven mostly by small nonvolatiles (e.g., polar steroids), a class of strong VSN ligands that were excluded from molecular analysis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.90529.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Nagel</surname><given-names>Maximilian</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>RWTH Aachen University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Aachen</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Niestroj</surname><given-names>Marco</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>RWTH Aachen University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Aachen</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bansal</surname><given-names>Rohini</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>The Hebrew University of Jerusalem</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Jerusalem</named-content></addr-line><country>Israel</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Fleck</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>RWTH Aachen University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Aachen</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lampert</surname><given-names>Angelika</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Neurophysiology, Uniklinik RWTH Aachen</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Aachen</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Stopkova</surname><given-names>Romana</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Charles University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Prague</named-content></addr-line><country>Czech Republic</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Stopka</surname><given-names>Pavel</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Charles University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Prague</named-content></addr-line><country>Czech Republic</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ben-Shaul</surname><given-names>Yoram</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>The Hebrew University of Jerusalem</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Jerusalem</named-content></addr-line><country>Israel</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Spehr</surname><given-names>Marc</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>RWTH Aachen University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Aachen</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><p>General comments</p><p>All three experts have raised excellent ideas and made important suggestions to extend the scope of our study and provide additional information. While we fully acknowledge that these points are valid and would provide exciting new knowledge, we also should not lose track of the fact that a single study cannot cover all bases. Sulfated steroids, for example, are clearly essential components of mouse urine. Unfortunately, however, all chemical analysis approaches are limited and the one we opted for is not suitable for analysis of such signaling molecules. Future studies should certainly focus on these aspects. The same holds true for the fact that we do not know which of the identified compounds are actually VSN ligands. These are inherent limitations of the approach, and we are not claiming otherwise.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>(1) In this manuscript, Nagel et al. sought to comprehensively characterize the composition of urinary compounds, some of which are putative chemosignals.

In addition, the authors found that the patterns of vomeronasal neuron response to urinary cues are not identical when measured using different recipient strains. This fascinating finding, however, requires an additional control to exclude the possibility that this is not due to sampling error.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer 1 for pointing this out. We agree that this is truly a “fascinating finding.” Reviewer 1 emphasizes that we need to add an “additional control to exclude […] that this is not due to sampling error”, and he / she elaborates on the required control in his / her Recommendations For The Authors (see below). Reviewer 1 states that “for Fig. 5, in order to conclude that the same urine activates a different population of VSNs in two different strains, a critical control is needed to demonstrate that this is not due to the sampling variability - as compositions of V1Rs and V2Rs could vary between different slices, one preferred control is to use VNO slices from the same strain and compare the selectivity used here across the A-P axis.” Importantly, we believe that this is already controlled for. In fact, for each experiment, we routinely prepare VNO slices along the organ’s entire anterior-to-posterior axis (not including the most anterior tip, where the VNO lumen tapers into the vomeronasal duct, and the most posterior part, the lumen ‘‘twists’’ toward the ventral aspect and its volume decreases (see Figs. 7 &amp; S7 in Hamacher et al., 2024, Current Biology)). This usually yields ~7 slices per individual experiment / session. Therefore, we routinely sample and average across the entire VNO anterior-to-posterior axis for each experiment. In Fig. 5, in which we analyzed whether the “same urine activates a different population of VSNs in two different strains”, individual independent experiments from each strain (C57BL/6 versus BALB/c) amounted to (a) n = 6 versus n = 8; (b) n = 10 versus n = 10; (c) n = 7 versus n = 9; (d) n = 9 versus n = 10; (e) n = 10 versus n = 9; and (f) n = 12 versus n = 10. Together, we conclude that it is very unlikely that the considerably different response profiles measured in different recipient strains result from a “sampling error.”</p><p>To clarify this point in the revised manuscript, we now explain our sampling routine in more detail in the Materials and Methods. Moreover, we now also refer to this point in the Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) There are several weaknesses in this manuscript, including the lack of analysis of the compositions of sulfated steroids and other steroids, which have been proposed to be the major constituents of vomeronasal ligands in urines and the indirect (correlational) nature of their mass spectrometry data and activity data.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer 1 is correct to point out that our chemical profiling approach omits (sulfated) steroids. We are aware of this weakness. We deliberately decided to omit steroids as well as other nonvolatile small organic molecules for three main reasons: (i) as the reviewer points out, (sulfated) steroid composition has been the focus of analysis in several previous studies and there is ample published information available on their role as VSN stimuli; (ii) the analytical tools available to us do not allow comprehensive profiling of non-volatile small organic molecules; employing two-dimensional head-space GC-MS as well as LC-MS/MS is not suitable for steroid detection; and (iii) the relatively small sample volumes forced us to prioritize and focus on specific chemical classes (in our case, VOCs and proteins). We made an effort to use of the exact same stimuli as previously employed to investigate sensory representations in the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) (Bansal et al., 2021), a feature that we consider a strength of the current study. However, this entailed that we had to effectively split our samples, further reducing the available sample volume.</p><p>We acknowledge that we did not sufficiently describe our rationale for focusing on VOCs and proteins on the previous version of the manuscript (nor did we discuss the known role of (sulfated) steroids in VSN signaling in adequate detail). We have now made an effort to address these shortcomings in the revised manuscript. Specifically, we have added new text to the Introduction (“Prominent molecularly identified VSN stimuli include various sulfated steroids (Celsi et al., 2012; Fu et al., 2015; Haga-Yamanaka et al., 2015, 2014; Isogai et al., 2011; Nodari et al., 2008; Turaga and Holy, 2012), which could reflect the dynamic endocrine state of an individual.”) and the Discussion (“Notably, our chemical profiling approach omits (sulfated) steroids other non-volatile small organic molecules, which have previously been identified in mouse urine as VSN stimuli (Nodari et al., 2008). Caution should thus be exerted to not attempt to fully explain VSN response specificity based on VOC and protein content alone.” &amp; “In line with the notion of highly selective vomeronasal sampling is our observation that the concentration differences between compounds shared among strains, which are often substantial, are not reflected by similarly pronounced differences in response strength among generalist VSNs. There are several, not necessarily mutually exclusive explanations for this finding: First, concentration could simply not be a read-out parameter for VSNs, which would support previous ideas of concentration-invariant VSN activity (Leinders-Zufall et al., 2000). Second, the concentrations in freshly released urine could just exceed the dynamic tuning range of VSNs since, particularly for VOCs, natural signals (e.g., in scent marks) must be accessible to a recipient for a prolonged amount of time (sometimes days). A similar rationale could explain the increased protein concentrations in male urine, since male mice use scent marking to establish and maintain their territories and urinary lipocalins serve as long-lasting reservoirs of VOCs (Hurst et al., 1998). Third, generalist VSNs might sample information only from a select subset of urinary compounds, which, given their role as biologically relevant chemosignals, might be released at tightly controlled (and thus similar) concentrations. In fact, in the most extreme scenario, several compounds that do display substantial strain- and/or sex-specific differences in concentration might not act as chemosignals at all. Forth, to some extent, different response profiles could be attributed to non-volatile small organic molecules such as steroids (Nodari et al., 2008), which were beyond the focus of our chemical analysis.”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Overall, the major contribution of this work is the identification of specific molecules in mouse urines.

We concur and, in fact, stress this point many times throughout the manuscript. In the Results, for example, we point out (i) that “in female urine, BALB/c-specific proteins are substantially underrepresented, a fact not reflected by VSN response profiles”, (ii) that “as observed in C57BL/6 neurons, the skewed distributions of protein concentration indices were not reflected by BALB/c generalist VSN profiles”, and (iii) that “VSN population response profiles do not reflect the global molecular content of urine, suggesting that the VNO functions as a rather selective molecular detector.” Moreover, in the Discussion, we state (i) that “caution should thus be exerted to not attempt to fully explain VSN response specificity based on VOC and protein content alone”; (ii) that, for several sex- and/or strain-specific molecules, none “has previously been attributed a chemosensory function. Challenging the mouse VNO with purified recombinant protein(s) will help elucidate whether such functions exist”; (iii) that “generalist VSNs might sample information only from a select subset of urinary compounds, which, given their role as biologically relevant chemosignals, might be released at tightly controlled (and thus similar) concentrations”; and (iv) that “to some extent, different response profiles could be attributed to non-volatile small organic molecules such as steroids (Nodari et al., 2008), which were beyond the focus of our chemical analysis.”</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we now aim to even more strongly emphasize the point made by Reviewer 2. In the Discussion, we have deleted a sentence that read: “Sex- and strain-specific chemical profiles give rise to unique VSN activity patterns.” Moreover, we have added the following statement: “In fact, in the most extreme scenario, several compounds that do display substantial strain- and/or sex-specific differences in concentration might not act as chemosignals at all.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>(1) One of the primary objectives in this study is to ascertain the extent to which the response profiles of VSNs are specific to sex and strain.

He / she is correct to mention that characterizing a VSN as generalist or specialist based on a “pairwise comparison” should not be the basis of attributing such a “generalist” or “specialist” label in general (i.e., regarding the global stimulus space). We acknowledge this point, but we do not regard this as a limitation of our study since we are not investigating rather broad (i.e., multidimensional) questions of selectivity. All we are asking in the context of this study is whether VSNs - when being challenged with pairs of sex- or strain-specific urine samples - act as rather selective semiochemical detectors. Of course, one can always think of a study design that provides more information. However, we here opted for an assay that - in our hands - is robust, “low noise” (i.e., displays low intrinsic signal variability as evident form reliability index calculations), ensures recovery from VSN adaptation (Wong et al., 2018), and, importantly, answers the specific question we are asking.</p><p>Regarding the second point (“there is no information about the sensitivity/concentrationdependence of the responses”), we would like to emphasize that this was not a focus of our study either. In fact, concentration-dependence of VSN activity has been a major focus of several previous studies referenced in our manuscript (e.g., Leinders-Zufall et al., 2000; He et al., 2008), albeit with contradictory results. In our study, we ask whether a pair of stimuli that we have shown to display, in part, strikingly different chemical composition (both absolute and relative) preferentially activates the same or different VSNs. With this question in mind, we believe that our assay (and its results) are highly informative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The functional measurements of VSN tuning to various pairs of urine stimuli are consistently presented alongside mass spectrometry-based comparisons. Although it is clear from the manuscript text that the mass spectrometry-based analysis was separated from the VSN tuning experiments/analysis, the juxtaposition of VSN tuning measurements with independent molecular diversity measurements gives the appearance to readers that these experiments were integrated (i.e., that the diversity of ligands was underlying the diversity of physiological responses). This is a hypothesis raised by the parallel studies, not a supported conclusion of the work. This data presentation style risks confusing readers.</p></disp-quote><p>As Reviewer 3 points out correctly “it is clear from the manuscript text that the mass spectrometry-based analysis was separated from the VSN tuning experiments/analysis.” In the figures, we try make the distinction between VSN response statistics and chemical profiling more obvious by gray shadows that link the plots depicting VSN response characteristics to the general pie charts.</p><p>We now also made an extra effort to avoid “confusing readers” by stating in the Discussion (i) that “caution should thus be exerted to not attempt to fully explain VSN response specificity based on VOC and protein content alone”; (ii) that, for several sex- and/or strain-specific molecules, none “has previously been attributed a chemosensory function. Challenging the mouse VNO with purified recombinant protein(s) will help elucidate whether such functions exist”; (iii) that “generalist VSNs might sample information only from a select subset of urinary compounds, which, given their role as biologically relevant chemosignals, might be released at tightly controlled (and thus similar) concentrations”; and (iv) that “to some extent, different response profiles could be attributed to non-volatile small organic molecules such as steroids (Nodari et al., 2008), which were beyond the focus of our chemical analysis.” Moreover, we have deleted a sentence that read: “sex- and strain-specific chemical profiles give rise to unique VSN activity patterns”, and we have added the following statement: “In fact, in the most extreme scenario, several compounds that do display substantial strain- and/or sex-specific differences in concentration might not act as chemosignals at all.”</p><p>However, we believe that there is value in presenting “VSN tuning measurements” next to “independent molecular diversity measurements.” While these are independent measurements, their similarity or, quite frequently, lack thereof are informative.

It is possible that only a very small number of these ligands activate the VNO. The list of variably expressed proteins - especially several proteins that are preferentially found in female urine - is compelling, but, again, there is no evidence presented that indicates whether or not these candidate ligands drive VSN activity. It is noteworthy that the largest class of known natural ligands for VSNs are small nonvolatiles that are found at high levels in mouse urine. These molecules were almost certainly involved in driving VSN activity in the physiology assays (both &quot;generalist&quot; and &quot;specialist&quot;), but they are absent from the molecular analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer 3 is right, of course, that at this point we have not tested the identified molecules on VSNs. This is clearly beyond the scope of the present study. We believe that the data we present will be the basis of (several full-length) future studies that aim to identify specific ligands and - best case scenario - receptor-ligand pairs. We find it hard to concur that our study, which provides the necessary basis for those future endeavors, is regarded as “incomplete”. By design, all studies are somewhat incomplete, i.e., there are always remaining questions and we are not contesting that.</p><p>It is true, of course, that a class of “known natural ligands for VSNs are small nonvolatiles.” As we replied above, our chemical profiling approach omits (sulfated) steroids. We are aware of this weakness. We deliberately decided to omit steroids as well as other non-volatile small organic molecules for three main reasons: (i) steroid composition has been the focus of analysis in several previous studies and there is ample published information available on their role as VSN stimuli; (ii) the analytical tools available to us do not allow comprehensive profiling of non-volatile small organic molecules; employing two-dimensional head-space GC-MS as well as LC-MS/MS is not suitable for steroid detection; and (iii) the relatively small sample volumes forced us to prioritize and focus on specific chemical classes (in our case, VOCs and proteins). We made an effort to use of the exact same stimuli as previously employed to investigate sensory representations in the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) (Bansal et al., 2021), a fact that we consider a key strength of our current study.

Specifically, we have added new text to the Introduction (“Prominent molecularly identified VSN stimuli include various sulfated steroids (Celsi et al., 2012; Fu et al., 2015; Haga-Yamanaka et al., 2015, 2014; Isogai et al., 2011; Nodari et al., 2008; Turaga and Holy, 2012), which could reflect the dynamic endocrine state of an individual.”) and the Discussion (“Notably, our chemical profiling approach omits (sulfated) steroids other non-volatile small organic molecules, which have previously been identified in mouse urine as VSN stimuli (Nodari et al., 2008).

Second, the concentrations in freshly released urine could just exceed the dynamic tuning range of VSNs since, particularly for VOCs, natural signals (e.g., in scent marks) must be accessible to a recipient for a prolonged amount of time (sometimes days). A similar rationale could explain the increased protein concentrations in male urine, since male mice use scent marking to establish and maintain their territories and urinary lipocalins serve as long-lasting reservoirs of VOCs (Hurst et al., 1998). Third, generalist VSNs might sample information only from a select subset of urinary compounds, which, given their role as biologically relevant chemosignals, might be released at tightly controlled (and thus similar) concentrations.

Is this sufficient to capture the diversity of wild <italic>M. musculus</italic> in local (Prague) habitats?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. For the present study, 20 male (M) and 27 female (F) wild mice were caught at six different sites in the broader Prague area (i.e., Bohnice 50.13415N, 14.41421E; 2M+4F), Dolni Brezany (49.96321N, 14.4585E; 3M+4F), Hodkovice (49.97227N, 14.48039E; 5M+6F), Písnice (49.98988N, 14.46625E; 3M+6F), Lhota (49.95369N, 14.43087E; 1M+2F), and Zalepy (49.9532N, 14.40829E; 6M+5F). 18 of the 27 wild females were caught pregnant. The remaining 9 females were mated with males caught at the same site and produced offspring within a month. When selecting 10 male and 10 female individuals from first-generation offspring for urine collection, we ensured that all six capture sites were represented and that age-matched animals displayed similar weight (~17g). We believe that this capture / breeding strategy sufficiently represents “the diversity of wild <italic>M. musculus</italic> in local (Prague) habitats.” In the revised manuscript, we have now included these details in the Materials and Methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) I found Figure 1e and figures in a similar format confusing - one panel describes the response statistics of VSNs, and other panels show the number of compounds found in different MS profiling, which is not immediately obvious from the figures.

Moreover, we thank the Reviewer for pointing out the mislabeling of the y-axis. Accordingly, we have deleted “%” in all corresponding figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) For Figure 5, in order to conclude that the same urine activates a different population of VSNs in two different strains, a critical control is needed to demonstrate that this is not due to the sampling variability - as compositions of V1Rs and V2Rs could vary between different slices, one preferred control is to use VNO slices from the same strain and compare the selectivity used here across the A-P axis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer 1 for pointing this out. Importantly, we believe that this is already controlled for (see our response to the Public Review). In fact, for each experiment, we routinely prepare VNO slices along the entire anterior-to-posterior axis (not including the most anterior tip, where the VNO lumen tapers into the vomeronasal duct, and the most posterior part, the lumen ‘‘twists’’ toward the ventral aspect and its volume decreases see Figs. 7 &amp; S7 in Hamacher et al., 2024, Current Biology). This usually yields ~7 slices per individual experiment / session. Therefore, we routinely sample and average across the entire VNO anterior-to-posterior axis for each experiment. In Fig. 5, individual independent experiments from each strain (C57BL/6 versus BALB/c) amounted to (a) n = 6 versus n = 8; (b) n = 10 versus n = 10; (c) n = 7 versus n = 9; (d) n = 9 versus n = 10; (e) n = 10 versus n = 9; and (f) n = 12 versus n = 10. Together, we can thus exclude that the considerably different response profiles that we measured using different recipient strains result from a “sampling error.”</p><p>To clarify this point in the revised manuscript, we now explain our sampling routine in more detail in the Materials and Methods.
