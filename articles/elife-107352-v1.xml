as resting primordial follicles in the cortex. Wave 1 follicles are known to mostly undergo atresia, a fate sometimes associated with the persistence of steroidogenic theca cells, but this connection is poorly understood. We characterized wave 1 follicle biology using tissue clearing, lineage tracing, and scRNA-seq to clarify their contributions to offspring and steroidogenesis. Wave 1 follicles, lineage-marked by E16.5 <italic>Foxl2</italic> expression in granulosa cells, reach preantral stages containing theca cell layers by 2 weeks. Atresia begins about a week later, during which 80–100% of wave 1 follicles degrade their oocytes, turn over most granulosa cells, but retain theca cells which expand in number together with interstitial gland cells in the medulla. During puberty (5 weeks), these cells ultrastructurally resemble steroidogenic cells and highly express androgen biosynthetic genes. Unexpectedly, the <italic>Foxl2</italic> lineage tag also marked about 400 primordial follicles, located near the medullary–cortical boundary, that become the earliest activated wave 2 follicles. These ‘boundary’ or ‘wave 1.5’ follicles generate 70–100% of the earliest mature oocytes, while fewer than 26 wave 1 follicles with oocytes survive. Consistent with their largely distinct fates in steroid or oocyte production, granulosa cells of antral wave 1 and 2 follicles differentially express multiple genes, including <italic>Wnt4</italic> and <italic>Igfbp5</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ovarian follicle</kwd><kwd>follicle wave</kwd><kwd>oocyte</kwd><kwd>theca cell</kwd><kwd>steroid</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Allan Spradling is an HHMI Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yin</surname><given-names>Qi</given-names></name><name><surname>Spradling</surname><given-names>Allan C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The first follicle wave undergoes atresia to amplify androgen-producing theca cells, while previously unknown wave 1.5 follicles leave quiescence at 2 weeks and produce most of the earliest offspring.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gametes often begin development in subgroups known as ‘waves’ that arise at specific times and gonadal locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hirshfield, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hirshfield and DeSanti, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gougeon, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jiménez, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DeFalco and Capel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zheng et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zheng et al., 2014b</xref>). In mice, the earliest developing follicles, a small group known as ‘wave 1’, become growing primary follicles in the ovarian medulla by the time of birth without entering dormancy as primordial follicles. The remaining ~90%, ‘wave 2’, enter quiescence before postnatal day 5 (P5) by forming primordial follicles within the ovarian cortex to support lifelong fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Edson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McKey et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Granulosa cells in recruited follicles secrete signals encoded by Desert hedgehog (<italic>Dhh</italic>) and Indian hedgehog (<italic>Ihh</italic>) that attract ovarian mesodermal precursors to form outer theca cell layers on follicles and to synthesize steroid hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, ovarian medullary precursors generate thecal fibroblastic cells and perivascular smooth muscle cells that vascularize the thecal region and enable these follicles to collectively serve as a major systemic steroid hormone source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guzmán et al., 2023</xref>). An ovarian cell type closely related to theca cells, interstitial gland cells, also coordinately forms in mice and other mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jiménez, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miyabayashi et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>Nr5a2</italic> promotes theca cell vascularization that is essential for ovulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duggavathi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bianco et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guzmán et al., 2022</xref>). Two classes of steroidogenic Leydig cells, fetal and adult, also arise during testis development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miyabayashi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p> Follicular cells synthesize specific steroid hormones during their development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Edson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Richards et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Niu and Spradling, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Meinsohn et al., 2021a</xref>). Steroidogenic theca cells of secondary and preantral follicles convert cholesterol into androgens through a series of enzymatic reactions involving steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), cytochrome P450 family 11 subfamily A member 1 (CYP11A1), hydroxy-delta-5-steroid dehydrogenase, 3-beta- and steroid delta-isomerase 1 (HSD3B1), cytochrome P450 family 17 subfamily A member 1 (CYP17A1), and steroid 5 alpha-reductase 1 (SRD5A1). <italic>Cyp17a1-iCre</italic> (<italic>Cyp17a1</italic> promoter driving codon-improved <italic>Cre</italic>) has been developed and used to label theca cells, interstitial gland cells, and some granulosa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bridges et al., 2008</xref>). Ovarian androgen production by theca cells during juvenile development is essential for normal maturation and the onset of puberty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Galas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Walters et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kelava et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, androgens diffuse into neighboring granulosa cells, where they are converted into estrogen by the action of hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 1 (HSD17B1) and cytochrome P450 family 19 subfamily A member 1 (CYP19A1). Estrogen produced in this manner signals the hypothalamus to initiate gonadotropin production and is essential for subsequent follicular maturation. After ovulation, the oocyte-free follicle is further modified into a corpus luteum, and its remaining granulosa and theca cells undergo luteinization to generate progesterone.</p><p> The development and function of wave 1 follicles have remained controversial. Most wave 1 follicles undergo atresia after reaching early antral stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Byskov, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Erickson et al., 1985</xref>) during juvenile development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This suggests they do not primarily serve a direct reproductive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hirshfield, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hsueh et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eppig and Handel, 2012</xref>), although these follicles are capable of developing into functional oocytes following superovulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lamas et al., 2021</xref>) and can support fertility in an irradiated rat model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guigon et al., 2003</xref>). Theca cells of atretic follicles often survive and persist in the ovary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Erickson et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Magoffin, 2005</xref>), suggesting a role in steroid production. However, when <italic>Foxl2-CreERT2</italic> was used to lineage-label the granulosa cells of wave 1 follicles, marked follicles substantially contributed to offspring during the initial months of fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zheng et al., 2014b</xref>).</p><p> Here, we studied wave 1 follicle development and gene expression in detail to gain deeper insights into follicular waves. We found that lineage labeling using <italic>Foxl2-CreERT2</italic>, activated in early fetal stages, is not specific to wave 1 follicles. Granulosa cells in about 400 primordial follicles were also marked near the medullary–cortical boundary in 2-week-old mice; hence, we termed them ‘boundary’ or ‘wave 1.5’ follicles. Marked boundary follicles accounted for more than 70% of developing follicles in the 5 week ovary, while no more than 26 intact wave 1 follicles survived to puberty. Boundary follicles probably correspond to the resting primordial follicle population expressing <italic>Nr5a2</italic> described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Meinsohn et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Meinsohn et al., 2021b</xref>. Thus, most of the <italic>Foxl2-CreERT2</italic>-labeled follicles contributing to offspring observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zheng et al., 2014a</xref> likely derived from boundary follicles rather than from wave 1 follicles.</p><p> Ovarian developmental and gene expression studies during 2–6 weeks (wk) provided molecular insight into gamete waves and follicular atresia. Wave 1 follicular oocytes and granulosa cells largely turn over beginning at about 3 wk. However, their theca cells increase in number and, by puberty, join interstitial gland cells to form a mass of active steroidogenic medullary cells that retain morphological evidence of their origin from atretic follicles. These steroidogenic cells highly express androgenic genes when granulosa cells are still reduced in number by atresia. The granulosa cell gene expression in developing wave 1.5 follicles also shows differences from that of wave 1 follicles, indicating that the distinct developmental fates of wave 1 follicles and of follicles that develop after a period of arrest (wave 1.5 and 2 follicles) may depend on intrinsic gene expression differences in addition to differing levels of gonadotropins.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Wave 1 follicle development</title><p>Advances that allow tissue clearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Faire et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fiorentino et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McKey et al., 2022</xref>) now make it possible to image an entire mouse ovary without sectioning.

At P5 and P10, we counted approximately 3822 and 3304 total follicles per ovary, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>), and 278 and 293 wave 1 follicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>).

We investigated the kinetics, cell specificity, and completeness of cellular turnover from 3 to 5 wk. At 4 wk, atretic follicles initially showed oocyte distortion followed by loss, leaving behind disorganized granulosa cell layers within the basement membrane but without affecting the theca cell layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, left). By 5 wk, atretic follicles progressively decreased in size and developed a cavity beneath the granulosa cell layer where the oocyte had previously resided (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, right). Oocyte loss from wave 1 follicles increased significantly between 3 and 4 wk, exceeding 80% by 5 wk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Electron microscopy revealed that during atresia, as oocytes degenerate, microvilli from both oocytes and granulosa cells retract from the zona pellucida (ZP). The shrinking of the cavity is marked by folding of the ZP, and in atretic follicles, remnants of the ZP appear to prevent further collapse of the cavity structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). ZP remnants in the follicular cavity have previously been used as a morphological indicator of atretic follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Myers et al., 2004</xref>).

Etymologically, atresia originates from the Greek ‘a-’ (meaning ‘no’) and ‘tresis’ (meaning ‘perforation’), referring to the absence or closure of an opening or cavity. The term is sometimes used simply to describe the complete turnover of follicles, which was not observed in wave 1 follicles.

Our data show that this substantial class of early primordial follicles does begin developing shortly after 2 wk, giving them sufficient time to reach the secondary and antral stages at 5 wk. It remains possible that a small number of wave 1 follicles, approximately 26 or fewer, do develop to maturity. However, it seems clear that the great majority of early progeny derive from boundary or other early-developing wave 2 follicles, rather than wave 1 follicles that escape atresia.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Mouse follicle waves express distinct genes</title><p>We found that differences in gene expression between wave 1 and 2 granulosa cells exist and may contribute to, or even control, the distinct fates of mouse follicular waves. Previously, gene expression differences had been mapped beginning as early as E14.5, and many were characterized between E16.5 and P5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Niu and Spradling, 2020</xref>). Those studies suggested that wave 1 follicles in the medulla differentially express several genes involved in steroid hormone production, while wave 2 granulosa cells in the cortex express genes that might predispose follicles to enter quiescence. This study extends knowledge of differences in gene expression within follicular waves during juvenile development up to 6 wk. Wave 1 follicles express much higher levels of <italic>Wnt4</italic> and <italic>Igfbp5</italic> than wave 2 follicles. Wnt4 has been genetically linked in humans to Müllerian dysgenesis and hyperandrogenism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choussein et al., 2017</xref>), perhaps reflecting its known roles in promoting female versus male development. High <italic>Wnt4</italic> expression in wave 1 granulosa cells may indicate that <italic>Wnt4</italic>-mediated downregulation of androgen production at 2 wk becomes reduced by granulosa cell degradation, promoting the subsequent upregulation of androgen levels at puberty. <italic>Igfbp5</italic>, the most conserved of the IGFBP family, is also a potent regulator of female reproductive tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schneider et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, while changing levels of gonadotropins in young juvenile mice likely play a role in wave 1 atresia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Edson et al., 2009</xref>), intrinsic differences in gene expression within different follicular waves at the same stage exist and have the potential to be important.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>The timing of follicular activation begins to be specified early in ovarian development</title><p>Finding that a subset of primordial follicles located near the medullary–cortical boundary comprises many of the earliest activated wave 2 follicles raises the question of how early activation is controlled. It is well established that upregulation of insulin-mediated growth pathways accompanies follicle activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Edson et al., 2009</xref>). Boundary follicles may become poised to activate before most other wave 2 follicles because their proximity to the nutrient-rich medulla enhances growth signaling, weakens quiescence, and promotes activation of <italic>Nr5a2</italic> and <italic>Foxl2</italic> expression, genes expressed in granulosa cells of all growing follicles. Wave 1 granulosa cells in the medulla differentially express growth-promoting genes such as <italic>Igfbp5</italic>, <italic>Grb14</italic>, and <italic>Ghr</italic>, as well as signaling genes like <italic>Itga6</italic> and <italic>Inha</italic>, relative to wave 2 follicles growing during 4 and 5 wk.</p><p>However, evidence increasingly suggests that follicular waves do not simply depend on differences in their local microenvironments. These follicle groups form at times in fetal ovary development that overlap with other critical events of gonad development. The progenitors of bipotential reproductive cell types like BPGs and mesenchymal steroidogenic precursors that arise early in both male and female gonad development remain elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Edson et al., 2009</xref>). These cells include stem-like populations that later give rise to theca cells and interstitial gland cells. We were able to preferentially mark both wave 1 follicles and boundary follicles using <italic>Foxl2-CreERT2</italic> as early as E14.5, suggesting that they are specified as early as bipotential and later progenitors and involve intercellular signaling events linked to sex determination. Progress in answering basic questions of gonad development would undoubtedly advance our understanding of how wave 1 and boundary follicles are specified.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Genetic studies of wave 1 follicles</title><p>We explored genotypes that reduce the number of wave 1 follicles in order to look for the genetic consequences of decreased wave 1 activity. In Turner syndrome, wave 1 follicle development is reported to be reduced significantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miura et al., 2017</xref>). This imbalance might lower androgen levels, potentially affecting juvenile development. Consistent with hormonal disruption, hormone replacement therapy significantly improves the development of individuals with Turner syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Klein et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, androgens are known to play an important role in this effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zuckerman-Levin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Viuff et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>We examined XO mice and looked for changes in wave 1 follicle numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B, C</xref>). Activated follicle numbers were reduced compared to XX controls at 1 wk. However, the reduction was transient, and by 2 wk, prior to remodeling and theca cell expansion, XO and XX females had similar numbers of activated follicles. Consequently, we could not draw any conclusions regarding the functional role of wave 1 follicles and their remodeling from these studies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Steroid hormones mediate sexual development in juvenile mice and during peri-puberty</title><p>Steroid hormones influence the development of sexually dimorphic organs, including the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Simerly, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnold, 2009</xref>). They have multiple sources, including steroids in the maternal circulation during pregnancy, as well as subsequent systemic and local steroid production during juvenile stages. Wave 1-derived theca cell numbers are high during 4 and 5 wk of juvenile development, a period known as peri-puberty that has been associated with sexual behavior development and with high levels of androgens, as well as relatively low estrogen production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">François et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Trova et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Devillers et al., 2023</xref>). While the sensitivity of the brain to steroid influences is probably declining during this period, sexually dimorphic circuits are still being shaped in ways that are important for sexually dimorphic behaviors in female and male rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sisk and Zehr, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Templin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Trova et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yoest et al., 2023</xref>). Potential targets of this influence include the anteroventral periventricular nucleus, which is larger in female than male rodents and helps regulate female reproductive functions such as ovulation and gonadotropin production. Sex hormones produced in females during puberty also enhance cell death in the primary visual cortex, reducing its volume in females compared to males. Thus, wave 1-generated steroid production may influence sexual development.</p></sec><sec id="s3-9"><title>Wave 1 follicle remodeling, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and human follicular waves</title><p>The work reported here may be relevant to the origin and high frequency of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McCartney and Marshall, 2016</xref>).

This work characterizes the wave 1 follicles in mouse comprehensively and compares different waves of follicles regarding their cellular and molecular features. Elegant mouse genetics methods are applied to provide lineage tracing of the wave 1 folliculogenesis, together with sophisticated microscopic imaging and analyses. Single-cell RNA-seq is further applied to profile the molecular features of cells in mouse ovaries from week 2 until week 6. While extensive details about the wave 1 follicles, especially the atresia process, are provided, the authors also identified another group of follicles located in the medullary-cortical boundary, which could also be labeled by the FoxL2-mediated lineage tracing method. The &quot;boundary&quot; or &quot;wave 1.5&quot; follicles are proposed by the authors to be the earliest wave 2 follicles, which contribute to the early fertility of puberty mice, instead of the wave 1 follicles, which undergo atresia with very few oocytes generated. The wave 1 follicle atresia, which degrades most oocytes, on the other hand, expands the number of theca cells and generates the interstitial gland cells in the medulla, where the wave 1 follicles are located. These gland cells likely contribute to the generation of androgen and estrogen, which shape oogenesis and animal development. By comparing scRNA-seq data from cells collected from week 2 until week 6 ovaries, the author profiled the changes in numbers of different cells and identified key genes that differ between wave 1 and wave 2 follicles, which could potentially be another driver of different waves of folliculogenesis. In summary, the authors provide a high amount of new results with good quality that illustrate the molecular and cellular features of different waves of mouse follicles, which could be further reused by other researchers in related fields. The findings related to the boundary follicles could potentially bring many new findings related to oogenesis.</p><p>This paper is overall well-written with solid and intriguing conclusions that are well supported. The reviewer only has some minor comments for the authors' consideration that could potentially help with the readability of the paper.</p><p>(1) The authors identify the wave 1.5 follicles at the medullary-cortex boundary, which begin to develop shortly after 2 weeks. Since the authors already collected scRNA-seq data from week 2 until week 6, could any special gene expression patterns be identified that make wave 1.5 follicle cells different from wave 1 and wave 2?</p><p>(2) Are Figures 1C and 1E Z projections from multiple IF slices? If so, please provide representative IF slice(s) from Figures 1C and 1E and clearly label wave 1 and wave 2 follicles to better illustrate how the wave 1 follicles are clarified and quantified.</p><p>(3) For Figure 3D, please also provide an image showing the whole ovary section, like in Figures 3A and 3C, to better illustrate the localization and abundance of different cells.</p><p>(4) In Figure 4H, expressions of HSD3B1 and PLIN1 seem to be detected in almost all medulla cells. Does this mean all medulla cells gain gland cell features? Or there is only a subset of the medulla cells that are actively expressing these 2 proteins. Please provide image(s) with higher magnification to show more clearly how the expression of these 2 proteins differs among different cells.</p><p>(5) Figure 5: The authors discussed cell number changes for different types of cells from week 2 to week 6. A table, or some plots, visualizing numbers of different cell types, instead of just providing original clusters in Dataset S6, at different time points, would make the changes easier to observe.</p><p>(6) Figure S7: It would be more helpful to directly show the number of wave 1 follicles.</p><p>(7) Did the fluorescence cryosection staining (Line 587 - 595) use the same buffers as in the whole-mount staining (Line 575 - 586)? Please clarify.</p><p>(8) In Line 618, what tissue samples were collected? Please point out clearly.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.107352.2.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>This study explores an important question concerning the developmental trajectory of wave 1 ovarian follicles, leveraging valuable tools such as lineage tracing and single-cell RNA sequencing. These approaches position the authors well to dissect early follicle dynamics. The study would benefit from more in-depth analysis, including quantification using the lineage-traced ovaries, and comparison of wave 1 and 2 follicular cells per stage within the single cell dataset.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This study aims to address an important question regarding the developmental trajectories of wave 1 ovarian follicles and how they differ from wave 2 follicles that contribute to long-term fertility. This is an important topic, as many studies on ovarian follicle development rely on samples collected at perinatal timepoints in the mouse, which primarily represent wave 1 follicles, to infer later fertility. The research group has the tools and expertise necessary to tackle these questions.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Wave 1 follicles are quantified based on the criteria of oocytes larger than 20 µm located within the medullary region, using whole-mount staining. However, the boundary between the medulla and cortex appears somewhat arbitrary. Quantification using FOXL2-lineage-traced ovaries provides a more reliable method for identifying wave 1 follicles. As the developmental trajectory of wave 1 follicles has been well described in Zhang et al. 2013, it would be valuable to provide a more detailed quantification of both labeled and unlabeled follicles by specific follicle stages. In fact, in Zhang et al. 2013, the authors demonstrated that lineage-labeled primordial follicles can be found at the cortex-medulla boundary, suggesting that the observation of labeled &quot;border follicles&quot; is not unexpected. Quantification by follicle stage would provide greater insight into the timing and development of these follicles.</p><p>Similarly, the analysis of wave 1 follicle loss should be performed on lineage-traced ovaries using cell death markers to demonstrate the loss of oocytes and granulosa cells, while confirming the preservation of theca and interstitial cells. In particular, granulosa cell loss should be assessed directly with cell death markers in lineage-traced ovaries, rather than from the loss of tamoxifen-labeled cells, as labeling efficiency varies between follicles (Figure 2G).</p><p>Single-cell RNA sequencing presents a valuable dataset capturing the development of first-wave follicles. The use of a 40µm cell strainer during cell collection for the 10x platform may explain the exclusion of larger oocytes. However, it is still surprising that no oocytes were captured at all. The central question, how wave 1 follicular cells differ from wave 2 cells, should be investigated in more depth, with results validated on FOXL2-lineage-traced ovaries (i.e., Wnt4 staining in wave 1 antral follicles versus wave 2 using lineage-traced ovaries). This analysis should span all stages of follicle development. It also appears to be a missed opportunity that the single-cell sequencing analysis was not performed on lineage-traced ovaries, which would have enabled more definitive identification of wave 1-derived cells.</p><p>Finally, this study does not directly assess fertility outcomes and should therefore refrain from drawing conclusions about the fertility potential of wave 1 follicles.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.107352.2.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yin</surname><given-names>Qi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Carnegie Institution for Science</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Baltimore</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff><aff><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Carnegie Institution for Science</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Baltimore</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Spradling</surname><given-names>Allan C</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Carnegie Institution for Science</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Baltimore</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff><aff><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Carnegie Institution for Science</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Baltimore</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The eLife assessment states that our manuscript is important only as a source of data for others to use in the future. Our methods and analysis of wave 1 follicles were said to be &quot;incomplete&quot; because one of two reviewers claimed we did not prove that 80% of wave 1 oocytes turn over by 5 wk.</p><p>We believe that this assessment is simply wrong because critical supporting data already present in the existing manuscript were not understood by one reviewer. Wave 1 follicular oocyte turnover was said to be unproven and to remain uncertain because evidence of death was based only on a lack of Ddx4 staining. New experiments documenting expression of cell death markers, were said to be needed to show the oocytes died. However, our work was not based on the analysis of sectioned material, but used whole mount 3D reconstruction microscopy of cleared ovary preparations. Oocyte death was determined by the absence of an oocyte in fully reconstructed follicles and its replacement with an empty cavity, not just the absence of antibody staining. We included images and complete 3D reconstruction movies documenting these methods. The paper also documents that the holes frequently still contained zona pellucida remnants indicating the former presence of an oocyte. Moreover, we observed many intermediates of oocyte death- shrunken and deformed oocytes- and deformations of follicle structures due to the presence of the empty cavities. Controls showed that Ddx4 staining in the context of 3D imaging always revealed an obvious giant labeled oocyte in 100% of wave 1 follicles prior to death, and in wave 1.5 and wave 2 follicles at all stages. Thus, our methodology is already fully reliable. The reviewer is correct that the entire program of wave 1 development including their programmed turnover would be interesting to explore further. We already provided a large amount of new gene expression information, and documented the first examples of wave 1-specific gene expression. Further studies are not needed for the major conclusions of the paper and can wait for a follow up study.</p><p>Secondly, the existence of wave 1.5 is not &quot;speculative,&quot; as stated by the reviewing editor. We extensively validated and quantified the existence of wave 1.5 primordial follicles following Foxl2-cre activation at E16.5, and analysis at 2 wks in multiple experiments. Additionally, we showed wave 1.5 follicles were present at the medullar/cortex border at 2 wks even after activation of Foxl2-cre at E14.5. Our paper also connected for the first time wave 1.5 follicles to a population of non-growing, &quot;poised&quot; primordial follicles at this identical location near the medulla/cortex boundary by Meinsohn et al. in 2021. These follicles had not started to develop yet, and their ultimate fate was not known. We followed the development of these follicles and determined several differences in wave 1.5 follicle gene expression compared to wave 1. As noted in the assessment, our findings on wave 1.5 are now already being extended to other systems such as primate ovaries (adopting our name &quot;wave 1.5&quot; from our bioRxiv manuscript). The simultaneous claims that our discovery of wave 1.5 exists is speculative, and also that other people are now finding wave 1.5 follicles in the species they are studying are logically incompatible.</p><p><bold>Response to reviewer 2:</bold></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 239-245: Please note that Zhang et al. 2013 also show that lineage-labeled primordial follicles can be found at the cortex-medulla boundary (see their Figure 1B).</p></disp-quote><p>The single image in the Zheng et al. 2014 paper may or may not show mosaic primordial follicles, but it would not be surprising since the experiment was identical to experiments in the paper. However, that single picture is only meaningful in the context of our subsequent work reported in the current manuscript. There was no mention of these follicles in the text of Zheng et al. 2014, no documentation or quantitation of their numbers, and no discussion or understanding of their significance. The incorrect conclusions of the paper were that wave 1 follicles- meaning rapidly developing follicles in the medulla- give rise to most early offspring. This conclusion reversed the previously accepted (and essentially correct) view that wave 1 follicles did not contribute significantly to fertility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;Finally, this study does not directly assess fertility outcomes and should therefore refrain from drawing conclusions about the fertility potential of wave 1 follicles.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We showed by lineage marking that only about 25 of about 200 wave 1 follicles survive even to wk 5.
