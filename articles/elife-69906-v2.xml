Disturbed flow is associated with vascular inflammation and focal distribution. Recent studies have revealed the involvement of epigenetic regulation in atherosclerosis progression. <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) is the most prevalent internal modiﬁcation of eukaryotic mRNA, but its function in endothelial atherogenic progression remains unclear. Here, we show that m<sup>6</sup>A mediates the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway during EC activation to regulate the atherosclerotic process. Oscillatory stress (OS) reduced the expression of methyltransferase like 3 (METTL3), the primary m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferase. Through m<sup>6</sup>A sequencing and functional studies, we determined that m<sup>6</sup>A mediates the mRNA decay of the vascular pathophysiology gene <italic>EGFR</italic> which leads to EC dysfunction. m<sup>6</sup>A modification of the <italic>EGFR</italic> 3’ untranslated regions (3’UTR) accelerated its mRNA degradation. Double mutation of the <italic>EGFR</italic> 3’UTR abolished METTL3-induced luciferase activity. Adenovirus-mediated METTL3 overexpression significantly reduced EGFR activation and endothelial dysfunction in the presence of OS. Furthermore, thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), an EGFR ligand, was specifically expressed in atheroprone regions without being affected by METTL3. Inhibition of the TSP-1/EGFR axis by using shRNA and AG1478 significantly ameliorated atherogenesis. Overall, our study revealed that METTL3 alleviates endothelial atherogenic progression through m<sup>6</sup>A-dependent stabilization of <italic>EGFR</italic> mRNA, highlighting the important role of RNA transcriptomics in atherosclerosis regulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>atherosclerosis</kwd><kwd>endothelial

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) is the most prevalent post-transcriptional modiﬁcation of eukaryotic mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Roundtree et al., 2017</xref>). This modification is reversible and is catalyzed by a multicomponent methyltransferase complex consisting of various methyltransferases including methyltransferase like 3 (METTL3), METTL14, Wilms tumor 1-associated protein (WTAP), and KIAA1429 (Virilizer), and is erased by demethylases such as fat mass and obesity-associated protein or α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase alk B homolog 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huang et al., 2021</xref>). As previously reported, m<sup>6</sup>A on mRNAs plays an important role in regulating cellular processes, including RNA stability, translation efﬁciency, RNA secondary structure, subcellular localization, alternative polyadenylation, and splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zaccara et al., 2019</xref>). In the methyltransferase complex, METTL14 functions as the target recognition subunit by binding to RNA and then recruits METTL3 to catalyze m<sup>6</sup>A formation. Wilms tumor 1-associated protein (WTAP) is a regulatory subunit required for the accumulation of METTL3 and METTL14 into nuclear speckles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ping et al., 2014</xref>). KIAA1429 guides region-selective m<sup>6</sup>A methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yue et al., 2018</xref>). As the core methyltransferase subunit, METTL3 has been demonstrated to modulate key physiological processes, including spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Xu et al., 2017</xref>), cell reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chen et al., 2015</xref>), and embryonic stem cell chromatin modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Xu et al., 2021</xref>). However, its function in human cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains elusive.</p><p>Atherosclerosis, resulted from endothelial dysregulation in the arterial wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Geovanini and Libby, 2018</xref>), is the leading cause of CVD resulting in high rate of mortality in the population. Atherosclerosis preferentially develops at branches and curvatures in the arterial tree where flow is disturbed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Davies, 2009</xref>). Disturbed flow pattern increases inflammatory response in ECs, including the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and vascular adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Humphrey et al., 2014</xref>). Recent studies have reported that oscillatory stress (OS) could modulate atherosclerosis development by inducing the expression of DNA methyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dunn et al., 2014</xref>) and histone modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hastings et al., 2007</xref>), indicating the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in the regulation of atherogenesis. In this study, we focused on exploring the function of RNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification under OS in ECs, which may provide a better understanding of atherogenesis.</p><p>Numerous studies have shown that thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1, encoded by <italic>THBS1</italic>) is a shear-sensitive protein important for the regulation of vascular remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ni et al., 2010</xref>). Notably, TSP-1 can induce dysregulated blood flow, impaired vessel dilation, and increased vascular tone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Csányi et al., 2012</xref> followed by arterial stiffening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, <italic>Thbs 1</italic> deficiency prevented lesion formation in <italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ganguly et al., 2017</xref>). As a receptor of TSP-1, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been reported to be involved in vascular pathophysiology and pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, EGFR-selective tyrphostin, AG1478, can reverse the phosphorylation of EGFR tyrosine-1068 induced by TSP-1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2009</xref>), indicating the complicated regulation between TSP-1 and EGFR with respect to vascular function.</p><p>In this study, we generated tamoxifen-inducible endothelial-specific <italic>Mettl3</italic>-deficient (EC-<italic>Mettl3<sup>KO</sup></italic>) mice to investigate the regulation of <italic>Mettl3</italic>-mediated m<sup>6</sup>A on atherogenesis. Our data revealed that downregulation of METTL3 and hypomethylation mediate OS-induced endothelial dysfunction and atherogenesis both in vivo and in vitro, indicating that the <italic>THBS1/EGFR</italic> axis is a key regulatory target of METTL3-dependent EC activation. These results illuminate a critical mechanism of m<sup>6</sup>A modification in regulating atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>METTL3 is decreased in atheroprone regions</title><p>To explore the functions of m<sup>6</sup>A modification under OS, we first detected m<sup>6</sup>A level changes in response to OS (0.5 ± 4 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup>, 1 Hz) for 6 hr in human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs) through UHPLC-MRM-MS (ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry coupled with multiple-reaction monitoring) analysis. The results showed that OS significantly decreased m<sup>6</sup>A modification in HUVECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To further investigate the effects of OS on the pattern of m<sup>6</sup>A modulators, we examined methyltransferase components including METTL3, METTL14, METTL16, WTAP, and Virilizer. Western blot analysis detected a significantly decrease of METTL3 and Virillizer after OS stimulation, without affecting other m<sup>6</sup>A modulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–E</xref>). Furthermore, to analyze the m<sup>6</sup>A modulators in atheroprone (aortic arch [AA]) and atheroprotective (thoracic aorta [TA]) regions, we performed western blot analysis and found that METTL3 and Virilizer were significantly decreased in AA tissue lysates than in TA region, whereas METTL14 and WTAP were not changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Consistently, in outer curvature of AA and TA, where blood flow is laminar, METTL3 was highly expressed in both regions but only displayed specific nuclear localization in outer curvature of AA. Conversely, in the inner curvature and bifurcation of AA, where blood flow is disturbed, METTL3 was dramatically decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Next, to further test the expression of METTL3, we used <italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice with partial ligation and performed carotid Doppler ultrasonography to verify disturbed flow induction in the partially ligated left common carotid artery (LCA) at 7<sup>th</sup> and 14<sup>th</sup> days after the procedure compared with stable flow in those at day 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Consistent with the AA, as compared with right common carotid artery (RCA), METTL3 was weakly expressed in LCA after 1 and 2 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>).

To investigate the molecular mechanisms of m<sup>6</sup>A function in endothelial activation, RNA-seq was performed using ECs treated with ST and OS. We identified 547 consistently upregulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D-F</xref>) upon OS. Consistent with the MeRIP-seq data, these upregulated genes were also significantly enriched in transcription regulation- and cell adhesion-associated pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>, right panel). Therefore, we hypothesized that METTL3 regulates the degradation of these genes in response to OS. Furthermore, we analyzed the upstream regulators of methylation-downregulated but expression-upregulated genes using IPA software. According to the IPA analysis, we identified <italic>EGFR</italic> as a potential key regulator participating in OS-enhanced gene ontology (GO) pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), which was further confirmed by the reduced ratio of <italic>EGFR</italic> (IP/input) in OS compared to ST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We also validated the significantly increased <italic>EGFR</italic> mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) and decreased m<sup>6</sup>A enrichment in OS compared to ST by MeRIP-quantitative PCR (qPCR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). To further test whether METTL3-mediated m<sup>6</sup>A regulates <italic>EGFR</italic> mRNA decay, we measured <italic>EGFR</italic> mRNA levels in ECs after treatment with the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D. Compared to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) control, METTL3 overexpression significantly decreased the remaining <italic>EGFR</italic> mRNA levels due to accelerated mRNA decay in the presence of functional m<sup>6</sup>A modification by overexpression of METTL3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). As expected, <italic>EGFR</italic> mRNA showed a slower decay rate in response to METTL3 knockdown or OS treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>). As we found that the 3’UTR of <italic>EGFR</italic> is a key region regulating m<sup>6</sup>A modification, we mutated two nearby potential m<sup>6</sup>A motifs AGACA and GGACT to AGTCA and GGTCT. Notably, the 3’UTR mutants did not respond to the decrease in luciferase activity caused by overexpression of METTL3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I and J</xref>).

To study the function of the endothelial TSP-1/EGFR axis in EC activation, we first treated wildtype and METTL3-overexpressed ECs with or without OS. Overexpression of METTL3 abolished phosphorylation of EGFR (Tyr-1068), AKT, and ERK, as well as total EGFR and VCAM-1 levels in response to OS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Furthermore, TSP-1 was significantly increased at both the mRNA and protein levels under OS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Supplementation with recombinant human TSP-1 didn’t change EGFR protein levels but enhanced EGFR phosphorylation which could be abolished by METTL3 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). Next, ECs were subjected to OS or METTL3 siRNA in the presence of the EGFR-selective tyrphostin AG1478, which blocked both OS and siMETTL3-mediated phosphorylation of EGFR, AKT, and ERK and VCAM-1 levels, had no effect on total EGFR expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–H</xref>).

First, we found that m<sup>6</sup>A modification levels were reduced concomitant with downregulation of METTL3 in atheroprone regions. Second, oscillatory flow-derived MeRIP-seq analysis revealed that m<sup>6</sup>A modification of the <italic>EGFR</italic> 3’UTR contributes to atherogenesis. Third, overexpression of METTL3 restored m<sup>6</sup>A modification and reversed VCAM-1 expression and the monocyte adhesion ability response to OS. Finally, TSP-1/EGFR inhibition prevented the development of atherosclerosis, suggesting a novel therapeutic method for atherosclerosis patients. Together, our findings demonstrate that METTL3 and m<sup>6</sup>A modifications could alleviate endothelial activation and atherogenesis through accelerated degradation of oscillatory flow-induced <italic>EGFR</italic> mRNA expression.</p><p>Atherosclerotic plaques tend to develop in the vasculature locations with increased shear stress and OS. EC activation in response to oscillatory flow plays important roles in regulating circulatory functions and atherosclerosis development, which is involved in the expression of various genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). Recently, increasing evidence has suggested that m<sup>6</sup>A mRNA modiﬁcation participates in a number of biological functions and in progression of ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Xiang et al., 2017</xref>). In this study, we generated tamoxifen-inducible endothelium-specific Mettl3 deficiency mice with or without <italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup></italic> background. Western blot analysis of arterial intima revealed decreased METTL3 in AA compared to TA in mice of both genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Overexpression of Mettl3 has potential protective effects on endothelial activation in atheroprone regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), indicating the involvement of both m<sup>6</sup>A modification and METTL3 in atherogenesis.</p><p>As the core methyltransferase subunit, METTL3 has been reported to modulate embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguilo et al., 2015</xref>) and spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Xu et al., 2017</xref>), and its deletion in mice causes early embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Geula et al., 2015</xref>). METTL3 also plays a central role in osteogenic differentiation and inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>), which act similarly in ECs. METTL3 expression is upregulated during osteoblast differentiation and downregulated after LPS (lipopolysaccharide) stimulation, while its depletion enhances the expression of <italic>Smad</italic> genes and proinflammatory cytokine expression in MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Chien et al. proposed that METTL3 is increased after long term of disturbed flow for 48 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chien et al., 2021</xref>). We performed a short term of disturbed flow for 6 hr, and the mechanism research in genotype mice limited in 2 or 4 weeks. Furthermore, most evidence was demonstrated in EC-specific Mettl3 knockout mice. We presume a possibility that the differential expression of METTL3 is attributed to variations in the stimulus, such as treatment time and strength. The development of hematopoietic stem cells (HSPCs) also requires METTL3-mediated m<sup>6</sup>A modiﬁcation, and mettl3 deficiency in arterial endothelial cells blocks endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition, followed by suppression of the generation of HSPCs through activation of Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). METTL3 plays a similar role in cerebral arteriovenous malformation, and deletion of METTL3 in ECs significantly affects angiogenesis by reducing heterodimeric Notch E3 ubiquitin ligase formed by DTX1 and DTX3L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). METTL3 seems to be essential for maintaining endothelial function. Here, we analyzed RNA-seq and MeRIP-seq to reveal declined methylation and increased expression of cell adhesion- and migration-related pathways. Our results describe the role of m<sup>6</sup>A and METTL3 in atherogenic progression and identify therapeutic strategies against atherosclerosis through m<sup>6</sup>A modiﬁcation and its related targets.</p><p>It has been reported that EGFR plays a role in foam cell transformation and accelerates atherosclerotic lesions characterized by accumulation of smooth muscle cells and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Although EGFR is expressed at low levels in ECs, explosive elevation of transcription and phosphorylation of EGFR were detected after OS treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), consistent with a report from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rizvi et al., 2013</xref>. METTL3 binds to <italic>EGFR</italic> mRNA near the stop codon and is responsible for its m<sup>6</sup>A modification, modulating <italic>EGFR</italic> mRNA stability in human cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lin et al., 2016</xref>). Chien et al. also pointed out EGFR as a hypomethylated gene in METTL3 knockdown under OS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chien et al., 2021</xref>). Our results demonstrated that the <italic>EGFR</italic> 3’UTR response to OS and double mutation of the 3’UTR abolished the reduction induced by METTL3 overexpression in ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), indicating that EGFR is responsible for m<sup>6</sup>A modification in response to OS treatment. EGFR is activated in response to its EGF-like repeats, such as TSP1, which require matrix metalloprotease activity, and the ligand-binding portion of the EGFR ectodomain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2009</xref>). The EGFR signaling pathway was blocked by overexpression of METTL3 in response to OS and supplementation with TSP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>). However, TSP-1 was not affected by METTL3 intervention, and we presume that TSP-1 acts as a specific ligand that activates EGFR after OS treatment. Moreover, the EGFR selective tyrphostin AG1478 inhibited EGFR phosphorylation at tyrosine 1068 without affecting the total levels of EGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Garg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wang et al., 2017</xref>) and had an atheroprotective role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). AG1478 reduced levels of p-EGFR and downstream proteins in the presence of OS, and <italic>Thbs1</italic> shRNA and AG1478 reversed atherogenesis in partially ligated arteries in EC-Mettl3<sup>KO</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we provide both in vitro and in vivo evidence demonstrating that m<sup>6</sup>A RNA modification regulates progression of EC activation in response to the onset of OS and subsequently, early atherogenesis. It should be noted that METTL3-modiﬁed <italic>EGFR</italic> mRNA participates in the pathogenic mechanism of atherogenesis. The TSP-1/EGFR axis may contribute to m<sup>6</sup>A-modified atherogenesis, and inhibition of the axis helps to retard atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

The indicated mice were anesthetized by using isoflurane (2–3%). Carotid arteries of both sides were exposed by creating a ventral midline incision (4–5 mm) in the neck. The left external carotid, internal carotid, and occipital arteries were ligated and right external carotid as sham; the superior thyroid artery was left intact. Mice were monitored until recovery in a chamber on a heating pad after surgery. Mice were fed WTD for 2 and 4 weeks. For lentivirus infection studies, a single exposure of 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> TU adenovirus was lumenally delivered to the left carotid artery and kept inside for 40 min to allow for sufficient infection. The lentivirus solution was subsequently removed and blood flow was restored. For AAV9 infection studies, AAV9-TIEp-METTL3/empty vectors (3 × 10<sup>11</sup> vector genomes/mice) were delivered by intravenous injection. One week after AAV9 delivery, partial ligation was performed.

Most of the studies in vivo have looked at METTL3 deficiency, so I think that the protective role of sustaining its expression in the ligation model should be explored in addition. Also, given the many RNAs found to be modified by METTL3, I find it surprising that it mainly comes down to EGFR in ECs, and that a major player is TSP1. TSP1, for example, has been investigated in atherosclerosis for its effects in two other major cells types in plaques, namely SMC and macrophages. Attributing all of its effects to what it does to ECs may reflect the model they use, which some consider as an &quot;advanced atherosclerosis&quot; process (it certainly has disturbed flow), but given that they have apoE-/- mice, a more standard atherosclerosis study could have been performed. Another technical note is that HUVECs are controversial in their direct relevance to arterial ECs. A final note is that there is a competing paper earlier this year in which some of the important results are discrepant, so there is a need for reconciling the findings.</p><p>The authors have provided a lot of detailed and interesting data to support their contention that the methylation of the RNA encoding EGFR is a major regulator of a vascular pathology related to atherosclerosis. There are some issues and gaps, however, in the story, including:</p><p>1. A lot of the studies are done in HUVECs. Historically, this cell model has been used for EC studies, but it is well appreciated that the direct relevance to arterial ECs is not clear. Were studies in other cell models of ECs performed, with similar results for key findings replicated?</p><p>2. TSP-1 has been studied for its effects on macrophages and SMCs, with reports to support its effects on atherosclerosis working through these cell types. The authors imply that all of the effects in their system is through the EC EGFR pathway. Is this perhaps a reflection of the ligation model they use? It has many notable differences from a standard model of atherosclerosis, so are the effects that seem to be confined to ECs model specific? With having apoE-/- mice available, I am surprised a standard atherosclerosis study was not performed.</p><p>3. The overexpression of METTL3 in vitro appeared to be protective against OS. While the authors provide experimental data in vivo with siRNA to further knock it down, I would think that an in vivo protection study would be a valuable addition. Also, with regard to the lentivirus experiment, how was it excluded that effects on other cell types (besides ECs) were not contributory?</p><p>4. THP-1 adhesion studies were done in some places, but the early studies referring to EC activation were based on the effects on adhesion molecules (e.g., VCAM). Some functional studies should have been done to show activation had a consequence on monocyte adhesion.</p><p>5. What is the basis for the effects of METTL3 changes on EGFR phosphorylation and the other signaling molecules reported on?</p><p>6. Going back to the specificity issue, there were many changes in the &quot;methylome&quot;- it is surprising that the major impact is exclusive to EGFR.</p><p>7. How do the authors explain the differences with the findings in Chien et al. (PNAS 118:e2025070118, 2021)?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>A notable strength of the current study is leveraging unbiased m6A interrogation approaches to decipher mechanisms of shear stress induced endothelial programming which is of substantial interest. Although others reported on generation of endothelial-specific Mettl3 KO, this is not a trivial endeavor and adds to the significance. It is difficult to ignore however that the most important conclusions of the paper were reported in a highly similar recent manuscript (Chien et al. PNAS. 2021). Notably the study from Shu Chien's group performed a rigorous interrogation of endothelial responses in response to oscillatory flow using eCLIP to map m6A sites, identified the reader protein involved and used a similar in vivo atherogenesis model perturbing Mettl3 to validate their findings. Implicating the EGFR signaling pathways and use of rescue/epistatic studies here is a novel aspect but the overall conceptual advance may be somewhat incremental.</p><p>1. The authors claim that mettl3 levels are reduced in response to OS but they provide no evidence that the subtle changes in mettl3 in endothelial cells(see figure 1A) translates in to meaningful changes in m6A levels. Thus, a major limitation of the work is that there are no direct m6A measurements? The authors need to measure global m6A levels preferably by mass spectrometry under different conditions. Measurement of m6A levels should also be done in the mettl3 overexpression studies.</p><p>2. Related to point#1, the proposed regulation of mettl3 in endothelial is opposite to previous work which showed that mettl3 is not downregulated and in fact upregulated in response to OS and other pro-atherogenic conditions (PMID: 33579825 and 32755566). The authors claim that these findings may be due to differences in conditions but this not well explored. The authors need to better consolidate their findings with previous work and ideally show experimentally the basis for Mettl3 regulation.</p><p>3. There are important details missing for key studies. How many replicates were used for the m6A-seq studies? How are the peaks shown in Figure 3C normalized? Can the authors show additional m6A peaks in the supplement? Can the authors also show a more expanded list of enriched motifs under different conditions and not just the top one?</p><p>4. Similar to the question above can the authors provide more details on number of replicates for RNA-seq study?</p><p>5. For some panels there appears to be dramatic differences in Mettl3 levels in the in vivo model. For example, in IHC staining shows that Mettl3 is almost completely absent in the LCA model (Figure 2D, and Supp Figure 5A). How do authors explain the big differences in plaque burden in Figure 5 if control animals are practically Mettl3 deficient? Curiously staining for Mettl3 is absent in figure 5.</p><p>6. The differences in motifs show in Figure 3B is an interesting finding but the physiologic significance of this finding is unclear since it invokes that the &quot;interactome&quot; of methyltransferase complex may be different depending on conditions which is not proven. Suggest minimizing this point in the text since its seems distracting.</p><p>7. Ref cited twice p28 line 7 and 10.</p><p>8.

Using in vitro and in vivo approaches, Li and collaborators have shown that disturbed flow decreases the expression of methyltransferase METTL3 in endothelial cells. METTL3 is the enzyme responsible for nearly all the N6-methyladenosin (m6A) addition in mRNAs. Using in vitro methods, the authors show that under conditions of shear stress, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) demonstrate reduced m6A modification in the EGFR mRNA, which they associate with reduced EGFR mRNA degradation. Additionally, the authors used partial ligation of the left common carotid artery, which is an animal model of disturbed flow, to show that METTL3 expression is decreased with increased EGFR levels in the endothelium. They also demonstrate that the increase in EGFR expression promotes vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis by upregulating vascular adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1). These findings were also observed using a METTL3 endothelial cell specific knockout animal model. Furthermore, both overexpression of METTL3, or pharmacological inhibition of EGFR signaling, reduced VCAM-1 expression. Based on these results, the authors conclude that vascular inflammation in areas with disturbed flow is regulated by mRNA m6A modification, and that METTL3-mediated EGFR mRNA modification participates in the pathogenic mechanism of atherogenesis.</p><p>The major strength of this study is that the authors used a variety of in vitro and in vivo models, combining genetic approaches (METTL3 specific KO and the overexpression of METTL3), and pharmacological approaches, to show that there is a role for METTL3 and EGFR in atherogenesis.</p><p>Despite many of the strengths that this work has, there are several key weaknesses that make their conclusions less convincing and will require additional experimentation to resolve. In particular, there are significant differences between the effect of perturbed flow on METLL3 expression observed in vitro and in vivo. While in vivo data showed a dramatic reduction of METTL3, the in vitro data showed a modest reduction in enzyme levels, and there was no difference in m6A modification between cells treated with normal or disturbed flow. The lack of m6A changes is most problematic and needs to be resolved, since altered m6A levels are the proposed mechanism of action. Fundamentally, it is not clear whether the in vitro perturbed flow model recapitulates the key properties of in vivo perturbed flow, or whether the in vivo effect is due to features other than altered flow.</p><p>Another factor that makes it difficult to interpret these data concerns the way that overexpression or silencing by lentiviral vector infection was carried out, including a lack of control studies. There are no data demonstrating that overexpression or silencing only occurs in the endothelium layer (which itself is doubtful). Therefore, it is difficult to interpret these results when it is possible that there are contributions from other cell compartments within the aortic wall, including vascular smooth muscle cells and recruited leukocytes. To more fully understand the results of this study, a more detailed description of the methods is needed, and a greater discussion of the study's findings is necessary. In addition, it is not clear how the quantification of fluorescence was done. Importantly, a proper statistical analysis is critical to evaluate these findings and determine whether certain conclusions are warranted. Another issue that needs to be corrected concerns the small number of animals used in each experiment. With the small number of animals used, it is not certain if the data follows a normal distribution prior to applying a parametric analysis (T-test or ANOVA). It is also not clear whether it is appropriate to to use the standard error of the mean (SEM) rather than standard deviation (SD) in many of these studies. SD seems to be proper analysis based on descriptions in experimental methods.</p><p>The work presented by Li et al. is meaningful and has a potential to be published, but at the present time it is incomplete and will require additional experimentation and clarification.</p><p>1. It will be more relevant for the study if the in vitro experiments are performed on aortic endothelial cells rather than HUVECs, especially since the authors are comparing and making correlations between in vivo and in vitro studies. in vivo studies are of course investigating aortic endothelial cells.</p><p>2. The lack of effect on m6A modification between cells treated with normal or disturbed flow is disconcerting, since that it is the activity of METTL3 that is proposed to be the mediator of the effects in this study. Consequently, assuming these data are correct, the authors should examine if there is an increase in METTL16 that could account for the fact that with lower METTL3 levels there are no changes in m6A levels. Another possible explanation could be that the remaining METTL3 enzyme is sufficient to carry out methyltransferase activity, or that loss of m6A requires considerably greater amount of time than considered in these studies. In that case, it would be important to add a METTL3 knockdown study as a control. A METTL3 knockdown would help to determine which changes in mRNA expression are due to METTL3 downregulation in OS conditions.</p><p>3. In Figure 3F, it is important to show the effect of METTL3 knockdown on EGFR mRNA stability. It is possible that the increase in the EGFR mRNA under OS could be a transcriptional effect. It needs to be determined whether under OS conditions, EGFR mRNA has a slower decay rate.</p><p>4. The authors showed that OS increases EGFR expression and signaling in HUVECs. Additionally, they showed that the activation of EGFR under OS increases AKT and ERK phosphorylation and an increase in VCAM-1 expression. Overexpression of METTL3 avoids the effects previously described and silencing of METLL3 recapitulates OS effects, and inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation with AG1478 impaired AKT and ERK phosphorylation and VCAM-1 expression under OS conditions. However, it is not clear why VCAM-1 protein levels increase under OS or with METTL3 silencing, and this needs to be resolved. Is it NF-κB or AP-1 mediated? What is the justification that the authors have to explain that all of the effects observed in AKT, ERK and VCAM-1 under OS are corrected by EGFR inhibition? The data supporting this conclusion is lacking. The authors seem to be suggesting that OS is sensed by HUVECs in an EGFR-mediated manner exclusively? That seems difficult to believe, and needs to be supported by additional evidence. Also, METTL3 overexpression and silencing must be demonstrated by immunoblots in Figure 4.</p><p>5. For the experiments with partial ligation of the left common carotid artery in which METTL3 endothelial cell specific knockout animals were used, the authors need to provide representative images of the immunofluorescence in the RCA of KO animals. This should also be quantified and compared statistically.</p><p>6. There is considerable background in a number of the images that makes it difficult to distinguish signal from noise, especially for CD31 (Figure 5). Because of this issue, it is difficult to conclude that VCAM-1 colocalizes with CD31 positive cells. Proper unambiguous staining is critical to demonstrate that the increase in VCAM-1 is in the endothelium and it is not also increasing in other cells like vascular smooth muscle cells that under inflammatory conditions express VCAM-1 as well. The best approach is to carry out staining in cross sections like the HandE staining studies. That way it will be clear if VCAM-1 expression is occurring exclusively in the endothelium.</p><p>7. For all studies in which overexpression or silencing was carried out, the staining should be shown in cross sections to demonstrate that the silencing or overexpression is limited to the endothelium and not to the intima or the media of the aortic wall. Was the silencing or overexpression homogenous along the whole endothelium?</p><p>8. Perturbed flow occurs naturally along the aorta, as the authors mentioned. One of these areas is the aortic root, in which atherosclerotic plaques are formed in pro-atherogenic mouse models (like the animal model the authors used for this study). Thus, it will be very informative to show what happens in Apoe-/-EC-Mettl3KO versus Apoe-/-Mettl3flox/flox, with EGFR, METTL3 and VCAM-1 expression. What is the state of macrophage accumulation (CD68 staining), lipid accumulation (ORO staining), and vascular smooth muscle cell accumulation, and fibrous cap formation (ACTA2 staining) in the aortic root? This experiment will address the variability that is an issue in the partial ligation intervention studies, including local inflammation due to the procedure.</p><p>9. To use parametric tests like T-test or ANOVA, the data must follow a normal distribution. If data does not follow a normal distribution, then non-parametric tests should be carried out. Based on the methods section, it does not seem that the authors used any test to first check for data distribution, and therefore they may have applied the wrong statistical analysis. This point needs to be addressed. Also, the authors should justify why they represented their data as SEM instead as SD, especially for the animal experiments. They should explain in the methods section how they acquired the images and carried out quantification, with justification of the statistical analyses used. For the immunofluorescence studies, it will be necessary to normalize the intensity by area or by number of cells. Also, it will be important to describe how many images per aorta were used for analysis and the size of the areas analyzed by microscopy.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69906.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>You will see in the reviewers' comments numerous questions and suggestions.

The overexpression of METTL3 in vitro appeared to be protective against OS.

We have indeed proved that overexpressed adenovirus METTL3 has a protective role against ECs activation both in vitro and in vivo (Revised Figures 2F-G and S2C-D). Moreover, to exclude the influence of other cell types, we carried out AAV<sup>endo</sup>-METTL3 experiment in the partial ligation model, and found that specific overexpression of METTL3 in ECs provided a great protection in ECs activation (Revised Figures 2F-G and Supplemental Figure 2C-D). Through lentivirus experiment, we measured TSP-1 expression in ECs, SMCs and macrophages and observed significantly reduced TSP-1 upon lenti-shTHBS1 in ECs, SMCs, and macrophages in partial ligation model.

Although others reported on generation of endothelial-specific Mettl3 KO, this is not a trivial endeavor and adds to the significance. It is difficult to ignore however that the most important conclusions of the paper were reported in a highly similar recent manuscript (Chien et al. PNAS. 2021). Notably the study from Shu Chien's group performed a rigorous interrogation of endothelial responses in response to oscillatory flow using eCLIP to map m6A sites, identified the reader protein involved and used a similar in vivo atherogenesis model perturbing Mettl3 to validate their findings. Implicating the EGFR signaling pathways and use of rescue/epistatic studies here is a novel aspect but the overall conceptual advance may be somewhat incremental.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the interests in our work.

The authors claim that mettl3 levels are reduced in response to OS but they provide no evidence that the subtle changes in mettl3 in endothelial cells(see figure 1A) translates in to meaningful changes in m6A levels.

Using in vitro and in vivo approaches, Li and collaborators have shown that disturbed flow decreases the expression of methyltransferase METTL3 in endothelial cells. METTL3 is the enzyme responsible for nearly all the N6-methyladenosin (m6A) addition in mRNAs. Using in vitro methods, the authors show that under conditions of shear stress, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) demonstrate reduced m6A modification in the EGFR mRNA, which they associate with reduced EGFR mRNA degradation. Additionally, the authors used partial ligation of the left common carotid artery, which is an animal model of disturbed flow, to show that METTL3 expression is decreased with increased EGFR levels in the endothelium. They also demonstrate that the increase in EGFR expression promotes vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis by upregulating vascular adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1). These findings were also observed using a METTL3 endothelial cell specific knockout animal model. Furthermore, both overexpression of METTL3, or pharmacological inhibition of EGFR signaling, reduced VCAM-1 expression. Based on these results, the authors conclude that vascular inflammation in areas with disturbed flow is regulated by mRNA m6A modification, and that METTL3-mediated EGFR mRNA modification participates in the pathogenic mechanism of atherogenesis.</p><p>The major strength of this study is that the authors used a variety of in vitro and in vivo models, combining genetic approaches (METTL3 specific KO and the overexpression of METTL3), and pharmacological approaches, to show that there is a role for METTL3 and EGFR in atherogenesis.</p><p>Despite many of the strengths that this work has, there are several key weaknesses that make their conclusions less convincing and will require additional experimentation to resolve. In particular, there are significant differences between the effect of perturbed flow on METLL3 expression observed in vitro and in vivo. While in vivo data showed a dramatic reduction of METTL3, the in vitro data showed a modest reduction in enzyme levels, and there was no difference in m6A modification between cells treated with normal or disturbed flow. The lack of m6A changes is most problematic and needs to be resolved, since altered m6A levels are the proposed mechanism of action. Fundamentally, it is not clear whether the in vitro perturbed flow model recapitulates the key properties of in vivo perturbed flow, or whether the in vivo effect is due to features other than altered flow.</p><p>Another factor that makes it difficult to interpret these data concerns the way that overexpression or silencing by lentiviral vector infection was carried out, including a lack of control studies. There are no data demonstrating that overexpression or silencing only occurs in the endothelium layer (which itself is doubtful). Therefore, it is difficult to interpret these results when it is possible that there are contributions from other cell compartments within the aortic wall, including vascular smooth muscle cells and recruited leukocytes. To more fully understand the results of this study, a more detailed description of the methods is needed, and a greater discussion of the study's findings is necessary. In addition, it is not clear how the quantification of fluorescence was done. Importantly, a proper statistical analysis is critical to evaluate these findings and determine whether certain conclusions are warranted. Another issue that needs to be corrected concerns the small number of animals used in each experiment. With the small number of animals used, it is not certain if the data follows a normal distribution prior to applying a parametric analysis (T-test or ANOVA). It is also not clear whether it is appropriate to to use the standard error of the mean (SEM) rather than standard deviation (SD) in many of these studies. SD seems to be proper analysis based on descriptions in experimental methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for the careful review. In the revision, we measured m<sup>6</sup>A levels in HUVECs and mAECs under disturbed flow (Author revised image 1; Revised Figure 1).

The lack of effect on m6A modification between cells treated with normal or disturbed flow is disconcerting, since that it is the activity of METTL3 that is proposed to be the mediator of the effects in this study. Consequently, assuming these data are correct, the authors should examine if there is an increase in METTL16 that could account for the fact that with lower METTL3 levels there are no changes in m6A levels. Another possible explanation could be that the remaining METTL3 enzyme is sufficient to carry out methyltransferase activity, or that loss of m6A requires considerably greater amount of time than considered in these studies. In that case, it would be important to add a METTL3 knockdown study as a control. A METTL3 knockdown would help to determine which changes in mRNA expression are due to METTL3 downregulation in OS conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the reviewer’s valuable suggestions.

The authors showed that OS increases EGFR expression and signaling in HUVECs. Additionally, they showed that the activation of EGFR under OS increases AKT and ERK phosphorylation and an increase in VCAM-1 expression. Overexpression of METTL3 avoids the effects previously described and silencing of METLL3 recapitulates OS effects, and inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation with AG1478 impaired AKT and ERK phosphorylation and VCAM-1 expression under OS conditions. However, it is not clear why VCAM-1 protein levels increase under OS or with METTL3 silencing, and this needs to be resolved. Is it NF-κB or AP-1 mediated? What is the justification that the authors have to explain that all of the effects observed in AKT, ERK and VCAM-1 under OS are corrected by EGFR inhibition? The data supporting this conclusion is lacking. The authors seem to be suggesting that OS is sensed by HUVECs in an EGFR-mediated manner exclusively? That seems difficult to believe, and needs to be supported by additional evidence.

Proper unambiguous staining is critical to demonstrate that the increase in VCAM-1 is in the endothelium and it is not also increasing in other cells like vascular smooth muscle cells that under inflammatory conditions express VCAM-1 as well.

This point needs to be addressed. Also, the authors should justify why they represented their data as SEM instead as SD, especially for the animal experiments. They should explain in the methods section how they acquired the images and carried out quantification, with justification of the statistical analyses used.
