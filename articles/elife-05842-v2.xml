within the pre-somitic mesoderm. Previous mathematical models of the somitogenesis clock that invoke the mechanism of delayed negative feedback predict that its oscillation period depends on the sum of delays inherent to negative-feedback loops and inhibitor half-lives. We develop a mathematical model that explores the possibility that positive feedback also plays a role in determining the period of clock oscillations. The model predicts that increasing the half-life of the positive regulator, Notch intracellular domain (NICD), can lead to elevated NICD levels and an increase in the oscillation period. To test this hypothesis, we investigate a phenotype induced by various small molecule inhibitors in which the clock is slowed. We observe elevated levels and a prolonged half-life of NICD. Reducing NICD production rescues these effects. These data provide the first indication that tight control of the turnover of positive as well as negative regulators of the clock determines its periodicity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05842.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05842.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05842.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>During embryo development, animals with backbones (also called vertebrates) repeatedly lay down pairs of segments along the axis that runs from the head to the tail of the embryo. These segments, known as somites, eventually form part of the skeleton, as well as the associated muscle, cartilage, tendons and some skin. Importantly, the segments in some species take longer to form than those in other species, and they also form in proportion to the overall size of the animal.</p><p>A ‘segmentation clock’ regulates the timing of somite formation via cycles in which genes are repeatedly switched on and then off again. Some aspects of this process are well understood. Firstly, many ‘clock genes’ are known to produce proteins that can inhibit their own production. However, this ‘negative feedback’ is typically delayed because it takes time to produce and transport protein within a cell. The inhibitory proteins are also unstable and their breakdown leads to an end of their inhibitiory effect. It is also known that: some proteins send signals to neighbouring cells while others, including one called Notch, receive them; and the received signals activate the expression of clock genes. However, until now, no one had studied how the turnover (that is, the production and breakdown) of the proteins that activate clock gene expression could regulate the pace of the clock.</p><p>Wiedermann, Bone et al. used a two-pronged approach to investigate this question. First, they developed a computational model that accounted for both inhibition and activation of clock gene expression. The model predicts that the clock slows down when the levels of a positive regulator called Notch intracellular domain (or NICD for short) are high. This is because the negative regulators would have to overcome the increased positive regulators to switch off the clock genes. A slower segmentation clock would be expected to give rise to fewer, larger somites in a given length of time when compared to a similar clock with a faster pace.</p><p>To test these predictions, Wiedermann, Bone et al. next conducted experiments on chicken embryos, which are commonly used in studies of animal development. The experiments agreed with the model predictions. That is, when treated with a variety of drugs that affected NICD turnover and thereby increased the levels of NICD, the clock slowed and these chicken embryos developed fewer, but larger somites. As predicted by the mathematical model, these effects were rescued when Wiedermann, Bone et al. reduced the production of NICD. These findings show that a balance of positive and negative regulators determines the pace of the segmentation clock.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05842.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05842.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Notch</kwd><kwd>segmentation</kwd><kwd>clock</kwd><kwd>oscillation</kwd><kwd>NICD</kwd><kwd>somite</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>097945/Z/11/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dale</surname><given-names>J Kim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT089357MA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dale</surname><given-names>J Kim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council (MRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>studentship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bone</surname><given-names>Robert Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>studentship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wiedermann</surname><given-names>Guy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Computational modelling together with experimental manipulation indicate that the stability and turnover of activated Notch is inextricably linked to the regulation of the pace of segmentation clock gene expression in the presomitic mesoderm.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The formation of the vertebrate skeleton and associated musculature relies on the ordered and timely segmentation of mesodermal tissue during early embryonic development. Segmentation is progressive and occurs in an anterior to posterior direction as the body axis elongates (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Oates et al., 2012</xref>). Mesodermal segments, or somites, ‘pinch off’ at the rostral limit of the two rods of pre-somitic mesoderm (PSM) that lie on either side of the caudal neural tube, with a distinct, species-specific periodicity; every 90 min in the chicken and every 120 min in the mouse. This periodicity is regulated by a molecular oscillator, known as the segmentation clock, that is defined by cyclic gene expression within PSM tissue with a period that regulates somite formation. These ‘clock’ genes belong to the Notch, WNT and FGF signalling pathways and are expressed in a cyclical pattern in the PSM of a wide variety of vertebrate species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krol et al., 2011</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dequéant et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gibb et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maroto et al., 2012</xref>). On a single cell level in the vertebrate PSM, oscillatory gene expression is believed to be established through negative feedback loops of unstable clock gene products.</p><p>Previous mathematical models of the somitogenesis clock that invoke the mechanism of delayed negative feedback predict that the clock period can be approximated as a sum of the delays involved in processes such as transcription, splicing, translation and transport and the half-lives of inhibitors of clock gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lewis, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Monk, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ay et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hanisch et al., 2013</xref>). Subsequent studies have confirmed that the period can be altered by genetically modifying genes that encode negative regulators (e.g., Hes7, Her6, Her7, Nrarp) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Herrgen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schröter and Oates, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Takashima et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Oates et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harima, et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hoyle and Ish-Horowicz, 2013</xref>). Moreover, it has been shown that regulation of clock gene mRNA turnover and degradation is gene specific and regulated at the level of the 3′UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hilgers et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nitanda et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, there has been relatively little experimental work demonstrating the predicted role of protein stability in regulating the periodicity of clock gene oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hirata et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>It is notable that models that invoke delayed negative feedback as the mechanism underlying the somitogenesis clock were developed primarily from zebrafish data, where the clock period is relatively short and there are significantly fewer oscillating components than other vertebrate species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krol et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, in zebrafish there is experimental evidence that Notch plays a key role in the synchronisation of neighbouring oscillators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Delaune et al., 2012</xref>) but that it is not necessary for oscillations themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ozbudak and Lewis, 2008</xref>). In contrast, Notch signalling in mouse and chick is thought to be essential for oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ferjentsik et al., 2009</xref>). One crucial factor in this regard is the Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD) which is cleaved following ligand activation, translocates to the nucleus and activates Notch target gene expression. NICD is unstable and, at least in mouse, its production appears as pulsatile, spatio-temporal waves that traverse the rostro-caudal axis of the PSM in the manner of a clock gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huppert et al., 2005</xref>). Importantly, pulsatile Notch1 protein expression was recently shown to be dependent on Notch signalling in the PSM of both chick and mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bone et al., 2014</xref>); this raises the possibility that, in mouse and chick at least, positive feedback, mediated by Notch and NICD, plays a role in the clock mechanism.</p><p>In this study we develop a mathematical model of the clock that describes both repression and NICD-mediated activation of clock gene transcription. The model predicts that increasing the half-life of NICD results in elevated levels of NICD and a longer clock period. Notably, these effects are not observed in the model upon increasing the half-life of the repressing clock protein. To test the predictions, we use a pharmacological approach that robustly delays the phase patterns of a clock gene in the chick and mouse PSM. Under these conditions, using a custom made antibody that recognises endogenous chick NICD, we show that, concomitant to delaying the pace of oscillations, the inhibitors increase both levels of NICD and its half-life. In agreement with model predictions, we rescue the phase patterns of clock gene expression by reducing NICD production. These data therefore suggest that increasing the half-life of NICD and thus increasing its turnover time increases the period of the somitogenesis clock.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mathematical modelling predicts that increased NICD half-life results in higher levels of NICD and a longer clock period</title><p>In order to investigate the role of both positive and negative feedback in the circuitry of the somitogenesis clock, we developed a mathematical model in which the key regulatory interactions are that an inhibitory clock protein and NICD negatively and positively regulate gene transcription, respectively (see ‘Materials and methods’ and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>).

In a given cycle of the clock, NICD activates transcription, resulting in the production of cytoplasmic protein after some delay, <italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub>. Clock protein then represses transcription and after a further delay, <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> , NICD is produced and activates the next cycle of the clock. In the model, perturbing protein half-lives alters the balance between activation and repression in a manner that modifies the clock period. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> we show that increasing the NICD half-life increases the period of the oscillation and the levels of both NICD and clock protein. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> we show that increasing the clock protein half-life does not greatly affect the oscillator period but reduces levels of NICD.</p><p>In order to further explore model behaviour we calculated solutions of the model in different regions of parameter space. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref> we show that the oscillator period and levels of NICD increase with NICD half-life but that these effects are not seen upon increasing the clock protein half-life. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> we show that the increased period, arising as a consequence of increased NICD half-life, can be rescued by reducing the NICD production rate. These numerical solutions demonstrate that, in the model, the balance between NICD production and degradation rates plays a key role in determining the clock period. Additionally, we note that there is a critical value of the production rate below which the trivial steady-state becomes stable (solutions tend to zero) and that perturbing clock protein and NICD production and decay rates can drive the system into stable states (e.g., by increasing repressor half-life in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> or reducing the NICD production rate in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Wnt inhibition delays the pace of <italic>cLfng</italic> oscillations in the chick and mouse PSM</title><p>It has previously been reported that modulating either the Shh or Wnt pathways can affect the pace of clock gene oscillations in the PSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gibb et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Resende et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gonzalez et al., 2013</xref>). To experimentally test the predictions of our model, we used a half-embryo assay to investigate whether levels and half-life of NICD were elevated under conditions where clock gene oscillations were robustly delayed using a pharmacological approach (see ‘Materials and methods’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gibb et al., 2009</xref>). In the first instance, PSM explants from chick embryos between Hamburger Hamilton (HH) stages 10–12 were exposed to XAV939, a specific Wnt inhibitor that acts by inhibiting Tankyrase1 (TNK1) and TNK2 enzymes, which normally degrade Axin2. Hence upon treatment with XAV939, AXIN2 protein is stabilised and maintains phosphorylated β-catenin protein in the destruction complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Following a titration assay, we determined that 100 μM XAV939 treatment was the lowest concentration that caused robust and reproducible down regulation of the Wnt target genes <italic>cAxin2</italic> and <italic>cLef1</italic> compared to the corresponding DMSO-treated contralateral explants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>; n = 61/68; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bone et al., 2014</xref>) and led to increased levels of phosphorylated β-catenin at Ser33, Ser37, Thr41, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>; n = 8/10). Using the same assay, we investigated the effect of the inhibitor on the dynamic expression of <italic>cLfng</italic> in the PSM<italic>.</italic> Following exposure to 100 μM XAV939, the domain of <italic>cLfng</italic> expression was at least 1 phase behind that of the control explant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, M; n = 57/64) and occasionally this resulted in the treated explant forming one less somite boundary than the control explant. These data imply that 100 μM XAV939 treatment noticeably lengthens the period of the oscillations. In explant pairs where both sides were DMSO-treated, an asymmetric pattern of <italic>cLfng</italic> expression was rarely seen (n = 2/18, data not shown) and, as such, the effects of XAV939 on <italic>cLfng</italic> expression could not be attributed to DMSO, natural variability in expression, or to the assay itself. In order to ensure that the oscillations were delayed and not halted, a fix and culture assay (see ‘Materials and methods’) revealed that <italic>cLfng</italic> expression was still dynamic in the presence of 100 μM XAV939 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; n = 8/9). Furthermore, Phospho-histone H3 (pH3) and NucView analyses demonstrated that neither proliferation nor apoptosis, respectively, were significantly affected following drug treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,D</xref>; n = 4, p = 0.236; n = 4, p = 0.292).

We found that 100 μM XAV939 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>), 10 μM Roscovitine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>; n = 31/41) and 10 μM DRB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>; n = 29/42) robustly down-regulated transcription of <italic>cAxin2</italic> in the caudal chicken PSM, compared to the DMSO control. These data raise the possibility that the effects of these reagents on the segmentation clock are via inhibition of Wnt activity. However, the increased phosphorylation of β-catenin at Ser33, Ser37, Thr41 observed with XAV939, which serves as a readout of Wnt inhibition, was not observed following exposure to 10 μM Roscovitine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>; n = 5/6) or 10 μM DRB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>; n = 4/4), suggesting that the mechanism by which these CDK inhibitors inhibit transcription of <italic>cAxin2</italic> is not through the inhibition of canonical Wnt signalling. However, alternative mechanisms of Wnt inhibition exist that do not lead to an increase in β-catenin phosphorylation and thus we cannot rule out an effect of CDK inhibition via changes in Wnt signalling.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Exposure to cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors increases the level of cNICD in the PSM</title><p>Having shown that Wnt inhibition or exposure to a panel of CDK inhibitors robustly delays the pace of the segmentation clock, a key question is whether or not there is a common mechanism underlying these observations. We thus investigated whether levels of NICD were perturbed by the CDK inhibitor treatments. Using the same assay as described above, one pool of PSMs was cultured for 3 hr in DMSO and the contralateral halves were cultured in the inhibitor. Both pools were then cultured for an hour in the presence of cycloheximide before Western Blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Remarkably, and in agreement with model predictions, we observed that the level of cNICD protein was again increased significantly in the presence of Roscovitine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, lanes 7, 8; n = 9/10), DRB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, lanes 9, 10; n = 6/8) and PHA-767491 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, lanes 11, 12; n = 2/2) compared to the corresponding DMSO control pool (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Again, even in the absence of cycloheximide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), levels of cNICD in the chicken PSM were consistently higher when treated with Roscovitine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>; n = 5/7), and DRB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>; n = 4/6) compared to respective DMSO control lysates (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Thus, Roscovitine, DRB and PHA-767491 treatments all increase the level of cNICD protein in the chicken PSM, just as they all delay oscillations of the Notch target gene <italic>cLfng</italic>. Hence, taken together the data with the Wnt and CDK inhibitors fulfil the predictions of the model that increased levels of NICD will be associated with an increase to the periodicity of clock gene oscillations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>XAV939 and the CDK inhibitors extend the clock period in chick leading to formation of fewer somites</title><p>To verify the extent to which the period had been extended in the presence of each of the reagents, we performed a time course of the fix and culture assay.

Untreated control pairs completed one full oscillation and made an extra somite in 90 min whereas exposure to the reagents resulted in an oscillation period of approximately 120 min (n = 8 for each inhibitor and for DMSO; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3E-J</xref>).</p><p>A prediction of the clock and wave-front model of somitogenesis is that a longer clock period will result, assuming a constant wave-front speed, in the formation of fewer, larger somites in a given time.

Thus, if XAV939, Roscovitine or DRB increased the production of DLL1 or Notch1, the observed increase in NICD might be secondary to increased signalling, rather than a result of changes in protein turnover. To address this possibility, we replaced the 1h CHX treatment with a 1h LY411575 treatment to specifically block production of new NICD, repeated the assay and measured levels of cNICD by Western Blot analysis. Thus, one pool of PSMs was cultured for 3 hr in DMSO and the contralateral halves were cultured in XAV939, Roscovitine or DRB. Both pools were then cultured for an hour in the presence of LY411575 before Western Blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).

These models are an excellent example of how a relatively simple mathematical framework can provide insight into the behaviour of a multi-component, multi-scale, nonlinear biological system. An elegant prediction of the models is that the period of the somitogenesis clock can be approximated as a sum of the constituent delays and the half-lives of negative regulators. However, whilst numerous studies have shown that genetic modification of clock components can modify the clock period, relatively little work has been published on whether half-lives of clock proteins have the predicted effect. Moreover, the models neglect the potential role of positive regulators of clock gene expression. In this study we combine experimental manipulation and mathematical modelling to begin to explore these issues.</p><p>In order to investigate the role of positive regulators of the somitogenesis clock, we modified previous frameworks to account for the role of NICD in the somitogenesis clock. In the model, NICD and the inhibitory clock protein compete to activate and repress the transcription of a clock gene, respectively. Notably, the release of NICD is a multi-cellular phenomenon involving the periodic and coordinated expression of cell surface proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bone et al., 2014</xref>). In order to avoid describing each of the constituent components, here we consider a model of a single cell oscillator and assume that NICD is released periodically in a manner that is coupled to the transcription of other clock genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bone et al., 2014</xref>). This formalism allows us to avoid explicitly modelling the temporal dynamics of Delta and Notch across cell populations and focus solely on investigating the role of the half-life of the positive regulator. The predicted outcome of the model is that increasing the half-life of NICD elevates levels of NICD and lengthens the period of oscillations in addition to increasing levels of the inhibitory clock protein. These effects can be rescued by decreasing the production rate of NICD.</p><p>In order to explore whether these predictions can be validated experimentally, we have further explored an intriguing phenotype whereby the application of a diverse range of small molecule inhibitors results in a clear, robust delay in the pace of <italic>Lfng</italic> oscillations across the chick and mouse PSM. We find that for each of the small molecule inhibitor treatments, the levels of the positive regulator, NICD, are elevated and NICD half-life is increased. When interpreted within the framework of the proposed model, these data support the hypothesis that treatment with the small molecule inhibitors results in an increased half-life of the positive regulator NICD, which elevates the levels of NICD, delays the clock, and results in the formation of fewer larger somites. In contrast, when interpreted within the framework of the proposed model, the data do not support the hypothesis, for instance: that the drug treatments solely modify the half-lives of negative regulators of the somitogenesis clock, such as Hes7. We also demonstrate experimentally, in agreement with model predictions, that both the delay in the pace of <italic>Lfng</italic> oscillations across the PSM and the elevated levels of the positive regulator, NICD, resulting from exposure to the small molecule treatments can be rescued by decreasing NICD production.</p><p>In this study we observe delays in the PSM phase pattern in the presence of small molecule inhibitors that are rescued by Delta-Notch signalling inhibitors. From these observations we infer that the autonomous frequency of individual oscillations is perturbed as a result of increased NICD stability. Nevertheless, it is also possible that the effect of increasing the NICD half-life is to alter tissue scale properties of the frequency gradient profile (e.g., increasing its rostro-caudal velocity or steepness would result in a greater proportion of cells in the PSM experiencing lower frequencies and thus observations of delayed phase patterns). Regardless of this detail, the premise of this study remains intact: positive as well as negative regulators of the somitogenesis clock can regulate its period.</p><p>We note that the inclusion of both positive and negative feedback into the somitogenesis clock model introduces the possibility of interesting nonlinear phenomena that may have relevance to the somitogenesis clock. For instance, Tsai et al. have shown that the inclusion of positive and negative feedback loops can result in the attainment of a wide frequency range over a small range in amplitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tsai et al., 2008</xref>). This point is potentially relevant in the context of somitogenesis, where a frequency gradient is thought to underlie the striking phase waves that traverse the rostro-caudal axis.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Wnt inhibition increases levels and half-life of cNICD and extends the period of the clock</title><p>Previous reports have suggested that inhibition of Shh signalling slows the segmentation clock in the chick PSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Resende et al., 2010</xref>). In this study, we clearly show that, in our hands, inhibiting the Shh pathway does not affect clock pace or the level of cNICD in the chick PSM within the timeframe of our assay. A possible reason for this discrepancy with Resende et al. is that we culture explant pairs for 3 hr whereas they observed delays to somite formation, in the absence of Shh signalling, only after 7.5 hr culture and alterations to clock gene expression after 4.5 hr culture. One possible explanation for the later arising effects they observe on the pace of the clock and somite formation is that they that are indirect secondary effects arising from Shh inhibition. In contrast, we report Wnt inhibition, within a 3 hr time frame, elicited by exposure to XAV939, increases the half-life of NICD in the chick and mouse PSM, leading to elevated NICD levels and a clear and robust prolonged period of clock gene oscillations and somite formation. Intriguingly, Gonzalez et al. previously reported exposure of mouse PSM explants to LiCl, which acts to inhibit GSK3B, lengthens the period of Hes7 oscillations in the mouse PSM. However, the authors report this effect may rather be via LiCl activation of the MapK pathway which is important for Hes expression in the PSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gonzalez et al., 2013</xref>), since more specific approaches to elevate Wnt signalling have been shown not to change the endogenous period of the segmentation clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aulehla et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gibb et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, Gonzalez et al. found the Wnt inhibitor CKI-7 delayed clock gene oscillations in the mouse PSM, in line with our own observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gibb et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gonzalez et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>CDK inhibitors roscovitine, DRB and PHA-767491 regulate the period of clock gene oscillations</title><p>We demonstrate that three CDK inhibitors, Roscovitine, DRB and PHA-767491, also increase the half-life of cNICD and delay the pace of <italic>Lfng</italic> oscillations at concentrations that have no significant effect on cell proliferation. At higher concentrations of inhibitors that did affect proliferation, the oscillations of <italic>Lfng</italic> expression were abolished. Importantly, these data separate the effects of the inhibitors on the segmentation clock from those on the cell cycle. This finding is consistent with the ‘clock and wavefront’ model of somitogenesis, rather than a cell cycle based model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cooke and Zeeman, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stern et al., 1988</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Tight control of the half-life of NICD, a positive regulator of oscillatory clock gene expression, appears key to regulating the clock period</title><p>A striking finding is the fact that these very different pharmacological reagents share distinctive phenotypic outputs: increased levels and half-life of NICD and extended period of the clock gene oscillations. This raises the compelling prospect that these effects are causally linked. Recent data showing that Notch1 protein is dynamically and periodically expressed in the chick and mouse PSM in a Notch dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bone et al., 2014</xref>) demonstrate that Notch1/NICD is itself part of a positive feedback loop. We experimentally validate the prediction that under conditions where half-life of NICD is increased, the period of the clock is extended. Our data thus expand upon previous models by highlighting the necessity for an added level of regulation, namely the strict regulation of the half-life for the positive input signal, NICD. Hence, it appears equally important to balance levels of both positive and negative input to correctly regulate the periodicity of clock gene oscillations. This result is similar to observations made in <italic>Nrarp</italic>-null mice, which display increased NICD levels in the PSM and a decrease in somite and vertebral body number although the pace of clock gene oscillations and somite size was not assessed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Our data with the neddylation inhibitor MLN4924 further substantiate the hypothesis that extended NICD half-life is causally linked to the extended clock period, given that this reagent, which acts via a completely distinct molecular mechanism, nevertheless leads to the same phenotypic output as the Wnt and CDK inhibitors. Thus, in addition to the expected higher levels of NICD in the PSM of MLN4924 treated explants, we saw a corresponding increase in the period of <italic>Lfng</italic> oscillations, as seen for XAV939, Roscovitine, DRB and PHA-767491 treated explants. In addition to elevating levels of NICD, exposure to MLN4924 elevates levels of phosphorylated β-catenin within PSM lysates. Since we show that Wnt inhibition can lead to elevated NICD levels and a delay to clock oscillations, this raises the possibility that the effects of MLN4924 are mediated via Wnt inhibition rather than directly via NICD turnover. However, we propose this is unlikely since in the absence of a degradation pathway the elevated levels of phosphorylated β catenin may in fact continue to participate in target gene transcription. Indeed, APC mutant lines which allow β catenin phosphorylation but are defective in ubiquitination are oncogenic, consistent with the idea that phosphorylated β catenin can indeed activate target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, we propose that the extended period of the clock seen following exposure to MLN4924 is due to the elevated levels of NICD brought about via inhibition of NICD degradation. Exposure to higher concentrations of this inhibitor leads to correspondingly higher levels of NICD in PSM explants and this accompanies a loss of dynamic <italic>Lfng</italic> expression. A similar correlation is seen in PSM explants exposed to increasing concentrations of Roscovitine, DRB, PHA-767491. It has previously been shown that overexpression or complete loss of Notch signalling abolishes clock gene oscillations and causes severe segmentation defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Niwa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ferjentsik et al., 2009</xref>). These data, together with previous reports investigating the effect of modulating protein levels of key clock components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hirata et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2011</xref>), indicate that there is a tolerance window for the degree of variance in levels of positive and negative input which will still allow for oscillatory gene expression. These experimental findings are consistent with the predictions of our model which also clearly predict that there is a window within which variations in half-life of both Hes7 and NICD will allow for oscillations. Taken together, our computational and experimental data show that slowing, as opposed to stopping, of the segmentation clock gene oscillations may be brought about through transient and/or partial stabilisation of Notch activity.</p><p>The rescue of both phase pattern changes and NICD levels elicited by exposure to both low concentrations of LY411575 together with Roscovitine, DRB or XAV939 provides compelling evidence that increased half-life and higher levels of NICD brought about by these inhibitors underlies the delay to clock gene oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>Following exposure to Roscovitine, DRB, PHA-767491 and XAV939, the Western Blot data reveal an additional band for NICD at a slightly lower molecular weight in some of the inhibitor treated samples as compared to the control treated samples. This observation is characteristic of an increase in abundance of a variant of a protein which lacks small post-translational modifications such as phosphate groups. This shift may therefore represent the loss of phosphorylation marks which have been shown to be important for NICD regulation and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fryer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jin et al., 2009</xref>). These data support the idea that post translational modification events may regulate the stability of NICD that could then directly affect the pace of the segmentation clock.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>XAV939, Roscovitine, DRB and PHA-767491 may directly affect NICD half-life through post translational modification of NICD</title><p>As alluded to above, post translational modifications may underlie the effects of the 4 reagents that each modulate NICD half-life and clock period. We demonstrate that XAV939 treatment elevates levels of GSK3B-mediated phosphorylated β catenin in the PSM and it is possible that it might equally facilitate GSK3B mediated phosphorylation of NICD which has previously been reported to affect NICD stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Espinosa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jin et al., 2009</xref>). It is noteworthy that the effect of this phosphorylation event on NICD stability is likely to be context dependent since different groups have reported this modification can increase or decrease NICD stability and it is not known if any of these interactions occur in the PSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Foltz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Espinosa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jin et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, it is possible that the CDK inhibitors modulate CDK-mediated phosphorylation of NICD which has also been reported to affect NICD stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fryer et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, exposure to specific CDK7, CDK8 or CDK9 inhibitors did not yield the delayed oscillation phenotype or increased levels of NICD and half-life of NICD in the chick PSM (data not shown). These data are somewhat surprising given that there are published reports describing a role for CDK8 in phosphorylating and thereby destabilising NICD. Indeed, CDK8-mediated phosphorylation in the PEST domain of NICD is required to target this protein for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the E3 ligase FBW7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fryer et al., 2004</xref>). Whilst it is possible that this mode of regulation of NICD stability by this specific CDK does not occur in the PSM, we acknowledge that it is also possible that the effect on pace and cNICD stability are only made apparent when inhibiting a combination of these activities as seen with Roscovitine, DRB and PHA-76749. It is important to note that an alternative explanation for the lack of effect of specific CDK7, CDK8, or CDK9 inhibitors is that the effect of Roscovitine, DRB and PHA-767491 may be through inhibition of a different set of kinases. The precise identification of the kinase(s) involved in destabilising cNICD will require further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>XAV939, roscovitine, DRB and PHA-767491 may indirectly affect NICD half-life and the clock period through transcriptional regulation of NICD-stability regulators</title><p>It is also formally possible that the common outcome of exposure to these four reagents to influence the pace of the clock involves regulation at the transcriptional level. Roscovitine is known to have highest efficacy against CDK2/CyclinE, CDK5, CDK7/CyclinH and CDK9/CyclinT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McLue et al., 2002</xref>) whereas DRB and PHA-767491 reduce the kinase activities of CDK7/CyclinH and CDK9/CyclinT towards Serine 2 and Serine 5 on the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA pol II. Exposure to DRB, Roscovitine, or PHA-767491 leads to a reduction in Ser5 RNA pol II phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>) which is required to promote initiation of transcription as RNA pol II moves away from the gene promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kormarnitsky et al., 2000</xref>) but it is also associated with ‘poised’ genes bound by both Ser5 phosphorylated RNA pol II and Polycomb repressor complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brookes and Pombo, 2012</xref>). Thus, one possibility is that reduced Ser5 phosphorylation of RNA pol II may leave some ‘poised’ genes in the PSM in a more repressed state. Importantly, certain gene transcripts are more susceptible to DRB treatment than others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zandomeni and Weinmann, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chodosh et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wada et al., 1998</xref>) and indeed we find not all gene transcripts in the PSM are down-regulated by these inhibitors (e.g., <italic>cLfng</italic> and <italic>cHairy2</italic> expression is delayed in the PSM but not down-regulated). Thus, the effects of these inhibitors may be to modify certain ‘poised’ genes to a more repressed state that specifically include genes encoding factors required for destabilising NICD.</p><p>Given that XAV939 elicits the same phenotypic output as exposure to the CDK inhibitors it is conceivable that all four reagents affect the transcription of some common genes; some involved in regulating the clock while others not; indeed we identified one gene commonly affected by all 4 reagents namely <italic>Gli1</italic> (known to be regulated by Wnt signalling in the neural tissue and somites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Munsterberg et al., 1995</xref>), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E–G</xref>). For this particular gene we show it is unlikely to be involved in clock regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). However, a transcriptomic analysis of common target genes would allow this possibility to be fully explored to identify genes co-regulated by these reagents which potentially encode regulators of NICD stability in the PSM.</p><p>Finally, a recent report has beautifully demonstrated that in zebrafish embryos the rate of tissue shortening, in addition to the periodicity of clock gene oscillations, is important in determining the periodicity of segmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Soroldoni et al., 2014</xref>). Further analyses are required to investigate if this is a conserved feature in all vertebrate species. That analysis notwithstanding, our data nevertheless clearly show that the pace of the segmentation clock itself has a strong influence upon the pace of somite formation since significantly fewer somites are formed within a given time-frame when the pace of clock gene oscillations and NICD stability are affected. In conclusion, our data suggest that the stability and turnover of NICD is inextricably linked to the regulation of the pace of clock gene expression across the PSM.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Chick culture</title><p>Fertilized chick (<italic>Gallus</italic> gallus) embryos from Winter Farm, Cambridge, UK, were incubated for approximately 40 hr at 38°C 5% CO<sub>2</sub> to yield embryos between Hamburger Hamilton (HH) stages 10–12 as judged by somite number and morphology.

Similarly, the author response typically shows only responses to the major concerns raised by the reviewers.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for sending your work entitled “A balance of positive and negative regulators determines the pace of the segmentation clock” for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been evaluated by Janet Rossant (Senior Editor) and three reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers all agreed that there was considerable merit in your study and that the concept of a positive regulator of the somite clock was an interesting one. However, there was one major concern. The experimental work demonstrates nicely a correlation between NICD levels and stability and period length. Nonetheless, all reviewers were concerned that you had not really proven a causal relationship between elevated NICD half-life and extension of the oscillation period.</p><p>There was a quite extensive discussion on this issue, and the reviewers were not sure exactly how you could prove your hypothesis. Some ideas were introducing a low level of RNAi to Notch1 to reduce Notch levels or treating with a gamma-secretase inhibitor to reduce NICD production or to increase FBXW7 levels. Alternately, another hypothesis discussed was to show that the clock period can be returned to normal by making NICD less stable (despite treating with a CDK or Tankyrase inhibitor). Other possibilities raised were locally raising NICD levels or changing half-life by removing the PEST domain. We realize that these are not necessarily the right experiments, and therefore would like to give you the option to respond to this criticism. Please take into account the major concerns raised by reviewers 1 and 2, appended below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1:</italic></p><p>1) The percentage of embryos where <italic>cLfng</italic> expression is delayed after (for example) Wnt inhibition is almost certainly statistically significant, but in the absence of data from control embryos (both halves cultured in DMSO) and some statistical comparison, this cannot be confirmed. The authors should already have this data.</p><p>2) For figures looking at NICD levels and half-life following drug treatment, it is not entirely clear to me that treatment with cycloheximide alone will prevent production of new NICD in explants. Given the delays inherent in Notch and DLL1 trafficking, cell surface presentation, and interactions, it seems possible that new NICD could be produced even in the presence of CHX, based on signaling through receptors that were made prior to initiation of CHX treatment. Thus, if any of the inhibitors increased the production of DLL1 or NOTCH1, for example, then the increases in NICD observed might be secondary to increased signaling, rather than a result of changes in protein turnover. Control experiments where inhibition of Notch signaling was initiated at the time of CHX treatment could address this concern, and provide additional support to the thesis that the effects the authors observe are due to changes in NICD half-life.</p><p>3) The use of <italic>p</italic> values in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> legend indicates that multiple pools were assessed and the Western Blot bands were quantified. The details of this process, as well as the averages and standard deviations of the values and the statistical analysis used should be described. Further, I don't find the phosphoserine 5 controls showing activity of CDK inhibitors in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1B</xref> extremely convincing. Details of quantification of Western Blots might help here as well. The authors should have this data.</p><p>4) From the images provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, it is not clear how “normal” the longer somites formed in the presence of various inhibitors actually are. Given that changes in clock synchrony also can affect somite size and morphology, the reader needs to have a clear idea of how (if) somite production might be perturbed by these treatments. Images that focus more closely on the region of interest to let the reader interpret morphology, and perhaps in situ analysis with markers that would delineate somite compartments would lend support to the authors’ conclusions.</p><p>5) Data showing that MLN4924 increases phospho-β catenin are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, but as far as I could tell, are not discussed? Since the authors claim that Wnt inhibition can on its own increase NICD levels and half-lives, this data should be at least acknowledged and put in some kind of context.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2:</italic></p><p>1) The experimental work nicely shows a correlation between NICD levels and stability and period length. It is however not clear if there is a causal relationship between elevated NICD half-life and extension of the oscillation period. The last set of experiments presented (subsection “Inhibition of SCF (SKP1- CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes results in delayed clock oscillations and higher levels of NICD”), aiming at inhibiting the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex is extremely important to address this issue. However, it should be extended to show that the inhibitor does not work through inhibition of the Wnt pathway, as is the case of the previous inhibitors. Otherwise the order of events remains unclear. Related to this, the last panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, which is not described in the Results section (and should be), suggests that levels of phosphorylated β catenin are elevated following MLN4924 treatment. This should be explained.</p><p>2) In many ways, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is essential to this manuscript. We feel it could be enhanced to facilitate the reading of the manuscript and understanding of the model and predictions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref> are not visually explicit enough to understand: a) the relationship between the clock protein, NICD, the feedback loops and the output on the oscillation period; b) how this model differs from the previous ones (Figure A could be replaced by the previous models); c) what the assumptions underlying this new model are. In addition, and maybe in the Experimental Procedures section, a statement explaining how the model can fit both the chicken and mouse somitogenesis, which oscillations for instance have a different period, would be useful.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C-H</xref> should be explained in a bit more detail, since this is the basis for understanding the rationale behind the experiments. The period on the top of the plots C-E correspond to what? In D and E how much are the half-lives of NICD and Hes7 increased? Maybe it should be stated clearly what the used values are and that the loss of oscillations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> corresponds to red region in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> near the solid line that is the limit of oscillations.</p><p>4) The competition relationship between NICD and the inhibitory clock protein to activate and repress transcription of a clock gene respectively (what parameter/properties considered?) impinges on the predictions of the model and interpretation of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, which postulates that elevated NICD half-life results in more clock protein, and should be better spelled out. In addition, depending on the ability of the clock protein to be a potent transcription inhibitor, having NICD longer around but not much more NICD protein may not have much of an impact. It would be useful to explicit which parameter(s) in the mathematical model reflect this aspect.</p><p>5) The description of the approach to measure the half-life is a bit confusing and hard to follow with regard to the equations. <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub><italic>(t)</italic> is the amount of NICD in both pools A and B. “t” is a free parameter. We suggest for the second equation in the subsection “Measuring the half-life of endogeneous NICD”: B_bar(<italic>τ</italic>)=A_bar(t+τ)=sum… and F(τ)=A_bar(t+τ)/A_bar(τ). This is more coherent with the integral form of F(τ) in the fourth equation.</p><p>Maybe it would be useful to have a profile sketch for A as a function of t.

However, there was one major concern. The experimental work demonstrates nicely a correlation between NICD levels and stability and period length. Nonetheless, all reviewers were concerned that you had not really proven a causal relationship between elevated NICD half-life and extension of the oscillation period</italic>.</p><p><italic>There was a quite extensive discussion on this issue, and the reviewers were not sure exactly how you could prove your hypothesis. Some ideas were introducing a low level of RNAi to Notch1 to reduce Notch levels or treating with a gamma-secretase inhibitor to reduce NICD production or to increase FBXW7 levels. Alternately, another hypothesis discussed was to show that the clock period can be returned to normal by making NICD less stable (despite treating with a CDK or Tankyrase inhibitor). Other possibilities raised were locally raising NICD levels or changing half-life by removing the PEST domain. We realize that these are not necessarily the right experiments, and therefore would like to give you the option to respond to this criticism.</italic></p><p>We have given the referees’ concerns careful consideration and conducted a key experiment to address the major issue that has been raised (i.e. causality of increased NICD stability and change in the pace of the clock – please see below for details). In short we titrated the concentration of the gamma secretase inhibitor LY411575 so as to reduce the elevated levels of NICD that were induced by the Rosc/DRB/XAV treatment and found that the clock delay phenotype is reversible. We believe that this dose-dependent rescue using a drug that is highly specific to NICD production in the cytoplasm provides strong evidence in support of the main thesis of our study that the increased NICD stability induced by Rosc/DRB/XAV treatment leads to a change in the pace of the clock. Moreover, the results from the rescue are consistent with the predictions of the mathematical model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).</p><p>In addition, we have responded to all other comments, added 4 new figures, a table and new data to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figures 4 and 5</xref>. Moreover, we have refined the mathematical model so that it has fewer variable and parameters and can better illustrate the major thesis of this study.</p><p>A key issue raised is that of causality between NICD stability and the change in pace of oscillations. We have used a small molecule approach to rescue the phenotype as follows:</p><p>LY411575 is a specific gamma-secretase inhibitor that blocks the release of NICD into the cytoplasm. We titrated its concentration so as to reduce but not remove NICD production in an attempt to offset the stability caused by Roscovitine/DRB/XAV939. The aim was to attempt to rescue the delay induced by the Roscovitine/DRB/XAV939 treatment.</p><p>In the initial draft of the manuscript we showed that Roscovitine, DRB or XAV939 delay the clock (approximately 95% chick; 90% mouse). In this revised draft we show that this phenotype is rescued in a significant proportion of the explants (30–40%) by the addition of 1 nM LY411575. Higher concentrations of LY411575 together with Roscovitine result in severe downregulation of <italic>Lfng</italic> mRNA expression whilst lower concentrations of LY411575 (0.1 nM) do not rescue the delay effect of Roscovitine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8–figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus we have identified a dose-dependent rescue using an inhibitor that is specific to NICD production within the cytoplasm.</p><p>Additionally, we have run Western Blots to show that the higher levels of NICD, usually seen in the presence of Roscovitine alone, are rescued by adding in 1 nM LY411575 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Given the well-established role of LY411575 in preventing NICD cleavage, we argue that this rescue is a particularly striking result that provides extremely strong support for the central thesis proposed in this study: that increased half-life and higher levels of NICD brought about by Roscovitine, DRB or XAV939 underlie the delay to clock gene oscillations observed on exposure to these inhibitors.</p><p>Furthermore, the result of this rescue is in agreement with the prediction of the mathematical model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>) which suggests that decreasing production of NICD in a background of longer half-life NICD will result in rescue of the phenotype (i.e. it is the ratio of production to decay rates that is the important parameter, hence reducing the decay rate can be offset by reducing the production rate).</p><p>We note that in order to demonstrate causality, the reviewers’ suggested the following experiments:</p><p>i) Introduce a low level of RNAi to Notch1 to reduce Notch levels;</p><p>ii) Treat with gamma-secretase inhibitor to reduce NICD production;</p><p>iii) Increase FBXW7 levels;</p><p>iv) Show the clock period can be returned to normal by making NICD less stable despite treating with a CDK or tankyrase inhibitor;</p><p>v) Locally raise NICD levels; and</p><p>vi) Change half-life by removing the PEST domain.</p><p>We gave each of these suggestions careful consideration. However, a technical problem with a number of the suggestions is that they require electroporation of a construct into the PSM. Despite huge experience working on this system in our lab, we find that this technique targets cells in a mosaic fashion and is at best 50% efficient. In such an experiment we would have no control over the amount of construct taken up.  Moreover, some of the suggested constructs would then need to compete with the endogenous Notch protein.</p><p>In our experience with this system, an effective way to affect all cells in a temporally controlled manner is through the use of small molecule inhibitors. In the future we would of course aim to identify the mechanism by which NICD is stabilised and generate a mouse that phenocopies this mechanistically in order to conclusively demonstrate causality. However, that is out of the remit of this manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer 1:</p><p><italic>1) The percentage of embryos where</italic> cLfng <italic>expression is delayed after (for example) Wnt inhibition is almost certainly statistically significant, but in the absence of data from control embryos (both halves cultured in DMSO) and some statistical comparison, this cannot be confirmed. The authors should already have this data</italic>.</p><p>We have included these data. In DMSO treated explant pairs an asymmetric pattern of <italic>cLfng</italic> expression was rarely seen (n = 2/18) showing asymmetry, data not shown) and as such the effects of XAV939 on <italic>cLfng</italic> expression could not be attributed to DMSO or natural variability in expression or to the assay itself.</p><p><italic>2) For figures looking at NICD levels and half-life following drug treatment, it is not entirely clear to me that treatment with cycloheximide alone will prevent production of new NICD in explants. Given the delays inherent in Notch and DLL1 trafficking, cell surface presentation, and interactions, it seems possible that new NICD could be produced even in the presence of CHX, based on signaling through receptors that were made prior to initiation of CHX treatment. Thus, if any of the inhibitors increased the production of DLL1 or NOTCH1, for example, then the increases in NICD observed might be secondary to increased signaling, rather than a result of changes in protein turnover. Control experiments where inhibition of Notch signaling was initiated at the time of CHX treatment could address this concern, and provide additional support to the thesis that the effects the authors observe are due to changes in NICD half-life</italic>.</p><p>We appreciate this comment and have conducted this experiment. We have replaced the 1h CHX treatment with 1h LY411575 treatment following exposure to Roscovitine, DRB or XAV939 and we then conducted the western to look at levels of NICD. We observe a very similar result to that seen with CHX: In contrast to explants cultured in explant media for 3h followed by 1h LY411575 which show severe depletion of NICD, we see that explants cultured in Roscovitine, DRB or XAV939 for 3h followed by 1h LY411575 show remarkably higher levels of NICD (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This data together with the half-life assay demonstrates that the higher levels are due to increased stability rather than increased production of NICD.</p><p><italic>3) The use of</italic> p <italic>values in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref> <italic>legend indicates that multiple pools were assessed and the Western Blot bands were quantified. The details of this process, as well as the averages and standard deviations of the values and the statistical analysis used should be described.

Details of quantification of Western Blots might help here as well. The authors should have this data</italic>.</p><p>We have included a table with these details (please see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) From the images provided in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref><italic>, it is not clear how “normal” the longer somites formed in the presence of various inhibitors actually are. Given that changes in clock synchrony also can affect somite size and morphology, the reader needs to have a clear idea of how (if) somite production might be perturbed by these treatments. Images that focus more closely on the region of interest to let the reader interpret morphology, and perhaps</italic> in situ <italic>analysis with markers that would delineate somite compartments would lend support to the authors’ conclusions</italic>.</p><p>We have added new panels to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> in which we present higher magnification images of the somites formed during the culture period.</p><p><italic>5) Data showing that MLN4924 increases phospho-β catenin are shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref><italic>, but as far as I could tell, are not discussed? Since the authors claim that Wnt inhibition can on its own increase NICD levels and half-lives, this data should be at least acknowledged and put in some kind of context</italic>.</p><p>We have reported the effect of MLN4924 upon phospho-β catenin in both the Results and Discussion. Phosphorylated β catenin is targeted for ubiquitination and degradation by the E3 ligase complex which is targeted by MLN4924. Thus, it is expected that exposure to this inhibitor leads to increased levels of phospho- β catenin. However, we propose the effects of MLN4924 on levels of NICD and disruption of phase patterns are not via indirect effects upon Wnt signaling for the following reasons: elevated levels of phospho βcatenin are indicative of Βcatenin molecules that would normally be decommissioned from participating in Wnt signaling but which are prevented from being degraded by MLN4924. Moreover, elevated levels of phospho βcatenin could in principle continue to participate in target gene transcription in the absence of a degradation pathway. If so it would mean MLN4924 potentially leads to elevated levels of Wnt signalling. Indeed, there are some APC mutant lines which allow βcatenin phosphorylation but are defective in ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang et al., 2006</xref> JBC). Given that these mutations are oncogenic, it would seem that phosphorylated βcatenin can indeed activate target genes. Even if phospho βcatenin cannot participate in target gene transcription, the phosphorylation decommissioning event is independent of MLN4924 and is thus happening at physiological levels and so again is not indicative of an inhibitor mediated block to Wnt signalling. Thus, we propose it is unlikely the extended period of the clock seen following exposure to MLN4924 is via Wnt inhibition but that rather it is due to the elevated levels of NICD brought about via inhibition of NICD degradation.</p><p>Reviewer 2:</p><p><italic>1) The experimental work nicely shows a correlation between NICD levels and stability and period length. It is however not clear if there is a causal relationship between elevated NICD half-life and extension of the oscillation period. The last set of experiments presented (subsection “Inhibition of SCF (SKP1- CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes results in delayed clock oscillations and higher levels of NICD”), aiming at inhibiting the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex is extremely important to address this issue. However, it should be extended to show that the inhibitor does not work through inhibition of the Wnt pathway, as is the case of the previous inhibitors. Otherwise the order of events remains unclear. Related to this, the last panel of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6D</italic></xref><italic>, which is not described in the Results section (and should be), suggests that levels of phosphorylated β catenin are elevated following MLN4924 treatment.

Moreover, it is not properly understood how even in a single PSM the period of individual oscillators varies as a function of axial position!</p><p>However, this work does show that modifying the half-life of positive activators of clock genes can produce a shift in period that is of similar magnitude to the chick-mouse difference.

What we suggest in this study is that the balance between activator/inhibitor is crucial. So making the half-life of inhibitor too large will result in loss of oscillations.
