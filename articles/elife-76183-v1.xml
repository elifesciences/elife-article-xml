space-dependent manner. Dysregulation of this post-translational modification is inevitably associated with pathological diseases. Our previous work has demonstrated that non-receptor tyrosine kinase FER is upregulated in ovarian cancer, knocking down which attenuates metastatic phenotypes. However, due to the limited number of known substrates in the ovarian cancer context, the molecular basis for its pro-proliferation activity remains enigmatic. Here, we employed mass spectrometry and biochemical approaches to identify insulin receptor substrate 4 (IRS4) as a novel substrate of FER. FER engaged its kinase domain to associate with the PH and PTB domains of IRS4. Using a proximity-based tagging system in ovarian carcinoma-derived OVCAR-5 cells, we determined that FER-mediated phosphorylation of Tyr779 enables IRS4 to recruit PIK3R2/p85β, the regulatory subunit of PI3K, and activate the PI3K-AKT pathway. Rescuing <italic>IRS4</italic>-null ovarian tumor cells with phosphorylation-defective mutant, but not WT IRS4 delayed ovarian tumor cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. Overall, we revealed a kinase-substrate mode between FER and IRS4, and the pharmacological inhibition of FER kinase may be beneficial for ovarian cancer patients with PI3K-AKT hyperactivation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ovarian cancer</kwd><kwd>tyrosine phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>FER</kwd><kwd>IRS4</kwd><kwd>PIK3R2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018YFC1004603</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fan</surname><given-names>Gaofeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31872831</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fan</surname><given-names>Gaofeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32070776</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fan</surname><given-names>Gaofeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19JC1413800</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fan</surname><given-names>Gaofeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Shanghai Pujiang program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18PJ1407900</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fan</surname><given-names>Gaofeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Shanghai Shuguang Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19SG55</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fan</surname><given-names>Gaofeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012600</institution-id><institution>ShanghaiTech University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fan</surname><given-names>Gaofeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Beyond its well-accepted function in metastasis, non-receptor tyrosine kinase FER also controls ovarian tumor cell proliferation through FER-IRS4-AKT signaling axis, making itself as a promising druggable target for the disease.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ovarian cancer is the most devastating gynecological malignancy, with high morbidity and ranking fifth among all cancer-related mortality in women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Siegel et al., 2020</xref>). Patients with ovarian carcinoma are usually diagnosed at an advanced stage, resulting in a very low 5-year survival rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Siegel et al., 2020</xref>). The lack of a genetically engineered mouse model for ovarian cancer significantly delays the entire process of ovarian cancer research. In particular, the molecular mechanisms of ovarian tumor progression and metastasis are not well understood, key factors severely restricting the overall survival from ovarian cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Binaschi et al., 2011</xref>). Consequently, there is an urgent need and enormous translational potential in revealing the molecular mechanisms regulating the initiation and progression of ovarian cancers. Understanding these mechanisms will serve as the first step toward identifying novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers for intervention against this heterogeneous and deadly disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kulasingam et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Protein tyrosine kinases represent a family of important enzymes for controlling cell proliferation, motility, survival, and differentiation, whose dysfunction has been closely related to the etiology of many major diseases, including cancer. Depending on the cellular localization, the family can be further divided into receptor tyrosine kinase, which resides in the plasma membrane, and non-receptor tyrosine kinase, which resides in cytosol. The feline sarcoma kinase FES and feline sarcoma-related kinase FER represent a unique family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases. They are characterized by distinguishable N-terminal phospholipid binding and a membrane targeting FER/CIP4 homology/Bin1/amphiphysin/RVS (F-BAR) domain, which are reported to function in cell proliferation, motility, cell-to-cell adhesion, and mediate signal transmission from cell surfaces to the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Greer, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Craig, 2012</xref>). Notably, the FER protein has been shown to be aberrantly upregulated and activated in different types of carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zoubeidi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albeck and Brugge, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ren et al., 2012</xref>). Specifically, high activity of FER protein kinase has been observed in 22% of ovarian cancer tumor samples via a global phosphoproteomic approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ren et al., 2012</xref>). To date, several receptor tyrosine kinases have been reported to act upstream of FER, including EGFR, PDGFR, and integrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Craig, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim and Wong, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ivanova et al., 2013</xref>). Meanwhile, STAT3, cortactin, MET, and CRMP2, the functions of which are intensively involved in tumor cell motility and chemo-resistance, have been verified as FER substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Orlovsky et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In addition to motility, FER expression has also been associated with proliferation of tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zoubeidi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allard et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lennartsson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Oneyama et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ivanova et al., 2019</xref>). However, due to the limited number of known substrates, the molecular basis for its pro-proliferation activity remains enigmatic. In this current study, we aim to identify novel substrate(s) of FER and investigate the role of kinase-substrate regulatory modules in promoting ovarian tumorigenesis and progression. By integrating mass spectrometry analysis with biochemical and biological approaches, we have demonstrated that FER directly phosphorylates insulin receptor substrate 4 (IRS4) and that this tyrosine phosphorylation is important to create a binding site for recruiting PIK3R2/p85β. As the key regulatory subunit of PI3K kinase, recruitment of PIK3R2/p85β onto IRS4 is required for PI3K-AKT signaling pathway activation and tumorigenesis in ovarian cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mass spectrometry analysis identified IRS4 as a novel substrate of FER</title><p>To identify novel substrates for tyrosine kinase FER, tyrosine phosphorylated proteins in HEK293FT cells upon wild-type (WT) and a kinase-dead mutant (K591R) of FER transfection were enriched by the anti-pTyr antibody, 4G10.

Interestingly, compared to anti-IgG control, the OVCAR-5 cell lysates with anti-FER antibody showed the interaction between FER and IRS1 at endogenous level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We further constructed IRS1 and IRS4 plasmids, and expressed these constructs alone or in combination, as indicated, in HEK293FT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Notably, the binding between FER and IRS4 was not affected in the absence and/or presence of IRS1.</p><p>To further map the region(s) involved in the interaction between IRS4 and FER, we employed different truncation forms of IRS4 with a Myc-tag, as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>.

Surprisingly, the shortest truncation of IRS4 (1–400) maintained a similar binding affinity with FER, indicating the N-terminal region of IRS4 is crucial for the interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>To further pinpoint the key region involved in binding, we employed additional truncated versions of IRS4 with a YFP-tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Whereas the 335–400 and 401–1257 mutants demonstrated no binding affinity with FER, the 200–400 mutant maintained weak but substantial interaction with FER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The N-terminal mutant 1–334 showed strongest binding among all these truncated constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Compared to the 200–400 mutant, which only covers PTB domain, the N-terminal 1–334aa of IRS4 contains both PH and PTB domains. Therefore, we constructed the 1–400 (both PH and PTB domains), 1–200 (PH domain only), and 200–400 (PTB domain only) mutants of IRS4 to further narrow down the binding region on IRS4. However, all three mutants showed as strong binding affinity with FER as WT IRS4, suggesting both PH and PTB domains were involved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Meanwhile, we also constructed Myc-IRS4ΔPH and IRS4ΔPTB mutants to further dissect their individual roles in association with FER. Interestingly, deletion of PH or PTB domain has minimal effect on binding affinity with FER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>), suggesting disrupt either of these domains is not sufficient to collapse the protein complex. Together, these results indicated that both PH and PTB domains of IRS4 are participated in the association with the kinase FER.</p><p>Subsequently, we expressed and purified two truncated FER proteins with a GST-tag in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) and incubated them separately with whole HEK293FT cell lysates expressing Myc-tagged IRS4 to evaluate their interaction. The C-terminal region (447–822aa, SH2+ kinase domains) of FER, rather than its N-terminal region (1–446aa, F-BAR+ FX domains), showed robust interaction with IRS4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). We further constructed GFP-FER 447–822 (SH2+ kinase domains), GFP-FER 447–550 (SH2 domain), and GFP-FER 563–822 (kinase domain) truncation mutants to narrow down the binding region on FER kinase, as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>. Consistent to our in vitro purified protein binding results, the 447–822 mutant of FER (SH2+ kinase domains) was important for the interaction with IRS4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Notably, FER kinase domain, but not SH2 domain, was involved in interaction with IRS4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Furthermore, FER kinase domain, but not SH2 domain, showed strong interaction with either PH domain (1–200aa) or PTB domain (200–400aa) of IRS4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C-D</xref>).</p><p>The pleckstrin homology (PH) domain is a functional domain present in a variety of signaling and cytoskeleton-related proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maffucci and Falasca, 2001</xref>). The polarity of the PH domain suggests that the ligand may be negatively charged. Therefore, we analyzed the charge distribution on the surface of FER kinase domain. First, we obtain the crystal structure of the target protein from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database. Then, we used UCSF Chimera v1.14 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/">https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/</ext-link>) to display the 3D structures and label the charged amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A-B</xref>). As expected, the surface of the PH domain in IRS4 is mainly distributed with positive charges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Interestingly, there is a negative charge distribution on the surface of FER kinase domain, where E676, D684, and E740 are key amino acid residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). We constructed single or multiple mutants of these key amino acids of FER, and detected their interaction with IRS4 full-length or 1–200 (PH) mutants, respectively, to verify whether the mutations of negative amino acids in the FER kinase domain would affect their binding with IRS4. The results suggested that the single or multiple mutations of negative amino acids in the FER kinase domain failed to disrupt their interaction with WT IRS4 or 1–200 (PH) mutants of IRS4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C-E</xref>).</p><p>The previous work with IRS1 suggests that an NPXY motif might be expected as the PTB domain binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wolf et al., 1995</xref>). FER possesses no NPXY motif but a QPVY motif within its kinase domain. To test the necessity of this motif in binding with IRS4, we either mutated the key tyrosine residue (Y634F) or deleted this motif (Δ631–634) completely. However, compared to FER-WT, these FER mutants showed an equivalent binding affinity with IRS4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3F</xref>).</p><p>Combining together, our data suggest that both PH and PTB domains of IRS4 participate in the association with the kinase domain of FER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Mass spectrometry analysis and site-directed mutagenesis identified several FER-phosphorylated tyrosine residues on IRS4</title><p>We next investigated the molecular details in the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS4 by FER kinase.

We concluded tyrosine residues between 700 and 1093 amino acids of IRS4 were potential substrate(s) for FER kinase, since: (1) the 1–1093 mutant of IRS4 showed equivalent phosphorylation level to full-length IRS4 upon FER phosphorylation; (2) compared to the 1–699 mutant, 1–800 mutant of IRS4 showed weak but significant amount of phosphorylation.</p><p>We took two strategies to further pinpoint the tyrosine residue(s) that undergo phosphorylation in the presence of FER.

Interestingly, these four residues are within or very close to the 700–1093 region of IRS4. Afterward, we mutated all tyrosine residues within 700–1093 region of IRS4 to phenylalanine and assessed the phosphorylation level change of these mutants compared to WT IRS4. Excluding the Y828, Y847, and Y921 mutants, a tyrosine to phenylalanine substitution at residue 779 remarkably decreased the phosphorylation level of IRS4 in the presence of FER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p><p>By combining results from both mass spectrometry analysis and site-directed mutagenesis analysis, we generated a quintuple Tyr to Phe mutant of IRS4, including Y656, Y779, Y828, Y847, and Y921 (named ‘5YF’ mutant hereafter). The tyrosine phosphorylation level of 5YF mutant by FER was profoundly diminished compared to each single mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).

The effect of overexpression was confirmed via immunoblotting against an anti-IRS4 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and D</xref>). Notably, Cell Titer-Glo (CTG) luminescent cell viability assay demonstrated that the expression of IRS4 significantly elevated the proliferation capacity of these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and E</xref>).</p><p>Meanwhile, we applied the CRISPR-Cas9 system to genetically knock out the <italic>IRS4</italic> gene in those ovarian carcinoma-derived cell lines with high IRS4 expression, such as OVCAR-5 and OVCAR-3. Regrettably, after several attempts we couldn’t get a single clone of <italic>IRS4</italic> knockout (KO) OVCAR-3 cells, since this cell line prefers to grow in clusters and it cannot re-confluence after FACS procedure. Nevertheless, we successfully obtained two OVCAR-5 <italic>IRS4</italic> KO cell lines with two distinct sgRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).</p><p>A series of assays were applied to assess the possible changes in cancer cell fitness in the absence of IRS4. Results from Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI) double staining assay indicated that loss of IRS4 has minimal effect on OVCAR-5 cell survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Further cell cycle analysis in both WT and <italic>IRS4</italic> KO cell lines with PI staining indicated that loss of IRS4 significantly decreased the proportion of cells within S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B-C</xref>). Consistently, CTG assay demonstrated that the KO of <italic>IRS4</italic> notably delayed the proliferation capacity of OVCAR-5 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Ectopic re-expression of IRS4, rather than an empty vector, restored the potential of cell proliferation in <italic>IRS4</italic>-KO ovarian cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Given the technical challenge in obtaining single clone of <italic>IRS4</italic> KO in OVCAR-3 cells, we took alternative shRNA knockdown strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). Consistent with KO studies in OVCAR-5 cells, loss of <italic>IRS4</italic> in OVCAR-3 cells also led to growth retardation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>), highlighting the key role of IRS4 in maintaining ovarian tumor cell growth.</p><p>We explored further and compared the difference(s) in downstream signaling pathways upon IRS4 expression alteration. Interestingly, ectopic expression of IRS4 significantly elevated the level of phospho-AKT in HEY and OVCAR-8 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and D</xref>). Consistently, we also observed a dramatic decrease of phospho-AKT in both OVCAR-5 <italic>IRS4</italic>-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) and OVCAR-3 <italic>IRS4</italic>-KD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>), indicating a tight correlation between PI3K-AKT pathway and ovarian cancer cell proliferation. To confirm this, we treated OVCAR-5 WT cells with PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K–L</xref>) and demonstrated that the inhibition of the PI3K-AKT pathway in OVCAR-5 cells indeed decreased the phosphorylation level of AKT and cell growth in a concentration-dependent manner. These results together strongly implied an indispensable role of IRS4 in connecting the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway and proliferation of ovarian cancer cells.</p><p>To further address the importance of PI3K-AKT signaling pathway in regulating ovarian cancer cell growth, we performed a CTG-based compound library screening assay in OVCAR-5 WT ovarian cancer cells. This compound library contains 198 small molecule inhibitors targeting key node genes in cancer cell signaling transduction and metabolism. Thirty out of 198 compounds showed proliferation inhibition greater than 75% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Among these, 16 compounds targeted the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). This result strongly supports the supposition that the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway plays a critical role in controlling the proliferation of OVCAR-5 ovarian cancer cells, and it is of great interest to understand the molecular details of how IRS4 mediates AKT activation.</p><p>Interestingly, whereas there was a dramatic decrease of phospho-AKT signal upon IRS4 deletion, we also observed evident elevation in phospho-ERK level in OVCAR-5 <italic>IRS4</italic>-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), indicating a potential compensatory effect of ERK signaling pathway which may contribute to the survival and proliferative capacities of OVCAR-5 cancer cells after IRS4 deletion. To test this hypothesis, we treated OVCAR-5 WT cells with PI3K inhibitor LY294002 along with ERK pathway inhibitor U0126, followed by CTG assay. The inhibition of both PI3K-AKT pathway and ERK pathway in OVCAR-5 cells almost blocked cell growth completely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M</xref>). Therefore, in the absence of IRS4-mediated PI3K-AKT activation, OVCAR-5 ovarian cancer cells would upregulate ERK activity in a compensating manner, thereby enhancing survival and proliferative capacities.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>PIK3R2 was identified as one of the major downstream signaling components of IRS4 by proximity labeling PUP-IT assay</title><p>Encouraged by our previous results we attempted to delineate the molecular mechanism by which IRS4 regulates the AKT signaling pathway, and therefore the likely mechanism by which it regulates the cell proliferation of ovarian cancer. We postulated that FER-mediated IRS4 phosphorylation would facilitate signaling molecule recruitment, which is important for AKT activation. To assess this hypothesis, we applied pupylation-based interaction tagging (PUP-IT) system to identify potential interacting proteins of phosphorylated IRS4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Interestingly, this preferential association of PIK3R2 appeared again when comparing interaction proteins between WT and 5YF mutant of IRS4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). The results from these PUP-IT assays strongly suggest that the FER-triggered tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS4 facilitated the recruitment of PIK3R2 and that Tyr779 was the major contributing residue.</p><p>To further validate the PUP-IT results, we performed an immunoprecipitation experiment to assess the essentiality of IRS4 phosphorylation on Y779 site in recruiting PIK3R2.

Further co-immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that both PIK3R1 and PIK3R2 can form complex with IRS4, and the presence of PIK3R1 wouldn’t block the formation of the IRS4-PIK3R2 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

We observed decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS4 after tandem IRS4 immunoprecipitation and pTyr immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The association of IRS4 and PIK3R2 was also decreased in FER-deficient OVCAR-5 ovarian cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). IGF1R indeed phosphorylated IRS4 in the presence of ligand IGF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A-B</xref>). However, small molecular IGF1R inhibitor BMS-536924 didn’t decrease tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS4 in the absence of IGF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A-B</xref>), indicating FER-mediated phosphorylation and activation of IRS4 in an IGF1-independent manner. Moreover, IGF1R phosphorylated IRS4 probably in a Tyr779-independent manner, since mutating tyrosine 779 to phenylalanine didn’t decrease phosphorylation level of IRS4 mediated by IGF1R receptor tyrosine kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>In a screen of 586 compounds, TAE684 has been identified as a potent inhibitor against FES, the family member of FER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hellwig et al., 2012</xref>). The high similarity between FER and FES inspired us to evaluate if TAE684 exhibits an equivalent inhibitory effect on FER. We first overexpressed FER in HEK293FT cells, followed by TAE684 treatment. We used Tyr402 auto-phosphorylation signal as a readout for measurement of FER kinase inhibition. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>, TAE684 can robustly inhibit the auto-phosphorylation of FER at Tyr402, with IC<sub>50</sub> around 8.8 nM. Interestingly, compared to lysates from myeloid leukemia cell HL-60, we detected no FES expression in ovarian cancer cell lines used in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Of note, ovarian cells treated with TAE684 did show dose-dependent inhibition on the kinase activity of FER, as illustrated by pY402 FER blotting analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Meanwhile, we witnessed the reduced global tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS4, as well as decreased binding between IRS4 and PIK3R2 in the presence of TAE684 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Of note, the kinase activity of AKT was largely dampened upon TAE684 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Collectively, genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of tyrosine kinase FER in ovarian cancer cells leads to decreased global tyrosine phosphorylation and PIK3R2 recruitment of IRS4, which is consistent with our ectopic overexpression studies in HEK293FT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>).</p><p>Our previous observations have already demonstrated a retarded cell proliferation in IRS4-deficient ovarian cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–H , and J</xref>). To further evaluate the importance of tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS4, we re-expressed these Y to F mutants, along with the WT, in OVCAR-5 <italic>IRS4</italic>-KO ovarian cancer cells. Whereas re-expression of WT IRS4 in <italic>IRS4</italic>-KO cell line fully recovered the growth defect, 5YF mutants of IRS4 failed to rescue cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). We did observe a certain extent of growth defect rescue with cells re-expressing in the Y779F mutant of IRS4, but these cells still showed significantly delayed proliferation rate compared to the parental ovarian cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). We repeated the whole experiment in the presence of ERK pathway inhibitor U0126. Consistently, <italic>IRS4</italic> KO OVCAR-5 cells treated with U0126 demonstrated profound inhibition in cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Most importantly, re-expression of WT IRS4 in <italic>IRS4</italic>-KO cells exposed to U0126 treatment recovered the growth capacity to the same level as U0126 treatment alone, whereas 5YF mutant of IRS4 failed to rescue cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). In addition, OVCAR-5 cells treated with TAE684 showed a dose-dependent growth inhibition, as illustrated by CTG assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C-D</xref>). These results demonstrate that the FER kinase-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS4 plays a key function in controlling cell proliferation in ovarian cancer.</p><p>The significant difference between the WT and YF mutants of IRS4 in regulating cell proliferation in vitro prompted us to extend the comparison of ovarian tumorigenesis in vivo.

The IRS family consists of four closely related members IRS1–IRS4 and two distant relatives IRS5/DOK4 and IRS6/DOK5. Although the members of the IRSs family are similar in overall structure and possess high homology, there are differences in tissue and subcellular distribution, and interactions with protein molecules containing the SH2 domain, which enable the six IRS proteins to have different biological characteristics and mediate different signal transduction pathways.</p><p>Combining mass spectrometry analysis with biochemical and biological approaches, we have revealed one of the IRS family members, IRS4, as a novel substrate of non-receptor tyrosine kinase FER. FER binds directly to IRS4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and phosphorylates several tyrosine residues on IRS4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The proximity labeling PUP-IT assay further confirmed that FER-mediated phosphorylation of Tyr779 on IRS4 is critical in recruiting PIK3R2/p85β, the key regulatory subunit of PI3K kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). While ectopic overexpression of FER dramatically increased tyrosine phosphorylation and PIK3R2 recruitment of IRS4, CRISPR-Cas9 directed KO or pharmacological inhibition of the endogenous kinase in ovarian cancer cells remarkably reduced tyrosine phosphorylation and PIK3R2 recruitment of IRS4. The current working model is present in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L</xref>.</p><p>By replacing two SHP2 binding COOH-terminal tyrosines of IRS1 to phenylalanine, Morris White and his colleagues have demonstrated that this mutant form of IRS1 failed to bind SHP2, and exhibited increased tyrosine phosphorylation, phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase binding, and activation of protein synthesis in response to insulin. These results clearly suggest that SHP2 attenuates the phosphorylation and downstream signal transmission of IRS1 and that the interaction of IRS1 and SHP2 is an important regulatory event which attenuates insulin metabolic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Myers et al., 1998</xref>). By using liver-specific <italic>SHP2</italic>-KO mice, Fawaz Haj and his colleagues were able to show that SHP2 is a negative regulator of hepatic insulin action, and its deletion enhances the activation of PI3K/AKT pathway downstream of the IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Matsuo et al., 2010</xref>). Unlike IRS1 and IRS2, IRS4 has no SHP2 binding motif to recruit tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wauman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fantin et al., 1998</xref>). This unique feature allows IRS4 to maintain constitutive hyperactivation of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wauman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fantin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cuevas et al., 2007</xref>), leading to growth factor-independent cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in mammary epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ikink et al., 2016</xref>). Genetic ablation of IRS4 with either CRISPR-Cas9 or shRNA almost completely abolished the activation of AKT kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and I</xref>) and dramatically delayed cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–H , and J</xref>). Interestingly, these cells were very sensitive to inhibitors against the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K–L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). This suggests that ovarian cells with high IRS4 expression may depend on IRS4-mediated PI3K-AKT activation for proliferation and survival. Any pharmacological perturbation of this pathway would benefit therapeutic outcomes for patients suffered from this deadly disease. Furthermore, our results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4H, M</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6F</xref>) also suggested simultaneously targeting both IRS4-mediated PI3K-AKT and ERK pathways may deliver a more effective strategy to treat ovarian cancer.</p><p>There are seven Y-X-X-M motifs on IRS4, which have been speculated as potential binding sites for the regulatory subunit of PI3K. Our results from mass spectrometry and site-directed mutagenesis analysis revealed five major Tyr residues as potential substrates for FER kinase: Tyr656, -779, -828, -847, and -921 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref>). However, it also should not be ignored that the 1–550aa truncation mutant of IRS4 also possessed weak but detectable phosphorylation signals in the presence of FER kinase. Actually, Tyr487 of human IRS4 also resembles YXXM motif that upon phosphorylation is predicted to bind SH2 domains in the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K. Among five major Tyr residues, Tyr779, -828, and -921 reside in YXXM motifs to create potential PI3K binding sites. Proximity labeling PUP-IT assays further demonstrated that Tyr779 was the major site responsible for PIK3R2/p85β recruitment on IRS4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–F</xref>) and this result was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Our data provides compelling evidence to decipher the molecular details on PIK3R2/p85β association with IRS4.</p><p>It has been reported that FER is significantly upregulated in ovarian cancer cell lines and ovarian cancer tumor samples, compared to normal controls and that its downregulation by RNAi results in substantial attenuation of tumor cell migration, invasion, and metastasis, with little change in primary tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fan et al., 2016</xref>). In the current study, tumor growth was significantly suppressed in the absence of IRS4, and re-expressing phosphorylation-defective mutant of IRS4 failed to rescue proliferation rate of the tumor cells. There is one determining factor that should be taken into consideration for aligning these two studies. In the previous report, CAOV4 cells have been used in the majority of in vivo assays, which expresses no IRS4. However, two cell lines used in this study, OVCAR-5 and OVCAR-3, have high IRS4 expression. We think this key difference could explain the different functional output of FER in both experimental context: In the absence of IRS4, FER regulates ovarian cancer cell motility and invasiveness mainly through MET-GAB1-SHP2-ERK1/2 signaling pathway, with MET and GAB1 as its substrates; in IRS4-positive ovarian cancer cells, FER-mediated phosphorylation of Tyr779 enables IRS4 to recruit PIK3R2/p85β, the regulatory subunit of PI3K, and activate the PI3K-AKT pathway for proliferation.</p><p>Besides IRS4 and IGF1R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Stanicka et al., 2018</xref>), our mass spectrometry analysis captured several interesting FER-interacting hits with functions of solute transportation, including <italic>SLC25A5</italic>, <italic>SLC25A6 SLC3A2</italic>, <italic>ATP1A1,</italic> and <italic>ATP2A2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Notably, tyrosine phosphorylation has been reported as an important layer of regulation for transporter proteins’ stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Loureiro et al., 2019</xref>) and activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Xu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hedges et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wertheimer et al., 2008</xref>). We also identified CTLC (Clathrin Heavy Chain) and COPA (COPI Coat Complex Subunit Alpha) as potential FER-associated proteins, the functions of which are involved in both Clathrin-dependent and -independent intracellular trafficking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In addition, regulators in cytosol-nucleus shuttle, for example, <italic>XPO1</italic> and <italic>IPO4</italic>, were also ranked high in the hit list (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Considering the well-documented function of FER kinase in vesicle trafficking and cell motility, these findings will definitely shed new light on molecular mechanism on FER’s function.</p><p>In summation, our study has demonstrated IRS4 as a novel substrate for non-receptor tyrosine kinase FER. This kinase-substrate regulatory mode between FER and IRS4, which leads to PIK3R2 recruitment and AKT activation, is critical for ovarian tumor cell growth. This work expounds on the versatile functions of the FER kinase, especially within ovarian cancer, and highlights the unmet need to develop a small molecule inhibitor of the kinase to benefit patients.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and chemical reagents</title><p>OVCAR-5 and OVCAR-3 cell lines were obtained from Robert Lucito lab in Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

Mass spectrometry was used to identify targets of the FER kinase and IRS4 was identified as one of the top candidates. As reported by the authors, high IRS4 expression correlates with worse outcomes in ovarian cancer patients, which emphasizes the significance of this study. Overall the data presented are clear and support a role for IRS4 in growth regulation. However, the data are limited to primarily one cell line and over-expression studies which diminishes the impact. Moreover, the novel mechanistic information gained regarding IRS4 function is limited. For these reasons, publication in <italic>eLife</italic> is considered premature at this time.</p><p>1) IRS4 belongs to the family of insulin receptor substrate proteins that have been best characterized for mediating signaling downstream of the insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptors to regulate organism metabolism and growth, respectively. IGF-1R was also identified as a target of FER in the mass-spec analysis. The authors do not address if the function of IRS4 is dependent upon this FER-mediated phosphorylation of IGF-1R. In addition, the IRS4 tyrosine mutations could also interfere with IGF-1R signaling to impact tumor growth, and this should be investigated to be able to attribute the IRS4-dependent effects to FER.</p><p>2) In a previous study (G. Fan et al., Genes and Dev, 2016), ovarian carcinoma cells with or without expression of FER were injected subcutaneously in mice and differences in tumor growth were not observed. However, metastasis to the lungs was decreased. In the current study, tumor growth was suppressed when IRS4 expression was knocked out. This raises concern that the growth-promoting effects of IRS4 are independent of FER. This discrepancy needs to be addressed.</p><p>3) All of the co-immunoprecipitation experiments are performed using over-expressed IRS4 and FER. The ability of endogenous proteins to interact should be assessed to validate this interaction.</p><p>4) In previous studies, the authors identified the MET receptor as a target of FER and showed that it plays a role in the ligand-independent activation of the receptor to promote invasion and migration. In the current study, inhibition of MET does not inhibit AKT activation indicating that these are two discreet pathways. It would be informative to determine if there is a mutually exclusive expression of IRS4 and MET in human ovarian tumors.</p><p>5) Throughout the manuscript, the authors state that FER-IRS4 promotes ovarian carcinoma proliferation. However, the assays show overall growth. The decrease in total cell numbers could reflect either proliferation or survival changes. Given the important role of PI3K-AKT signaling in survival, individual assays to assess the specific mechanism that contributes to growth should be performed.</p><p>6) The majority of experiments were performed using only OVCAR5 cells, with the exception that knockdown of IRS4 in OVCAR3 cells also suppressed growth. This limited use of cells raises concern about the general conclusions about IRS4 function in ovarian cancer. Inclusion of experiments using human PDX models of ovarian cancer would strengthen the clinical significance of the conclusions of the study. In addition, it would be informative to express IRS4 in other negative cell lines to determine its impact on their function.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This is an interesting paper investigating the role of IRS4 as a decisive adapter protein in the growth of some ovarian cancers that links the FER tyrosine kinase to the PI3K/AKT by binding to PIK3R2. Generally, I like the paper because it combines cell-based molecular studies with the function of IRS4 to promote tumor growth; however, as I was reading the paper there were certain questions arising, which might be considered by the authors:</p><p>1. Regarding the interaction of FER with IRS4. The data suggest that the N-terminal region of IRS4 is important, which implicates the PH or PTB domain, whereas mutation of FER implicated the C-terminal part of the kinase for the interaction. Although the authors have all the tools, they leave this interaction question open for discussion. IRS PTB domains usually bind NPEpY motifs, which do not exist in FER; however, they discuss the possibility that a PGEpY motif plays this role. The authors should test this possibility. Is this site phosphorylated? It is also possible that the PH domain contributes to the interaction. PH domain in IRS tend to bind to negative peptide motifs. Do such motifs exist in FER and could that contribute to the binding specificity?</p><p>2. Regarding specificity, does FER interact with IRS1 or IRS2? By using HEK cells, the authors bias their analysis toward IRS4 as some clones of this line only express IRS4. Functional interactions with IRS1 and IRS2 might implicate this signaling system in metabolic or normal growth regulation. The authors should test this possibility in the assay systems. Does overexpression of IRS1 or 2 block IRS4 action? Otherwise, I am left with the feeling that FER-IRS4 is very specific---which might be the wrong impression.</p><p>3. Similar concerns arise for the specific role of PIK3R2 in the mechanism of Figure 6I. I would expect that IRS4 interacts with other PI3K regulatory isoforms. Are the results biased toward PIK3R2 owing to the selection of cells that over express this protein? If IRS4 does interact with other PIK regulatory isoforms, would such interactions also promote growth? Or would expression of the other isoforms suppress the formation of the FER/IRS4/PIK3R2 complex? I suspect they have the tools for this experiment.</p><p>4. What about the comparison of signaling generated by FER/IRS4 compared against IGF1R/IRS4, especially since IGF1R has been implicated in these systems previously. It seems the authors have the perfect system to investigate whether FER/IRS4 is fundamentally different than IGF1R/IRS4 at the growth regulatory level. Is IGF1R activated in the test cell system?</p><p>5. Immunostaining is of concern owing to the specificity of the IRS4 antibody. The authors should show that IRS4 antibody only recognizes IRS4 and not the other isoforms to validate their experiments in Figure 7.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;FER-mediated phosphorylation and PIK3R2 recruitment on IRS4 promotes AKT activation and tumorigenesis in ovarian cancer&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Jonathan Cooper (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>This paper investigates the mechanism of cellular proliferation through FER (feline sarcoma-related kinase). The authors demonstrate that FER directly phosphorylates IRS4 (insulin receptor substrate 4) and that this tyrosine phosphorylation is important to create a binding site for recruiting the PI3K and activate the AKT cascade to promote proliferation. This can cause increased tumor burden in mice. This is important because ovarian cancer ranks 5th among all cancer related mortality in women.</p><p>The conclusion that FER / IRS4 contributes to tumor burden (Figure 7E) is generally consistent with the major conclusion that IRS4 signaling can exacerbate ovarian cancer burden. This is important; however, the relative contribution of IRS4 verses &quot;the other&quot; pathways is loosely established/discussed, especially as risk of death from ovarian cancer is still rather fatal in patients with low IRS4. The biochemical analysis is broadly consistent with the story, but several shortcomings weaken the experimental mechanism, which require attention by the authors.</p><p>Specific Points</p><p>1. The analysis of the interaction between IRS4 and FER is reasonably rigorous even though it relies largely upon overexpression of the relevant proteins; however, the analysis lacks identification of the binding sites in the PTK domain of FER that interact directly with the PH and PTB domains of IRS4. (lines 170- 84). Based upon previous work with IRS1, an NPXY motif might be expected as the PTB domain binding site. By contrast, a cluster of acid residues might be expected for the PH domain (See PMID 9813005). This should be established experimentally or at least discussed.</p><p>2. Line 221 suggests that there are at least five tyrosine phosphorylation sites in IRS1; however, some other tyrosine phosphorylation sites appear to exist, and this should be mentioned at line 222 (See Figure 3F). How might these sites contribute?</p><p>3. While the authors argue the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway plays a critical role in controlling the proliferation of OVCAR-5 ovarian cancer cells, they do not clarify why the cells can grow without IRS4 and reduced AKT activity. Is the residual activity important or is there another pathway? Can the other pathway operate when IRS4 is not elevated in most other ovarian tumor cells (See Figure 4A and Figure 7E).</p><p>4. Although Tyr779 enhanced the recruitment of PIK3R2 and activation of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, is the sequence surrounding this site expected to be recognized by the SH2 domain? This point is important because PIK3R1 can complex with both WT and Y779F mutant of IRS4 which should have a similar motif specificity. These results suggest that an intermediate might be involved. There are many possibilities in the MS/MS list. Generally, the different contributions of PIK3R1 and PIK3R2 seem confusing and ignored by the authors.</p><p>5. Inclusion of pAKT levels in Figure 5H would strengthen the conclusion that Y779-dependent recruitment of PIK3R2 to IRS4 is primarily responsible for activating AKT to drive growth.</p><p>6. Tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS4 and the binding of PIK3R2 decreased upon FER-ko, but it seems substantial activity remains (See Figure 6C). Moreover, IGF1R inhibition failed to implicate the IGF1R as an alternative kinase, which is a reasonable alternative; however, perhaps IGF1 should have been added to the assay.</p><p>7. At line 358…. TAE684 is not a specific FER inhibitor, so the conclusion of the experiment, while consistent with the story, might be wrong.</p><p>8. At line 378…. It is hard to determine that the FER kinase mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS4 plays a key function in controlling cell proliferation in ovarian cancer because the cells still grow, although slowly. It might be important to inactivate the other pathways to cause complete inhibition of growth, and then show that FER-&gt; IRS4 can restore (rescue) tumor growth as demonstrated decades ago with 32D cells experiments (PMID: 8798677). The in vivo tumor growth experiments do show a contribution of FER Irs4 in tumor burden. Regardless, the absence of IRS4 slows but does not prevent tumor growth, so it is important to understand the alternative pathway(s), which also lead cause substantial patient death.</p><p>9. Line 442-444: The role of SHP2 in IRS1 and IRS2 has not been clearly demonstrated to attenuate PI3K signaling. Thus, whether the lack of SHP2 in IRS4 exacerbates PI3K signaling could be deleted unless an appropriate reference is cited.</p><p>10. Lines 450-452: The authors should estimate of the contribution of IRS4 signaling versus other pathways for tumor survival or burden in order to establish the therapeutic benefit for disruption of the FER-IRS4 pathway. Based on Figure 7E the improvement seems significant but small, so the other pathways must be rather robust. What are they?</p><p>11. Lines 454-461: Can the authors tell us which of the MS/MS verified Tyr(P) sites reside in YXXM motifs to create potential PI3K binding sites. This might be achieved from clearer writing.</p><p>12. Inclusion in the Discussion of how the current study differs from the previous knockout study of FER would clarify the discrepancies in the outcomes of the two studies. The authors provide this explanation in the response to reviewers and should include it in the Discussion.</p><p>13. On Page 10, line 270, LY294002 is described as an AKT inhibitor. This is incorrect, LY294002 is a PI3K inhibitor.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76183.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: The authors appealed the original decision.

To address if the function of IRS4 is dependent upon FER-mediated phosphorylation of IGF-1R, we applied IGF-1R inhibitor BMS-536924 (S1012) to inhibit IGF-1R activity in OVCAR5 cell line. The efficiency of BMS-536924 was pretty good, as demonstrated by decreased levels of pY1131 IGF-1R. However, pharmacological inhibition of IGF-1R didn’t decrease tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS4 or recruitment of PIK3R2 in OVCAR5 cells (Figure 6—figure supplement 1, line 352-355). In contrast, knockout of FER or treatment with FER inhibitor TAE684 (S1108) in OVCAR5 cells inhibited the phosphorylation of IRS4, as well as the recruitment of PIK3R2 (Figure 6C-D, line 347-352 and line 357-364).</p><p>These results suggest that the phosphorylation and activation of IRS4 has the IGF1R-independent pathway which mediated by kinase FER.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In a previous study (G.

Further loss-of-function assay also suggest that FER-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS4 is important for PIK3R2 recruitment (Figure 5 and Figure 6C-D) and downstream AKT pathway activation (Figure 4F, 4I and 6D), which is important for ovarian cancer cell proliferation (Figure 4 and 6).</p><p>There is one determining factor should be taken into consideration for solving abovementioned discrepancy. In the previous paper <italic>(G. Fan et al., Genes &amp; Dev, 2016)</italic>, the majority of in vivo assays was done with CAOV4 cells, which has no IRS4 expression at all. In this current manuscript, two cell lines we used in our phenotypic assays, OVCAR5 and OVCAR3, have high IRS4 expression. We think this key difference could explain the different functional output of FER in both experimental context: In the absence of IRS4, FER regulates ovarian cancer cell motility and invasiveness mainly through MET-GAB1-SHP2-ERK1/2 signaling pathway, with MET and GAB1 as its substrates; in IRS4-positive ovarian cancer cells, FER-mediated phosphorylation of Tyr779 enables IRS4 to recruit PIK3R2/p85β, the regulatory subunit of PI3K, and activate the PI3K-AKT pathway for proliferation (line 431-440).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) All of the co-immunoprecipitation experiments are performed using over-expressed IRS4 and FER.

The N-terminal mutant 1-334 showed strongest binding among all these truncated constructs (Figure 2E, lane 153-154). Compared to the 200-400 mutant, which only covers PTB domain, the N-terminal 1-334aa of IRS4 contains both PH and PTB domains. To solve this issue, we constructed the 1-400 (both PH and PTB domains), 1-200 (PH domain only) and 200-400 (PTB domain only) mutants of IRS4 to further narrow down the binding region on IRS4. However, all three mutants showed as strong binding affinity with FER as WT IRS4, suggesting both PH and PTB domains were involved (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A, line 156-160). Meanwhile, we also constructed Myc-IRS4ΔPH and IRS4ΔPTB mutants to further dissect their individual roles in association with FER. Interestingly, deletion of PH or PTB domain has minimal effect on binding affinity with FER (Figure 2—figure supplement 2B, line 160-164), suggesting disrupt either of these domains is not sufficient to collapse the protein complex. Together, these results indicated that both PH and PTB domains of IRS4 are participated in the association with the kinase FER.</p><p>IRS4 PTB domains usually bind NPEpY motifs, which do not exist in FER; however, there is one PGEpY motif within FER protein sequence. We either mutated key tyrosine residue (Y492F) or deleted this motif completely (Δ489-492), and compared IRS4-binding affinity of these mutants with wt FER. However, compared to FER WT, these FER mutants showed equivalent binding affinity with IRS4, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>.</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-76183-sa2-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Meanwhile, we constructed GFP-FER 447-822 (SH2+kinase domains), GFP-FER 447-550 (SH2 domain) and GFP-FER 563-822 (kinase domain) truncation mutants to further narrow down the binding region on FER kinase. Notably, FER kinase domain, but not SH2 domain, is involved in the interaction with IRS4 (Figure 2G, line 171-177). Furthermore, FER kinase domain, but not SH2 domain, shows strong interaction with either PH domain (1-200aa) or PTB domain (200-400aa) of IRS4 (Figure 2—figure supplement 2C-D, line 177-179).

The PH domain is a functional domain present in a variety of signaling and cytoskeleton-related proteins. The polarity of the PH domain suggests that the ligand may be negatively charged.

Regarding specificity, does FER interact with IRS1 or IRS2? By using HEK cells, the authors bias their analysis toward IRS4 as some clones of this line only express IRS4.

Does overexpression of IRS1 or 2 block IRS4 action? Otherwise, I am left with the feeling that FER-IRS4 is very specific---which might be the wrong impression.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer to give this great suggestion. Actually, Masanori Iwanishi and his colleagues have showed interaction between IRS1 and FER at endogenous level in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (JBC, 2000). We also performed endogenous co-immunoprecipitation assay in OVCAR5 cell line.

Similar concerns arise for the specific role of PIK3R2 in the mechanism of Figure 6I. I would expect that IRS4 interacts with other PI3K regulatory isoforms. Are the results biased toward PIK3R2 owing to the selection of cells that over express this protein? If IRS4 does interact with other PIK regulatory isoforms, would such interactions also promote growth? Or would expression of the other isoforms suppress the formation of the FER/IRS4/PIK3R2 complex? I suspect they have the tools for this experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer to give this great suggestion. We first constructed PIK3R1 and PIK3R2 plasmids, and expressed these constructs alone or in combination, as indicated, in HEK293 cells. We confirmed interaction between IRS4 and PIK3R2. Notably, the binding affinity was not affected in the absence and/or presence of PIK3R1 (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A , line 324-328).

Next, we want to test whether IRS4 could recruit PIK3R1 through same mechanism. Interestingly, our data indicated that PIK3R1 could form complex with both WT and Y779F mutant of IRS4 with equivalent binding affinity (Figure 5—figure supplement 1B, line 328-330). Therefore, both PIK3R1 and PIK3R2 can be recruited to IRS4, but with distinctive binding mechanism.</p><p>Notably, PIK3R1/p85α has a tumor-suppressor function, whereas PIK3R2/p85β is an oncogene. Expression of PIK3R2, encoding the p85β regulatory subunit of PI3K, increases with advanced tumor stage in melanoma, breast, and squamous cell lung carcinoma. Its overexpression induces metastasis in mouse models, whereas preclinical deletion of PIK3R2 triggers tumor regression and reduces invasion. Therefore, the abovementioned difference in binding mechanism with IRS4 may shed some light to decipher their opposite roles in tumorigenesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. What about the comparison of signaling generated by FER/IRS4 compared against IGF1R/IRS4, especially since IGF1R has been implicated in these systems previously. It seems the authors have the perfect system to investigate whether FER/IRS4 is fundamentally different than IGF1R/IRS4 at the growth regulatory level. Is IGF1R activated in the test cell system?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer to point out this issue. To address if the function of IRS4 is dependent upon FER-mediated phosphorylation of IGF-1R, we applied IGF-1R inhibitor BMS-536924 (S1012) to inhibit IGF-1R activity in OVCAR5 cell line. The efficiency of BMS-536924 was pretty good, as demonstrated by decreased levels of pY1131 IGF-1R. However, pharmacological inhibition of IGF-1R didn’t decrease tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS4 or recruitment of PIK3R2 in OVCAR5 cells (Figure 6—figure supplement 1, line 352-355). In contrast, knockout of FER or treatment with FER inhibitor TAE684 (S1108) in OVCAR5 cells inhibited the phosphorylation of IRS4, as well as the recruitment of PIK3R2 (Figure 6C-D, line 347-352 and 357-364).</p><p>These results suggest that the phosphorylation and activation of IRS4 has the IGF1R-independent pathway which mediated by kinase FER.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

The authors demonstrate that FER directly phosphorylates IRS4 (insulin receptor substrate 4) and that this tyrosine phosphorylation is important to create a binding site for recruiting the PI3K and activate the AKT cascade to promote proliferation. This can cause increased tumor burden in mice. This is important because ovarian cancer ranks 5th among all cancer related mortality in women.</p><p>The conclusion that FER / IRS4 contributes to tumor burden (Figure 7E) is generally consistent with the major conclusion that IRS4 signaling can exacerbate ovarian cancer burden. This is important; however, the relative contribution of IRS4 verses &quot;the other&quot; pathways is loosely established/discussed, especially as risk of death from ovarian cancer is still rather fatal in patients with low IRS4. The biochemical analysis is broadly consistent with the story, but several shortcomings weaken the experimental mechanism, which require attention by the authors.</p><p>Specific Points</p><p>1. The analysis of the interaction between IRS4 and FER is reasonably rigorous even though it relies largely upon overexpression of the relevant proteins; however, the analysis lacks identification of the binding sites in the PTK domain of FER that interact directly with the PH and PTB domains of IRS4. (lines 170- 84). Based upon previous work with IRS1, an NPXY motif might be expected as the PTB domain binding site. By contrast, a cluster of acid residues might be expected for the PH domain (See PMID 9813005).

Can the other pathway operate when IRS4 is not elevated in most other ovarian tumor cells (See Figure 4A and Figure 7E).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this issue. By using RNA interference technology (RNAi), Eva Cuevas and her colleagues have shown that IRS-4 plays an important role in HepG2 proliferation/differentiation and exerts its actions through ERK and p70S6K activation in a Ras/Raf/MEK1/2- and PI3Kinase/AKT-independent manner and in a PKC-dependent way (J Hepatol. 2007 PMID: 17408801).</p><p>Interestingly in our study, whereas there was a dramatic decrease of phospho-AKT signal upon IRS4 deletion, we also observed evident elevation in phospho-ERK level in O5 IRS4-KO cells (Figure 4F), indicating a compensatory effect of ERK signaling pathway which may contribute to the survival and proliferative capacities of OVCAR-5 cancer cells.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we treated O5 WT cells with PI3K inhibitor LY294002 along with ERK inhibitor U0126, followed by CTG assay (new Figure 4M).

Therefore, in the absence of IRS4-mediated PI3K-AKT activation, OVCAR-5 ovarian cancer cells would upregulate ERK activity in a compensating manner, thereby enhancing survival and proliferative capacities.

Although Tyr779 enhanced the recruitment of PIK3R2 and activation of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, is the sequence surrounding this site expected to be recognized by the SH2 domain? This point is important because PIK3R1 can complex with both WT and Y779F mutant of IRS4 which should have a similar motif specificity. These results suggest that an intermediate might be involved. There are many possibilities in the MS/MS list. Generally, the different contributions of PIK3R1 and PIK3R2 seem confusing and ignored by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this issue. There are 7 YXXM motifs on IRS4, which have been speculated as potential binding sites for the regulatory subunit of PI3K, including PIK3R1 and PIK3R2. Our results from mass spectrometry and site-directed mutagenesis analysis revealed 5 major tyrosine residues phosphorylated by FER kinase: Tyr-656, -779, -828, -847 and -921. Among them, Tyr-779, -828 and -921 reside in YXXM motifs to create potential PI3K binding sites.</p><p>Therefore, the answer is “Yes” that the sequence surrounding Tyr779 site is expected to be recognized by the SH2 domain of PI3K. Given the different outcomes of phos-Tyr779 in recruiting PIK3R2 and PIK3R1 onto IRS4, it is possible that an intermediate might be involved in differentiating the binding mechanisms of these two regulatory subunits of PI3K, as suggested by the reviewer. We will further digest the MS/MS list and test this hypothesis. What is also possible is that PIK3R1 and PIK3R2 may rely on different YXXM motifs for docking onto IRS4 and subsequent downstream signaling regulation. In this current study, we identified Tyr779 of IRS4 subjected to FER kinase-mediated phosphorylation. Furthermore, using a proximity-based tagging system, we determined that FER-mediated phosphorylation of Tyr779 enables IRS4 to recruit PIK3R2/p85β, the regulatory subunit of PI3K, and activate the PI3K-AKT pathway. The abovementioned two hypotheses definitely deserve more investigation as the continuous study of this project in the lab.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS4 and the binding of PIK3R2 decreased upon FER-ko, but it seems substantial activity remains (See Figure 6C).

However, small molecular IGF-1R inhibitor BMS-536924 didn’t decrease tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS4 in the absence of IGF1 (new Figure 6—figure supplement 1A-B), indicating FER-mediated phosphorylation and activation of IRS4 in an IGF1-independent manner. Moreover, IGF-1R phosphorylated IRS4 probably in a Tyr779-independent manner, since mutating Tyrosine 779 to Phenylalanine didn’t decrease phosphorylation level of IRS4 mediated by IGF1R receptor tyrosine kinase (new Figure 6—figure supplement 1C).

Due to the long-term lack of necessary attention of the importance of FER protein kinase, currently we not only know little about the activation mechanism and substrate of FER, but also the research and development of FER-specific inhibitors lags far behind other kinase proteins. Fortunately, Sabine Hellwig and his colleagues have identified TAE684 as a small molecule compound against FES tyrosine kinase (Cell Chem Bio. 2012 PMID: 22520759). Given that FES and FER kinase proteins belong to the same sub-family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, we started to test whether TAE684 could be used as a small molecule kinase inhibitor against FER.</p><p>First, we measured FER kinase activity inhibition by TAE684. We overexpressed FER in HEK293FT cells, followed by TAE684 treatment. We used Tyr402 auto-phosphorylation signal as a readout for measurement of FER kinase inhibition.

It is hard to determine that the FER kinase mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS4 plays a key function in controlling cell proliferation in ovarian cancer because the cells still grow, although slowly.

Therefore, ERK pathway is the alternative pathway we are looking for.</p><p>For this question, we first treated IRS4 knockout OVCAR-5 cells with ERK pathway inhibitor U0126, and observed profound inhibition in cell growth. Most importantly, re-expression of WT IRS4 in IRS4-KO cells exposed to U0126 treatment recovered the growth capacity to the same level as U0126 treatment alone, whereas 5YF mutant of IRS4 failed to rescue cell proliferation (new Figure 6F). This rescue experiment suggested that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS4, executed by FER kinase and alternatively IGF-1R in the presence of ligand IGF-1, plays a significant role in controlling cell proliferation in ovarian cancer.

That may partially explain the improvement seems significant but small based on IRS4 expression and signaling.</p><p>In question 3, we found that in the absence of IRS4-mediated PI3K-AKT activation, OVCAR-5 ovarian cancer cells would upregulate ERK activity in a compensating manner, thereby enhancing survival and proliferative capacities. Pharmacological inhibition of both PI3K-AKT pathway and ERK pathway in OVCAR-5 cells almost blocked cell growth completely. Therefore, ERK pathway is the alternative pathway we are looking for.</p><p>In question 8, we treated IRS4 knockout OVCAR-5 cells with ERK pathway inhibitor U0126, and observed profound inhibition in cell growth. Most importantly, re-expression of WT IRS4 in IRS4-KO cells exposed to U0126 treatment recovered the growth capacity to the same level as U0126 treatment alone, whereas 5YF mutant of IRS4 failed to rescue cell proliferation. This rescue experiment suggested that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS4, executed by FER kinase and alternatively IGF-1R in the presence of ligand IGF-1, plays a significant role in controlling cell proliferation in ovarian cancer.</p><p>Therefore, in sum, simultaneously targeting both IRS4-mediated PI3K-AKT and ERK pathways may deliver a more effective strategy to treat ovarian cancer (Discussion section lines 513-515).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. Lines 454-461: Can the authors tell us which of the MS/MS verified Tyr(P) sites reside in YXXM motifs to create potential PI3K binding sites. This might be achieved from clearer writing.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this great suggestion. There are 7 YXXM motifs on IRS4, which have been speculated as potential binding sites for the regulatory subunit of PI3K. Our results from mass spectrometry and site-directed mutagenesis analysis verified 3 Tyr(P) sites reside in YXXM motifs to create potential PI3K binding sites: Tyr-779, -828 and -921. This new information has been integrated into the Discussion section lines 517-525.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. Inclusion in the Discussion of how the current study differs from the previous knockout study of FER would clarify the discrepancies in the outcomes of the two studies. The authors provide this explanation in the response to reviewers and should include it in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer to point out this issue. In this current manuscript, we have provided both in vitro (Figure 3B) and cell-based (Figure 3A and 3C-F) biochemical assays to demonstrate the kinase-substrate regulatory mode between FER and IRS4. Further loss-of-function assay also suggests that FER-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS4 is important for PIK3R2 recruitment (Figure 5 and Figure 6C-D) and downstream AKT pathway activation (Figure 4F, 4I and 6D), which is important for ovarian cancer cell proliferation (Figure 4 and 6).</p><p>In a previous study (Genes Dev. 2016, PMID: 27401557), ovarian carcinoma cells with or without expression of FER were injected subcutaneously in mice, and differences in tumor growth were not observed. However, metastasis to the lungs was decreased. In the current study, tumor growth was suppressed when IRS4 expression was knocked out. There is one determining factor that should be taken into consideration for solving the abovementioned discrepancy.</p><p>In the previous paper, the majority of in vivo assays were done with CAOV4 cells, which have no IRS4 expression at all. In this current manuscript, two cell lines we used in our phenotypic assays, OVCAR-5 and OVCAR-3, have high IRS4 expression. We think this key difference could explain the different functional output of FER in both experimental contexts: In the absence of IRS4, FER regulates ovarian cancer cell motility and invasiveness mainly through MET-GAB1-SHP2-ERK1/2 signaling pathway, with MET and GAB1 as its substrates; in IRS4-positive ovarian cancer cells, FER-mediated phosphorylation of Tyr779 enables IRS4 to recruit PIK3R2/p85β, the regulatory subunit of PI3K, and activate the PI3K-AKT pathway for proliferation. This new information has been integrated into the Discussion section lines 531-545.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. On Page 10, line 270, LY294002 is described as an AKT inhibitor. This is incorrect, LY294002 is a PI3K inhibitor.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this issue. Indeed, LY294002 is the first synthetic small molecule known to inhibit PI3Kα/δ/β with IC50 of 0.5 μM/0.57 μM/0.97 μM, respectively, in cell-free assays. LY294002 inactivates AKT/PKB, thus inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis. We have corrected all the mistakes in our revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
