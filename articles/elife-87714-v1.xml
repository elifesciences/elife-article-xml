To test the importance of histone variants in the organization of chromatin we investigated how histone variants and histone modifications assemble in the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> genome. We showed that a limited number of chromatin states divide euchromatin and heterochromatin into several subdomains. We found that histone variants are as significant as histone modifications in determining the composition of chromatin states. Particularly strong associations were observed between H2A variants and specific combinations of histone modifications. To study the role of H2A variants in organizing chromatin states we determined the role of the chromatin remodeler DECREASED IN DNA METHYLATION (DDM1) in the organization of chromatin states. We showed that the loss of DDM1 prevented the exchange of the histone variant H2A.Z to H2A.W in constitutive heterochromatin, resulting in significant effects on the definition and distribution of chromatin states in and outside of constitutive heterochromatin. We thus propose that dynamic exchanges of histone variants control the organization of histone modifications into chromatin states, acting as molecular landmarks.</p></abstract><kwd-group

nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Luger et al., 1997</xref>). Nucleosomes contain two copies of each of the core histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Histone variants have arisen through the divergence of their intrinsically disordered loop and tail regions and dozens of histone variants in the H2A, H2B, and H3 families have been identified in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Loppin and Berger, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Talbert and Henikoff, 2021</xref>). These variants regulate the properties of nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chakravarthy et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Horikoshi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Koyama and Kurumizaka, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tachiwana et al., 2012</xref>) and affect transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rudnizky et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Subramanian et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Weber and Henikoff, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wollmann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wollmann et al., 2017</xref>). Animals and plants have evolved unique H2A variants associated with transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Loppin and Berger, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Talbert and Henikoff, 2021</xref>) and with gametes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Osakabe and Molaro, 2023</xref>). In vascular plants, the H2A.W variants are distinguished by a C-terminal KSPK motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lei et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bourguet et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yelagandula et al., 2014</xref>). In synergy with H3K9 methylation, H2A.W favors heterochromatic silencing by directly altering the interaction between H2A.W and DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bourguet et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Osakabe et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bourguet et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yelagandula et al., 2014</xref>). The roles of the recently recognized H2B variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Raman et al., 2022</xref>) in transcription remains unknown. However, H2B variants might differ in their capacity to be ubiquitinated, an important modification for RNA polymerase II elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feng and Shen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Minsky et al., 2008</xref>). Histone variants thus represent complex, diverse nucleosome components that could regulate and organize the functional activities of chromatin.</p><p>Histones are subject to a wide range of post-translational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Talbert and Henikoff, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tessarz and Kouzarides, 2014</xref>). Applying a Hidden Markov Model (ChromHMM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ernst and Kellis, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ernst and Kellis, 2017</xref>) to genomic profiles of histone modifications revealed chromatin states that reflect the combination of post-transcriptional histone modifications present in mammals, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, and rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ernst and Kellis, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ernst and Kellis, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kharchenko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Roudier et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sequeira-Mendes et al., 2014</xref>). Chromatin states distinguish the major domains of chromatin within the genome, comprising euchromatin (with active genes), facultative heterochromatin (with repressed genes), and constitutive heterochromatin (with transposons and repeats) in animals and plants. They also highlight specific features such as promoters and enhancers.</p><p>Compared with the wealth of data on the relationship between histone modifications and transcription, the role of histone variants in this process remains to be explored. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, there is a clear correlation between transcript levels and enrichment of the variant H3.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stroud et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wollmann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wollmann et al., 2017</xref>) and H2A and H2A.X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yelagandula et al., 2014</xref>) on gene bodies marked by H3K36me2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leng et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, H2A.Z is enriched on repressed genes marked by H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carter et al., 2018</xref>), and the histone variant H2A.W is present on transposons and repeats marked by H3K9me2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Osakabe et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yelagandula et al., 2014</xref>). Although it was suggested that histone variants might have a global role in defining chromatin states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hake and Allis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Henikoff et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Weber and Henikoff, 2014</xref>) the complex, intimate associations between histone variants and modifications have not been fully characterized in plants or mammals.</p><p>Here, we analyzed how all thirteen histone variants expressed in vegetative tissues associate with twelve prominent histone modifications to form chromatin states in the model flowering plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. Our findings indicate that H2A variants are major factors that differentiate euchromatin, facultative heterochromatin, and constitutive heterochromatin. This hypothesis is supported by in silico analyses and the mis-assembly of chromatin states caused by the deregulation of the exchange of H2A variants.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Co-occurrence of H3 modifications and histone variants in nucleosomes</title><p>In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, homotypic nucleosomes containing a single type of H2A variant are prevalent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Osakabe et al., 2018</xref>). However, it was not determined whether H3 variants also assemble in a homotypic manner and if H2A variants preferably assemble with a specific H3 variant or histone modification. To answer these questions, we immunoprecipitated mononucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>) from transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> lines expressing HA-tagged <italic>HTR13</italic> (H3.1) and <italic>HTR5</italic> (H3.3) under the control of their native promoters in the respective mutant backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jiang and Berger, 2017</xref>). Because tagged H3 ran slower than endogenous H3 on SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), this approach allowed us to analyze the composition of H3.1 and H3.3 nucleosomes by mass spectrometry (MS) and immunoblotting. Spectral counts of peptides covering regions around lysine 27 (K27), where H3.1 and H3.3 can be distinguished by MS analysis, revealed that ~60% of H3.1 and ~42% of H3.3 nucleosomes contained both H3 variants, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We analyzed H3.1 and H3.3 nucleosomes for the presence of H2A variants by western blotting and found that neither H3.1 nor H3.3 was preferentially associated with a specific H2A variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This was further confirmed by MS analysis of nucleosomes pulled down with H2A variant-specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Thus, by contrast with H2A variants, H3 variants do not necessarily form homotypic nucleosomes, despite the presence of H3 variant-specific deposition mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Loppin and Berger, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Probst, 2022</xref>), and they do not associate with a specific H2A variant.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Biochemical analysis of the association between histone variants and histone marks.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Histones H3.1 and H3.3 form homotypic and heterotypic nucleosomes.

We found that all the methylation and acetylation marks surveyed were present on transgenic (T) and endogenous (E) H3 in both H3.1 and H3.3 immunoprecipitations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), although there was some degree of preferential association of H3K4me, H3K36me, and H3 acetylation with H3.3 and of H3K27me1 with H3.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). H3.1 and H3.3 modifications were also analyzed by MS by using information from both transgenic and endogenous H3 in respective immunoprecipitations. This approach unambiguously distinguishes the modifications of peptides covering lysines 27 (H3K27) and 36 (H3K36) originating from the endogenous or the transgenic copies of H3.1 and H3.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). We put our focus on modifications at these two positions, because they are diagnostic of constitutive heterochromatin (H3K27me1), facultative heterochromatin (H3K27me3), and actively transcribed euchromatin (H3K36me). In contrast to previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Johnson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>) we identified similar levels of H3K27me2 and H3K27me3 marks on both H3.1 and H3.3 whereas the constitutive heterochromatin mark H3K27me1 was higher on H3.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E-G</xref>). High levels of H3K27me1 on H3.3 were unexpected considering the specificity of H3K27 methyltransferases ATXR5/6 for H3.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jacob et al., 2014</xref>) and are the likely product of the demethylation of H3K27me3 by the JUMONJI H3K27 demethylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2010</xref>) or intermediates of methylation by the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2. Acetylation and all three methylation states at H3K36 that are associated with active chromatin were likewise found on both H3.1 and H3.3 but with higher enrichment on H3.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E-G</xref>). This is consistent with western blot analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and with the established role of H3.3 as a replacement variant during transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Delaney and Almouzni, 2023</xref>). The levels of H3K27 and H3K36 modifications on H3.1 and H3.3 displayed the same trends irrespective of whether they were precipitated with either H3.1 or H3.3 nucleosomes, contrasting with the predominant enrichment of H3K37 modifications on H3.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The H3 region covering K4, K9, K14, K18, and K23 residues cannot be distinguished between H3.1 and H3.3 by either bottom-up MS or western blotting. Therefore, we analyzed H3K9me1 and H3K9me2, which mark constitutive heterochromatin in plants, only on transgenic H3 and found that both marks were similarly distributed among H3.1 and H3.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>) as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Johnson et al., 2004</xref>). Also, acetylation of H3K9, H3K14, H3K18, H3K23 and combinations thereof were very similar in H3.1 and H3.3 immunoprecipitations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I-K</xref>). Modifications on H3K4 were not analyzed by MS because our experimental setup produced too short peptides to be captured by nanoLC. As the total numbers of measured spectra covering H3 modifications were nearly identical for H3.1 and H3.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>) our MS together with western blot data suggest that the vast majority of H3 modifications are not H3 variant specific to the notable exception of H3K36 and H3K37 modifications that are associated preferentially but not uniquely with H3.3. This preference for H3.3 might be related to the presence of substitutions at position 41 specific that distinguishes H3.1 from H3.3 in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borg et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Probst, 2022</xref>). These findings suggested that in the heterotypic nucleosomes the same modifications are found on either H3 variants present irrespective of their identity.</p><p>Unlike H3 variants, homotypic nucleosomes containing either H2A.W, H2A.Z, H2A, or H2A.X showed marked enrichment of specific histone modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Histone modifications in constitutive heterochromatin (H3K9me1, H3K9me2, and H3K27me1) were primarily associated with H2A.W consistent with their synergistic impact on silencing transposons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bourguet et al., 2021</xref>). The modification H3K27me3 (facultative heterochromatin) was detected only in H2A.Z nucleosomes, and H3K36me3 (marking euchromatin) was primarily detected in H2A, H2A.X, and H2A.Z nucleosomes. Other modifications, such as H3K4me1 and H3K4me3, displayed complex patterns of association with H2A variants, among themselves, and with other H3 modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Surprisingly, H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 co-precipitated high levels of H3K27me1, H3K27me3, and H3K36me3 and low levels of H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) showing that repressive and active H3 marks co-exist on the same nucleosomes or potentially on the same H3 tail. Similar complex interplay between H3 marks has also been observed in mouse ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schwämmle et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, H2A but not H3 variants form homotypic nucleosomes that preferentially carry specific histone modifications associated with either the transcriptional status of protein-coding genes or transposons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Associations of histone variants with the chromatin states</title><p>We performed ChIP-seq using <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedlings to identify the combinations of all histone variants present in somatic cells and their associations with twelve prominent histone modifications.

We chose to analyze the 26 chromatin states model, which proved to be most parsimonious (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>; see Methods). Chromatin states were clustered based on the emission probability for each modification and histone variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and were distinguished based on distinct combinations of enrichment amongst the 27 chromatin components analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Chromatin states occupied different proportions of the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>) and showed distinct relative abundance of transposons, repeats, and elements of protein-coding genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). For each chromatin state, we measured the average level of transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), the degree of enrichment in CG methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>)<bold>,</bold> the degree of enrichment in CHG and CHH methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C, D</xref>), the level of accessibility by DNase I-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), the nucleosome density determined by MNase-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E</xref>), and the length in base pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2F</xref>). Chromatin states H1–H6 showed low accessibility, the highest levels of DNA methylation, and primarily occupied transcriptionally inactive transposons and repeats, thus representing constitutive heterochromatin. The states F1–F6 were associated with low transcriptional activity and were present over genes and pseudogenes, indicating that they represented facultative heterochromatin. As defined by state occupancy, constitutive and facultative heterochromatin composed 17% and 20% of the genome, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>), corresponding to previous estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Roudier et al., 2011</xref>). The states E1–E11 occupied expressed genes and thus comprised euchromatin. Three states (I1–I3) showed the lowest nucleosome density and highest accessibility and occupied a large fraction of non-coding RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2G</xref>) and a quarter of untranslated regions of genes (3′UTR and 5′UTR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Hence, the states I1–I3 were classified as intergenic. We conclude that specific groups of chromatin states define constitutive heterochromatin (H1-6), facultative heterochromatin (F1-6), euchromatin (E1-11), and intergenic regions (I1-3).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Histone variants define chromatin states in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Bubble plot showing the emission probabilities for histone modifications/variants across the 26 chromatin states.

H2A.W and H3K9me1 are the determining marks of all six heterochromatic states. H2A.Z, with the polycomb histone modifications H2AK121ub and H3K27me3, are the hallmark of facultative heterochromatin states. H2A and H2A.X associated with H2Bub and H3K36me3 mark euchromatic states. Contrasting with the strong association between H2A variants and the three major domains of chromatin, much less prominent associations are observed between histone modifications and either H3 or H2B variants.</p><p>To examine the importance of H2A variants in the definition of chromatin states, we compared the 26 chromatin states defined in our study with the 9 states defined in a previous study that did not include the comprehensive set of histone variants present in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sequeira-Mendes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2H</xref>). The blocks of heterochromatic states H1–H6 corresponded to the previously identified states 8 and 9, which were also defined as heterochromatin in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sequeira-Mendes et al., 2014</xref>). States F1–F6 tended to map to the previously defined facultative heterochromatin states 5 and 6, although state F6 was split among the three states 2, 4, and 6. Similarly, although there was a broad correspondence between euchromatin states E1– E11 with states 1, 3, and 7, there were noticeable differences. Overall, several newly defined states were not associated with the corresponding types of chromatin domains described in previous studies. Previously defined states 2, 4, and 6 contained elements belonging to multiple newly defined chromatin states. To test the dissimilarity between the 9-state and the 26-state models we calculated a 26-state model based on the chromatin marks used to define the 9-state model. The difference between the resulting matrices were measured by the Jaccard index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This showed an overall coherence between the two models, with only mis-assignment of chromatin identity by the 9-state model of chromatin in intergenic regions, H1, H5, H6, and a lower diversity of euchromatin states. Altogether, the addition of the comprehensive set of histone variants in the 26-state model provides a more refined and coherent classification of elements of chromatin than the 9-state model defined primarily based on chromatin modifications and the variants H3.1 and H3.3, suggesting the importance of histone variants in the definition of chromatin states.</p><p>To evaluate the contribution of individual components in defining the chromatin states, we recalculated chromatin states after excluding either H2B variants, H3 variants, H2A variants, H3 modifications (no H3 PTMs) or all histone variants (no H2A/H3/H2B) from the dataset used to learn the 26-state model. The difference between the resulting matrices of chromatin states was measured by the Jaccard index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Removing H2B variants did not affect most chromatin states, except for H1 and I2, which showed high emissions probabilities for H2B variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In contrast, H3 variants showed larger contributions in defining specific states, and removing all H2A variants caused the loss of several states marked by a Jaccard index &lt;0.7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Eventually, removing all histone variants had a stronger impact than removing all H3 modifications from the model. In summary, our computational and biochemical analyses led to conclude that, among histone variants, H2A variants have the strongest effect on defining the chromatin states by their association with histone modifications.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Perturbation of H2A variant dynamics affects the genomic localization of chromatin states</title><p>We considered the idea that the dynamics of the exchange of H2A variants would affect the chromatin states.

Because these profiles were acquired on leaves while seedlings were used to define the 26-state model in the wild-type, we first considered whether the development stage could affect the definition of chromatin states in the wild-type. To test this idea, we built a concatenated chromHMM model based on the profiles of the same set of histone variants and modifications from 10-day-old seedlings and leaves of five-week-old plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Although this model had only 15 chromatin states we observed an association between H2A variants and histone modifications comparable to the model describing the 26-state model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The absence of most typical euchromatic histone modifications in the model likely explained the strong reduction of the number of states of euchromatin compared with the 26-state model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The complexity of the different heterochromatin states were preserved in the concatenated model, supporting that the set of H2A variants and histone modifications used to study <italic>ddm1</italic> are sufficient to represent the complexity of the heterochromatin affected directly by <italic>ddm1</italic>. The composition of the chromatin states did not vary significantly between seedlings and leaves and each state occupied a similar proportion of the genome in seedlings or leaves to the exception of state 5 present primarily in leaves and state 13 only present in seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref> right column with green bars). However, as expected by the dissimilar transcriptomes of these two developmental stages euchromatic states occupied distinct genes in seedlings and leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This indicated that neither tissue type nor developmental stage has a dramatic effect on the definition of chromatin states in the wild-type.</p><p>To directly compare chromatin states between <italic>ddm1</italic> and wild-type, we built a concatenated chromHMM model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ernst and Kellis, 2017</xref>). The concatenated model created a common set of 16 chromatin states that are shared between wild-type and <italic>ddm1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and identified the percentage of the genome occupied by each chromatin states for each genotype individually (see Methods) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref><bold>,</bold> and bar plot on the left). The states were classified as constitutive heterochromatin (hI-hIII), facultative heterochromatin (fI-fVI), euchromatin (eI-eIII), and intergenic (iI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), based on their emission probability and genomic overlap with states from those groups in the 26-state model (see Methods). The presence of chromatin profiles from <italic>ddm1</italic> caused three additional mixed states in the 16-state model, which represents regions covered by facultative and constitutive heterochromatin (fhI) or by a combination of intergenic and constitutive heterochromatin (ihI,ihII) in the 26-state model. Because several euchromatic histone PTMs were not included in the new model, only three states represented euchromatin (eI-eIII) compared with the 11 euchromatic states in the 26-state model. In the 16-state concatenated model with <italic>ddm1</italic> the complexity of facultative (fI-fVI) was preserved but the complexity of heterochromatin states was reduced to three (hI-hIII) compared with the six heterochromatin states in the wild-type 26-state model. Overall, <italic>ddm1</italic> caused a perturbation of the chromatin states associated with constitutive heterochromatin and did not significantly affect the group similarity for facultative heterochromatin and euchromatin states between the 16- and 26- state models, with genomic overlaps between 68 and 100% for the non-mixed states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Decreased in DNA Methylation (DDM1) loss of function disrupts chromatin states in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Heatmap showing the emission probability for each mark/variant across the 16 chromatin states of the concatenated wild-type and <italic>ddm1</italic> mutant model.

The strongest differences, in terms of genomic coverage, between <italic>ddm1</italic> and wild-type were observed in constitutive and facultative heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Accordingly, the regions marked by heterochromatin (red states h) became covered by states typical of facultative heterochromatin (blue states f) or intergenic states (gray states iI, ihII) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C and E</xref>). To a lesser extent, regions covered by facultative state fVI and euchromatic state eIII were converted to intergenic state iI. Hence, the loss of DDM1 broadly affected the association of chromatin states with regions covered with constitutive heterochromatin in the wild-type. Accordingly, chromatin states were changed over TEs, including TE fragments and TE genes (assigned to TE families in TAIR10 annotation) but did not change over protein-coding genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>).

We thus concluded that the loss of DDM1 causes a profound perturbation of both the definition of chromatin states and their distribution.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The H2A.W-binding domains of DDM1 bind H2A.Z</title><p>The conversion of chromatin states occupied by H2A.W in wild-type to chromatin states occupied by other H2A variants in <italic>ddm1</italic> suggested that DDM1 could also control the dynamics of other H2A variants. We have previously shown that DDM1 specifically binds H2A.W but neither H2A.X nor H1 linker histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Osakabe et al., 2021</xref>). To determine if DDM1 binds to H2A or H2A.Z in addition to H2A.W, we performed a Ni-NTA agarose pulldown assay with recombinant histone heterodimers composed of H2B and one of the four H2A variants. We found that His<sub>6</sub>-tagged DDM1 co-precipitated heterodimers containing H2A.W and H2A.Z but not H2A or H2A.X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). This demonstrated that DDM1 bound H2A.W and H2A.Z but not H2A and H2A.X. Notably, the C-terminal tail of H2A.W was dispensable for DDM1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). To test whether the conserved motifs involved in H2A.W binding also bind H2A.Z, we prepared a series of DDM1 fragments fused with either His<sub>6</sub>- or GST-tag. Our pulldown assays showed that fragments containing residues 100–123 or 639–673 were able to bind H2A.W and H2A.Z, whereas some additional regions of DDM1 showed weak binding only to H2A.Z (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A-C</xref>). Thus, DDM1 uses the same conserved sites to bind H2A.Z and H2A.W.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Exchange of chromatin states defined by H2A.W and H2A.Z is not directly associated with transcription</title><p>H2A.W evolved in land plants independently from macroH2A in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Osakabe and Molaro, 2023</xref>). macroH2A is also associated with heterochromatin although not as strictly as H2A.W (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sun and Bernstein, 2019</xref>). The deposition of macroH2A depends at least in part on the DDM1 murine ortholog LSH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ni et al., 2020</xref>), and it was proposed that LSH binds and exchanges H2A to macroH2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ni and Muegge, 2021</xref>). Finding that DDM1 uses the same sites to bind both H2A.Z and H2A.W suggested that DDM1 controls the deposition of H2A.W and H2A.Z. To test this hypothesis, we surveyed the enrichment of H2A variants and histone PTMs over TEs in <italic>ddm1</italic> and compared this with the wild-type. To prevent carry-over mutations from generations of self-fertilized <italic>ddm1</italic> homozygous mutants we used leaves from <italic>ddm1</italic> homozygous mutant plants segregated from heterozygous <italic>ddm1</italic> mutants. We observed an overall enrichment of H2A.Z over TE genes in <italic>ddm1</italic>, supporting the idea that DDM1 promotes the removal of H2A.Z at TE genes where DDM1 deposits H2A.W in the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Remarkably, non-transcribed TE genes also accumulated H2A.Z (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) supporting the conclusion that the replacement of H2A.W by H2A.Z observed in <italic>ddm1</italic> mutants is not governed by transcription. Transcribed TE genes showed enrichment in H2A.Z at their TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) but also H2A.X on the gene body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Transcription of TEs in <italic>ddm1</italic> did not affect the degree of enrichment for H3K27me3 of facultative heterochromatin but with increasing levels of transcription, there was increased enrichment of H3K36me3, resulting in a chromatin profile typical of expressed protein-coding genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Accordingly, strongly expressed TE genes showed an accumulation of euchromatic states, in contrast with non-expressed TE genes that became covered with states typical of facultative heterochromatin, irrespective of the type of constitutive heterochromatin observed on these TE genes in wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The change of chromatin states did not correlate with the length of the TE gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>) or the homogeneity of the chromatin landscape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>). We conclude that at TE genes, DDM1 prevents the replacement of H2A.W by H2A.Z in a transcription-independent manner.

Yet, the alteration in the dynamics of H2A.W and H2A.Z in <italic>ddm1</italic> perturbs the allocation of chromatin states at constitutive heterochromatin and in other regions of chromatin. In some TEs, the new chromatin state acquired in <italic>ddm1</italic> permits transcription, which is then accompanied by a further exchange of H2A.Z to H2A and H2A.X and further loss of marks of constitutive heterochromatin and H1 and gain of marks of euchromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Impact of expression on chromatin states over TE genes in <italic>ddm1</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Enrichment profiles of H2A.W.6 and H2A.Z.9 over TE genes in <italic>ddm1</italic>.

These chromatin states summarize the prevalent organization of chromatin across cell types and stages of vegetative development from seedlings to mature leaves. Our data suggest that minor variations in chromatin states occur between vegetative cell types. We predict that highly specialized cell types such as gametes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Borg et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borg et al., 2021</xref>) with specific histone variants and unusually high or low levels of chromatin regulators harbor specific chromatin states that are not reflected in our study. Calculation of chromatin states and biochemical analyses demonstrate the strongest associations between nucleosomes homotypic for H2A variants and histone modifications while nucleosomes are primarily heterotypic for H3 variants with a weaker association with histone modifications.</p><p>The prominent role of H2A variants in the organization of chromatin states is supported by systematic evaluation of the individual contribution of histone variants, H3 marks, and a combination thereof (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) and the impact of the loss of the remodeler DDM1, which deposits H2A.W to maintain TE silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Osakabe et al., 2021</xref>). We further show that the DDM1 binding sites for H2A.W also bind H2A.Z, but not H2A or H2A.X. In <italic>ddm1</italic>, we observe a net replacement of H2A.W by H2A.Z. The effect can be interpreted in several manners. DDM1 could exchange directly H2A.Z to H2A.W. This model would support the idea of the convergent evolution of DDM1 and its orthologs LSH and HELLS in mammals with LSH catalyzing the exchange between replication dependent H2A and macroH2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berger et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ni and Muegge, 2021</xref>). An alternative model is that the replacement of H2A.W by H2A.Z is indirect in <italic>ddm1</italic>. For example, H2A.Z might be deposited because of the loss of DNA methylation in <italic>ddm1</italic>, which is consistent with the well-established mutually exclusive patterns of H2A.Z and DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zilberman et al., 2008</xref>). It is also possible that the binding of DDM1 to H2A.Z is relevant in a different context that is not illustrated by our study. Whichever mechanism is involved it is unlikely that on its own, the loss of H2A.W in <italic>ddm1</italic> causes the deposition of H2A.Z on constitutive heterochromatin because this is not observed in mutants lacking H2A.W (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bourguet et al., 2021</xref>). The resulting enrichment of H2A.Z in <italic>ddm1</italic> is accompanied by a corresponding exchange of constitutive to facultative chromatin states over TEs. Notably, this does not require transcription, as TEs that remain silent in <italic>ddm1</italic> are likewise occupied by a facultative heterochromatin marked by H2A.Z and H3K27me3. When TEs are strongly expressed in <italic>ddm1</italic>, they also acquire euchromatin states marked by H2A and H2A.X over their gene body, while H2A.Z remains confined to the transcription start site. Hence, H2A variants appear to be important in shaping the deposition of histone modifications and defining chromatin states.</p><p>Overall, our observations suggest that chromatin writers and erasers operate with different affinities and efficacies based on the H2A variants in the nucleosome, an idea that is supported by previous reports. The inhibition of the H2B ubiquitin ligase by the H2A.Z tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Surface et al., 2016</xref>) is sufficient to explain the anticorrelation between H2Bub and H2A.Z over gene bodies. H2A.Z is the major substrate for H2AK121Ub deposited by PRC1, as indicated by their co-occurrence within chromatin states as well as previous biochemical analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gómez-Zambrano et al., 2019</xref>). PRC2 strongly prefers arrays of H2A.Z as a substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2018</xref>), thus supporting the link between H2A.Z and H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carter et al., 2018</xref>). We propose to expand these examples to the more general idea that the nature of the H2A variant controls the activity of the machinery that either deposits or erases the histone modifications. Such a model would explain the importance of histone variants in the establishment of chromatin states.</p><p>How are chromatin states maintained? In mammalian cells, there is a broad maintenance of the patterns of H3 modifications by recycling H3 and H4 at the replication fork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reverón-Gómez et al., 2018</xref>). As plant cells divide, H3.1 sustains the deposition of H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jiang and Berger, 2017</xref>) and H3K27me1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jacob et al., 2014</xref>) thus providing a positive feedback loop to sustain the polycomb repressive state and constitutive heterochromatin in dividing cells, respectively. Recent data in mammalian cells show that the recycling of H2A-H2B after replication provides another positive feedback loop to maintain the patterns of H2A variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flury et al., 2023</xref>). Such replication-dependent maintenance mechanisms no longer operate in non-dividing cells, providing opportunities for changing the allocation of chromatin states. This is illustrated by several studies in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. The positive feedback loops that maintain histone modifications become inactive and reversion to active chromatin states becomes possible by the deposition of H3.3 and eviction of H2A.Z by INO80 in response to temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhao et al., 2023</xref>) or to light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Willige et al., 2023</xref>). Mechanisms coupling H3.3 and H2A.Z dynamics are likely general for the regulation of responsive genes that are covered with facultative chromatin states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Long et al., 2023</xref>). Conversely, on expressed genes, acetylated histones assist in the docking of the chromatin remodeler SWI2/SNF2-related 1 (SWR1), which deposits H2A.Z at the transcription start sites (TSS) of expressed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aslam et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bieluszewski et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Although H3.1 and H3.3 do not strongly differentiate the three main classes of chromatin, they likely refine their definition. A relative enrichment of H3.1 with constitutive heterochromatin modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Johnson et al., 2004</xref>) were previously noted and confirmed in our study. Accordingly, the preferred substrate for the deposition of the heterochromatic mark H3K27me1 is H3.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jacob et al., 2014</xref>). We also observed a relationship between H3.3 and H3K36me1/2, pointing to a possible preference of H3.3 for the deposition of H3K36me or for the demethylation of H3K36me3. In addition, it is becoming apparent that the dynamics of H3.3 and H2A.Z are coordinated in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhao et al., 2023</xref>) and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). We thus propose that as yet unknown mechanisms link the deposition of H2A and H3 variants, resulting in specific types of nucleosomes that are sufficient to orchestrate the deposition of PTMs in distinct chromatin states. These will be read, interpreted, and further modified by silencing mechanisms in heterochromatin and the transcriptional machinery in euchromatin, leading to a changing chromatin landscape responding to the activity of the cell and its responses to the environment.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

Isolated nuclei were washed once in 1 ml of N buffer (15 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 60 mM KCl, 15 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 250 mM sucrose, 1 mM DTT, 10 mM ß-glycerophosphate) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche).

Twenty microliters of MNase (0.1 u/µl) (Sigma-Aldrich) were added to each tube and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C and during the incubation nuclei were mixed four times by inverting the tubes. MNase digestion was stopped on ice by addition of 110 µl of MNase stop solution (100 mM EDTA, 100 mM EGTA). Nuclei were lysed by the addition of 110 µl of 5 M NaCl (final concentration of 500 mM NaCl). The suspension was mixed by inverting the tubes and they were then kept on ice for 15 min.

Histone H3 bands were excised, reduced, alkylated, in-gel trypsin or LysC digested, and processed for MS. The nano HPLC system used was a Dionex UltiMate 3000 HPLC RSLC nano system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Amsterdam, Netherlands) coupled to a Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany), equipped with a Proxeon nanospray source (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Odense, Denmark). Peptides were loaded onto a trap column (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Amsterdam, Netherlands, PepMap C18, 5 mm 3300 mm ID, 5 mm particles, 100 Å pore size) at a flow rate of 25 ml/min using 0.1% TFA as the mobile phase. After 10 min, the trap column was switched in line with the analytical column (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Amsterdam, Netherlands, PepMap C18, 500 mm 375 mm ID, 2 mm, 100 Å). Peptides were eluted using a flow rate of 230 nl/min and a binary 2 hr gradient. The gradient starts with the mobile phases: 98% solution A (water/formic acid, 99.9/0.1, v/v) and 2% solution B (water/acetonitrile/formic acid, 19.92/80/0.08, v/v/v), increases to 35% of solution B over the next 120 min, followed by a gradient in 5 min to 90% of solution B, stays there for 5 min and decreases in 5 min back to the gradient 98% of solution A and 2% of solution B for equilibration at 30 °C. The Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent mode, using a full scan (m/z range 380–1500, nominal resolution of 60,000, target value 1E6) followed by MS/MS scans of the 10 most abundant ions. MS/MS spectra were acquired using a normalized collision energy of 27%, an isolation width of 1.4 m/z, and a resolution of 30.000, and the target value was set to 1E5. Precursor ions selected for fragmentation (exclude charge states 1, 7, 8, &gt;8) were put on a dynamic exclusion list for 40 s. Additionally, the minimum AGC target was set to 5E3, and the intensity threshold was calculated to be 4.8E4. The peptide match feature was set to preferred, and the exclude isotopes feature was enabled. For peptide identification, the RAW files were loaded into Proteome Discoverer (version 2.1.0.81, Thermo Scientific). The resulting MS/MS spectra were searched against <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> histone H3 sequences (seven sequences; 951 residues) using MS Amanda v2.1.5.8733 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dorfer et al., 2014</xref>). The following search parameters were used: Beta-methylthiolation on cysteine was set as a fixed modification, oxidation on methionine, deamidation of asparagine and glutamine, acetylation on lysine, phosphorylation on serine, threonine, and tyrosine, methylation and di-methylation on lysine and threonine, tri-methylation on lysine, and ubiquitinylation on lysine were set as variable modifications. The peptide mass tolerance was set to ±5 ppm, and the fragment mass tolerance was set to ±15 ppm. The maximal number of missed cleavages was set to 2. The result was filtered to 1% FDR at the peptide level using the Percolator algorithm integrated with Thermo Proteome Discoverer. The localization of the phosphorylation sites within the peptides was performed with the tool ptmRS, which is based on the tool phosphoRS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Taus et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Peptides diagnostic for H3.1 and H3.3 covering positions K27 and K36 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>) was used for the analysis of modifications. All peptides covering these two positions were selected in H3.1 and H3.3 immunoprecipitation samples and analyzed for the presence of modifications with the threshold for modification probability set to 95% or higher. Relative modification levels were expressed as the number of modified peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>) divided by the total number of peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>) that were measured for each lysine position resulting in total modification levels for H3.1 and H3.3 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

Crosslinked tissues were frozen and ground with a mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen to obtain a fine powder. Ground tissues were resuspended in M1 buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1 M hexylene glycol, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitor (Roche)), and the suspension was filtered through miracloth.

Aligned BAM files were then converted to BED format using bedtools bamtobed v2.27.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Quinlan, 2014</xref>). These genome-wide BED files were then used for learning chromatin states by the multivariate Hidden Markov Models. For the extensive wild-type model, we used the BinarizeBed and LearnModel programs from ChromHMM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ernst and Kellis, 2017</xref>) with default settings and window size of 200 bp. We generated models from 2 to 50 chromatin states. To compare emission parameters of models with different numbers of states, the command CompareModel from ChromHMM was used. Thus, we selected a reference model with the largest number of states (50) and compared it with other models with lower number of states (from 49 to 2). This resulted in a correlation matrix between each state of the reference model and any state of the other models being compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). This comparison revealed that the correlation dropped for models including less than 13 states, suggesting that some of the biologically relevant states were not resolved. We thus concluded that at least 13 states should be used. However, ChromHMM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ernst and Kellis, 2017</xref>) does not establish the optimal state number as it does not consider genomic features which are associated with specific biological function. Therefore, we analyzed the association between chromatin states with genomic features in all models ranging from 13 to 30 states. As a result, for example, we observed that models with more than 13 states could resolve biologically meaningful heterochromatic states (H2 to H6) (H2 to H4 associated with pericentromeric repeats/CMT2 associated repeats; H5 and H6 associated with chromosome arm repeats/RdDM repeats) (as shown in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jamge et al., 2022</xref>, Figure 3). Furthermore, only with a 26-state model, we observed a clearly defined novel state H1 with H2B enrichment, largely deprived of TE genes and located in the closest proximity to centromeres. Increasing the number of states to 27 and above gave rise to an additional chromatin state that could no longer be associated with any distinct genomic feature. Hence, we decided that, with the set of chromatin components included, a 26-state model is optimal for our analysis.</p><p>For the mixed seedling and leaf data, and for the mixed wild-type and <italic>ddm1</italic> mutant data we used concatenated ChromHMM models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ernst and Kellis, 2017</xref>). Those models use the data from both tissues/genotypes to build a common model. To this end, we used the BinarizeBed and LearnModel with the default settings and window size of 200 bp but with the tissue or genotype as additional information. The number of states in the final model was decided on as described for the extensive model.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Analysis of sub-epigenome models</title><p>The ChromHMM command EvalSubset was used to compare models where histone variants or modifications were excluded from the model.

Following up on the finding that H2A.Z replaces H2A.W at TE genes in ddm1 mutants, the authors provide in vitro evidence that DDM1 binds to H2A.Z-H2B dimers. These results are taken together to conclude that DDM1 normally removes H2A.Z-H2B dimers from nucleosomes at TE genes and replaces them with H2A.W-H2B dimers. However, the evidence for this model is circumstantial and such a model raises a variety of other questions that are not addressed by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer raises a series of interesting questions. We proposed that DDM1 exchanges H2A.Z to H2A.W because it is the simplest model and also because LSH - the mammalian ortholog of DDM1 exchanges H2A to macroH2A. However we do stress in the revised manuscript that this is a model and other possible models that could involve chaperones and additional remodelers are possible. Addressing why the loss of DDM1 results in a net exchange of H2A.W to H2A.Z is not the purpose of this study. Here we use the perturbation caused by ddm1 as a means to address the importance of the dynamics exchange of H2A variants in setting up the chromatin states. We do observe that perturbing this dynamic exchange causes an important perturbation of chromatin states. This further supports our main conclusion: H2A variants dynamics are one important factor that organizes chromatin states.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For example: if DDM1 does remove H2A.Z from TE genes, how does H2A.Z normally come to occupy these sites, given that they are highly DNA methylated and that H2A.Z is known to anticorrelate with DNA methylation in plants and animals?</p></disp-quote><p>The anticorrelation between H2A.Z and DNA methylation is observed at steady state. The exchange of H2A.Z to H2A.W that results from the action of DDM1 would indeed remove unwanted H2A.Z from regions occupied by DNA methylation as suggested by the Reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given that H2A.Z does not accumulate in TEs in h2a.w mutants, how would H2A.X and H2A instead become enriched at these sites if DDM1 cannot bind these forms of H2A?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a valid question: We envisage that H2A.X and H2A are deposited by remodelers and chaperones other than DDM1 in the h2a.w mutant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given that there are no apparent regions with common sequence between H2A.Z and H2A.W variants that are not also shared with other H2A classes, how would DDM1 selectively bind to H2A.W-H2B and H2A.Z-H2B dimers to the exclusion of H2A(.X)-H2B dimers?</p></disp-quote><p>It was shown by the Muegge Lab both in vitro and in vivo that LSH - the mammalian ortholog of DDM1 binds to macroH2A and H2A, and these two H2A variants do not share similar specific region. Yet it remains to determine which region of H2A.Z and H2A.W binds to DDM1, which does not fit in the scope of this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Jamge et al. set out to delineate the relationship between histone variants, histone modifications and chromatin states in Arabidopsis seedlings and leaves.

The title of the discussion, &quot;histone variants drive the overall organization of chromatin states&quot; implies a causation which wasn't investigated, and overstates the finding that some broad chromatin states can be further subdivided when one considers histone variants (adding variables to the model).</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed subtitles in the discussion and have taken care to avoid over simplified statements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Adding variables to a ChromHMM model naturally increases the complexity of the models that can be built, however it is difficult to objectively define which level of complexity is optimal. The differences between states may be subtle to the point that they may be considered redundant. The authors claim that the sub-states they define are biologically important, but provide little evidence to support this claim. It is not obvious whether the 26 states model is much more useful than a 9-states model. Removing variables naturally affects the definition of states that depend on these variables, but it is also hard to define the biological significance of that change. This sensitivity analysis is thus not very developed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that adding more input tracks/ data will increase the complexity.</p><p>But we would like to mention the differences of this study and the 9-state model,</p><p>1. We have included the histone variants which have been previously missed in chromatin state definition.</p><p>2. The previous 9-state model used data from different tissue types.

And we have expanded the description in the methods section and our reasoning behind using 26 state model to be analyzed in depth.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are issues with the logical sequence of arguments in Fig1 and Fig3. Fig1A shows that nucleosomes often contain both H3.1 and H3.3. Therefore pulling-down H3.1-containing nucleosomes also pulls down H3.3 and whether specific H2A variants associated with H3.1 cannot be answered in this way (Fig1B).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for point this out. If 60% of nucleosomes are homotypic and if they would associate with a specific H2A variant this would be clearly visible on WB as a much stronger band. Also, the MS data presented in Figure1 figure supplement 1D clearly show that all H2A variants associate with both H3.1 and H3.3. We have included in the revised version more detailed explanation to clarify this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The same issue likely carries to the investigation of the association with H3 modifications if Fig1C and 1D, since the H3.1-HA pull-down also pulls down endogenous H3.1 (so presumably the rest of the nucleosome, with H3.3, as well).</p></disp-quote><p>We disagree on this point. The H3 band corresponding to the transgene copy is eitherH3.1 or H3.3, so all signals on upper band (T) in Figure 1C are associated with either H3.1 (H3.1 IP) or H3.3 (H3.3 IP), thus unambiguously showing that all modifications we analyzed are present on both H3.1 and H3.3. Furthermore, data shown in Figure 1D and E, where we analyzed modifications on K27 and K36 which are in the H3 region that can be distinguished between H3.1 and H3.3 by MS clearly demonstrate that these modifications are present on both H3.1 and H3.3. In order to make this clearer, we also extended the description of this part in the Results section to emphasize this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Fig3, the conclusion that it is the loss of H2A.Z -&gt; H2A.W exchange in the ddm1 mutant that causes loss of constitutive heterochromatin is rushed. The fact that the h2a.w mutant does not recapitulate the loss of constitutive heterochromatin seen in ddm1 argues against this interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that at first the minimal impact of the loss of H2A.W alone is surprising. However, we point to the preprint <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.31.493688v1">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.31.493688v1</ext-link>. There it is shown that the joint loss of H2A.W and H3K9 methylation (also observed in ddm1) affects silencing of a large range of transposons that also lose silencing in ddm1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It's also difficult to conclude about the importance of dynamic exchanges when the ddm1 mutation has been present for generations and the chromatin landscape has fully readapted. Further work is needed to support the authors' hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize that the Reviewer could not find the information regarding the origin of ddm1 mutant material. We did not use a mutant where ddm1 mutations was kept for generations. We were in fact very careful on this point and used leaves from ddm1 first homozygous plants segregated from heterozygous ddm1 kept heterozygous.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The study also relies on a large number of custom (polyclonal) antibodies with no public validation data. Lack of specificity, a common issue with antibodies, would muddle the interpretation of the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We added information about validation of custom made antibodies into Methods:”Specificities of custom made polyclonal antibodies against Arabidopsis H2A.Z.9, H2A.X, H2A.W.6, H2A.13, H2A.W.7, H2Bs, and linker histone H1 were validated in previouspublications (Yelagandula et al., 2014; Lorkovic et al., 2017; Jiang et al., 2020; Osakabe et al., 2021).“ For H2A.2 and H2A.Z.11 antibodies we provide validation data as Figure 2 figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, this study nicely illustrates that, in Arabidopsis, histone variants (and H2A variants in particular) display specificity in modifications and genomic locations, and correlate with some chromatin sub-states.

The rationale for switching from using 10-day old seedlings for chromatin profiling to using mature leaves in Figure 3 and beyond is not explained and introduces additional complexity into the analyses. The reasoning should be clearly explained in the text, and there are several additional suggestions or questions related to this that should be addressed:</p></disp-quote><p>This was done for practical reasons. We had already obtained some profiles of marks in ddm1 mutants and extended the dataset using the same stage of development because this tied this study with our previous study. Using different stages of development provides an additional benefit. The same chromatin states are observed in 10 day old seedlings and leaves of older plants. Constitutive heterochromatin is occupied by the same chromatin states and logically euchromatin is positioned on different genes as expected by the distinct pattern of gene expression at the two stages of development.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A) In the 16-state model (Figure 3A), euchromatin states were not well defined compared to the 26-state model. Why did the authors not profile these marks also, and could this explain why ddm1 mutants did not show a significant effect on euchromatin states in this model?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the lack of detailed explanation: In our previous study we used leaves of five weeks ld plants to show the impact of ddm1 on the profiles of H2A.W.6, H2A.X, H1, H3K9me2, H3K36me3 and H3K27me3 in leaves (Jamge, Osakabe et al., 2021). This study showed that DDM1 causes the deposition of H2A.W.6 to heterochromatin and we thus used leaves to extend this investigation to the two other marks of heterochromatin (constitutive or facultative) H3K9me1, H2A.W.7 and H2A.Z.9 and H2A.Z.11.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) The authors state that the tissue types do not impact the definition of chromatin states. However, there is a clear difference in the portion of the genome occupied by each chromatin state between leaf and seedling (states 1, 5, 8, 13, and 14; Figure S3A).</p></disp-quote><p>We had missed a comment on supFig3B and have now provided more explanation: “Although the composition of the chromatin states did not vary significantly between seedlings and leaves, each state occupied a similar proportion of the genome in seedling or leaves to the exception of state 5 present primarily in leaves and state 13 only present in seedlings (Figure 3 figure supplement 3A, right column with green bars) and the euchromatin states occupied different genes (Figure 3 figure supplement 3B) as expected by the dissimilar transcriptomes of these two developmental stages.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

In an ideal system the last statement would be correct, but this does not take into account chromatin dynamics associated with replication, transcription, etc. Also, total amounts of H3.1 and H3.3 in tissue we used for the experiment is not known. It could possibly be inferred from RNAseq data, but if this would reflect real amounts of the protein is highly questionable. In Arabidopsis there are 5 H3.1 genes and 3 H3.3 genes. Nevertheless, we recalculated data for H3.1 and H3.3 and this has been updated in the main text (~60% of H3.1 and ~42% of H3.3 immunoprecipitated nucleosomes contained both H3 variants).

We also included data on K9me into Figure 1 figure supplement 1H.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Fig 1D. Could you confirm the high level of H3K27me1 on H3.3?</p></disp-quote><p>H3K27me1 data are shown both by WB (Figure 1C) and Mass spectrometry (Figure 1D and E). We also provide a possible explanation for high levels of this mark on H3.3 by taking into account the fact that H3K27me1 is also produced by demethylation of H3K27me3 by JMJ demethylases.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. All WB in Fig 1. They need to be quantified and normalized (plus statistical analysis) in order to provide strong support to the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>The conclusion of all WB are supported by quantified Mass spectrometry data and many WB were even repeatedly shown in Figure 1F (for example IPs for H2A variants and a large set of H3 marks used for WBs) with the same results. Also, association of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 with H2A variants was analyzed in both ways (Figure 1F); IPs of variants and WBs of variants and marks and IPs of marks and WBs of marks and variants. For most of the data we do not have more than two repeats, so statistical analysis may not be possible.</p><p>Nevertheless, we are convinced that our major conclusions from data presented in Figure 1 andSupporting figure 1 (these are: that H3 variants form both homotypic and heterotypic nucleosomes, that H3 marks do not preferentially associate with H3 variants but some of them do so with H2A variants and that H3 modifications show very complex pattern of associations with each other) are fully valid as they were drawn from two orthogonal approaches and further supported by the chromatin states identified.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Fig. 2A. Authors focus on &quot;the most parsimonious model&quot; based on 26 chromatin states. This needs to be justified in a more explicit manner. It is surprising that this number emerges for an analysis of 27 independent variants and marks. What are the differences in the conclusions when other number of states are used? See also below (reduced number of number derived from the &quot;concatenated model&quot;).</p></disp-quote><p>Why 26 states were chosen is now explained in great details in the method section. Since to the exception of H2A variants that are invariably homotypic, nucleosomes can be heterotypic for all other histone variants and histone modifications, the random combination of the 27 marks in one nucleosome representing one states is 4 H2A (without the subtypes) x 4H3 x 2H1 x 2(power16) (for each mark) which is well above the circa 26 states observed. This shows that our probabilistic model reduces the potential complexity of a theorical random association in a remarkable manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. As a summary, it would be very helpful to generated a table (or similar) where is proposed chromatin state is ascribed to functional genomic elements.</p></disp-quote><p>This aspect of the work is presented in a preprint where the biological association with the chromatin is described in details. See Jamge et al 2002, https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.02.494419v1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Fig 2F (and S2B). A comprehensive comparison a various approaches should include others and estimate the Jaccard similarity index: (1) the same of marks and variants used in the Sequeira-Mendes et al paper, and (2) the subset of marks and variants added in this study. In this way, a direct evaluation of the contributions could be more properly made.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and have now included a new column with the combination of marks and variants as used in Sequeira-Mendes et al., 2014 (see Figure 2F). These data clearly demonstrate that adding histone variants significantly contribute to the definition of chromatin states.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Fig. 3. Explain in more detail the concatenated model used here. Does the reduction in the number of chromatin states mean that the other do not add new information?</p></disp-quote><p>ChromHMM concatenated model allows to identify common definition of chromatin state in multiple tissue types. Here multiple cell types are concatenated leading to a shared definition of chromatin states, but specific to each cell type.</p><p>In our paper we used the concatenated model to identify common chromatin states in two different genotypes (WT and ddm1). The data for WT and ddm1 was obtained from leaves. As we had a limited number of ChIP-seq profiles in the leaves dataset The complexity of the concatenated model was also reduced compared to the extensive 26 chromatin state model. We chose to analyze 16-states in the concatenated model because this was the minimal number of states that gave rise to a similar complexity of heterochromatic states.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. The ddm1 mutant. The text in page 14 is a bit confusing. It seems that H2A.Z is deposited on TEs and the exchanged by the H2A.W.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided additional alternative models that could explain our observations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Page 15: link between H2A.Z and H3K27me3. Gomez-Zambrano et al 2018, cited in the text, found that only a relatively small subset of (putative) targets are common to H2A.Z and H3K27me3. How do authors reconcile this with their statement supporting a link between both of them?</p></disp-quote><p>We refer to Gomez-Zambranao et al to illustrate the link between H2A.Z and H2AK121ub so we do not understand this comment. The strong link between H2A.Z and H3K27me3 is shown without ambiguity by our work and also Carter et al., 2018.</p></body></sub-article></article>
