However, the contribution of cellular programs outside islets to insulitis is unclear. Here, using CO-Detection by indEXing (CODEX) tissue imaging and cadaveric pancreas samples, we simultaneously examine islet and extra-islet inflammation in human T1D. We identify four sub-states of inflamed islets characterized by the activation profiles of CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells enriched in islets relative to the surrounding tissue. We further find that the extra-islet space of lobules with extensive islet-infiltration differs from the extra-islet space of less infiltrated areas within the same tissue section. Finally, we identify lymphoid structures away from islets enriched in CD45RA<sup>+</sup> T cells — a population also enriched in one of the inflamed islet sub-states. Together, these data help define the coordination between islets and the extra-islet pancreas in the pathogenesis of human T1D.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>When someone has type 1 diabetes, their immune system mistakenly targets and destroys β-cells in the pancreas, which produce insulin, the hormone that helps bring down sugar levels in the blood after we eat. Despite advances in treatment, most people with type 1 diabetes will depend on insulin for their entire lives.</p><p>T cells are a type of immune cell involved in type 1 diabetes. These cells infiltrate the pancreatic islets, the structures where β-cells reside, to attack the β-cells. This process, called insulitis, is poorly understood, partly because obtaining tissue samples containing islets in the process of being infiltrated by T cells is extremely difficult.</p><p>Barlow et al. collaborated with the Network for Pancreatic Organ Donors with Diabetes to obtain pancreatic tissues from eight organ donors with type 1 diabetes, and two organ donors whose immune systems could recognize islets but who were not yet exhibiting diabetes symptoms.</p><p>Barlow et al. analysed 54 proteins in each tissue section and examined how inflammation progressed in islet cells and the surrounding pancreas to better understand insulitis. The researchers identified four types of insulitis, each defined by the types of T cells present. The nature of the T cells in islets is important because it may affect how fast type 1 diabetes progresses. Although Barlow et al. did not examine enough cases to establish if a correlation exists between the types of insulitis and disease progression, this can be examined in future studies. They also found that, during insulitis, the blood vessels in the islets switched on a protein called IDO, possibly in response to T cells that infiltrate islets. IDO may temporarily protect the islets from the immune response as insulitis progresses, but it is insufficient to protect the β-cells. Barlow et al. further found aggregates of T cells mixed with B cells, another type of immune cell, in the pancreas tissue surrounding the islets. Given that B cells and T cells provide stimulatory signals to each other, these aggregates may promote inflammation and be a new therapeutic target.</p><p>Barlow et al. also wanted to understand why T cells target some islets more than others and why islet destruction is spatially organized. The team compared pancreatic areas with many inflamed islets to areas in the same donor where fewer islets were inflamed, finding that the cell composition differs. Interestingly, the types of cells that were different were not the same as those that were infiltrating islets. B cells, macrophages and T cells were the major cell types infiltrating islets, but the cells that varied outside islets were nerves, endothelial cells, and a third cell type that may have been innate lymphoid cells. These results indicate a crosstalk between the cells outside islets and those that infiltrate islets.</p><p>The results by Barlow et al. lay the groundwork for a better understanding of the biology underpinning how the immune system destroys β-cells in insulitis. The next steps would be to see if other cells in the islets can influence T cells and if diabetes could be delayed by inhibiting interactions between T cells and the relevant cells outside the islets. Moreover, it would be important to establish whether preserving IDO in endothelial cells could delay diabetes symptoms.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In type 1 diabetes (T1D), insulin-producing β-cells are killed by islet-infiltrating immune cells in a process called ‘insulitis’. T1D results in a critical requirement for exogenous insulin and affects over eight million individuals world-wide with an estimated 0.5 million new diagnoses each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gregory et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Recently, the first immunotherapy for delaying T1D onset, teplizumab (a human anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hirsch, 2023</xref>). However, this treatment and other immunotherapies help only a small fraction of patients and are significantly less effective after patients progress to overt T1D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Herold et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Perdigoto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Herold et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pescovitz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Orban et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Orban et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bluestone et al., 2021</xref>). A better understanding of T1D pathogenesis is essential to building on this progress.</p><p>One of the challenges of studying human T1D pathology is the availability of suitable tissue samples. Obtaining pancreatic biopsies raises the risk of surgical complications and the progressive nature of T1D would necessitate serial, longitudinal studies over time, which is prohibitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krogvold et al., 2014</xref>). Fortunately, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) Network for Pancreatic Organ Donors with Diabetes (nPOD) provides human pancreatic tissues from cadaveric donors for this study and many others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Campbell-Thompson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pugliese et al., 2014</xref>). nPOD has enabled substantial progress towards characterizing the pathology of human T1D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wilcox et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arif et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leete et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martino et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Korpos et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Our understanding of key features of human T1D pathology remains limited. Although the cellular composition of insulitis, inflammation specifically of the islets, has been studied extensively, this has been done in separate studies looking at different tissue sections, prohibiting an understanding of how the numerous cellular programs in insulitis are coordinated throughout disease. This was recently addressed using Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC), which uncovered alterations in β-cell phenotypes, immune composition, vascular density, and basement membrane that accompany T1D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Damond et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). However, these studies did not deeply phenotype islet-infiltrating CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells, believed to be major driver of β-cell elimination.</p><p>Recently, intriguing differences in the extra-islet spaces of T1D and healthy controls have been reported. First, the abundance of multiple types of immune cells outside islets are increased in T1D patients compared to non-T1D controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rodriguez-Calvo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Campbell-Thompson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bender et al., 2020</xref>). Second, HLA-DR expression is increased on ductal cells in T1D tissue donors, hinting at a functional link with CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fasolino et al., 2022</xref>). Third, peri-insulitis, the accumulation of immune cells outside islets, is observed in tissues from patients with T1D <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Korpos et al., 2013</xref>, indicating that not all T cells enter the pancreas directly via islet microvasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Savinov et al., 2003</xref>). Fourth, in human T1D, but less so in most animal models, islets in different regions of the pancreas are infiltrated at strikingly different rates for reasons that are unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">In’t Veld, 2014</xref>). This suggests that the extra-islet compartment could be responsible by governing the targeting of islets. Finally, tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) — dense aggregates of lymphoid cells indicative of local immune activation — are observed outside islets in T1D patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Korpos et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In summary, analyzing both compartments simultaneously could help identify how these extra-islet factors influence islet pathogenesis. However, to date, multiplexed imaging studies have only examined islets. A comprehensive, spatially resolved cellular analysis of both compartments in T1D is lacking.</p><p>Here, we investigated the islet and extra-islet pancreas together. We used CO-Detection by indexing (CODEX) with an antibody panel targeting 54 antigens to samples from a cohort of T1D patients with insulitis as well as non-T1D individuals with and without islet-specific autoantibodies (AA- and AA+ respectively) obtained through the JDRF nPOD program. We analyzed approximately 2000 islets and broad swaths of the extra-islet tissue to evaluate local and distal spatial architecture. We then used pseudotime analysis to characterize insulitis sub-states based on the activation states of islet-infiltrating CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells. We further investigated the cellular changes in niches and lobules beyond islets. Our results implicate both the islet microenvironment and inflammation at distal sites within the pancreas in the progression of insulitis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cohort curation, image acquisition, and cell annotation</title><p>The JDRF nPOD is a national registry of cadaveric pancreases donated by T1D patients that has transformed the ability of researchers to investigate the pathways underlying the progression of human T1D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Campbell-Thompson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pugliese et al., 2014</xref>).

Although nPOD had close to 200 T1D cases, at the time of our study, only 17 had documented insulitis. Of these, triple-immunohistochemistry for Insulin, Glucagon, and CD3 was performed. T1D and AA+ cases that had CD3 staining in islet or peri-islet spaces and tissue still available were selected for our study. The final cohort included two AA+ cases, eight T1D cases, and three non-T1D controls. Given that insulitis is not detected in non-T1D cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bruggeman et al., 2021</xref>), the blocks from controls were selected randomly.

CellSeg was used to segment cell nuclei and quantify marker expression from CODEX images as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2022</xref>. In total, our dataset consisted of 7.0x10<sup>6</sup> cells across all donors (ranging from 3.0x10<sup>5</sup> to 9.8x10<sup>5</sup> cells per donor). Twenty-one cell types were identified with Leiden clustering and manual merging and visualized using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Endocrine cells were manually gated from UMAP embeddings derived from Proinsulin, Glucagon, and Somatostatin to identify β-cells, α-cells, and δ-cells, respectively. Immune cells were sub-clustered with the Leiden algorithm using immune-specific markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). To verify the accuracy of our annotations, we overlaid cell labels onto the original images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Of note, we could not accurately identify macrophage subsets or distinguish dendritic cells from macrophages due to the panel design, complex combinations of co-expression, and the difficulty in segmenting and quantifying markers on myeloid populations due to their morphology. Therefore, we refer to this cluster as ‘macrophage/DCs’ In addition, we identified a cell population that could not be definitively annotated that expressed high levels of CD45, CD69, Granzyme-B, and CD44, intermediate levels of CD16, S100A6, Galectin-3, and Hyaluronan, but not expressing CD3, CD20, CD56, CD57, CD15, or MPO. We confirmed from the raw images that CD3, CD4, and CD8 were not internalized, indicating activation, nor did these cells express other T cell activation markers CD45RA, CD45RO, PD-1, or LAG-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> bottom right).

Previous reports observed that insulin-containing islets are significantly more common in recent-onset T1D cases than cases with diabetes durations of greater than one year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">In’t Veld, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Campbell-Thompson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Richardson and Pugliese, 2022</xref>). Similarly, we found that samples from patients who had been diagnosed with T1D for 0–2 years had significantly reduced β-cell frequencies compared to non-T1D controls. Furthermore, samples from subjects with disease durations of 5–6 years had minimal remaining β-cell mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Whereas one AA+ case had β-cell mass comparable to those of cases with disease duration of 0–2 years, the other AA+ case was comparable to non-T1D controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The total islet area imaged was comparable across all donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Next, we investigated how the abundances of non-endocrine cell types inside islets differed across donors. We performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the donors using the frequencies of non-endocrine cell types located in islets. Donors were clearly separated into two groups by the first two principal components; one group included all T1D cases and one AA+ case and the second included all non-T1D cases and the other AA+ case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In this analysis, we did not consider β-cells, ⍺-cells, and δ-cells. Thus, donors were stratified by disease duration strictly according to the abundances of immune and other pancreatic, non-endocrine cell types in the islets.</p><p>We next considered only cells located outside islets. Again, donors were clearly separable by the first two principal components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The first principal component separated cases with times since diagnosis between 0 and 2 years from non-T1D, AA+, and cases with diabetes durations of 5–6 years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The second principal component separated cases with diabetes durations of 5–6 years from the rest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Therefore, both the islet and extra-islet spaces of T1D and non-T1D cases were distinct.</p><p>Many cell types were increased in T1D cases with times since diagnosis of 0–2 years relative to non-T1D controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). In T1D cases with times since diagnosis of 5–6 years, the abundance of different cell types either remained higher than non-T1D controls or returned to baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). This trend was present in both islet and extra-islet regions. These data demonstrate that the immune activity between the islet and extra-islet compartments are coordinated.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Pseudotemporal reconstruction of islet pathogenesis identifies a conserved trajectory of insulitis</title><p>In human T1D, β-cell destruction does not occur simultaneously across all islets and even neighboring islets can be at different stages of destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Damond et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">In’t Veld, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">In’t Veld, 2011</xref>).

CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells expressing CD45RA (which are either naive or terminally differentiated effector memory cells [TEMRA]) were detectable in islets, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Damond et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

These populations resemble the two exhausted T cell populations identified in the peripheral blood of T1D patients that were associated with responsiveness to alefacept <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Diggins et al., 2021</xref>. Therefore, the activation profiles of islet-infiltrating T cells are heterogeneous.</p><p>We reasoned that the islet microenvironment may dictate the activation state of CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells by specifically recruiting T cells of a particular state or inducing changes after they enter the islet. If so, islets would contain specific combinations of CD8<sup>+</sup>T cell states. To interrogate this, we performed UMAP only on Inflamed islets, using the frequencies of CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells expressing each functional marker. We identified four inflamed sub-clusters, I–IV, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> top). Here, the term ‘sub-cluster’ is used to highlight that these groups were all contained within the previously defined ‘Inflamed’ cluster and the roman numerals do not imply a temporal ordering. Inflamed-I contained only CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells that did not express any of the functional markers analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> bottom, top row). Inflamed-II was characterized by a high frequency of CD45RA<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> bottom, second row from top and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> top row).

In summary, the phenotypes of CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells are coordinated across islets.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Regulation of insulitis sub-states by the islet microenvironment</title><p>To identify cellular or molecular factors that regulate the state of CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells in islets, we first inspected the distribution of inflamed sub-clusters in each patient. Each donor possessed islets that belonged to multiple inflamed islet sub-clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Therefore donor-level factors such as genetics, the location within the pancreas (i.e. head, body, or tail), or time since T1D onset, are not associated. Instead, these insulitis sub-states are conserved among T1D patients.</p><p>Next, we asked if each T cell marker is enriched in CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells in islets compared to CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells in the peri-islet and exocrine space. We computed the frequencies of each CD8<sup>+</sup>T cell state inside islets of each inflamed sub-cluster and in separate swaths 0–25 µm, 25–50 µm and 50–100 µm away from the islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). We found that for islets of Inflamed-II, -III, and -IV, functional markers characterizing their CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells were expressed more frequently inside than in the surrounding tissue areas. Although the different functional markers were all enriched on islet-infiltrating T cells compared to T cells outside islets, the degree of this enrichment varied across the markers measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). The markers of Inflamed-IV, LAG-3, ICOS, and Granzyme-B, were highly enriched inside islets (~20% of islet-infiltrating CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells vs &lt;5% of extra-islet CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells). CD45RA and CD69 in Inflamed-II were slightly less enriched in islets (~28% of islet-infiltrating and ~20% of extra-islet CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells). CD45RO and PD-1 in Inflamed-III islets were the most abundant but had the least enrichment in islets (~45% of islet-infiltrating CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells vs ~35% of extra-islet CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). This demonstrated that the specific differences in the compositions of CD8<sup>+</sup>T cell states in different islets were attributable to the islet microenvironment and not the surrounding extra-islet spaces.</p><p>Although macrophage/DCs are abundant in islets from the Inflamed group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) and can interact with T cells by presenting antigen or secreting cytokines, neither the expression of markers of macrophage/DC activity nor macrophage/DC abundance was significantly associated with any of the inflamed sub-clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Similarly, no other cell type nor the vascular expression of IDO was linked to CD8<sup>+</sup>T cell programs in islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Accordingly, the four inflamed sub-clusters had identical distributions throughout the original PAGA force-directed layout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Therefore, the activation states of islet-infiltrating T cells are independent of the abundance of any of the other cell types we could identify.</p><p>Lastly, we compared CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells in islets from the Insulin-Depleted + Immune group to CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells in islets from the Inflamed group. Insulin-Depleted + Immune islets contained a higher frequency of CD45RA<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells and a lower frequency of CD45RO<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells than Inflamed islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). TOX was expressed by a higher frequency of CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells in Insulin-Depleted + Immune islets than CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells in Inflamed islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Importantly, CD45RA and TOX were never co-expressed on the same CD8<sup>+</sup>T cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

However, other donors are on the other end of this spectrum and have lobules comprised of a random mixture of islets from different stages of pathogenesis.</p><p>It is unknown why some cases exhibit lobular patterning.

Note that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> differs from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> because islets are broken up according to pseudotime, not donor, and not all islets in T1D donors are undergoing insulitis.</p><p>Counterintuitively, although CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells and macrophage/DCs were higher in the extra-islet compartments of T1D cases vs non-T1D cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), they were not associated with lobular patterning (they were not more abundant in the extra-islet space of lobules with more advanced insulitis; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). These data raise the possibility that vasculature, Granzyme-B/CD3- cells, and nerves outside islets help predispose lobules to insulitis or are affected by extensive insulitis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Immature tertiary lymphoid structures are enriched in subjects with T1D</title><p>We hypothesized that T cells’ interactions with certain cell types in specific areas of the pancreas may be important for their functionality.

The top three CNs (fold change of abundance in T1D relative to abundance in non-T1D) were (CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells|B cells), (Macrophage|Stromal Cells|B cells), and (Vasculature|B cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). We asked whether these three CNs were commonly adjacent to each other as this could indicate that they act as components of a larger structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhate et al., 2022</xref>). Measuring the frequency with which the three B cell CNs were adjacent to each other throughout the tissues demonstrated that the (CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells|B cells) CN is predominantly found adjacent to both the other CNs but that (Macrophage|Stroma|B cells) and (Vasculature|B cells) are less commonly adjacent to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>We next asked whether these CN assemblies corresponded to either peri-vascular cuffs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agrawal et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wekerle, 2017</xref>) or tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Korpos et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agrawal et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rovituso et al., 2016</xref>), as these are two B cell-rich structures commonly present in autoimmune conditions. Although the (CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells|B cells) CN was adjacent to vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), it was not in the perivascular space, as is the case with perivascular cuffs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). In our samples, the (CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells|B cells) CN did not have segregated T cell and B cell zones as seen in mature TLSs, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Korpos et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In summary, the (CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells|B cells) CN is more abundant in T1D tissues from patients with diabetes durations of 0–2 years compared to non-T1D tissues and T1D tissue from patients who had T1D for more than 4 years.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Immature tertiary lymphoid structures are in the extra-islet pancreas, and are enriched in CD45RA<sup>+</sup> /CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells</title><p>We next asked whether the (CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells|B cells) CN had high endothelial venules (HEV), specialized blood vessels that are commonly found in TLSs that enable naive lymphocytes to extravasate into peripheral tissues. We observed expression of peripheral lymph node addressin (PNAd), an HEV marker, in the vessels associated with the (CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells|B cells) CN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> left image) but not in other vessels (data not shown). Although we could not assess the presence of other TLS traits such as follicular dendritic cells, fibroblastic reticular cells, or follicular helper T cells, the aggregation of B cells and presence of HEVs, but the lack of compartmentalized B and T cell zones indicate that instances of the (CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells|B cells) CN are immature TLSs.</p><p>Next, we asked if immature TLSs could support the entry of naive CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells into the pancreas. We observed CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells co-expressing CD45RA and CD62L (the ligand for PNAd) near PNAd<sup>+</sup> vasculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, middle and right image respectively). Thus, CD45RA<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells in the pancreas may adhere to HEVs. Furthermore, CD45RA<sup>+</sup> was enriched threefold on CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells in the (CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells|B cells) CN relative to CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells in the tissue as a whole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), providing additional evidence that CD45RA<sup>+</sup> T cells may enter the pancreas through HEVs.</p><p>We found immature TLSs both adjacent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>.1) or not adjacent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>.2) to islets. Quantifying the frequency of this adjacency revealed that fewer than half of the immature TLSs were adjacent to islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). We did not identify any differences in the cellular composition of the immature TLSs that were or were not adjacent to islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We reasoned that even if immature TLSs were far from islets, extravasating cells may migrate to islets. Accordingly, islet-adjacent CD45RA<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells (that were not in islet-adjacent TLSs) co-expressed CD62L, suggesting that they originated from the (CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells|B cell) CN (HH). Consistent with this, in one notable tissue donor, regions of the pancreas with Insulin-Depleted islets were enriched in the (CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells|B cell) CN relative to regions of the pancreas with β-cell containing islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). This spatial correlation between the (CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells|B cells) CN and the destruction of islets implicates immature TLSs with islet pathology even if they are not adjacent to islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have performed CODEX imaging and comprehensive computational analysis of whole cadaveric pancreata from T1D subjects. Our data support several conclusions.</p><p>First, our results are consistent with the model previously proposed by Damond et al, who proposed a single trajectory for insulitis, characterized by an enrichment in HLA-ABC expression, CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells, and macrophage/DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Damond et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Second, we are the first to report that IDO<sup>+</sup> vasculature is present in inflamed islets but not in normal islets or islets that have lost insulin-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Furthermore, islets with IDO<sup>+</sup> vasculature contained higher frequencies of CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells and higher expression of HLA-ABC, but not higher frequencies of macrophage/DCs compared to inflamed islets that did not contain IDO<sup>+</sup> vasculature, suggesting that IDO is induced by a cytokine produced by infiltrating CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells such as IFN-γ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Given IDO’s established tolerogenic role, these data suggest that the loss of IDO on vasculature could be a prerequisite for β-cell death. Leveraging this checkpoint to protect transplanted β-cells from rejection has shown promise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander et al., 2002</xref>) and could be combined with similar approaches using programmed death-ligand 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yoshihara et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Castro-Gutierrez et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>We did not observe IDO expression on β-cells, in contrast to Anquetil et al. that report this in healthy patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anquetil et al., 2018</xref>). Our observations are consistent with data demonstrating that IDO needs to be induced. First, it has been shown with western blot and RT-PCR that human islets require cytokine stimulation to express IDO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sarkar et al., 2007</xref>). Second, the human protein atlas has tested multiple IDO antibodies and demonstrated that IDO is negative in human islets via immunohistochemistry: (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.proteinatlas.org">https://www.proteinatlas.org</ext-link>). In addition, the human protein atlas’s single-cell RNAseq atlas only report IDO transcripts in immune cells in healthy pancreas.</p><p>Third, we performed the first high-dimensional spatial phenotyping of CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells in T1D islets. We found that most T cells were antigen experienced. A small population expressed CD45RA and CD69, which could be naive, TEMRA, or Tscm cells (P). Another population expressed LAG-3, Granzyme-B, and ICOS. It is notable that only a small population of islets had Granzyme-B-expressing T cells. This could indicate that alternative mechanisms are contributing to the elimination of β-cells.</p><p>Fourth, the insulitis trajectory is comprised of four sub-clusters, each characterized by the activation profile of the islet-infiltrating CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Multiple of these inflamed sub-clusters were present in all T1D donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). One potential explanation for this observation is that sub-clusters are capable of inter-converting. The factors that regulate the conversion of a given islet between sub-clusters could correspond to immunoregulatory checkpoints that are critical to the progression of T1D. Unfortunately, our search for such features failed to generate any candidates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). By phenotyping T cells at different distances from the islet edge, we were able to determine that the T cell activation profiles characterizing each sub-cluster were only present in the islet, not in the surrounding tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Unfortunately, from our data, we cannot speculate whether the insulitis sub-clusters arose due to differential stimulation of T cells that had already entered islets, differential recruitment of pre-activated T cells, or both.</p><p>Fifth, pancreatic lobules affected by insulitis are characterized by distinct tissue markers. We discovered that lobules enriched in β-cell-depleted islets were also enriched in nerves, vasculature, and Granzyme-B<sup>+</sup>/CD3<sup>-</sup> cells, suggesting these factors may make lobules permissive to disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The role of islet enervation in T1D has been studied but such work has focused on nerves in the islet rather than on nerves in the exocrine tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Christoffersson et al., 2020</xref>). The Granzyme-B<sup>+</sup>/CD3<sup>-</sup> cells could be natural killer cells; if so, they are most likely of the CD56<sup>dim</sup> subset as CD56 was not detected on these cells. It is noteworthy that the cell types linked with direct islet invasion were distinct from those linked to lobule patterning even though both sets of cell types were found across islet and extra-islet regions. Therefore, for insulitis to consume every islet, crosstalk may be required between the cell types in the islet and extra-islet compartments. Conversely, inhibiting this interaction might contain pathology to isolated lesions.</p><p>Finally, we identify immature TLSs away from islets where CD45RA<sup>+/</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells aggregate. We also observed an inflamed islet-subcluster characterized by an abundance of CD45RA<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. It will be important to determine whether the CD45RA<sup>+</sup> T cells localized around islets may have originated from immature TLSs. In mice, blocking immune egress from lymph nodes reduced the size of TLSs and halted diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Penaranda et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, therapeutic targeting of immune cell trafficking to TLSs could help mitigate autoimmunity in human T1D.</p><p>Together, these data illuminate relationships between insulitis, the local islet microenvironment and inflammation at distal sites.</p><p>A major limitation for the study is the cohort size. Cases with documented insulitis are very rare, significantly limiting the feasibility of curating large cohorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Campbell-Thompson et al., 2016</xref>). Due to this limitation, factors such as the donors’ histories of drug use, durations of stay in the intensive care unit, and BMIs could not be balanced or statistically adjusted for but should be considered as they may affect exocrine inflammation but not the prevalence of insulitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bruggeman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">In’t Veld et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, only one of the AA+ cases, Case 6267, had detectable insulitis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The other case, 6314 tested positive for only one autoantibody, GADA, and therefore had a significantly lower probability of progressing to overt T1D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ziegler et al., 2013</xref>). Age and diabetes duration are also important criteria to consider when interpreting key results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Another limitation is our limited perspective on myeloid cell populations. Although antibodies in our panel detect numerous myeloid markers, we failed to identify any heterogeneity in myeloid populations during insulitis. This was likely due in part to the difficulty of segmenting myeloid cells and quantifying marker expression due to their morphology. Spatial transcriptomics could be used in future studies to better define the myeloid populations and inform additions to future CODEX panels.</p><p>Lastly, our samples are two-dimensional sections which could affect some of the adjacency relations.</p><p>In conclusion, using a data-driven approach, we mapped conserved sub-states of insulitis and integrated the spatial pathology of islet and extra-islet regions into a single model of T1D pathogenesis. The tools and computational pipelines developed here will enable further investigation of immune pathology at the tissue scale that may lead to development of therapies for T1D.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

the nPOD program, sponsored by the Juvenile Diabetes Research Fund. Case numbers cited herein are assigned by nPOD and comparable across nPOD-supported projects. 17 cases in the nPOD biorepository had been previously documented to contain insulitis. For each of these cases, we examined the triple stained immunohistochemistry images (CD3, Insulin, and Glucagon) using nPOD’s online pathology database to select blocks in which insulitis was present. To ensure that the tissue regions still contained insulitis (and had not been sectioned extensively after their images were uploaded to the nPOD pathology database), we re-sectioned and visualized CD3, Insulin, and Glucagon. The use of cadaveric human tissue samples is not considered human subject research and does not require review by Stanford University’s Institutional Review Board.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>CODEX data collection</title><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>CODEX antibody generation and validation</title><p>Oligonucleotides were conjugated to purified, carrier-free, commercially available antibodies as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schürch et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kennedy-Darling et al., 2021</xref>). For validation experiments, human tonsils and non-diabetic pancreata were co-embedded in FFPE blocks so both tissues could be stained and imaged simultaneously. Each antibody in the CODEX panel was validated by co-staining with previously established antibodies targeting positive and negative control cell types. Once validated, the concentration and imaging exposure time of each antibody were optimized. The tissue staining patterning was compared to the online database, The Human Protein Atlas, and the published literature.

Briefly, FFPE tissues were deparaffinized and rehydrated. Heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) antigen retrieval was conducted in Tris/EDTA buffer at pH9 (Dako) at 97°C for 10 min. Tissues were blocked for 1 hr with rat and mouse Ig, salmon-sperm DNA, and a mixture of the non-fluorescent DNA oligo sequences used as CODEX barcodes. Tissues were stained with the antibody cocktail in a sealed humidity chamber overnight at 4°C with shaking. The next day, tissues were washed, fixed with 1.6% paraformaldehyde, 100% methanol, and BS3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and mounted to a custom-made acrylic plate attached to the microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>CODEX imaging</title><p>Imaging was conducted using the Keyence BZ-X710 fluorescence microscope with a CFI Plan Apo λ 20x/0.75 objective (Nikon). ‘High resolution’ mode was selected in Keyence Navigator software, resulting in a final resolution of .37744 µm/pixel. The exposure times are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3 table4">Tables 3 and 4</xref>. Regions for imaging were selected by rendering HLA-ABC, Proinsulin, and CD8 and selecting large regions (averaging 55 mm<sup>2</sup>).

Biotinylated hyaluronan-binding protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clark et al., 2011</xref> was rendered by adding streptavidin-PE at 1:500 concentration to the 96-well plate containing fluorescent oligos in the last cycle and running the CODEX program normally.

Cells were split into training, validation, and test splits (60/15/25 respectively). ResNet50 architecture and initial weights were imported from the Keras library pre trained on ImageNet. Image augmentation consisted of random flips, rotations, zooms, contrast, and translation (±ten pixels only). All weights were unfrozen, and the model was trained for 100 epochs (see accompanying source code for training details).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Sub-clustering of inflamed islets with cell-type-specific functional markers</title><p>For each Inflamed Islet (n=351), the frequency of each marker expressed by CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells was computed. Single cells inside the islet and within 20 µm from the islet’s edge were combined before the frequency was measured. The subsequent matrix underwent z-normalization followed by UMAP gating using Bokeh. Insulin-Depleted + Immune Islets were defined as islets without β-cells with greater than two CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells and greater than seven macrophage/DCs. These thresholds correspond to the 95th percentiles of CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells and macrophage/DCs in Normal islets.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Identification of cellular neighborhoods</title><p>Previously, CNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schürch et al., 2020</xref>) were identified by, for each single cell, defining its ‘window’ as the 20 spatial nearest neighbors. Cells were clustered according to the number of each cell type in their windows using Mini Batch K-Means. The output clusters corresponded to CNs. To ensure our method was sensitive to rare neighborhoods, we adapted this algorithm by over-clustering, using k=200 in the K-Means step rather than using a k ranging from 10 to 20 as used elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Phillips et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhate et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shekarian et al., 2022</xref>). Next, to determine which cell types were characteristic of each cluster, we identified, for each cluster, the set of cell types that were present in more than 80% of the windows allocated to that cluster. We named the clusters according to this set of cell types and merged all clusters with the same name, resulting in 75 CNs. Acinar cells and epithelial cells were used in the kNN graph and in the clustering but were not considered when merging clusters. Note that this method does not differentiate neighborhoods that have the same combination of cell types but different stoichiometries.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Lobule segmentation</title><p>A training dataset was generated by manually tracing the edges of lobules in ImageJ using the ROI function. The ROI were then floodfilled in Python and used as masks for training. For each tile, the blank cycle was selected to distinguish tissue from background coverslip. A U-Net model was trained for 10 epochs (see attached source code for training details). After stitching together all masks, the resulting images required slight refinement where lobules were not completely separated, and this was done manually in ImageJ. The connected components in the stitched image defined the lobule instances. Cells were assigned to a lobule by indexing the lobule mask with their X and Y coordinates. Cells in the inter-lobular space were assigned to one ‘edge’ lobule. This resulted in 464 lobules.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Formulation of hierarchical linear models</title><p>For each lobule, the number of each cell type in the extra-islet space was divided by the number of acinar cells in the extra-islet space.

They aimed to assess key features of inflammation in both islet and extra-islet tissue areas; they report that the extra-islet space of lobules with extensive islet infiltration differs from the extra-islet space of less infiltrated areas within the same tissue section. The study also identifies four sub-states of inflamed islets characterized by the activation profiles of CD8+T cells enriched in islets relative to the surrounding tissue. Lymphoid structures are identified in the pancreas tissue away from islets, and these were enriched in CD45RA+ T cells - a population also enriched in one of the inflamed islet sub-states. Together, these data help define the coordination between islets and the extra-islet pancreas in the pathogenesis of human T1D.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The analysis of tissue from well-characterized organ donors, provided by the Network for the Pancreatic Organ Donor with Diabetes, adds strength to the validity of the findings.</p><p>By using their innovative imaging/computation approaches, key known features of islet autoimmunity were confirmed, providing validation of the methodology.</p><p>The detection of IDO+ vasculature in inflamed islets - but not in normal islets or islets that have lost insulin-expression links this expression to the islet inflammation, and it is a novel observation. IDO expression in the vasculature may be induced by inflammation and may lost as disease progresses, and it may provide a potential therapeutic avenue.</p><p>The high-dimensional spatial phenotyping of CD8+T cells in T1D islets confirmed that most T cells were antigen experienced. Some additional subsets were noted: a small population of T cells expressing CD45RA and CD69, possibly naive or TEMRA cells, and cells expressing LAG-3, Granzyme-B, and ICOS.</p><p>While much attention has been devoted to the study of the insulitis lesion in T1D, our current knowledge is quite limited; the description of four sub-clusters characterized by the</p><p>activation profile of the islet-infiltrating CD8+T cells is novel. Their presence in all T1D donors, indicates that the disease process is asynchronous and is not at the same stage across all islets. Although this concept is not novel, this appears to be the most advanced characterization of insulitis stages.</p><p>When examining together both the exocrine and islet areas, which is rarely done, authors report that pancreatic lobules affected by insulitis are characterized by distinct tissue markers. Their data support the concept that disease progression may require crosstalk between cells in the islet and extra-islet compartments. Lobules enriched in β-cell-depleted islets were also enriched in nerves, vasculature, and Granzyme-B+/CD3- cells, which may be natural killer cells.</p><p>Lastly, authors report that immature tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) exist both near and away from islets, where CD45RA+ CD8+T cells aggregate, and also observed an inflamed islet-subcluster characterized by an abundance of CD45RA+/CD8+ T cells. These TLSs may represent a point of entry for T cells and this study further supports their role in islet autoimmunity.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>As the author themselves acknowledge, the major limitation is that the number of donors examined is limited as those satisfying study criteria are rare. Thus, it is not possible to examine disease heterogeneity, and the impact of age at diagnosis. Of 8 T1D donors examined, 4 would be considered newly diagnosed (less than 3 months from onset) and 4 had longer disease durations (2, 2, 5 and 6 years). It was unclear if disease duration impacted the results in this small cohort. In the introduction, the authors discuss that most of the pancreata from nPOD donors with T1D lack insulitis. This is correct, yet it is a function of time from diagnosis. Donors with shorter duration will be more likely to have insulitis. A related point is that the proportion of islets with insulitis is low even near diagnosis, Finally, only one donor was examined that while not diagnosed with T1D, was likely in the preclinical disease stage and had autoantibodies and insulitis. This is a critically important disease stage where the methodology developed by the investigators could be applied in future efforts.</p><p>While this was not the focus of this investigation, it appears that the approach was very much immune-focused and there could be value in examining islet cells in greater depth using the methodology the authors developed.</p><p>Additional comments</p><p>Overall, the authors were able to study pancreas tissues from T1D donors and perform sophisticated imaging and computational analysis that reproduce and importantly extend our understanding of inflammation in T1D. Despite the limitations associated with the small sample size, the results appear robust, and the claims are well supported.</p><p>The study expands the conceptual framework of inflammation and islet autoimmunity, especially by the definition of different clusters (stages) of insulitis and by the characterization of immune cells in and outside the islets.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>I have not felt the need to update the initial review.</p><p>However, I note that the paragraph describing the nPOD repository (lines 154-158) can be misinterpreted that insulitis is infrequent in T1D (17 of 200 donors had it) without the clarification that insulitis is present around the time of diagnosis in most patients and it subsides over time. Thus, authors are urged to clarify that the presence of insulitis and its severity are impacted by the disease stage and disease duration.</p><p>The last sentence of this paragraph, lines 164-165, although linked to the previous sentence about the cause of death in the donors, may be misconstrued in the context of this paragraph, and it is unclear what data support this statement.

We agree that patient heterogeneity and the sample size limited the impact of this study. In the future, more cases with insulitis will become available and spatial technologies will become more scalable.</p><p>Given these constraints, we have made a significant effort to illustrate the individual heterogeneity of the disease by using the same color for each nPOD case ID throughout the manuscript and showing individual donors whenever feasible (e.g. Figures 1D-E, 2C, 2I, 3E, 3G, 4B-C, 5C, and 5F). For figures related to insulitis, we do not typically include non-T1D controls since they did not have any insulitis (Figure 2C). We also explicitly discuss the differences in the two autoantibody-positive, non-T1D cases: one closely resembled the T1D cases with respect to multiple features and the other more closely resembled the non-T1D, autoantibody-negative controls.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors aimed to characterize the cellular phenotype and spatial relationship of cell types infiltrating the islets of Langerhans in human T1D using CODEX, a multiplexed examination of cellular markers</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Major strengths of this study are the use of pancreas tissue from well-characterized tissue donors, and the use of CODEX, a state-of-the-art detection technique of extensive characterization and spatial characterization of cell types and cellular interactions.

The authors speculate this may be induced as a feature of IFNg expressed by lymphocytes in the local microenvironment. Can any of these concepts be further validated by staining for transcription factors or surrogate downstream markers associated with Th1 skewing (e.g., Tbet, CXCR3, etc)?</p></disp-quote><p>The only other interferon-stimulated gene in our panel is HLA-ABC. We updated Supplemental Figure 2F to include HLA-ABC expression in IDO- and IDO+ islets (within the “Inflamed” group). Consistent with the hypothesis that IDO is stimulated by interferon, HLA-ABC is also significantly higher in IDO+ islets than IDO- islets. PDL1, another interferon-stimulated gene. was included in the panel but we did not detect any signal. This antibody was very weak during testing in the tonsil, so we couldn’t confidently claim that PDL1 was not expressed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors discuss the potential that CD45RA may be expressed in Temra populations.

We think it is more appropriate to request the data directly from them.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) I had only a few specific comments. I think the statement in Lines 317 and 318 is too strong. It implies that each lobe is always homogeneous for having all islets with insulitis or not having insulitis. Some lobes are certainly enriched for islets with insulitis but insulin+ islets without insulitis in some lobes in some T1D donors are seen. Please soften that statement.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for our lack of clarity. We have edited the text (line 305-309) to better articulate that organ donors fall on a spectrum. Thank you for raising this point as we think the motivation for our analysis is much clearer after these revisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Please cite and discuss In't Veld Diabetes 20210 PMID: 20413508. While the main point of the paper is that there is beta cell replication after prolonged life support, another observation is that there is a correlation between prolonged life support and CD45+ cells in the pancreas parenchyma. This might indicate that not all immune cells in the parenchyma are T1D associated in donors with T1D.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, we have added this citation to our discussion of the importance of duration of stay in the ICU (Line 471).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Can you rule out that CD46RA+/CD69+ CD8+ T cells in the islets are not TSCM?</p></disp-quote><p>(See above)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Similar studies in experimental models may afford increased opportunity to evaluate the significance of these findings and model their potential relevance for disease staging and therapeutic targeting.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the lack of experimental data limits the ability to interpret and validate the significance of our findings.
