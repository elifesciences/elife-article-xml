vaccination programmes worldwide. Using an agent-based model, EpiMetHeos, recently calibrated to Indian data, we illustrate how shifting from a girls-only (GO) to a gender-neutral (GN) vaccination strategy could improve the resilience of cervical cancer prevention against disruption of HPV vaccination. In the base case of 5-year disruption with no coverage, shifting from GO to GN strategy under 60% coverage (before disruption) would increase the resilience, in terms of cervical cancer cases still prevented in the disrupted birth cohorts per 100,000 girls born, by 2.8-fold from 107 to 302 cases, and by 2.2-fold from 209 to 464 cases under 90% coverage. Furthermore, shifting to GN vaccination helped in reaching the World Health Organization (WHO) elimination threshold. Under GO vaccination with 60% coverage, the age-standardised incidence rate of cervical cancer in India in the long term with vaccination decreased from 11.0 to 4.7 cases per 100,000 woman-years (above threshold), as compared to 2.8 cases (below threshold) under GN with 60% coverage and 2.4 cases (below threshold) under GN with 90% coverage. In conclusion, GN HPV vaccination is an effective strategy to improve the resilience to disruption of cancer prevention programmes and to enhance the progress towards cervical cancer elimination.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>resilience</kwd><kwd>gender-neutral vaccination</kwd><kwd>human papillomavirus</kwd><kwd>cervical cancer</kwd><kwd>COVID-19 pandemic</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000865</institution-id><institution>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>INV-039876</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baussano</surname><given-names>Iacopo</given-names></name><name><surname>Georges</surname><given-names>Damien</given-names></name><name><surname>Man</surname><given-names>Irene</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Shifting from girls-only to gender-neutral HPV vaccination strategy improves the resilience of cervical cancer prevention and enhances progress towards cervical cancer elimination.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In August 2020, the World Health Assembly adopted the Global Strategy for cervical cancer elimination, with the overarching target of reducing the age-standardised incidence rate (ASIR) of cervical cancer to fewer than 4 cases per 100,000 woman-years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">WHO, 2020a</xref>). To reach this target, the following actions have been recommended: to fully vaccinate 90% of all girls with the HPV vaccine by age 15 years, to screen 70% of women using a high-performance test by the age of 35, and again by the age of 45, and to treat 90% of women with pre-cancer and 90% of women with invasive cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">WHO, 2020b</xref>). However, the delivery of these interventions has been severely disrupted worldwide by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, which was declared a global emergency in the same year by the World Health Organization (WHO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">WHO, 2020a</xref>). More specifically, HPV vaccination worldwide was affected at many different levels: (a) where population-based HPV vaccination programmes were already active, vaccine delivery slowed down or was interrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Muhoza et al., 2021</xref>), (b) the launch of HPV vaccination programmes was delayed in several countries, in particular in resource-limited settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">The Lancet Oncology, 2022</xref>), and (c) the production of HPV vaccines was also limited in favour of manufacturing other vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">WHO, 2022a</xref>).</p><p>Apart from the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in extensive disruption of health-care provision at a global level, health-care systems or public-health programmes at a local level have also regularly suffered severe disruption caused by other factors such as changes in political commitment, financial constraints, scepticism of the civil society, geo-political unrest, and environmental disasters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Colón-López et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gallagher et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Germani et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jawad et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Larson, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McGrath, 2022</xref>). Such circumstances may even lead key public health actors to reconsider their previous commitments. These partial or complete disruptions to organised disease prevention and control programmes may multiply public health crises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sharpless, 2020</xref>), as well as provoke substantial, usually unquantified waste of human, logistic, and financial resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Richards et al., 2020</xref>). Clearly, devising and implementing pre-emptive measures aimed at improving the resilience of public health programmes would help mitigate disruption.</p><p>In a previous study, conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic in a high-income country, we showed that the addition of vaccination in boys to a programme targeting girls only could increase the resilience of the vaccination programme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elfström et al., 2016</xref>). In the present paper, we complement our previous work by assessing the potential effect of switching from girls-only (GO) to gender-neutral (GN) HPV vaccination on resilience and progress towards the elimination of cervical cancer in India, which in turn may help local health authorities in deciding on their vaccination strategy. Currently, India is the country with the largest burden of cervical cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonjour et al., 2021</xref>). Cervical cancer screening is still limitedly accessible in India, with less than 3% ever-in-life coverage in women aged 30–49 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sankaranarayanan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">The Lancet Oncology, 2022</xref>). HPV vaccination (in girls) has been introduced in two Indian states with high vaccination coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sankaranarayanan et al., 2019</xref>). Following the recent marketing authorisation granted to an indigenous vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">The Lancet Oncology, 2022</xref>), the prospect of introducing HPV vaccination into the national immunisation programme has also significantly improved.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To estimate the impact of HPV vaccination on cervical cancer burden, we used the agent-based HPV transmission model, EpiMetHeos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Man et al., 2022</xref>), in combination with the cervical cancer progression model, Atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonjour et al., 2021</xref>). Routine HPV vaccination at age 10 under the GO or GN strategy was modelled with different vaccination coverages in boys and girls from the range between 0% and 100%, at 10% intervals, as we do not yet know what coverage a national HPV immunisation programme in India may reach. Estimates of the life-time number of cervical cancer cases prevented per 100,000 girls born were derived by cohort.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>GN vaccination to improve resilience of cervical cancer prevention</title><p>To consider the impact of scaling up vaccination from such suboptimal coverage in girls, we highlighted the following four scenarios: (A) GO strategy with 60% coverage in girls, (B) GO strategy with 90% coverage in girls, (C) GN strategy with 60% coverage in both girls and boys, (D) GN strategy with 90% coverage in both girls and boys. As the base case, we simulated disruption in vaccination for 5 years, taking place 10 years after the introduction of vaccination. Life-time cervical cancer cases prevented in the birth cohorts vaccinated prior to the disruption period ranged between 562 (UI: 444, 676) and 807 (UI: 752, 853) cases per 100,000 girls born in the four highlighted scenarios. The highest impact was achieved by the GN strategy with 90% coverage, closely followed by GO with 90% coverage, then GN with 60% coverage, and then GO with 60% coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Resilience against HPV vaccination disruption in the base case.</title><p>Predicted resilience, defined as life-time number of cervical cancer cases still prevented in the birth cohorts with disruption of vaccination per 100,000 girls born (blue arrow), and drop in cervical cancers prevented as compared to impact in the cohorts vaccinated prior to the disruption (black arrow), under the four highlighted scenarios. Disruption was simulated according to the base case with a period of disruption of 5 years and 0% coverage in girls and boys during the disruption period.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-85735-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Among the four highlighted scenarios, the GO strategy with 60% coverage also had the lowest resilience, which we defined as the mean number of cases still prevented across the birth cohorts with disruption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We found that the life-time number of cervical cancer cases prevented would drop considerably from 562 (UI: 444, 676) cases in the undisrupted cohorts to 107 (UI: 7, 214) cases per 100,000 girls born in the disrupted cohorts (i.e., resilience of 107). Increasing the coverage under the GO strategy from 60% to 90% would lead to a small absolute gain in resilience, from 107 (UI: 7, 214) to 209 (UI: 81, 340) cases prevented per 100,000 girls born, and this despite the larger increase in impact in the undisrupted cohorts vaccinated prior to the disruption from 562 (UI: 444, 676) to 773 (UI: 701, 836) cases prevented. By contrast, switching from GO to GN vaccination, under 60% coverage, led to a moderate gain of impact in the undisrupted cohorts from 562 (UI: 444, 676) to 647 (UI: 539, 746) cases prevented, but a substantial increase in resilience from 107 (UI: 7, 214) to 302 (UI: 170, 437) cases prevented per 100,000 girls born. Finally, GN vaccination with 90% coverage led to the highest impact of 807 (UI: 752, 853) cases prevented per 100,000 girls born in the undisrupted cohorts as well as the highest resilience of 464 (UI: 328, 602) cases prevented per 100,000 girls born in the disrupted cohorts.</p><p>Considering the required number of vaccine doses, we found a trade-off between dose-efficiency and resilience. In general, GO vaccination favoured dose-efficiency and GN vaccination favoured resilience (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). For instance, increasing GO coverage from 60% to 90% would lead to a higher impact in undisrupted cohorts, while needing less additional vaccine doses than switching from GO to GN vaccination under 60% coverage. However, this switch from GO to GN vaccination would yield a higher gain in resilience than when increasing GO coverage from 60% to 90% (2.8-fold versus 2-fold increase). Similarly, switching from GO to GN vaccination under 90% coverage would require an additional doubling of the number of doses and only marginally improve the impact in the undisrupted cohorts, but would produce a 2.2-fold gain in resilience.</p><p>The same trade-off between dose-efficiency and resilience was found when stratifying by Indian state. Interestingly, in the states with high cervical cancer incidence, we found slightly lower resilience under the GO strategy and a slightly greater relative gain in resilience when switching from GO to GN vaccination than in states with low incidence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig1">Appendix 2—figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig3">3</xref>). In the base case, for example, the resilience ratio for switching from GO to GN strategy (under 60% coverage) was 3-fold in states with high cervical cancer incidence and 2.7-fold in states with low cervical cancer incidence.</p><p>Sensitivity analyses on less strong disruption in vaccination coverage or alternative durations of disruption also yielded higher resilience with GN than GO vaccination (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig2">Appendix 2—figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig3">3</xref>). The gain in resilience by switching from GO to GN vaccination was most evident under complete disruption of vaccination (i.e., 0% coverage at disruption) but still consistently found under less strong disruption (i.e., 20% or 40% coverage at disruption) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> part II, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig2">Appendix 2—figure 2</xref>). As expected, resilience decreased with longer duration of disruption, with any vaccination strategy, but was always higher with the GN strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The gain in resilience by switching from GO to GN vaccination was consistently above 2.7-fold under 60% coverage and above 2.0-fold under 90% coverage (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> part III). Finally, in the scenario with no restart of vaccination, GN vaccination could ensure some resilience of at least 125 cases prevented per 100,000 girls born for eight birth cohorts from the start of disruption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Resilience against HPV vaccination disruption in sensitivity analyses on duration of disruption.</title><p>Predicted life-time cervical cancer cases prevented by birth cohorts (per 100,000 girls born) under different durations of disruption (panel) and in the four highlighted scenarios: girls-only strategy with 60% coverage (light red), girls-only strategy with 90% coverage (dark red), gender-neutral strategy with 60% coverage (light blue), and gender-neutral strategy with 90% coverage (dark blue).

Introducing GO vaccination with 60% coverage would have the lowest impact, reducing the nationwide ASIR of cervical cancer from 11 cases, which is the present level before the introduction of vaccination, to 4.7 (UI: 4.3, 5.1) cases per 100,000 woman-years in 100 years, but this remained above the WHO elimination threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The other highlighted scenarios enabled elimination to be reached within 55–62 years. Introducing GN vaccination with 60% coverage in both girls and boys would reduce incidence down to 2.8 (UI: 2.5, 3.2) cases per 100,000 woman-years, hence below the elimination threshold. The GO strategy with 90% coverage, as recommended by WHO, would also decrease incidence below the threshold to 2.4 (UI: 2.3, 2.6) cases per 100,000 woman-years. Lastly, given the already high vaccination coverage of 90% in girls, switching to the GN strategy would only marginally reduce incidence to 2.3 (UI: 2.2, 2.3) cases per 100,000 woman-years.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Progress towards cervical cancer elimination over time.</title><p>Predicted cervical cancer age-standardised incidence (in cases per 100,000 woman-years) in the years since start of vaccination in India under no vaccination and in the four highlighted scenarios.

With vaccination in boys, a lower critical coverage in girls might be sufficient for elimination. For instance, coverage between 50% and 70% in girls might also be sufficient for elimination when combined with moderate coverage (30%) in boys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Attainment of cervical cancer elimination in the long term.</title><p>Heatmap of the predicted cervical cancer age-standardised incidence rate (in cases per 100,000 woman-years) in the long term (i.e., at 100 years after the start of vaccination) in India by vaccination coverage in girls and boys (under no disruption of vaccination).

The repercussions of disruption of health-care systems may subsequently translate into increased morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sharpless, 2020</xref>), and economic burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Richards et al., 2020</xref>), at a population level. In the present paper, using India as an example, we illustrate how the introduction of GN HPV vaccination could mitigate the negative impact of a sudden HPV vaccine delivery disruption. More specifically, using a validated agent-based model, calibrated to context-specific data, we have simulated a range of plausible scenarios of disruption of a national HPV vaccination programme and assessed the gain in resilience by shifting from GO to GN vaccination in terms of the number of cervical cancer cases still prevented in the birth cohort with vaccination disruption.</p><p>Our model-based exercise showed that in the case of HPV vaccination disruption for 5 years (base case), resilience increased by 2.8-fold (from 107 to 302 cases per 100,000 girls born) and 2.2-fold (from 209 to 464 cases per 100,000 girls born) when shifting from GO to GN vaccination under 60% and 90% coverage, respectively. GN vaccination was shown to improve resilience irrespective of the duration of disruption. However, the absolute magnitude of resilience and of resilience gain resulting from adding boys to routine vaccination of girls steadily decreased with increasing duration of disruption, under all the vaccination strategies assessed, indicating that measures to restore HPV vaccination should be implemented as soon as feasible.</p><p>An important determinant underlying the gain in resilience by switching from GO to GN vaccination is likely the age difference between sexual partners. In general, men are on average older than women within sexual partnerships almost everywhere worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wellings et al., 2006</xref>). In cases of vaccination disruption, the birth cohorts of boys vaccinated before the disruption would indirectly protect the cohorts of younger girls who missed out on vaccination during the disruption period. Since sexual behaviour is regulated by population-specific social norms, the magnitude of the resilience attributable to GN HPV vaccination is also expected to be different across populations. In India, for example, the age difference between male and female partners is on average 7 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">USAID, 2017</xref>), similar to the number of birth cohorts still retaining some protection by GN vaccination when we simulated no restart of vaccination after disruption. As shown by our results, increasing coverage in girls also helps to increase resilience. However, vaccinating boys is a more direct way to reduce the force of infection in men than vaccinating girls, which is the likely mechanism underlying the higher resilience achieved by GN strategy than GO strategy.</p><p>In the present paper, we have also illustrated how the introduction of GN vaccination across India would enhance progress towards the elimination of cervical cancer. In principle, elimination across India could be reached with a critical level of GO coverage of 70%, which falls between the average coverage observed among girls aged 9–15 years living in countries with an active HPV vaccination programme, that is, 53% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bruni et al., 2021</xref>), and the coverage recommended by the WHO, that is, 90% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">WHO, 2020b</xref>). On the other hand, our model-based estimates suggest that cervical cancer elimination could be reached with 50–70% coverage in girls when combined with moderate coverage in boys, even if coverage in boys were lower than that of girls. In cases where GO coverage is already above 70%, GN vaccination would allow even more ambitious cervical cancer control targets to be reached, which might eventually make cervical screening targeted to vaccinated birth cohorts redundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tota et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Man et al., 2022</xref>), reaching elimination might be challenging in the Indian states with the highest baseline cervical cancer incidence before vaccination. In these cases, additional measures such as GN vaccination would be even more relevant.</p><p>The availability and limitations of data on sexual behaviour and cervical cancer incidence across Indian states were discussed in detail in our previous publication in which we presented the calibrated model for the first time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Man et al., 2022</xref>). A limitation of this study is that the critical levels of HPV vaccination coverage found for India are not necessarily generalisable to other populations. Baseline cervical cancer incidence and the magnitude of herd effect, that is, the indirect protection offered by the vaccinated to the unvaccinated individuals of a population against HPV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Malagón et al., 2018</xref>) should be considered. These are, in turn, governed by local sexual behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bosch et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schulte-Frohlinde et al., 2022</xref>). As mentioned above for resilience, the critical level of vaccination coverage to reach cervical cancer elimination will be context-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baussano et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lehtinen et al., 2022</xref>). Extrapolation of the results of this study to other populations will be limited to those sharing similar patterns of demography, social norms, and cervical cancer epidemiology as India. Nevertheless, we expect the principle of improving the resilience of cervical cancer prevention through a shift to GN vaccination to be widely applicable, and this is supported by the consistency of our results in India when stratifying by state-specific cervical cancer incidence.</p><p>Another limitation is the finite number of scenarios considered in which disruption of a health system might occur. For example, we did not explore changes in sexual behaviour in the population due to disruption, which occurs in dire circumstances like a pandemic. However, we did account for a large variation in the duration of disruption and in vaccination coverage at disruption through our sensitivity analyses. In addition, we did not consider the influence of choice of HPV vaccine, as a quadrivalent vaccine (either indigenously produced or Gardasil) would be the likely choice for India due to the price advantage. In cases of using a nonavalent vaccine, or a vaccine with higher levels of cross-protection, we expect similar qualitative results for resilience, and elimination of cervical cancer could be expected to be more easily achieved. We also did not consider changes in cervical cancer screening, as it is difficult to predict how much coverage of cervical cancer screening will increase in India in the coming years.</p><p>Although a formal health-economic assessment of the introduction of GN HPV vaccination in India is beyond the scope of this paper, clearly adding vaccination of boys to the routine coverage of girls would approximately double the required number of vaccine doses and would increase the financial effort to be made by the national government. It has been demonstrated that GN HPV vaccination schedules are economically attractive in high-income tender-based settings, in particular where GO vaccine uptake is below 80% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Qendri et al., 2020</xref>). GN vaccination is likely to be even more attractive in India where population-based screening programmes have not yet been widely implemented. Of course, the actual determinants of a trade-off between redundancy and efficiency of resource allocation depends on context-specific planning and assessment. In our example, to achieve greater resilience, GN vaccination with 60% coverage would require more doses of vaccine while leading to fewer prevented cases of cervical cancer in vaccinated cohorts without interruption than GO vaccination with 90% coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). However, extending vaccination to boys could be easier to put in place than improving coverage in girls from 60% to 90% in some contexts. Finally, shifting from a two-dose to a single-dose HPV vaccination schedule could also improve the affordability of GN vaccination. More research is needed to investigate the cost-effectiveness and affordability of GN vaccination in low-resource settings and how resilience should be accounted for in deciding the vaccination strategy.</p><p>Having clearly illustrated the merits of GN vaccination considering different aspects across different settings here and in earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chow et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elfström et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lehtinen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lehtinen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Qendri et al., 2020</xref>), the next step is to establish a feasible pathway for implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Sanjose and Bruni, 2020</xref>). In high-income countries, where affordability was less of an issue, most vaccination programmes were initiated with the GO strategy, often combined with catch-up in girls/women, and are now increasingly shifting towards GN vaccination. In resource-limited settings, once routine vaccination in girls has been implemented, countries may need to make a choice between boys’ vaccination or female catch-up vaccination. The limited global vaccine supply will likely remain an important factor influencing this decision-making process in the coming years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">WHO, 2022b</xref>). In addition, the choice at the country level should also account for the health-economic objectives, the type of health infrastructure already in place as well as socio-cultural context. In some contexts, important arguments for choosing GN strategy could be the fact that it helps to overcome the stigma associated with a vaccine that targets only girls and aims to prevent a sexually transmitted disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cernasev et al., 2023</xref>), and the direct health benefits in men who have sex with men.</p><p>In conclusion, within the limitations of our model, the model-based estimates show that shifting from GO to GN vaccination may improve the resilience of the Indian HPV vaccination programme while also enhancing progress towards the elimination of cervical cancer. Our resilience estimates go beyond health-care disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, any societal events undermining the routine activities of a health-care system can produce a comparable effect. Over the years, disease prevention programmes have been disrupted by the occurrence of pandemics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Osterholm, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">WHO, 2021</xref>), armed conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jawad et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McGrath, 2022</xref>), economic sanctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Germani et al., 2022</xref>), or widespread vaccine hesitancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Larson, 2020</xref>). Therefore, we argue that such societal crises, which are unpredictable but expected to occur, should be anticipated through careful planning of disease prevention programmes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Model</title><p>EpiMetHeos was used to simulate a dynamic sexual contact network, which allows long-term and overlapping partnerships, through which HPV infections were transmitted.

Since the high-quality data on HPV prevalence and cervical cancer incidence data needed to calibrate the models to each Indian state were not available, we used a Footprinting framework to approximate the missing data and extrapolate the impact by state. In short, we first identified clusters of states with similar patterns of cervical cancer incidence. We then calibrated EpiMetHeos to the state of Tamil Nadu to represent the states in the high cancer incidence cluster, and the state of West Bengal to represent the states in the low cancer incidence cluster, using the available sexual behaviour and HPV prevalence data of these two states. Finally, we estimated the impacts for Tamil Nadu and West Bengal and extrapolated these to other states within each cluster. The model was calibrated for previous publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Man et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Man et al., 2023</xref>).

While it is still uncertain which HPV vaccine will be used in the Indian immunisation programme, we simulated vaccination with a quadrivalent vaccine targeting two high-risk types, HPV16 and HPV18 (and two low-risk types, HPV6 and HPV11). The efficacy estimates of the locally produced HPV vaccine were not available to us; hence, we based our model assumptions on the efficacy estimates of the IARC India vaccine trial, which considered Gardasil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Joshi et al., 2023</xref>). In this trial, no difference was found between the efficacy estimates of the single-dose and two-dose schedules, which were moreover stable after up to 10 years’ follow-up. Hence, we based the model on pooled efficacy estimates (95% efficacy for HPV16 and HPV18, 9% cross-protection for HPV 31, HPV33, and HPV45, and 0% efficacy for the remaining high-risk HPV types) and assumed no waning of vaccine immunity over time. In doing so, the modelled efficacy could represent vaccination under either a single-dose or two-dose schedule. Vaccine protection was modelled through an all-or-nothing working mechanism, that is, if the efficacy is X%, then X% of the vaccinated individuals in the model are fully protected and 100-X% fully not protected.</p><p>To assess the resilience of different vaccination strategies on cervical cancer prevention, we simulated the above scenarios first without disruption of the HPV vaccination programme, and then with disruption occurring 10 years after the start of vaccination. As the base case, we simulated a disruption period of 5 years with total interruption of HPV vaccine delivery, that is, 0% vaccination coverage in both boys and girls. As sensitivity analyses, we considered less severe disruption with still 20% and 40% vaccination coverage in girls (but still 0% in boys), as well as shorter or longer durations of disruption of 1, 2, and 10 years, and no restart of vaccination. These sensitivity analyses were considered to represent different types of disruption attributable to a COVID-19 pandemic or to any other interference of the HPV vaccination programme.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Model outcomes</title><p>Estimates of the life-time number of cervical cancer cases prevented per 100,000 girls born were derived by cohort. The first 40 birth cohorts following the introduction of vaccination were considered to have estimates for both cohorts before and after the disruption period. The mean number of cases prevented across the first 10 vaccinated birth cohorts was used to evaluate the impact prior to the disruption. As a measure of resilience, we used the mean number of cases still prevented, as a result of previous HPV vaccination, across the birth cohorts with disruption. Considering such a metric of resilience allows us to evaluate whether any given strategy provides a sufficient level of protection retained during disruption as compared to a possible prefixed target level of protection.

An STERGM is characterised by formation and dissolution probabilities of partnerships.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Diane Harper as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Romina Tejada (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>– Provide more context on HPV vaccination programs and screening in India.</p><p>– Reviewers questioned the calculation methods used for resilience ratios. Consider providing more rationale for these ratios and/or using other metrics for measuring resilience.</p><p>– Address requests for clarifications made by reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I found the manuscript well-written and easy to read. Nevertheless, I have some questions:</p><p>– Why did the authors use an agent-based model? Stochastic models (individual-based models) are mostly used for studying outbreaks and not in cases of disseminated diseases such as HPV. Do the authors consider that using a deterministic model could have provided different results?</p><p>– The authors mention in the Appendix that they considered an &quot;all-or-nothing working mechanism for vaccine protection&quot; for those HPV types included in the vaccine as well as for cross-protection. This should be added to the main article as it would be important for decision-makers who might not read the Appendix.</p><p>– Why did the authors consider that men did not develop natural immunity?</p><p>– Results, Pag 11 lines 152-153 &quot;Among the four highlighted scenarios, the GO strategy with 60% coverage was also the least resilient&quot;. It would be better to start with the most resilient scenario.</p><p>– Presenting the prevented cases in the disrupted cohort (resilience) as a percentage of the cases prevented in the undisrupted scenarios would be more informative for the reader when comparing the four scenarios.</p><p>– The resilience ratios were constructed with the absolute number of cases prevented; they should have been constructed with the relative number of cases prevented because the values changed greatly between scenarios for the undisrupted cohorts. For example, the resilience ratio for GO 60% to GN 60% in the base case analysis for all states reported by the authors was 2.8 when using absolute numbers but it would be 2.4 when using relative numbers.</p><p>– Figure B2: The description says &quot;with (A) high and (B) low cervical cancer incidence&quot; but the figures are (A) all case (B) high incidence and (C) low incidence.

Please describe the current status of HPV vaccination in India in the introduction, including when foreign HPV vaccines were available on the market in India, whether a routine HPV vaccination program has been / will be implemented in India (and when if yes), the current (estimated) HPV vaccine uptake, although I may miss the corresponding text.</p><p>2. Used an agent-based model (EpiMetHeos) to simulate the dynamic transmission of HPV infection of high-risk HPV types and a cervical cancer progression model (Altas) to estimate the impact on cervical cancer burden. The authors are suggested to include the advantage (and limitations) or the difference of using the agent-based model when compared with other models.</p><p>3. Model validity.</p><p>a. Please show the uncertainties (e.g., confidence interval) of the model calibration/fitting.</p><p>b. Please explicitly state the table(s)/figure(s) that contain(s) the values and assumptions used in the model/study in the manuscript, especially when referring to table(s)/figure(s) in the supplementary materials.</p><p>c. Percentile intervals (10% to 90%) were presented based on the simulations using the 100 parameter sets best fitting the sexual behaviour and HPV prevalence data obtained through calibration. Please state the criteria that were used to determine the &quot;best fitting&quot; (e.g., minimal difference, log-likelihood, or other metrics)</p><p>4. Vaccine characteristics</p><p>a. The study considered a locally developed quadrivalent HPV vaccine by referring the vaccine efficacy to Gardasil quadrivalent. The authors are advised to present the numerical values of the efficacy of the locally developed HPV vaccine explicitly in addition to claiming the similarity (although a reference was cited).</p><p>b. A sensitivity analysis on the below items may be useful when addressing the uncertainties of the assumption.</p><p>(i). shorter vaccine-induced protection, in addition to assuming no waning of protection over time.</p><p>(ii). vaccine efficacy, perhaps at the lower bound of the reported estimated efficacy, in addition to the point estimates.</p><p>c. Please discuss the latest estimate of vaccine uptake in India among girls and preferably among boys. That would be the comparator when evaluating the impact of a vaccination program. Please also provide the rationale/information for the four &quot;highlighted&quot; scenarios on vaccination coverage (lines 113-115).</p><p>d. Please state the year that the vaccination program would start in the model simulation.</p><p>5. Screening uptake in India</p><p>&quot;Given the extremely low coverage of the existing screening programme in India, we have not considered the impact of screening in our study (Bruni et al., 2022)&quot; (lines 142-143)</p><p>Please state the screening coverage explicitly.</p><p>6. Results</p><p>For each scenario, the authors are advised to include the relative changes in the number of cervical cancer cases eliminated with and without disruption.</p><p>7. There are likely some potential typos and grammar issues.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall</p><p>1. This study will benefit from a better selection of realistic vaccine trade-offs in moving from the base strategy (i.e GO 60%) to alternate strategies. This 'trade-off' is briefly mentioned in Lines 166-168: &quot;Considering the required number of vaccine doses, we found a trade-off between dose-efficiency and resilience. In general, GO vaccination favoured dose efficiency and GN vaccination favoured resilience (Figure 1).&quot; However, the trade-off is not easily interpreted when the alternate strategies use a different quantity of vaccines (as seen in Figure 1). If the alternate strategies used a similar quantity of vaccines, then the results of the study would be better understood by decision-makers/readers regarding the potential implications of various vaccination strategies with limited vaccine supplies.</p><p>2. The study will benefit from a lengthier discussion on the mechanisms through which gender-neutral vaccination can increase the HPV vaccine programme 'resilience' in preventing cervical cancer:</p><p>a) The mechanisms through which a gain in 'resilience' is achieved in moving to a GN strategy have been indirectly described in previous publications. During a period of vaccine disruption, my interpretation of the reason cervical cancer incidence increases is due to the reduction in vaccine coverage amongst all girls over time – and it has been shown in previous modelling studies that a gender-neutral vaccination programme is more beneficial when coverage amongst girls is lower. Therefore are the findings of this study a manifestation of this mechanism? – this would be worth discussing.</p><p>b) The authors describe the primary factor influencing resilience in Lines 241-243: &quot;The main determinant underlying the gain in resilience by switching from GO to GN vaccination is the age difference between sexual partners, with men being on average older than women within sexual partnerships almost everywhere worldwide (Wellings et al., 2006).&quot; However, it is not clear from the results of this paper why this is described as the 'main determinant'. Possibly providing evidence through sensitivity analyses to show how changes in age difference between sexual partners change the resilience of GN strategies may help prove the point to readers that this is the main determinant.</p><p>Methodology</p><p>3. The outcome of 'resilience' is calculated as the [in lines 128-131]: &quot;mean number of cases still prevented across the birth cohorts with disruption, as a result of previous HPV vaccination,…, which was compared to the mean number of cases prevented across the birth cohorts before the disruption.&quot; I had a few concerns about this outcome measure:</p><p>a) My initial impression of the use of the term 'resilience' would be the ability of the vaccine programme to retain its population protective effect in times of disruption. Therefore the use of the 'ratio of the mean number of cases prevented' did not reflect resilience to me. Instead, I felt the description of the definition of 'resilience' in your Elfstrom et al. 2016 paper [referenced in lines 66-67] is clearer to readers as a measure of resilience: &quot;the difference in percentage attributable to vaccination estimated with and without temporary coverage reduction&quot;. Would the team be able to reconcile whether the definitions/formulas used in this study and Elfstrom et al.'s 2016 paper are identical?</p><p>b) The calculation of the 'resilience ratio' in Appendix B1 is not immediately clear to readers, and an example/formula would help readers understand how it is calculated better.</p><p>c) The comparison of resilience ratios (seen in Appendix B1) would be better interpreted if the shift from GO 60% to alternative scenarios all involved the same quantity of vaccine supply. For e.g. resilience ratio in a (i) GO 60% to GO 90% scenario being compared with a (ii) GO 60% to Girl-60%/Male-30% scenario [assuming males &amp; females are equal in each cohort, this would mean the same quantity of vaccines]. Such a comparison would be easier to interpret and would help decision-makers understand the benefits &amp; drawbacks of either course of action.</p><p>Results</p><p>4. In lines 211-212 it is mentioned that: &quot;coverage between 50% and 70% in girls might also be sufficient for elimination when combined with moderate coverage (30%) in boys.&quot; A table/graph to illustrate this scenario and its associated results would help readers understand the conclusion made here. If the data is presented in the appendix, then a reference to the location of the information in the appendix would be helpful.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>5. In lines 141-142 it is mentioned that: &quot;we have not considered the impact of screening in our study&quot;. It might be useful to discuss the implications of this assumption in the discussion, bringing in the foreseeable changes in screening uptake &amp; screening technology in India and other low-income countries.</p><p>6. The discussion would benefit from challenging the assumptions made in the model. Such as the assumptions that:</p><p>a) The total population in the model is kept constant over time</p><p>b) Only modelling heterosexual partnerships – this would not account for the fact that vaccinating 10-year-old boys who become predominantly men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM) when sexually active, would likely have minimal to no impact on reducing cervical cancer incidence.</p><p>c) Sexual behaviours remain unchanged throughout the person's lifespan.</p><p>d) Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model used in men, which does have a period of immunity incorporated.</p><p>e) Having limited data on sexual behaviours and cervical cancer incidence in other Indian states.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85735.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>– Provide more context on HPV vaccination programs and screening in India.</p></disp-quote><p>India has not yet introduced HPV vaccination into the national immunization programme.

Furthermore, considering this absolute metric would allow the evaluation of strategies in terms of whether it provides a minimum level of protection during disruption period.</p><p>To clarify why we have chosen the absolute metric, we have revised the manuscript as follows (page 22 lines 420-424): “As a measure of resilience, we used the mean number of cases still prevented, as a result of previous HPV vaccination, across the birth cohorts with disruption. Considering such a metric of resilience allows us to evaluate whether any given strategy provides a sufficient level of protection retained during disruption as compared to a possible prefixed target level of protection.”</p><p>Nevertheless, we agree with the reviewers that a relative metric of resilience, e.g., the proportion of cervical cancer cases still prevented as compared to the number of cases prevented before/without the disruption, could also be interesting. It provides an idea of how efficient the resource invested before disruption can be retained at disruption. However, in our opinion, it might be less straightforward to compare the “relative resilience” between strategy/scenario; an increase in relative resilience does not necessarily mean more cancer cases prevented during disruption.</p><p>Furthermore, we are unsure whether we should consider efficiency when dealing crises.</p><p>At the end, to avoid using too many different metrics, we chose to consider only the absolute resilience and the ratio thereof. Furthermore, the relative resilience can be easily read off from Figure 1 and calculated from Table 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I found the manuscript well-written and easy to read. Nevertheless, I have some questions:</p><p>– Why did the authors use an agent-based model?

This study will benefit from a better selection of realistic vaccine trade-offs in moving from the base strategy (i.e GO 60%) to alternate strategies. This 'trade-off' is briefly mentioned in Lines 166-168: &quot;Considering the required number of vaccine doses, we found a trade-off between dose-efficiency and resilience. In general, GO vaccination favoured dose efficiency and GN vaccination favoured resilience (Figure 1).&quot; However, the trade-off is not easily interpreted when the alternate strategies use a different quantity of vaccines (as seen in Figure 1). If the alternate strategies used a similar quantity of vaccines, then the results of the study would be better understood by decision-makers/readers regarding the potential implications of various vaccination strategies with limited vaccine supplies.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the efficiency of HPV vaccine dose allocation is a key operational issue and understand that the suggested strategies allow comparison of scenarios in terms of how to best allocate resources. However, we still decided to focus on comparing strategies of girls-only and gender-neutral that do not necessarily correspond to the same amount of vaccine doses. The reason was that while the policymakers have control to decide on the vaccination strategy (either girls-only or gender-neutral), they usually do not have control over the coverage eventually attained in the population. For example, the scenario of girls-only vaccination with 90% coverage requires the same number of vaccines as the scenario of gender-neutral vaccination with 60% in girls and 30% in boys. However, it would not be realistic to stop vaccinating at 30% coverage in boys if more boys would like to be vaccinated. While data on uptake in boys is still scarce, there are indication that uptake in boys could be expected to be similar to that in girls (Wähner et al., 2023, Infection). This was the rationale behind the chosen scenarios. In our opinion, it is enough to demonstrate the trade-off between dose-efficiency and resilience with the part of the Results section mentioned by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The study will benefit from a lengthier discussion on the mechanisms through which gender-neutral vaccination can increase the HPV vaccine programme 'resilience' in preventing cervical cancer:</p><p>a) The mechanisms through which a gain in 'resilience' is achieved in moving to a GN strategy have been indirectly described in previous publications. During a period of vaccine disruption, my interpretation of the reason cervical cancer incidence increases is due to the reduction in vaccine coverage amongst all girls over time – and it has been shown in previous modelling studies that a gender-neutral vaccination programme is more beneficial when coverage amongst girls is lower. Therefore are the findings of this study a manifestation of this mechanism? – this would be worth discussing.</p></disp-quote><p>Resilience in cervical cancer prevention is the herd effect in women unvaccinated due to disruption because the reduced population force of infection from men that have contact with these unvaccinated women. We agree with the reviewer that vaccinating more girls could also decrease the force of infection in men, and so increasing resilience. However, vaccinating boys is a more direct way to reduce the force of infection in men than vaccinating girls. This is likely the mechanism underlying the higher resilience achieved by gender-neutral strategy than girls-only strategy.</p><p>To better explain this mechanism, we have added the following sentences to the Discussion section (page 15 lines 275-278): “As showed by our results, increasing coverage in girls also helps to increase resilience. However, vaccinating men is a more direct way to reduce the force of infection in men than vaccinating girls, which is likely the mechanism underlying the higher resilience achieved by gender-neutral strategy than girls-only strategy.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The authors describe the primary factor influencing resilience in Lines 241-243: &quot;The main determinant underlying the gain in resilience by switching from GO to GN vaccination is the age difference between sexual partners, with men being on average older than women within sexual partnerships almost everywhere worldwide (Wellings et al., 2006).&quot; However, it is not clear from the results of this paper why this is described as the 'main determinant'. Possibly providing evidence through sensitivity analyses to show how changes in age difference between sexual partners change the resilience of GN strategies may help prove the point to readers that this is the main determinant.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that the wording “main determinant” was not appropriate. We have rephrased it as follows: “An important determinant underlying the gain in resilience by switching from GO to GN vaccination is likely the age difference between sexual partners.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Methodology</p><p>3. The outcome of 'resilience' is calculated as the [in lines 128-131]: &quot;mean number of cases still prevented across the birth cohorts with disruption, as a result of previous HPV vaccination,.., which was compared to the mean number of cases prevented across the birth cohorts before the disruption.&quot; I had a few concerns about this outcome measure:</p><p>a) My initial impression of the use of the term 'resilience' would be the ability of the vaccine programme to retain its population protective effect in times of disruption. Therefore the use of the 'ratio of the mean number of cases prevented' did not reflect resilience to me. Instead, I felt the description of the definition of 'resilience' in your Elfstrom et al. 2016 paper [referenced in lines 66-67] is clearer to readers as a measure of resilience: &quot;the difference in percentage attributable to vaccination estimated with and without temporary coverage reduction&quot;. Would the team be able to reconcile whether the definitions/formulas used in this study and Elfstrom et al.'s 2016 paper are identical?</p></disp-quote><p>We think that the definition in this study is in line with the initial impression the reviewer describes as the definition in Elfström et al. What the reviewer refers to as “protective effect retained” is what we refer to as “cervical cancer cases still prevented”, which is what we define as “resilience” in this study.</p><p>The ratio of the number of cervical cases still prevented, or resilience ratio, is then used to evaluate the increase in resilience between scenarios. We have now clarified the definition of the resilience both in the Materials and methods section and in the caption of Table 1 and Appendix 2-Table 1. – Page 22 lines 424-425: “Estimates of resilience were compared between the highlighted scenarios A-D based on their ratio.”</p><p>Page 36 lines 637-639: “[Resilience ratio of scenario X to scenario Y] is defined is [resilience of scenario Y] / [resilience of scenario X]. For example, in the base case, [resilience ratio of GO 60% to GO 90%] = [resilience of GO 90%] / [resilience of GO 60%] = 209 / 107 = 2.0.”</p><p>Finally, what we define as resilience in Elfström et al. corresponds to the “drop in cervical cancer prevented” in Figure 1. In this study, we defined resilience to focus on the protective effect still retained during disruption.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The calculation of the 'resilience ratio' in Appendix B1 is not immediately clear to readers, and an example/formula would help readers understand how it is calculated better.</p></disp-quote><p>The following definition of the resilience ratio is now added to the caption of Table 1 and Appendix 2-Table 1: “[Resilience ratio of scenario X to scenario Y] is defined is [resilience of scenario Y] / [resilience of scenario X].</p><p>For example, in the base case, [resilience ratio of GO 60% to GO 90%] = [resilience of GO 90%] / [resilience of GO 60%] = 209 / 107 = 2.0.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) The comparison of resilience ratios (seen in Appendix B1) would be better interpreted if the shift from GO 60% to alternative scenarios all involved the same quantity of vaccine supply. For e.g. resilience ratio in a (i) GO 60% to GO 90% scenario being compared with a (ii) GO 60% to Girl-60%/Male-30% scenario [assuming males &amp; females are equal in each cohort, this would mean the same quantity of vaccines].

This is because of the likely small proportion of MSM in India (estimated as 3% in the 2006 NACO report of sexual behaviour), and vaccination in 10-year-old boys is expected to result in similar in boys who later become heterosexual or MSM. However, we would be fitting to discuss the direct benefit in MSM for HPV related cancer in men.
