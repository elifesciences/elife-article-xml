There is an intriguing disproportion between the entrenchment of the notion of a ‘cranio-sacral’ pathway, which informs every textbook schematic of the autonomic nervous system since the early XX<sup>th</sup> century, and the wobbliness of its two roots: an anatomical detail overinterpreted by Walter Holbrook Gaskell (the ‘gap’ between the lumbar and sacral outflows), on which John Newport Langley grafted a piece of physiology (a supposed antagonism of these two outflows on external genitals), repeatedly questioned since, to little avail. I retrace the birth of a flawed scientific concept (the cranio-sacral outflow) and the way in which it ossified instead of dissipated. Then, I suggest that the critique of the ‘cranio-sacral outflow’ invites, in turn, a radical deconstruction of the very notion of a ‘parasympathetic’ outflow, and a more realistic description of the autonomic nervous system.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>autonomic nervous system</kwd><kwd>parasympathetic</kwd><kwd>sexual function</kwd><kwd>sympathetic</kwd><kwd>neuron types</kwd><kwd>anatomy</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-19-CE16-0029-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brunet</surname><given-names>Jean-François</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-17-CE16-0006-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brunet</surname><given-names>Jean-François</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FRM-EQU202003010297</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brunet</surname><given-names>Jean-François</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The term 'parasympathetic', unlike the term 'sympathetic', unduly unifies an assemblage of autonomic pathways which are unrelated by anatomy, physiology or genetics, and whose distinction can foster a better understanding of the autonomic nervous system.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction: A question of nomenclature</title><p>Langley devoted several texts to the question of nomenclature. Two of his enduring legacies in this matter are the terms ‘autonomic’ for the entire system of nerves (previously ‘visceral’ or ‘involuntary’); and ‘parasympathetic’ for one of its three divisions (alongside sympathetic and enteric). The first chapter of his 1921 monography (written in 1919) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Langley, 1921</xref>) is entitled “The divisions of the autonomic nervous system. Nomenclature”, and 7 years earlier he had already published a “Nomenclature of the sympathetic and of the related systems of nerves” in which he remarked on the difficulties of such an endeavor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Langley, 1913</xref>):</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>“According as the point of view is anatomical, physiological, or pharmacological the feature selected for connotation may be different. Consequently, the aim of any nomenclature should be to satisfy <bold>as far as possible</bold><sup>1; see ‘Notes’</sup> these several points of view.”</p></list-item></list><p>But all things considered, including a proposal by Heubner<sup>2</sup> to create a ‘consensual’ parasympathetic system that would include innervation to the sweat glands, on account of a common mimicry by pilocarpine, Langley insisted on a nomenclature which was “almost purely anatomical” and firmly posited:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>“I think the nomenclature of the nervous systems themselves should be based on anatomical facts.”</p></list-item></list><p>However, anatomy itself, even in its purely morphological, pre-genetic age, was never exempt from interpretation. Besides, Langley never quite stuck to his own anatomical principle and was not above reminding us (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Langley, 1921</xref>, p. 8)</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>“that the sympathetic has, in general, opposite functional effects from those of the other autonomic nerves”</p></list-item></list><p>a notion contested in many details (including by Langley himself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Langley, 1900</xref>, table p. 693] — and see below) but of enduring appeal and still omnipresent in neurology textbooks (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kandel et al., 2012</xref>), despite all the qualifications; and he considered his theory “much strengthened” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Langley, 1921</xref>, p. 8) by “recent pharmacological discoveries”. And indeed, how palatable could be an anatomy which would deploy itself at odds with physiology? The stage was thus set, despite Langley’s anatomical credo, for a multiplicity of definitional criteria (anatomical, neurochemical, physiological). As it happens, they never quite fit with each other. I retrace below these fateful ambiguities concerning the ‘cranio-sacral parasympathetic’, throughout the texts of Gaskell and Langley. Lastly, I provide reasons why the field of autonomic neuroscience could benefit from foregoing the parasympathetic concept altogether.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Gaskell’s anatomy</title><p>The first and possibly most decisive act in the creation of a cranio-sacral parasympathetic system, is anatomic indeed, like Langley wanted, and actually belongs to Gaskell and his histological analysis of the course of the “connector nerves” (which we now call, after Langley, preganglionic<sup>3</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gaskell, 1886</xref>). Gaskell followed these projections out of the central nervous system into the spinal nerves, as “fine medullated [myelinated]<sup>4</sup> fibers” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). He thus called them <italic>white rami viscerales</italic> and noticed that they exited the spinal cord at thoracic and lumbar levels, but not immediately rostral or caudal. Rostrally, beyond a gap that corresponds (in part) to the cervical plexus, they resumed in the vagal nerve; caudally, beyond the lumbar plexus, they resumed in the pelvic nerve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Gaskell does not say, except, in a rather circular way, that it avoids confusing them. The circularity is broken only by the fleeting mention that the thoracolumbar is “sympathetic” and, by inference, the pelvic is not. Why not? Because we are no longer in 1886, and it is now 15 years since Langley (to whom allegiance is explicitly made) has consolidated the cranio-sacral outflow, based however not on anatomy, but on physiology (as we shall see later).</p><p>Now that the ‘pelvic splanchnic’ is no longer splanchnic, and that any common feature is thus erased between the thoracolumbar and sacral outflows, the original [a/a-b/a] scheme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) becomes more like [a/a-b/c] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The last trick to arrive at the final [c/a-b/c] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) is to equate cranial to sacral — and so did Gaskell, following Langley’s reasoning, that we shall examine later. However, there is a serious obstacle to this, and it is anatomical: the cranial and sacral preganglionic nerves spring from different kinds of roots: ventral for the sacral (as they are for the thoracolumbar), dorsolateral for the cranial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). But this smoking gun of the discordance between the cranial and sacral outflows, that Gaskell precisely describes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gaskell, 1886</xref>, p. 10), was lost to him, for two reasons.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Categorization of autonomic nerves according to Gaskell and Langley (<bold>A</bold>), and according to genetically-defined cell types (<bold>B</bold>).</title><p>In (<bold>A</bold>) the vagus nerve and the sacral splanchnic are put in the same category (parasympathetic, green) despite their projections in different types of roots: dorso-ateral (and dedicated) for the vagus, ventral (and shared with somatic motor axons, black), for the sacral, as is the case at thoracolumbar level.

This confusion de facto dissociated types of roots from types of nerves (the same <italic>rami viscerales</italic> travelling, according to him, in both ventral and dorsal roots), and comforted him in thinking that</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>“the exits of the different nerves from the central nervous system [are less bound up] with the true morphological meaning of the segmental arrangement of nerves [than] the arrangement of the groups of nerve cells in the central nervous system” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gaskell, 1889</xref>, p. 153)</p></list-item></list><p>This “arrangement of the group of nerve cells” alludes to the analysis of the central nervous system in terms of longitudinal columns, that Gaskell more or less inaugurated, for better and worse. It led to the flawed notion of a continuous craniospinal visceromotor column, made plausible by the fact that both spinal and cranial preganglionic neurons are positioned (i.e. settle after a migration) dorsal to somatic motoneurons: the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus or the nucleus ambiguus can be vaguely likened, in that respect, to the intermediolateral column of the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fritzsch et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Different embryonic origins but similar migration pathways of preganglionic neurons at spinal and hindbrain levels.</title><p>At spinal levels (<bold>A, A’</bold>) — including sacral ones— preganglionic neurons (red) arise embryonically (<bold>A</bold>) from the same progenitor domain (pMN) as somatic motoneurons (black), with which they share an extensive transcriptional signature, but segregate from them to settle dorsally.

At hindbrain levels (<bold>B, B’</bold>), pre-ganglionic neurons (green) arise (<bold>B</bold>) in a progenitor domain (pMNv) different from that of somatic motoneurons (pMN), and have consequently different transcriptional signatures. However, they also migrate dorsally (<bold>B</bold>) to form (<bold>B’</bold>) preganglionic nuclei, such as the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve.

Scale bars: 1 mm.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-104826-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Second, and more generally, Gaskell was determined to find serial homologies between cranial and spinal nerves<sup>9</sup> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fritzsch et al., 2017</xref> for a more detailed account). The conceptual cost was high: it involved four components for both spinal and cervical nerves that projected in three roots in the cranial nerves, but only two in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gaskell, 1889</xref>, p. 65:)<sup>10</sup>. Irrespective of the details, this “conception” certainly helped make “immediately vanish” “the difficulties that the homologies of the cranial with the spinal nerves had to contend with” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gaskell, 1889</xref>, p. 65)! As C. Judson Herrick later remarked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Herrick, 1918</xref>, p. 158) “the knowledge of the composition of the cranial nerves was long retarded by persistent attempts to analyze them in accordance with the analogy of a supposed simple spinal pattern”. Ironically, Herrick’s own classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Herrick, 1918</xref>, p. 159–162), although duly complexified by components that were “special” to the cranial nerves, was still marred by the homogenization of spinal and cranial preganglionics, directly inherited from Gaskell. At the end of the XX<sup>th</sup> century, Nieuwenhuys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nieuwenhuys et al., 1998</xref>, vol.I, p. 196) still hailed the “important contribution to the clarification of the brain stem afforded by Gaskell” and chronicled the “great impact of his ideas on a number of American neuroanatomists” (Osborn, Herrick, Strong, Johnston, etc.). Indeed, consequences of this largely misguided endeavor are still with us today, and the sacral parasympathetic is one of them<sup>11</sup>.</p><p>The enterprise was possibly enabled by the vertebral theory of the cranium, invented by the German Naturphilosophen of the late XVIII<sup>th</sup> century and still alive during Gaskell’s youth, in his own country, under the influence of Richard Owen<sup>12</sup>: if the skeleton of vertebrates was a succession of fundamentally — if sometimes cryptically — similar segments, from tail to head, the hindbrain could be a seamless continuation of the spinal cord, making a cranio-sacral parallel conceivable<sup>13</sup>.</p><p>Yet, the distinct types of roots predictably reflect distinct types of neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>): the sacral preganglionics form an 'intermediolateral column', indistinguishable from the thoracolumbar one, from which it is only separated by the swelling of the lumbar motoneuronal pool, and incompletely so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Verlinden et al., 2024</xref>). Conversely, the cranial preganglionics reside in several cell groups of the hindbrain (nucleus ambiguus, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve, salivatory nuclei), quite distinct from the intermediolateral column whose rostral limit lies caudally far away, at the border of the thoracic and cervical cords. A century later we know that, unsurprisingly, the anatomic similarity between the sacral and thoracolumbar intermediolateral columns, and their difference with the cranial preganglionic nuclei, reflect their respective embryonic origins and genetic make-ups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alkaslasi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blum et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Espinosa-Medina et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, concerning preganglionic autonomic nerves, there is nothing 'cranio-sacral'. And, logically, there is nothing cranio-sacral concerning the ganglionic relays either (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sivori et al., 2023</xref>), but this aspect was never central for Gaskell.</p><p>In summary, in terms of anatomy, the cranio-sacral parallel is predicated on two mistakes (which, for good measure, were contradictory with each other): the homogenization, against all odds, of the entire cranio-spinal visceral outflow; and the dismissal, for no reason, of the kinship between the thoracolumbar and sacral splanchnics. One can speculate that, without the resulting symmetry in the arrangement of preganglionic nerves, and the esthetic appeal of two similar outflows, cranial and sacral, framing at a distance a thoracolumbar one, there would have never been a ‘sacral parasympathetic’.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Functional antagonism</title><p>The second and definitive act in the creation of the cranio-sacral parasympathetic is Langley’s 1899 <italic>Address to the British Association for the Advancement of Science, Physiological section</italic> at Dover, September 15, 1899 (published in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Langley, 1899a</xref>). He calls the sacral and cranial systems “one system”, different from the “sympathetic”, based on a physiological argument. (He has yet to invent the term ‘parasympathetic’ which he will do 6 years later, in the unceremonious form of a footnote: “I use the word para-sympathetic for the cranial and sacral autonomic systems” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Langley, 1905</xref>, p. 403]).</p><p>As a physiologist, the memory of Langley has now largely eclipsed that of Gaskell, but it was not always so.

He accused Gaskell (who could no longer answer) of having surreptitiously erased all kinds of confusions from his 1886 paper and replaced them with Langley’s own clarifications, blurring the transition by a treatment that was “not historical”. Among other things, Langley claims credit for “essentially” modifying the “conception of the visceral system as a single system”:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>“It is now held that the bulbar part of the “cranial outflow” and the “sacral outflow” <bold>form one system for the gut and its appendages</bold> (my oro-anal system) and that it is essentially different […] from the sympathetic.”<sup>15</sup></p></list-item></list><p>But here, it seems that it is Langley who fails to give proper credit to Gaskell. If Gaskell’s 1886 anatomy was erroneous on many points (particularly the nature of various ganglia), and tentative about a cranio-sacral parallel, some of his physiological remarks prefigure Langley’s views. In particular, Gaskell explicitly likens the <italic>nervus erigens</italic> to the vagus, both “vasoinhibitory nerves <italic>par excellence</italic>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gaskell, 1886</xref>, p. 28), and describes the origins of the vasomotor and vasoinhibitory nerves as mutually exclusive: respectively thoracolumbar and cranio-sacral (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The visceral nerves of a dog as they appear in figure V, plate III, from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gaskell, 1886</xref> (enhanced for clarity).</title><p>‘Vaso-inhibitory nerves’ are represented in red and are found at cranial and sacral levels.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-104826-fig4-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Langley was possibly justified in ignoring Gaskell’s physiological argument on account that it got muddled in <italic>The involuntary nervous system</italic> (in the meantime, Gaskell had found vasoinhibitory nerves also at thoracolumbar level, after all), and that Langley’s own crucial vascular argument is more specific, as I explain below.</p><p>In his <italic>Address</italic>, after mentioning the view of “some observers” that the cranio-sacral system is in fact part of a general one, only separated by the “nerve-centers for the arms and the legs”, Langley, in the founding moment of the “sacral parasympathetic”, dissents, based on “one reason” (p. 885): it concerns “certain blood vessels” that receive a double input from the lumbar and sacral levels, with opposing effects. This is an allusion (remarkably cryptic, perhaps for the sake of decency during a public discourse<sup>16</sup>) to his 1895 monography on the blood vessels of the “external generative organs”: the helicine arteries (terminal branches of the cavernous artery) whose dilatation after stimulation of the sacral outflow underlies erection, and constriction after stimulation of the lumbar outflow (as Langley reported) causes detumescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Langley and Anderson, 1895</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). And he concludes that the two outflows are different.

Langley obtained, like Eckhardt had done 30 years earlier, massive vasodilation of the helicine arteries (thus erection) upon stimulation of the pelvic nerve (1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), a “very great contraction” (p. 87) of the same arteries (thus detumescence) when stimulating the lumbar sympathetic trunk or its roots (2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), but also “some degree of contraction” (p. 103) when stimulating the hypogastric nerve — the lumbar “splanchnic nerve” which projects past the paravertebral chain and through the inferior mesenteric plexus, en route to the pelvic ganglion (3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). On this latter point<sup>17</sup>, however, Langley was contradicting previous studies, summarized in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Espinosa-Medina et al., 2018</xref> and that he duly cited and discussed (p. 85–87 and p. 103) — notably by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eckhard, 1876</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">François-Franck, 1895</xref>. Thereafter, he was himself repeatedly contradicted: by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Root and Bard, 1947</xref> using lesion experiments, and, using electrostimulation like Langley himself, by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bacq, 1935</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bessou and Laporte, 1961</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sjöstrand and Klinge, 1979</xref>, who all found a proerectile pathway in the hypogastric nerve, for which Dail proposed an anatomical substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dail et al., 1986</xref>). In this time span, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Semans and Langworthy, 1938</xref> are pretty much alone in corroborating Langley’s view of an exclusively anti erectile role of the lumbar spinal cord. The current general view (sometimes reticent or buried in the fine print) is that there is indeed a lumbar (thus sympathetic) pro-erectile pathway, traveling in the hypogastric nerve, which is revealed either by its electrical stimulation, or by destruction of the sacral pathway (experimentally in animals, accidentally in humans<sup>18</sup>). The reason why Langley missed it has been attributed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bessou and Laporte, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Root and Bard, 1947</xref>) to the coexistence of dilator and constrictor fibers in the hypogastric nerve, the latter masking the former in some stimulation paradigms. Incidentally, such coexistence might be found also in the first sacral root of the pelvic nerve which, in the hands of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">François-Franck, 1895</xref>, could elicit either dilation or constriction, as noted by Langley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Langley and Anderson, 1895</xref>, p.86). All in all, the erectile function is “well duplicated” between lumbar and sacral levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jänig, 2006</xref>) (p. 357): the antagonism across this anatomic boundary in the spinal cord — the <italic>only</italic> physiological reason that Langley ever gave for placing the sacral outflow in the parasympathetic system — does not exist.</p><p>How, then, could the ‘sacral parasympathetic’ survive to this day? How the many proponents of two pro-erectile pathways, one lumbar and one sacral, could keep calling them, respectively, ‘sympathetic’ and ‘parasympathetic’, when the latter was christened explicitly to signify that this function was not shared by the former?</p><p>A reason might be that, when the first contradiction to Langley was published in the late 1940s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Root and Bard, 1947</xref>) —arching back to Eckhardt and François-Franck—, the authors did not remember the origin of the term “para-sympathetic”, hidden in a footnote from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Langley, 1905</xref> (p. 403), which does not even refer to the 1895 study that inspired it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Langley and Anderson, 1895</xref>). Another reason might be that, in this interval, the discovery of the chemical neurotransmitters noradrenaline and acetylcholine had finally explained functional antagonism (whose mechanism remained elusive for Langley<sup>19</sup>) thus consolidating the general notion of two antagonistic autonomic outflows and, so to speak, emancipating the term ‘parasympathetic’ from its (erroneous) sacral origins. A final irony however, is that, concerning erection, the chief antagonist of noradrenaline is not acetylcholine, but nitric oxide, whose proerectile role would not be established before another half-century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burnett et al., 1992</xref>), which has nothing to do with the “receptive substances” discovered by Langley, and which played no role in establishing the classical view of the autonomic nervous system that we inherited from him.</p><p>To this day, the anatomical substrate of the neural antagonism on the helicine arteries, thus erection, is uncertain. For all we know, it might play out between the sacral paravertebral chain and the pelvic ganglion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vanhatalo et al., 1996</xref>): since the former receives input from the lumbar cord exclusively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), and the latter from both, the lumbar and the sacral cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sivori et al., 2023</xref>), this would represent, at the level of the spinal cord, a lumbar/lumbo-sacral antagonism. And little is known of the projections from higher brain centers on the lumbar and sacral spinal cord which are paramount to trigger or terminate erection — too often, and not very aptly, called a ‘spinal reflex.’ The physiology also is poorly understood: it could consist in a pseudo-antagonism (as in the case of the iris, see below), whereby the variations in the diameter of arteries depend exclusively on fluctuations of the lumbo-sacral proerectile pathway, against the background of a weak noradrenergic tone, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sjöstrand and Klinge, 1979</xref>. The idea of a ‘sacral parasympathetic’, by appearing to offer easy answers to all these questions, might be partly responsible for our current lack of understanding.</p><p>Another adverse long-term effect of the (non-existent) lumbo-sacral antagonism on the helicine arteries — and an unwitting part, this time, of Langley’s legacy — is that by echoing the (undisputed) cranio-thoracic antagonism on the heart, it only helped planting the notion that the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems function antagonistically <italic>in general</italic>, the didactic basis of all presentations of the autonomic nervous system to this day. A detailed criticism of this exaggeration, or oversimplification is outside the scope of this review, but I will just mention the degree to which it was peripheral to Langley’s views.</p><p>In the 1899 <italic>Address</italic>, strangely, he did not even bother to mention, alongside the functional lumbo-sacral antagonism that he put forward, the thoraco-cranial one on the heart, which is required to justify the cranio-sacral parallel: perhaps he was loathe of treading on Gaskell’s turf; or he counted that this fact was sufficiently on his audience’s mind. At any rate, he never worked himself on the heart (which remains to this day the canonical example of a <italic>bona fide</italic> antagonism). Langley never touched any antagonism on the iris, where he only studied the sympathetic input (to argue for the existence of an atypical 'dilator muscle' controversial for a long time) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Langley and Anderson, 1892</xref>)<sup>20</sup>. Concerning the bladder, a major conclusion of his monography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Langley and Anderson, 1895</xref>) had been that:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>“We give some additional—and we think conclusive—evidence that <bold>both the lumbar and the sacral nerves cause contraction</bold> of all the muscle fibers of the bladder […].

The fateful paragraph arguing for a physiological antagonism — lumbo-sacral, on the helicine arteries— which inaugurated the current dogma of a sacral parasympathetic outflow, is a singularity in Langley’s body of work (and dates from his early period).</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Conclusion: The polytomous autonomic outflow</title><p>Once the parasympathetic nervous system is bereft of its sacral part, which was key to its definition, what remains of it? An interesting case to consider is the enteric nervous system, the largest part of the autonomic nervous system, whose inclusion or not in the parasympathetic division is the subject of a century-long hesitation. In 1899, before he had coined the term ‘parasympathetic’, Langley talked of</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>“The cranial and sacral systems [that] supply the muscular coats of the alimentary canal and certain structures connected developmentally with anterior and posterior portions of it. They are especially connected with these terminal portions; they send numerous nerve fibers to them, whereas they send but few to the intervening portion.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Langley, 1899a</xref>)</p></list-item></list><p>a statement that included all central projections to the gut in the “oro-anal system”, despite their relative scarcity in the middle. Gaskell followed through with his “bulbo-sacral or enteral system” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gaskell, 1920</xref>, Figure 5, p. 25). However, 20 years later, Langley chose to exclude the enteric nervous system, for one reason: the existence of the preganglionic fibers was not settled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Langley, 1921</xref>, p. 9); consequently, he put it in a class by itself. But the preganglionic fibers do exist, after all (those “few to the intervening portion”, i.e., projections of the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve to enteric neurons), and they are indistinguishable so far from other parasympathetic fibers. For this reason and others, and despite Langley’s caution, the enteric nervous system is invariably included in the parasympathetic division in schematics of the autonomic circuits. More recently, as enteric neurons revealed their diversity, experts have arched back to Langley’s late view that “the enteric nervous system is neither sympathetic nor parasympathetic but a third autonomic division” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rao and Gershon, 2018</xref>); the Langleyan rationale being that “most of its component neurons lack direct innervation”: Langley saw the glass as possibly empty, and it is only partly full. The enteric nervous system is thus described as “<italic>receiving</italic> sympathetic and parasympathetic input” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rao and Gershon, 2018</xref>). But this symmetrical formulation glosses over a fundamental anatomical asymmetry: no spinal thoraco-lumbar (sympathetic) neuron is preganglionic to enteric ones (which might receive a <italic>ganglionic</italic> sympathetic input, e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stebbing et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Furness, 2012</xref>), while a parasympathetic nucleus (the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve) is preganglionic to a fraction of them. Consequently, in the non-parasympathetic view of the enteric nervous system, those vagus efferent fibers which synapse onto enteric neurons (like others do onto lung or pancreatic ones), should also be removed from the parasympathetic nervous system; or else, enteric neurons that receive these inputs should be removed from the enteric nervous system, either way leading to a rather convoluted anatomy. One could add that the esophageal and gastric parts of the enteric nervous system form exactly like parasympathetic ganglia (from nerve-associated neural crest, a.k.a. Schwann Cell Precursors, in this case of the vagus nerve) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Espinosa-Medina et al., 2017</xref>), and that, like them, they largely depend on their preganglionic innervation for function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Furness, 2006</xref>). Finally, the view that the enteric nervous system does not belong to the parasympathetic robs the latter of half of its ‘rest and digest’ functions— which might explain why the “separate but equal classification of the enteric nervous system still surprises doctors and even neuroscientists” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gershon, 1999</xref>, p. 16). I suggest that the debate cannot be settled, and is pointless, because one of its terms, the parasympathetic, is ill-defined in the first place.</p><p>Two other traditional components of the parasympathetic are the midbrain pathway to the eye, and the medullary (‘bulbar’) one to the heart. In both cases, knowledge of cell identities and circuitry is scant. In the case of cardiac ganglia, a great heterogeneity of cell types was noted as early as the XIXth century, by Remak, Dogiel, and many others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), and have inspired, in more recent accounts, to call cardiac ganglia “a little brain in the heart” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armour, 2008</xref>) — in an echo of the ‘second brain’ in the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gershon, 1999</xref>) — which, like the latter, receives inputs on only a fraction of its cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McAllen et al., 2011</xref> and displays activity after decentralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ardell et al., 1991</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Cardiac ganglionic neurons of three morphological types recognized by Dogiel (reproduced in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Testut, 1911</xref>, after Dogiel 1894).</title><p>Testut provides tens of references and comments: “Despite this body of work, the question of cardiac ganglia is far from settled, owing in part to the difficulty of the subject”.

The parasympathetic nervous system — unlike the sympathetic — is not a natural kind.

But we now know that they are sensory.</p><p><sup>7</sup> The vagus is bulbar and not “upper cervical”, but Gaskell mistakenly includes in his analysis the branchiomotor fibers of the “spinal accessory nucleus”.</p><p><sup>8</sup> ‘erector nerve’ in latin, name given by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eckhard, 1876</xref>.</p><p><sup>9</sup> This quest, which occupies section IV of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gaskell, 1886</xref> and the whole of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gaskell, 1889</xref>, can be viewed as the first act of the grand comparative entreprise of <italic>The Origin of the vertebrates</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gaskell, 1908</xref>), which juggles analogies between organs and creatures in a way that makes Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire appear sober in retrospect.</p><p><sup>10</sup> “Each spinal segment gives origin to <bold>three roots</bold>, viz. anterior, posterior, and lateral, combined with the further conception that these <bold>three</bold> roots may be grouped together <bold>into a dual</bold> arrangement”.</p><p><sup>11</sup> “The general visceral elements in the brain stem are considered equivalent to the cells in the lateral horn of the spinal cord” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nieuwenhuys et al., 1998</xref>), vol. I, p. 197.</p><p><sup>12</sup> Owen published an <italic>Anatomy of the vertebrates</italic> in 1866 and died in 1892.</p><p><sup>13</sup> The influence that I suspect, however, must have been unconscious, and stealthily passed from the bones to the nerves, and anyway forgotten 20 years later, since (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gaskell, 1908</xref>) barely mentions Goethe, Oken or Owen himself and deems “hopeless to resolve the cranium into vertebral segments” (p. 124).</p><p><sup>14</sup> This protest suggests that <italic>The Autonomic nervous system (Pt. I)</italic>, written in the same year, was put together in a huff, as an effort to supersede Gaskell’s book. This would explain the clumsiness of this unlikely grand finale, much less structured than Langley’s own 1900 treatise. Indeed, after the first two chapters of nomenclature and generalities (where Langley replaces Gaskell’s “involuntary” with “autonomic”, “enteral” with “parasympathetic”, “connector” with “preganglionic”, etc.), and which is probably all that people read nowadays, it is difficult to pick one’s way among a hodge-podge of detailed historical accounts, ongoing debates, experimental minutiae and phylogenetic speculations. The only “Tissues Innervated” (chapter 5) are the melanocytes of lower vertebrates and tissues that are… not innervated! (capillaries and skeletal muscle). Langley probably felt that he had made his point and, in the six years that were left of his life, did not bother to provide a “Part II”, whose plan would not have been easy to devise.</p><p><sup>15</sup> About Langley’s mention of “one system for the gut”, as well as the de facto exclusion of the tectal outflow to the eye from this formulation of the parasympathetic, see Conclusion.</p><p><sup>16</sup> In the slightly altered version of his address published by <italic>The Lancet</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Langley, 1899b</xref>), Langley humorously comments, after a quote from an XVIIIth century doctor about his Majesty’s spleen, gall bladder and duodenum: “In these days we are, perhaps, less free in our allusions to our component parts”.</p><p><sup>17</sup> And on this latter point only: to the best of my knowledge no one ever questioned that the stimulation of the lumbar roots, which run in great part to the paravertebral chain, or the paravertebral chain itself, triggered vasoconstriction — an experiment also performed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Semans and Langworthy, 1938</xref>.</p><p><sup>18</sup> The pure ‘lumbar’ erection of men whose sacral spinal cord is destroyed is singled out as “psychogenic” (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krassioukov and Elliott, 2017</xref>) (but every erection is strictly dependent on a psychological trigger — or at least supraspinal, as in sleep-related erections); and its poor quality is highlighted (but it could entirely be due to the lack of sensory feedback, which is sacral).</p><p><sup>19</sup> As strange at it may sound to the contemporary reader, even though Langley discovered “receptive substances” — our neurotransmitter receptors — he never envisioned endogenous ligands for them, thus chemical neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vallenstein, 2006</xref>). He conceived autonomic nerves as largely equivalent, “indifferent” in their action (see the <italic>Address</italic>, p. 891). He was inspired in this view by his observation that a heterotopic graft of the proximal end of a cut vagus nerve onto a sympathetic ganglion was functional, enabling the vagal nerve to have sympathetic effects on the iris (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Langley, 1897</xref>). For him, the effect of autonomic nerves depended solely on the nature of their targets (which was revealed by drug action). This view prevented any mechanistic explanation for a functional antagonism of different nerves on the same target, a topic with which he struggled on and off over 20 years (discussed for example in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Langley, 1905</xref>, p. 403, or in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Langley, 1921</xref>, p. 45). This conceptual deadlock may have played a role in Langley’s tendency to shun the idea of antagonism (see below).</p><p><sup>20</sup> Let’s remark here that the classical notion of sympatho-parasympathetic antagonism on the iris, however useful in ophtalmological practice, obscures rather than illuminates the mechanism of the pupillary light reflex, which depends exclusively on modulations of the midbrain input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clarke et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lowenstein, 1950</xref>). Morevoer, given that the ciliary muscle receives no sympathetic innervation, such antagonism cannot have any relevance for accommodation to distance.</p><p><sup>21</sup> Another twist in this story, which would deserve another study, is that many after Langley, inspired by his idea of a lumbar sympathetic/sacral parasympathetic dichotomy, looked for a lumbo-sacral antagonism on the bladder — and occasionally even found it, as is often the case of desirable outcomes — thus contradicting Langley himself. But, despite most summary diagrams, such an antagonism is negligeable and probably nonexistent in many species, including humans (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fowler et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p><sup>22</sup> And see note 15.</p><p><sup>23</sup> This text, published in 1900 but written in 1898, is credited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jänig, 2006</xref> (p. 168) for presenting the first classification of the enteric nervous system as a separate division, but in fact Langley had not yet invented the parasympathetic, and he treated the sacral and tectal outflows also separately, among the “related systems of nerves”.</p><p><sup>24</sup> Langley frequently described the autonomic divisions in terms of development and evolution (this combination, which could appear as a visionnary ‘evo-devo’ synthesis, was common place at a time when the Haeckelian recapitulation still held sway over embryological thinking). This evolutionnary line of thought is already present in the 1899 Address (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Langley, 1899a</xref>), in the form of what sounds nowadays almost like a non-sequitur: right after the physiological statement that the lumbar and sacral outflows have opposite effects on the helicine arteries, rather than simply concluding that they are different, Langley writes:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>“Thus, it seems to me probable that in the <bold>evolution</bold> of mammals, the sympathetic nerves have <bold>developed at one time</bold>, and the cranial and sacral involuntary nerves have <bold>developed at another time</bold>.”</p></list-item></list><p>And several pages of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Langley, 1921</xref> are devoted to a ‘parasympathetic first’ evolutionnary scenario, which I do not have the space to recount here.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s6"><title>Additional
