dopaminergic neurons directly mediate these effects. We show that dopaminergic neurons in these areas mainly express orexin receptor subtype 1 (Ox1R). In contrast, only a minor population in the medial ventral tegmental area express orexin receptor subtype 2 (Ox2R). To analyze the functional role of Ox1R signaling in dopaminergic neurons, we deleted Ox1R specifically in dopamine transporter-expressing neurons of mice and investigated the functional consequences. Deletion of Ox1R increased locomotor activity and exploration during exposure to novel environments or when intracerebroventricularely injected with orexin A. Spontaneous activity in home cages, anxiety, reward processing, and energy metabolism did not change. Positron emission tomography imaging revealed that Ox1R signaling in dopaminergic neurons affected distinct neural circuits depending on the stimulation mode. In line with an increase of neural activity in the lateral paragigantocellular nucleus (LPGi) of Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup> mice, we found that dopaminergic projections innervate the LPGi in regions where the inhibitory dopamine receptor subtype D2 but not the excitatory D1 subtype resides. These data suggest a crucial regulatory role of Ox1R signaling in dopaminergic neurons in novelty-induced locomotion and exploration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>orexin</kwd><kwd>dopamine</kwd><kwd>context-induced locomotion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TRR 134</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kloppenburg</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name><name><surname>Hausen</surname><given-names>Anne Christine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>401832153</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kloppenburg</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009318</institution-id><institution>Helmholtz Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hausen</surname><given-names>Anne Christine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>233886668/GRK1960</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yeghiazaryan</surname><given-names>Gagik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

Dopamine was discovered as a neuro-active molecule approximately 70 y ago and the dopaminergic system has diverse functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Iversen and Iversen, 2007</xref>). In a simplified model the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system, containing the dopaminergic projections from SN to the dorsal striatum, predominantly regulates action selection and exploratory behaviors. In contrast, the mesolimbic and mesocortical dopaminergic systems, which consist of the dopaminergic pathways from the VTA to the ventral striatum and prefrontal cortex, predominantly regulate motivation, cognition, decision-making, reward, and aversive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kutlu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Latif et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lerner et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Roeper, 2013</xref>). Some VTA dopaminergic neurons also represent movements in trained animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lerner et al., 2021</xref>).

On the other hand, systemic injection of dopamine receptor antagonists reduces orexin A-induced increase of hyperlocomotion, and stereotypic and grooming behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nakamura et al., 2000</xref>). However, whether the above effects of orexin signaling in the VTA and SN are mediated by dopaminergic or non-dopaminergic cells is not yet clear.</p><p>The orexin system consists of the two peptides orexin A and B, which are derived from the precursor, prepro-orexin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Lecea et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sakurai et al., 1998</xref>). Both are endogenous ligands for two G-protein-coupled receptors, orexin receptor subtype 1 (Ox1R), and 2 (Ox2R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sakurai et al., 1998</xref>). Orexin A activates both receptors, while orexin B predominantly activates Ox2R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sakurai et al., 1998</xref>). Detection of mRNA by in situ hybridization revealed the expression of both receptors in the VTA and SN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Marcus et al., 2001</xref>). However, the cell-type specific expression of Ox1R and Ox2R in the VTA and SN is not well understood.

In contrast, Ox2R-positive dopaminergic neurons were mainly located in the medial VTA, including IF, PN, and PIF, with 25–42% of dopaminergic neurons expressing the Ox2R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, C, D, G-I</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). While the above data were calculated as the mean percentages in the investigated mice, we also calculated the mean dopaminergic neuron numbers separately for those expressing both or exclusively one of the orexin receptor types.

Therefore, Ox1R was specifically inactivated in dopaminergic (DAT-expressing) neurons of mice (Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup>). As a prerequisite for the functional analysis (behavior and PET imaging) validation of the Ox1R deletion was necessary. In Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup> mice, Ox1R expression was significantly reduced in dopaminergic neurons and remained unchanged in Th-negative cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, E-I</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In contrast, the Ox2R expression patterns remained similar to that in the control mice, indicating the successful and specific knockout of Ox1R in dopaminergic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, E, I</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Next, we used perforated patch clamp recordings to establish that orexin A activates dopaminergic neurons not only in the mouse VTA (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baimel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Korotkova et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tung et al., 2016</xref>), but also in the mouse SN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). In dopaminergic SN neurons that were pharmacologically isolated from GABAerigc and glutamatergic synaptic input 100 nM orexin increased the action potential frequency in 75% (6 of 8) of the neurons. Increasing the orexin A concentration to 300 nM further increased the firing frequency. This finding is consistent with previous extracellular recordings in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). To also validate the Ox1R knockout in dopaminergic neurons functionally, we performed Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in acute brain slices from control and Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup> mice. We used the genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator GCaMP6s to monitor [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> specifically in dopaminergic (DAT-expressing) neurons. This analysis focused on dopaminergic neurons in the SN, which we used as an ‘indicator population’ because a large number of these neurons express Ox1R. During the experiments, GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic input was blocked and orexin A was bath-applied at 100 nM and 300 nM. Bath application of 100 nM orexin A already resulted in a clear and significant increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in dopaminergic SN control neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I-L</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>). For quantification, we tested each neuron whether it responded to 100 nM orexin A. A neuron was considered orexin-responsive if the change in GCaMPs fluorescence induced by orexin A was three times larger than the baseline fluorescence’s standard deviation (3 σ criterion ≙ Z-score of 3). We found that 56% of the neurons tested responded to 100 nM orexin A, while 44% of the neurons did not respond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). These data are in very good agreement with the number of Ox1R-expressing neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). To determine the ‘population response’ of all analyzed neurons, we measured the orexin-induced GCaMP6s fluorescence of each neuron expressed as a percentage of the GCaMP6s fluorescence induced by applying high (40 mM) K<sup>+</sup> saline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). This is a solid reference point since it reflects the GCaMP6s fluorescence at maximal voltage-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. The ‘population response’ of all analyzed neurons was expressed as the mean ± SEM of these responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). The significance of this mean response was tested for each group (control and Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup>) using a one-sample t-test. We found a highly significant and marked response of control neurons to 100 nM orexin A, while the Ox1R knockout neurons did not respond (control: p&lt;0.0001, n=71; Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup>: p=0.5, n=86; one sample t-test for each group) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, Ox1R is the main orexin receptor expressed in dopaminergic VTA and SN neurons and mediates their activation by orexin. Therefore, we wanted to determine further the functional role of Ox1R signaling in dopaminergic neurons. By comparing control and Ox1R<sup>ΔDAT</sup> mouse data, we first identified behaviors modulated by orexin via dopaminergic neurons. In a second step, we used PET imaging to define and map neuronal pathways modulated by orexin.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Ox1R in dopaminergic neurons regulates novelty-induced locomotion and exploration</title><p>The behavioral test included an analysis of locomotor behavior, novelty exploration, reward processing, anxiety, and energy homeostasis.

We found that Ox1R is the main subtype of orexin receptors in DAT-expressing neurons in VTA and SN, though the expression patterns of orexin receptors in DAT-expressing cells in brain areas outside VTA/SN remain unclear. The essential prerequisites for these functional studies were RNAscope and ex vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments, which confirmed the successful knockout of Ox1R in dopaminergic neurons. Further PET imaging, along with c-Fos and DRD expression analyses, provided initial insights into the underlying mechanisms. These findings can serve as a basis for developing testable working hypotheses on the systemic physiological role of orexin signaling.</p><p>Earlier studies showed orexin-induced activation of VTA dopaminergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baimel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Korotkova et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tung et al., 2016</xref>). Whole-cell patch clamp recordings combined with mRNA measurement of the individually recorded VTA neurons revealed fewer Ox2R- than Ox1R- positive dopaminergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Korotkova et al., 2003</xref>), which is in line with our findings. While our electrophysiological and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging data clearly show an orexin A-induced activation of dopaminergic SN neurons when GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic input is blocked, previous in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Korotkova et al., 2002</xref>) or in vivo extracellular electrophysiological recordings in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 2018</xref>) studies were controversial about whether orexin A could activate dopaminergic neurons in the SN. Since Ox1R and Ox2R are expressed by non-dopaminergic neurons around the SN, recordings in the absence of synaptic blockers, could detect a mixed direct and indirect orexin-induced response in dopaminergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nair-Roberts et al., 2008</xref>). This may partially explain their controversial findings.</p><p>We found that Ox1R deficiency in dopaminergic neurons caused an increase in novelty-induced locomotion and exploration, which could indicate elevated arousal levels and hyperactivity. Interestingly, children with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have lower orexin A but unaltered orexin B levels in plasma compared to the healthy controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baykal et al., 2019</xref>). ADHD patients exhibit impaired dopaminergic functions, and medicine improving dopaminergic signaling is used to treat ADHD in clinics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Feldman and Reiff, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Volkow and Swanson, 2013</xref>). Ox1R signaling in dopaminergic neurons is important to limit novelty-induced arousal and hyperactivity, which are related to task performance and learning capability. Novelty-induced behavioral response should be at proper levels under normal physiological conditions. The orexin-dopamine interaction blunting novelty-induced locomotion could be important to keep attention on the main task without being distracted too much by other random environmental stimuli. When this balance is disrupted, the behavioral deficits may happen, such as ADHD.</p><p>We did not observe a significant impact of Ox1R signaling in dopaminergic neurons on reward processing. Previous studies reported that Ox1R signaling in VTA promoted reward processing with pharmacological methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tsujino and Sakurai, 2013</xref>). The difference could have resulted from the involvement of non-dopaminergic neurons in VTA or different behavioral models.

Our PET imaging experiments, without orexin application, indicate that Ox1R signaling in dopaminergic neurons modulates brain regions (MPA, Pir, endopiriform claustrum, LSS, SubCV, spinal trigeminal nucleus, sp5, IRt, and Gi) important for olfaction, eating, arousal and sleeping (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). When central orexin levels were increased by orexin A injection, Ox1R signaling in dopaminergic neurons regulates HDB, MCPO, Pir, DEn, S1, V2L, V1, BNST, LPGi, and M2, which are important for sensation, emotion, exploration, and action selection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In future studies, it would be interesting to investigate the direct and indirect downstream pathways of Ox1R-expressing dopaminergic neurons. Interestingly, in the fruitfly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, it has been shown that the dopaminergic system oppositely regulates sleep-wake arousal and environmentally stimulated arousal, and the authors discussed the possibility of identify similar patterns in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lebestky et al., 2009</xref>). It was further suggested that the dopaminergic system differentially regulates arousal levels under different stimulating conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lebestky et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lima and Miesenböck, 2005</xref>). Emotion perception affects the decision of how to respond to the novelty. We think that novelty activates the orexin system, and Ox1R signaling in dopaminergic neurons promotes emotion perception and inhibits exploration.</p><p>DRD1 and DRD2 in the BNST regulate anxiety, fear, and addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Bundel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eiler et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Giardino et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Krawczyk et al., 2013</xref>). LGPi regulates exploratory behaviors and locomotor speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Takatoh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arber and Costa, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Capelli et al., 2017</xref>). We found a potential direct impact of dopaminergic neurons on LPGi and BNST. The inhibitory D2 receptor was mainly expressed in LPGi, and the expression levels of the excitatory D1 receptor were decreased in BNST after Ox1R deletion in dopaminergic neurons. Our findings suggested that Ox1R deletion in dopaminergic neurons results in the disinhibition of neural activity in LPGi via dopaminergic pathways and the decrease of dopamine-mediated neural activity in BNST. The expression levels of Th were not altered in dBNST or LPGi by Ox1R deletion in dopaminergic neurons. It remains unclear whether dopamine release is affected in these regions. It is possible that either the dopaminergic regulation of neuronal activity or the changes in dopamine release could lead to the decreased expression of dopamine receptors in dBNST. It would be very interesting to further investigate these pathways in the future. There are few publications on the functional relevance of dopaminergic projections in the LPGi. Future studies would be very interesting in terms of functionally analyzing DRD2 signaling in the LPGi and how orexin interacts with DRD2 signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal care</title><p>All animal procedures were conducted in compliance with protocols approved by the local government authorities (Bezirksregierung Cologne, Germany; reference number: 84–02.05.40.14.134) and were in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines.

At least 4 wk were allowed for GCaMP6s virus expression. The imaging setup consisted of a Zeiss AxioCam/MRm CCD camera with a 1388x1040 chip and a Polychromator V (Till Photonics) that was coupled via an optical fiber into the Zeiss AxioExaminer upright microscope (Objective W ‘Plan-Apochromat’ 20 x/1.0 DIC D=0.17 M27 75 mm). The camera and polychromator were controlled by the software Zen Pro, including the module ‘Physiology’ (2012 blue edition, Zeiss). The SN neurons were identified according to their anatomical location and expression of the GCaMP6s. Calcium signals in GCaMP6s expressing cells were monitored by images acquired at 470 nm excitation wavelengths with 20 ms exposure time at ~0.2 Hz. The emitted fluorescence was detected through a 500–550 nm bandpass filter (BP525/50), and data were acquired using 4×4 on-chip binning. Images were recorded in arbitrary units (AU) and analyzed as 16-bit grayscale images. Orexin A (ab120212, Abcam) in the concentrations of 100 nM and 300 nM was applied for 8 min each. To analyze the orexin A effect, we compared the fluorescence measured in the cell bodies during 4- min intervals that were recorded immediately before and at the end of the peptide applications. This protocol was followed by applying high K<sup>+</sup> (40 mM) concentration saline (40 mM KCl; osmolarity adjusted by reducing the NaCl concentration) to identify cell bodies of neurons with functional GCaMP6s expression. Regions of interest (ROI) were defined after the experiment based on the high K<sup>+</sup> saline responses. The mean AU values of the ROIs were calculated in Image J. Time series analysis was performed with Igor Pro 6. To correct for bleaching artifacts, the baseline fluorescence (without orexin application) was fit. The extended fit was subtracted from the raw data. For each neuron, we tested whether it responded to orexin A. A neuron was considered orexin-responsive if the change in GCaMPs fluorescence induced by orexin A was three times larger than the standard deviation (3 σ criterion ≙ Z-score of 3) of the baseline fluorescence. To determine the ‘population response’ of all analyzed neurons, we measured the orexin-induced GCaMP6s fluorescence of each neuron expressed as a percentage of the GCaMP6s fluorescence induced by the high (40 mM) K<sup>+</sup> saline application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Parametric images of the [18 F]FDG kinetic constants K<sub>1</sub>, k<sub>2</sub>, k<sub>3</sub>, and k<sub>4</sub> were determined by a voxel-by-voxel (voxel size = 0.4 mm×0.4 mm×0.8 mm) fitting of data to a two- tissue-compartment kinetic model. K<sub>1</sub> is the constant for transport from blood to tissue, k<sub>2</sub> for transport from tissue to blood, k<sub>3</sub> the constant for phosphorylation of [18 F]FDG to [18 F]FDG-6-phosphate, and k<sub>4</sub> the constant of dephosphorylation. The ratio of tissue and plasma glucose concentrations (C<sub>E</sub>/C<sub>P</sub>) is a measure for glucose transport and is given by C<sub>E</sub>/C<sub>P</sub> = K<sub>1</sub>/(k<sub>2</sub> + k<sub>3</sub>/0.26) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Backes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jais et al., 2016</xref>). Since neuronal activation is accompanied by increased glucose transport and this parameter is less sensitive to changes in plasma glucose level, we use alterations of glucose transport (C<sub>E</sub>/C<sub>P</sub>) as a surrogate for alterations in neuronal activation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-2"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical testing was performed by application of a voxel-wise t-test between groups. 3D maps of p-values allow for the identification of regions with significant differences in the parameters. From these regions, we defined volumes of interest (VOIs) and performed additional statistical testing for these VOIs. For presentation only, 3D maps of p-values were re-calculated on a 0.1 mm×0.1 mm×0.1 mm grid from the original dataset using trilinear interpolation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Virus injection</title><p>Male mice received 1 mg/ml of tramadol in drinking water 2 d before the surgeries. On the day of surgery, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, and a bolus of buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg BW) was given (i. p.) to reduce pain. Brain regions were identified according to the atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Franklin and Paxinos, 2007</xref>). After alignment of the brain in the stereotaxic surgery platform, one or four small holes were drilled in the skull at specific coordinates. The virus, pAAV-Ef1a-DIO EYFP (~1×10<sup>13</sup> GC/ml, 300 nl, Addgene) was bilaterally injected into VTA and SN of 10-wk-old mice, with micropipettes pulled in-house with a heating system. The coordinates from Bregma were: anterior-posterior, AP: –3.4 mm; medial-lateral, ML: ±0.5/1.25 mm; dorsal-ventral, DV: –4.2 mm. The GCaMP6s virus (AAV1.Syn.Flex.GCaMP6s.WPRE.SV40, ~4×10<sup>12</sup> GC/ml, 300 nl, Penn Vector Core) was injected to left SN (AP: –3.4 mm, ML: 1.1 mm, DV: –4.2 mm) of 12-wk-old mice, to specifically express GCaMP6s in dopaminergic neurons. After virus injection, mice received a bolus of meloxicam (5 mg/kg BW, s.c.), and tramadol in drinking water for 3 d after surgeries to relieve pain. BW was checked twice a day. Experiments started at least 4 wk later than virus injection to allow virus expression.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>All numerical values are expressed as the mean ± SEM.

It extends previous findings suggesting an interplay between these two systems in regulating behaviour by first characterizing the expression of orexin receptors in the midbrain and then disrupting orexin transmission in dopaminergic neurons by deleting its predominant receptor, OX1R (Ox1R fl/fl, Dat-Cre tg/wt mice). Electrophysiological and calcium imaging data suggest that orexin A acutely and directly stimulates SN and VTA dopaminergic neurons but does not seem to induce c-Fos expression. Behavioral effects of depleting OX1R from dopaminergic neurons include enhanced novelty-induced locomotion and exploration, relative to littermate controls (Ox1R fl/fl, Dat-Cre wt/wt). However, no difference between groups is observed in tests that measure reward processing, anxiety, and energy homeostasis. To test whether the depletion of OX1R alters overall orexin-triggered activation across the brain, PET imaging is used in OX1R∆DAT knockout and control mice. This analysis reveals that several regions show higher neuronal activation after orexin injection in OX1R∆DAT mice, but the authors focus their follow-up study on the dorsal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and lateral paragigantocellular nucleus (LPGi). Dopaminergic inputs and expression of dopamine receptors type-1 and -2 (DRD1 &amp; DRD2) are assessed and compared to control demonstrating a moderate decrease in DRD1 and DRD2 expression in the BNST of OX1R∆DAT mice and unaltered expression of DRD2, with absence of DRD1 expression in LPGi of both groups.

Ex vivo calcium imaging of midbrain neurons is used to show that, in the absence of this receptor, orexin is no longer able to excite dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra.</p><p>The authors proceed to use this same model to study the effect of orexin receptor 1 deletion on a series of behavioral tests, namely, novelty-induced locomotion and exploration, anxiety-related behavior, preference for sweet solutions, cocaine-induced conditioned place preference, and energy metabolism. Of these, the most consistent effects are seen in the tests of novelty-induced locomotion and exploration in which the mice with orexin 1 receptor deletion are observed to show greater levels of exploration, relative to wild-type, when placed in a novel environment, an effect that is augmented after icv administration of orexin.</p><p>In the final part of the paper, the authors use PET imaging to compare brain-wide activity patterns in the mutant mice compared to wildtype. They find differences in several areas both under control conditions (i.e., after injection of saline) as well as after injection of orexin. They focus in on changes in dorsal bed nucleus of stria terminalis (dBNST) and the lateral paragigantocellular nucleus (LPGi) and perform analysis of the dopaminergic projections to these areas. They provide anatomical evidence that these regions are innervated by dopamine fibers from midbrain, are activated by orexin in control, but not mutant mice, and that dopamine receptors are present.

In other places, ANOVAs are mentioned but full results including main effects and interactions are not described in detail, e.g., in F3-S3, only a single p-value is presented and it is difficult to know if this is the interaction term or a post hoc test (L205). These and all other statements need statistics included in the text as support. Addition of these statistical details was also requested by the editor.</p></disp-quote><p>We submitted all our source data as Excel spreadsheets to eLife during our first-round revision, and the full statistics, such as main effects and interactions, are presented alongside the source data in the respective spreadsheets. We thank the reviewer for pointing out our lack of clarity in the manuscript. In this revised manuscript, we included the statistical details of ANOVAs mentioned above in the figure legends. In the figure legends, we also explained that the full statistics were provided alongside the source data in the supplementary materials.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the presentation of reward processing this is particularly important as no statistical tests are shown to demonstrate that controls show a cocaine-induced preference or a sucrose preference. Here, one option would be to perform one-sample t-tests showing that the data were different to zero (no preference). As it is, the claim that &quot;Both of the control and Ox1RΔDAT groups showed a preference for cocaine injection&quot; is not yet statistically supported.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestions. We have added the one-sample t-test results in this revised manuscript (Figure 2–figure supplement 4, lines 171 - 183).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Can the authors comment on overlap between DAT and Ox1R in brain areas outside VTA/SN? Is there any?</p></disp-quote><p>We only focused on the expression patterns of orexin receptors in VTA/SN, and we did not examine other brain regions. Additionally, little is known from the literature about the expression of Ox1R in DAT-expressing cells in brain areas outside VTA/SN. Further analysis is necessary to answer this question. We have added the comment in our discussion (lines 243 - 344).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For the Ca2+ imaging experiment, it is unclear to me why the authors do not show all the neurons (almost 160 in total) and just select 5 neurons to show for each condition.</p></disp-quote><p>Heat maps of all recorded neurons are now shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are other claims that still require a statistical justification to be included in addition to the passages on behavior mentioned above, e.g., &quot;Increasing the orexin A concentration to 300 nM further increased [Ca2+]i&quot; (L118).</p><p>Authors should ensure that all such claims are either presented with a statistical test or are phrased differently, e.g. &quot;Visual inspection of data suggested that there was a further increase...&quot;. In addition, when an ANOVA is conducted, full results including main effects and interactions should be described.</p></disp-quote><p>We emphasize now our statement that ALREADY 100 nM orexin A significantly increased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i levels (lines 117 - 118).</p><p>We submitted all our source data as Excel spreadsheets to eLife during our first-round revision, and the full statistics, such as main effects and interactions, are presented alongside the source data in the respective spreadsheets. For clarity, we chose to include only the key statistical information in the main text and figures. We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. In this revised manuscript, we have emphasized in each figure legend: ‘Source data and full statistics are provided in the supplementary materials’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Typos in figure captions</p><p>F2-S1 - spontanous</p><p>F3-S2 - intrest</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the typos.
