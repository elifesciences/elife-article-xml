However, our mechanistic understanding of the ocean is biased toward its larger constituents, while rates and biomass fluxes in the microbial food web are mainly inferred from indirect measurements and ensemble averages. Yet, resolution at the level of the individual microplankton is required to advance our understanding of the microbial food web. Here, we demonstrate that, by combining holographic microscopy with deep learning, we can follow microplanktons throughout their lifespan, continuously measuring their three-dimensional position and dry mass. The deep-learning algorithms circumvent the computationally intensive processing of holographic data and allow rapid measurements over extended time periods. This permits us to reliably estimate growth rates, both in terms of dry mass increase and cell divisions, as well as to measure trophic interactions between species such as predation events. The individual resolution provides information about selectivity, individual feeding rates, and handling times for individual microplanktons. The method is particularly useful to detail the rates and routes of organic matter transfer in micro-zooplankton, the most important and least known group of primary consumers in the oceans. Studying individual interactions in idealized small systems provides insights that help us understand microbial food webs and ultimately larger-scale processes. We exemplify this by detailed descriptions of micro-zooplankton feeding events, cell divisions, and long-term monitoring of single cells from division to division.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Picture a glass of seawater.

Already Darwin, in his foundations on evolutionary biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Darwin, 2004</xref>), noted how excluding herbivores from a heath land transformed it into a forest of pine trees with an altogether different species composition. Single-celled micro-zooplankton take on the role of herbivores in the ocean, consuming approximately two thirds (40 Petagrams (Pg) carbon) of the primary production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Calbet and Landry, 2004</xref>). In oceanic ecology, the primary production is dominated by unicellular phytoplankton, which produce around 50 Pg of carbon annually, quantitatively slightly exceeding the production of terrestrial plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Behrenfeld and Falkowski, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Field et al., 1998</xref>). Selective grazing shapes the plankton community and drives large-scale processes such as harmful algal bloom formation and carbon export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Irigoien et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Selander et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Despite its importance, our understanding of the role of micro-zooplankton in shaping oceanic communities is still much less developed than that of macro-organisms, which can more readily be observed at the individual level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Glibert and Mitra, 2022</xref>). In fact, rates and fluxes in the oceanic microbial food web are still mainly inferred from indirect measurements or ensemble averages, leaving us with a limited mechanistic understanding. Quantitative estimates of primary production are mostly inferred from satellite images of ocean color (chlorophyll) using moderate resolution spectroradiometers calibrated against in situ isotope incorporation experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hu et al., 2012</xref>). Ensemble-level biomass transitions during grazing events by microscopic zooplankton are calculated from dilution experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Landry and Hassett, 1982</xref>), where the grazer density is manipulated by dilution, and the corresponding net increase in primary production is approximated. While these methods provide good estimates of the magnitude of biomass fluxes, they do not resolve the small-scale individual interactions that drive the large-scale processes. Moreover, indirect measurements of processes such as micro-zooplankton grazing rest on assumptions that are not always fulfilled. For example, feeding rates and growth rates of both predators and prey need to be unaffected by dilution, which is often not true (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dolan et al., 2000</xref>). In addition, the dilution technique is based on chlorophyll measurements and does not account for consumption of non-chlorophyll-bearing particles, which leads to underestimation of carbon transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Stoecker et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Currently, the biomass of individuals is often inferred from volume-to-carbon relationships developed over time for different trophic groups of planktons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Strathmann, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Menden-Deuer and Lessard, 2000</xref>), which require cell counting and sizing followed by elemental analysis, but do not allow continuous measurements of the same individual. However, these regression relations are not very precise: the average deviation of individual data points to the regressed expression exceeds 50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Menden-Deuer and Lessard, 2000</xref>). In addition, single cells of the same volume can differ by a factor two in dry mass, which is not possible to detect by volume-to-carbon relationships. To go beyond the current level of detail in marine microbial food webs, we need complementary techniques that can follow individual microplanktons over extended periods, while continuously monitoring their growth rate and predation events.</p><p>Continuous measurements can be realized using microscopy techniques. For example, holographic microscopy can record holograms of cells under investigation in the form of interference patterns containing phase and amplitude information. The information in the holograms can be used to extract the three-dimensional position of microplanktons as well as their mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zangle and Teitell, 2014</xref>). Holographic imaging has already found applications in microbial studies, especially for in situ measurements of particle size distributions and their identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nayak et al., 2021</xref>). However, its full potential has not yet been exploited, namely for the quantitative investigation of the growth and feeding patterns of individual planktons over prolonged times. Arguably, this is because the data acquisition and processing pipelines are very computationally expensive.</p><p>Here, we solve this problem by employing a technique that combines holography with deep learning. The deep-learning algorithms circumvent the long computational times and, once trained, allow rapid determination of three-dimensional position and dry mass of individual microplanktons over extended time periods. We evaluate this method on nine plankton species belonging to different trophic levels and representing the major classes of microplankton. We highlight that unlike other methods, our approach makes it possible to follow and weigh single cells throughout their lifetime, being especially useful to detail micro-zooplankton and mixotrophic life histories as feeding events can be quantitatively measured. Furthermore, the estimated dry mass can be tagged to single planktons detected in the experiments. We can track and identify both prey and predator cells and closely follow the transfer of mass from cell to cell. Finally, we observe the growth and cell divisions in diatoms by their long-term monitoring over more than one cell cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experimental setup and deep-learning data analysis</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows an overview of the holographic microscopy experimental setup and the deep-learning data analysis pipeline to estimate the position and dry mass of the planktons.

The uncertainty in the dry mass value represents the standard error of the mean computed for ±5 frames around the measurement point (gray dashed lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>We have repeated this experiment with various cell densities with independently cultured samples, collecting multiple division events. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref> shows the high correlation (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf44"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.857</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) between the parent cell dry mass and the sum of the daughter cells’ dry masses for 11 cell divisions. It is interesting to note that the division events of <italic>T. weissflogii</italic> occur when the parent cell weighs between 310 pg and  436 pg, with a mean value of ≈ 378 pg. This kind of a tip-off value prediction in dry mass for a division event is achieved for the first time thanks to this method and is another example of the type of information that can be acquired by employing a nonintrusive technique that can continuously measure single cells throughout the cell cycle.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The main advantage of combining holographic microscopy with deep-learning algorithms lies in the ability to monitor position and dry mass of individual plankton cells over extended time periods. The method is nondestructive and minimally invasive, and allows quantitative assessment of trophic interactions such as feeding and biomass increase throughout the cell cycle, providing unprecedented detail to the life histories of marine microorganisms.</p><p>The standard methods to determine the biomass of cells entail either performing elemental analysis on cells harvested from single species cultures or estimating the biomass from volume-to-carbon relationships drawn from multiple elemental analyses of similar plankton organisms of different sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Strathmann, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Menden-Deuer and Lessard, 2000</xref>). Elemental analysis has the advantage of providing detailed measurements of individual elements, typically carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen; however, it is destructive and cannot provide individual cell resolution. Volume-to-carbon relationships can provide biomass estimates of individual living cells as long as the volume of the cells can be measured accurately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Menden-Deuer and Lessard, 2000</xref>); yet, the variability around the relationship is substantial (e.g., the estimated value for <italic>O. marina</italic> used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Menden-Deuer and Lessard, 2000</xref> is 30% higher than that measured by elemental analysis). Moreover, the volume-to-carbon relationships do not account for the nutritional status of the cell (e.g., as discussed in Results, ‘Dry mass estimates’, similarly sized cells of the same species can indeed differ by more than a factor of two in the estimated dry mass by the volume-to-carbon method).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref> reveals asymmetric cleavage in <italic>T. weissflogii</italic>, where sister cells receive unequal proportions of the mother cell biomass. Asymmetric division is well established in centric diatoms that have a rigid silica shell called the frustule consisting of two halves. Both halves have the shape of a cylinder with one open end; the smaller one (known as hypotheca) fits inside the larger one. Upon division, both daughter cells grow a new hypotheca fitting inside the half that is inherited from the mother cell so that one of the daughter cells will be slightly smaller (while the other maintains the size of the mother cell). When the cells reach a critically small size, the size is reinstalled through sexual reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Macdonald, 1869</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pfitzer, 1869</xref>). Experimentally, asymmetric cleavage beyond the reductive cell cycle has also been shown in the diatom <italic>Ditulum breightwelli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Laney et al., 2012</xref>) where daughter cells are of different volume. Similar to our study, the sister cells show unequal times to the subsequent division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a–e</xref>) which may lead to faster population growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Laney et al., 2012</xref>). Physiological asymmetry is also found in bacteria (e.g., <italic>E. coli</italic>) where old damaged cell content is distributed differently leading to the development of age structure in prokaryote populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Proenca et al., 2018</xref>). The differences in biomass of sister cells observed here are larger than expected from the volume alone which suggest that unequal division of biomass may be more common in protozoans than previously perceived.</p><p>Three-dimensional tracking of microorganisms is not easily achieved by alternative methods. In many instances, two-dimensional traces are obtained and three-dimensional swimming behavior is inferred by assuming isotropic swimming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Selander et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, traditional tracking techniques often lose track of cells when they intersect other cells or swim out of focus. Holographic microscopy which records the holograms of objects overcomes the limitations due to the shallow depth of field in conventional light microscopy, and the three-dimensional positioning together with the biomass estimates facilitates linking of cell positions into coherent trajectories. The RU-Net approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2c</xref>) that we describe can be a useful candidate to track interesecting cells from a recorded holographic image. Three-dimensional positioning of both prey and predator cells also allows detailed observations of cell–cell interactions such as reaction distances and rejection events. Finally, holographic microscopy does not require manipulation such as dilution and is not sensitive to the same assumptions as the dilution technique. On the other hand, the volume that can be monitored by holographic microscopy is limited by the coherence length of the light source. Here, we use an LED light source with a relatively short coherence length (approximately 200μm with 1-nm line filter). The depth of the observational chamber can, however, be increased by use of laser light sources with longer coherence length. With simple modifications to the setup design, the lensless approach used here can be adopted for smaller organisms such as bacteria and heterotrophic nanoflagellates, or larger organisms such as rotifers and small crustaceans. It could also be merged with rotating stages that keep cells in suspension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Krishnamurthy et al., 2020</xref>), or microfluidic channels to facilitate experiments with large number of cells in flow. The method is particularly suitable to study micro-zooplankton grazing behaviors.</p><p>A large and growing proportion of micro-phytoplanktons previously considered fully autotrophic have been reclassified as mixotrophic, that is, supporting their energy demand by a combination of photosynthesis and uptake of dissolved or particulate organic matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Stoecker et al., 2017</xref>). This discovery is of more than academic interest as allowing mixotrophy in food web modeling results in up to a threefold increase in average organism size and enhanced transfer of biomass to higher trophic levels, thus increasing the sinking flux of carbon, ‘the biological pump’, by an estimated 35% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ward and Follows, 2016</xref>). The discovery has led to something of a paradigm shift in marine microbial ecology and highlighted the need for new methods to accurately account for mixotrophy in biogeochemical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Flynn et al., 2019</xref>). Mixotrophy is a plastic trait that changes with conditions. Among the more extreme cases, there is the dinoflagellate <italic>Karlodinium armiger</italic>, which is an autotroph at low cell concentrations, but switches to heterotrophy at high densities and even revert the food web by killing their copepod predators and extracting their content through peduncle feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berge et al., 2012</xref>). The combination of holographic microscopy and deep-learning algorithms can be used to quantify uptake of both particulate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and dissolved matter. Uptake of dissolved organic matter will result in increased dry mass, and the slope of such increase will provide cell-specific uptake rates. Furthermore, it will allow us to explore the level of mixotrophy in different conditions and organisms by monitoring dry mass in factorial combinations of, for example, light and organic substrates. For instance, primary production can be assessed as dry mass increase in the presence of light but the absence of organic food sources (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In the scenarios where both photosynthesis and uptake of organic food sources are possible, the level of heterotrophy can be estimated by subtracting photosynthesis from total production.</p><p>Individual-level observations have been key to further the development of ecological theory, not only in larger organisms, but also in smaller organisms such as millimeter-sized copepods, the most common multicellular organisms in the ocean. As an example, copepods have been shown to feed selectively and reject well-defended cells. Consequently, well-defended cells are favored and enriched by copepod grazing, which contributes to harmful algal bloom formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ryderheim et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, individual-level observations have revealed the sensory capabilities of copepods involved in prey and threat detection as well as the fundamental strategies involved in foraging and reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kiørboe et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kiørboe et al., 2009</xref>). Likewise, Individual-level observations of protozoans have the potential to catalyze experiments and gain insights in microbial food–web interactions in a similar way.</p><p>We conclude that the marriage between holographic microscopy and deep learning provides a strong complementary tool in microbial ecology. It allows the nondestructive and minimally invasive determination of the three-dimensional position and dry mass of individual microorganisms. It outperforms traditional methods in terms of speed and individual resolution and rivals the precision and accuracy of current methods. While holographic microscopy has already been employed in marine sciences, the combination with deep-learning algorithms makes it more versatile and many orders of magnitude faster, which is key to follow and characterize individuals throughout their lifespan.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Holographic imaging</title><p>During the measurements, the planktons are placed under the holographic microscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) in two different configurations depending on the application.

The results from the first case study show feeding behavior and the increase in cell mass upon prey consumption, while the cell division study shows asymmetric division and a second round of division by the larger daughter cell.

The tracking of individual cells, possible via deep learning, seems that it cannot provide details on the predator-prey dynamics occurring at shorter time scales.

However, the limitation of the method seems to restrict the application of the method to idealized scenarios, whose ecological relevance is questionable.

I think the authors could try to discuss in more detail how such studies can help to understand the ecology of plankton systems.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79760.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Both reviewers think the work is interesting and high-quality.

We have tested the technique with mixed samples containing two different plankton species (see feeding-event experiments in Figure. 3). The RU-Net is useful in this case to separate cells from other matter, apart from classifying the species. The continuous measurements of size / dry mass and three-dimensional position will allow us to quantitatively follow individual cells belonging to a certain class also in more complex environments. But it is true that there is an upper limit for the number of cells that can be imaged. We have tested the limits of the system, for instance in the feeding-event experiments (Figure. 3) where we have used a high concentration of prey cells (~700 cells observed simultaneously). It is observed that beyond a certain threshold, the accuracy in dry mass measurements deteriorates significantly due to multiple overlapping plankton holograms.</p><p>We also discuss some other possible limitations of the method in response to reviewer’s comment R1.2, where we also indicate the possible ways to overcome these limitations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) How can the results obtained by this method inform larger macroscale questions in plankton ecology?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added some specific examples in the “Discussion” section, where individual-level observations have furthered the understanding for higher-level dynamics.

Consequently, well-defended cells are favored and enriched by copepod grazing, which contributes to harmful algal bloom formation. Moreover, individual-level observations have revealed the sensory capabilities of copepods involved in prey and threat detection as well as the fundamental strategies involved in foraging and reproduction. Individual-level observations of protozoans have the potential to catalyze experiments and gain insights in microbial food-web interactions in a similar way (see response to R1.1 and R2.1. and revised manuscript file with highlighted changes).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors sought to develop and apply a new method for tracking individual plankton over time.

Given the ability to keep track of the dry mass and 3D positions, we may still be able to follow individual cells in more complex settings.

These include detailed characterization of, e.g., feeding strategies, feeding preferences, handling times, sensory capabilities determining reaction distances, encounter rates in copepods. We hope to have now more clearly addressed the limitations and opportunities in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the abstract and introduction, the authors motivate their study from a too macroscopic perspective of the problem. However, the limitation of the method seems to restrict the application of the method to idealized scenarios, whose ecological relevance is questionable. However, I believe that studying such idealized, small systems is an initial key step. I think the authors could try to discuss in more detail how such studies can help to understand the ecology of plankton systems.</p></disp-quote><p>We took the macroscopic perspective to motivate our study and put it in that context. While we still think this is relevant, we have followed the reviewer’s advice and de-emphasized the significance for large-scale processes by referring more to the microbial food web and less to the ocean food web, and we also refer to specific examples from larger organisms, where individual-level observations have furthered the understanding for higher-level dynamics to make it more clear how and when we envision that small-scale observations can provide mechanistic understanding with some relevance also for larger scale dynamics (see answer to R1.1 and changes in the manuscript file with highlighted changes).</p></body></sub-article></article>
