In terms of protein targeting and assembly, the current dogma holds that a ‘β-signal’ imprinted in the final β-strand of the OMP engages the β-barrel assembly machinery (BAM) complex to initiate membrane insertion and assembly of the OMP into the outer membrane. Here, we revealed an additional rule that signals equivalent to the β-signal are repeated in other, internal β-strands within bacterial OMPs, by peptidomimetic and mutational analysis. The internal signal is needed to promote the efficiency of the assembly reaction of these OMPs. BamD, an essential subunit of the BAM complex, recognizes the internal signal and the β-signal, arranging several β-strands and partial folding for rapid OMP assembly. The internal signal-BamD ordering system is not essential for bacterial viability but is necessary to retain the integrity of the outer membrane against antibiotics and other environmental insults.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>BAM complex</kwd><kwd>outer membrane protein</kwd><kwd>protein assembly</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group

Structurally, each major OMP has a β-barrel transmembrane domain, spanning the membrane as a cylindrical structure formed from amphiphilic, antiparallel β-strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Konovalova et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schulz, 2000</xref>). Starting as nascent polypeptides synthesized by ribosomes in the cytoplasm, these newly synthesized OMPs cross the inner membrane in a process mediated by the SecYEG translocon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Manting et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mori and Ito, 2001</xref>), and then traverse the periplasm supported by the periplasmic chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). The molecular machine driving OMP insertion and assembly into the membrane is the β-barrel assembly machinery complex (BAM complex) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bakelar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Iadanza et al., 2016</xref>).

It has been shown that the β-signal plays a significant role in the targeting and folding of BAM complex substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kutik et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wang et al., 2021</xref>), yet several important OMPs do not have a recognizable β-signal motif in their C-terminal sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Celik et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hagan et al., 2015</xref>). For instance, BamA itself lacks an apparent C-terminal β-signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hagan et al., 2015</xref>). Also, a comprehensive study of the autotransporter class of OMPs, including proteins such as EspP, showed that while 1038 non-redundant proteins did have a C-terminal β-signal motif, over 40% of these proteins had a β-signal motif only in internal strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Celik et al., 2012</xref>), which was also suggested to be the case for BamA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hagan et al., 2015</xref>). It remains to be tested if these internal motifs function as β-signals and how they engage the BAM complex.</p><p>Before substrate OMPs can enter the lateral gate of BamA, they must first pass through the periplasmic features of the BAM complex. Although the assembly reactions that occur at the lateral gate are well understood, less is known about the molecular mechanisms at the early stage, prior to being position in the lateral gate. The specific points that have been established are that the substrate makes contact with the BamB and BamD subunits and the lateral gate of the BamA subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hagan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harrison, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ieva et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Here, we establish a screening system based on an in vitro reconstituted membrane assay using a translocation-competent <italic>E. coli</italic> microsomal membrane (EMM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gunasinghe et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Thewasano et al., 2023</xref>) and demonstrate that OMPs - including the major porins that are the predominant substrate of the BAM complex - contain multiple β-signal-related repeats. Comparison of the C-terminal β-signal with what we refer to here as the ‘internal signal’ revealed the essential elements of sequence and orientation in the signals that are recognized by the BAM complex. Internal signals and β-signals are recognized by BamD and are responsible for rapid assembly of the OMP into the bacterial membrane at the early stage. Moreover, in situ cross-linking and mutagenesis demonstrated that the specific relationship between the BAM complex and this dual signal plays an important role in the integrity of the outer membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Peptidomimetics derived from <italic>E. coli</italic> OmpC inhibit OMP assembly</title><p>The EMM assembly assay provides a means for in vitro reconstitution of BAM complex function, where the assembly of a <sup>35</sup>S-labeled OMP can be monitored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gunasinghe et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Thewasano et al., 2023</xref>). EspP, a model OMP substrate, belongs to autotransporter family of proteins. Autotransporters have two domains: (1) a β-barrel domain, assembled into the outer membrane via the BAM complex, and (2) a passenger domain, which traverses the outer membrane via the lumen of the β-barrel domain itself and is subsequently cleaved by the correctly assembled β-barrel domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Celik et al., 2012</xref>). When EspP is correctly assembled into outer membrane, a visible decrease in the molecular mass of the protein is observed due to the self-proteolysis. Once the barrel domain is assembled into the membrane it becomes protease-resistant, with residual unassembled and passenger domains degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leyton et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Roman-Hernandez et al., 2014</xref>). When applied to <sup>35</sup>S-labeled EspP, the assay discriminates assembly of a protease-protected β-barrel domain, assembled into the outer membrane by the BAM complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ieva et al., 2011</xref>), from the protease-sensitive extracellular passenger domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) that are degraded by protease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The addition of peptides with BAM complex affinity, such as the OMP β-signal, are capable of exerting an inhibitory effect by competing for binding of substrate OMPs to the BAM complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hagan et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the addition of peptides derived from the entirety of OMPs to the EMM assembly assay, which can evaluate assembly efficiency with high accuracy, expects to identify novel regions that have affinity for the BAM complex. To screen for potential peptidomimetics that could inhibit BAM complex function, a synthetic peptide library was designed for coverage of the sequence features in OmpC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We used peptides that mapped the entirety of OmpC, with a two amino acid overlap.

In addition, because it is the last β-strand, it also contributes to engagement with the first β-strand in order that purified OMPs can fold into β-barrels, even in the absence of the BAM complex in artificial non-membrane environments such as detergent micelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burgess et al., 2008</xref>). To compare this property of strand engagement for β-barrel folding in detergent micelles, we purified urea-denatured OmpC and the OmpC variant proteins with mutations in the –5 strand (F280A and Y286A) and the –1 strand (V359A and Y365A). The spontaneous folding of each OmpC variant was assessed by the rate of formation of trimer in the presence of detergent micelles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Trimer embedded into detergent micelles migrated at 100 kDa in this assay system, whereas non-folded monomeric OmpC migrated at 37 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Relative to the rate/extent of trimer formation observed for OmpC(WT), mutations to the [Ω/Φ] (position 6) in the –5 strand, i.e., OmpC(Y286A) or the –1 strand, i.e., OmpC(Y365A) showed significantly impaired spontaneous folding. Position 6 is an amino acid that contributes to the aromatic girdle. Since Y286A and Y365A affected OMP folding as measured in folding experiments, their positioning into the aromatic girdle may contribute to the efficiency of β-barrel folding, in addition to contributing to the internal signal. Mutation of the Φ residue (position 0) in the –5 strand, i.e., OmpC(F280A) or the –1 strand, i.e., OmpC(V359A) maintained a similar ability to assemble into micelles as native OmpC. Thus, the conserved features of both –1 and –5 strands have equivalent impact on intrinsic properties for spontaneous folding of β-barrel of OmpC.</p><p>We further analyzed the role of internal β-signal by the EMM assembly assay. Compared to the rate at which the trimeric form of OmpC is assembled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), OmpC(Y286A) is slow and the gels resolve that most of the <sup>35</sup>S-labeled OmpC(Y286A) is held in a high-molecular-weight species for most of the time-course. Only at 80 min of assembly has substantial amount of the <sup>35</sup>S-labeled OmpC(Y286A) been resolved from this assembly intermediate (‘Int’) to a native, trimeric form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In analyzing assembly intermediates of other sorts of membrane proteins in mitochondria, a version of this analysis referred to as ‘gel shift’ BN-PAGE analysis has been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shiota et al., 2012</xref>). Here, the addition of an antibody recognizing the surface-exposed BamC to the samples prior to electrophoresis resulted in a dramatic shift, i.e., retardation of electrophoretic mobility due to the added mass of antibodies. This is consistent with OmpC(Y286A) being held in an assembly intermediate engaged with the BAM complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Consistent with this, the assembly intermediate which was prominently observed at the OmpC(Y286A) can be extracted from the membranes with urea; urea extraction of the membrane samples prior to analysis by BN-PAGE showed that the integral membrane trimer form of OmpC and OmpC(Y286A) was not extracted by urea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Conversely, the assembly intermediate was completely extracted with urea, as expected for a substrate engaged in protein-protein interactions with a proteinaceous complex in the membrane fraction. These results suggest that the mutation in OmpC(Y286A) causes a longer interaction with the BAM complex, as a species of protein that is not yet inserted into the surrounding membrane environment.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Mutation that stalls outer membrane protein (OMP) assembly in a high-molecular-weight assembly intermediate.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Upper panel, assembly assay of <sup>35</sup>S-OmpC wild-type (WT) and mutant Y286A.

Peptide 23 inhibited binding of the substrate by BamA and peptide 18 inhibited binding of the substrate by BamD. Peptide 21 inhibited binding of the substrate by either BamA or BamD. These results suggest that BamA and BamD are important for recognition of both the β-signal and the internal signal. While the biochemical assay demonstrated that the OmpC(Y286A) mutant forms a stalled intermediate with the BAM complex, in a state in which membrane insertion was not completed, biochemical assays such as this cannot elucidate where on BamA-BamD this OmpC(Y286A) substrate is stalled. Neutron reflectometry (NR) is a powerful tool for probing the details of substrate-chaperone interactions, and is ideally suited for membrane-embedded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shen et al., 2014</xref>). The rationale to these experiments is that NR: (1) provides information on the distance of specified subunits of a protein complex away from the atomically flat gold surface to which the complex is attached, and (2) allows the addition of samples between measurements, so that multi-step changes can be made to, for example, detect changes in domain conformation in response to the addition of a substrate. To apply NR imaging to monitor the engagement of OmpC with the BAM complex, BamA was immobilized on an Ni-NTA atomic flat gold-coated silicon wafer to orient the POTRA domain distal to the silicon wafer as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ding et al., 2020</xref>). A lipid layer was reconstituted to provide BamA with a membrane-like environment prior to sequential measurement of: (1) BamA with lipid (first measurement), (2) BamA with lipid and BamD (second measurement), and (3) BamA-BamD-lipid with the addition of OmpC(WT) or OmpC(Y286A) (third measurement) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Proximity and dependence of BamD with OmpC(Y286A) revealed by neutron reflectometry (NR) analysis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ni-NTA was used to affinity purify His<sub>6</sub>-BamA or His<sub>6</sub>-BamD.

This internal signal corresponds to the –5 strand in OmpC and is recognized by BamD. Sequence analysis shows that similar sequence signatures are present in other OMPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4</xref>). These sequences were investigated in two further OMPs: OmpF and LamB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). Hidden Markov model approaches like HMMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eddy, 1995</xref>) detect conserved sequence features and tools such as MEME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bailey et al., 2009</xref>) can then define a sequence motif derived from information across very many non-redundant protein sequences. The abundance of information which arises from modeling approaches and from the multitude of candidate OMPs is generally oversimplified when written as a primary structure description typical of the β-signal for bacterial OMPs (i.e. ζxGxx[Ω/Φ]x[Ω/Φ]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kutik et al., 2008</xref>). Analysis of the few peptidomimetic peptide sequences in functional analyses, via both in vitro assays and intact <italic>E. coli</italic> analysis, suggests that Φxxxxx[Ω/Φ]x[Ω/Φ] is a descriptor for the internal signal, which is complimentary in function to the C-terminal β-signal that engages the BAM complex to assist OMP assembly into the outer membrane.</p><p>The β-signal motif (ζxGxx[Ω/Φ]x[Ω/Φ]) is an eight-residue consensus, and internal signal motif is composed of a nine-residue consensus. Recent structures have shown the lateral gate of BamA interacts with a seven-residue span of substrate OMPs. Interestingly, inhibitory compounds, such as darobactin, mimic only three residues of the C-terminal side of β-signal motif. Cross-linking presented here in our study showed that BamD residues R49 and G65 cross-linked to the positions 0 and 6 of the internal signal in OmpC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Both signals are larger than the assembly machinery’s signal binding pocket, implying that the signal might sit beyond the bounds of the signal binding pocket in BamD and the lateral gate in BamA. These finding are consistent with similar observations in other signal sequence recognition events, such as the mitochondrial targeting presequence signal that is longer than the receptor groove formed by the Tom20, the subunit of the translocator of outer membrane complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yamamoto et al., 2011</xref>). The presequence has been shown to bind to Tom20 in several different conformations within the receptor groove (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nyirenda et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The current dogma in our field states that the information contained in the β-signal is important for engagement into the lateral gate of BamA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bitto and McKay, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Cock et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Doyle et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doyle and Bernstein, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hagan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jansen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Robert et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tomasek et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xiao et al., 2021</xref>). This interaction initiates the insertion of a nascent OMP polypeptide into the outer membrane. By this model, BamD is considered to function by organizing the BamC and BamE subunits of the BAM complex against the core subunit BamA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Malinverni et al., 2006</xref>). If that is the sole role of BamD, then BamD is essential because its importance in structural organization of the BAM complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hart and Silhavy, 2020</xref>), not because of a substrate recognition function. Previous studies have shown that BamD is capable of stimulating the folding and insertion of OMPs into liposomes in the absence of BamA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hagan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hagan et al., 2010</xref>). The question remains, how is BamD capable of this function? In our present study, we show that incubation of OmpC with BamD promotes the formation of antiparallel β-strands by the formation of intramolecular disulfide cross-linking of neighboring β-strands at the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). In EspP position 1214, located within the internal signal, was seen to cross-link to BamD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ieva et al., 2011</xref>), and our intermolecular cysteine cross-linking showed that the N-terminal helices of BamD’s TPR structure interact with the internal signal and the C-terminal helices interact with the β-signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). Failure in this interaction was seen to stall substrate assembly within the soluble domain of the BAM complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This suggests that BamD acts in an important role in an early recognition step in which both the substrate’s C-terminal β-signal and internal signal engage BamD in order to be arranged into a form ready for transfer to the lateral gate of BamA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tomasek et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>).

We showed that purified BamD can facilitate partial folding of an OMP and we propose that BamD captures the –1 strand and draws the –5 strand by a conformational change, thereby catalyzing the formation of hydrogen bonds to form β-hairpins in neighboring strands, to prime the substrate for insertion into the outer membrane by the action of BamA. After OMP assembly, all elements of the internal signal are positioned such that they face into the lipid phase of the membrane. This observation may be a coincidence, or may be utilized by the BAM complex to register and orientate the lipid facing amino acids in the assembling OMP away from the formative lumen of the OMP. Amino acids at position 6, such as Y286 in OmpC, are not only component of the internal signal for binding by the BAM complex, but also act in structural capacity to register the aromatic girdle for optimal stability of the OMP in the membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

The reflectivity at the interface between the Si substrate and water solution was measured at three incident angles (0.3°, 0.75°, and 1.8°). The neutrons were introduced from the substrate side to illuminate the interface and the reflection intensity was normalized by the transmission intensity through the substrate to achieve the reflectivity with the Q range of up to 0.2 Å<sup>–1</sup>. Neutron reflectivity, denoted as R, is the ratio of the incoming to the exiting neutron beams. It’s calculated based on the momentum transfer Q, which is defined by the formula Q=4π sinθ/λ, where θ represents the angle of incidence and λ stands for the neutron wavelength. The approximate value of R(Q) can be expressed as R(Q)=16π<sup>2</sup>/Q<sup>2</sup> |ρ(Q)|2, where R(Q) is the one-dimensional Fourier transform of ρ(z), which is the SLD distribution perpendicular to the surface. SLD is calculated by dividing the sum of the coherent neutron scattering lengths of all atoms in a sample layer by the volume of that layer. Consequently, factors such as thickness, volume fraction, and interface roughness of the samples significantly influence the intensity of the reflected beams.</p><p>Analysis of the NR profiles was performed using the MOTOFIT analysis software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nelson, 2010</xref>). The software uses a conventional method, optical matrix method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nelson, 2006</xref>), to model the reflectivity profiles. Briefly, the layer is divided into several sublayers and then a characteristic matrix is evaluated for each sublayer, from which the whole reflectivity can be calculated exactly. The same layer with multiple datasets with three different isotopic contrasts is fitted simultaneously until the satisfactory fit is obtained (smallest χ<sup>2</sup> value in the genetic algorithm). All models include a 15 Å oxide layer on the surface of the silicon substrates and subsequently there are three layers of Ni, gold, and Ni-NTA on the top of oxide layer. Protein layers will assemble outward from the Ni-NTA layer.</p><p>The best-fit model from MOTOFIT gives information about the thickness, density, and roughness of each layer.

A single colony was used to inoculate a culture in photo-cross-linking media (1% NaCl, 1% tryptone, 0.1% extract yeast dried, 1 mM BPA) for 3 hr at 37°C in the dark. Afterward, arabinose (0.1% final concentration) was added and further incubated for 2.5 hr. Cultures were divided with one half UV-irradiated for 7 min at RT and the other half not. Cells were pelleted and solubilized with 1% SDS buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% SDS). His-tagged BamD containing BPA and its cross-linked products were purified by Ni-NTA agarose. Cross-linked products were identified via immunoblotting with anti-BamD and anti-FLAG antibodies.</p><p>In vitro photo-cross-linking was performed with 32 µg of purified BamD-His<sub>8</sub> variants containing BPA diluted in Buffer A. 40 µl of <sup>35</sup>S-OmpC was added to each tube and incubated at 25°C for 10 min in the dark. Each mixture was transferred to the lid of a microtube and irradiated with UV using B-100AP (UVP) for 7 min on ice. 10% (wt/vol) SDS solution was added to a final concentration of 1%, then incubated at 95°C for 10 min to denature proteins. Protein mixtures were diluted with 0.5% Triton X-100 buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100), and purified on Ni-NTA agarose beads.

So far, the last strand of an OMP, referred to as the beta-signal, has been known as a primary recognition motif by BAM. Here, authors have identified additional sequence motifs that are located in the upstream of the last strand.</p><p>Here, authors carried out rigorous biochemical, biophysical, and genetic approaches to prove that the newly identified internal motifs are critical to the assembly of outer membrane proteins as well as to the interaction with the BAM complex. The identification of important regions on the substrates and Bam proteins during biogenesis is an important contribution that gives clues to the path substrates take en route to the membrane. Assessing the effect of the internal motifs in the assembly of model OMPs in the absence (in vitro) and presence (in vitro and in vivo) of BAM machinery aids a precise definition of the role of the motifs, solidifying the conclusions.</p><p>The initial reviews raised several concerns:</p><p>1. Strengthening the claim that the recognition of the internal signal by BAM is mediated by BamA and BamD via specific interactions.</p><p>2. Justification of the rationale of the peptide inhibition assays as a primary tool to identify significant recognition motifs.</p><p>3. More careful interpretation of the mutational effects on OMP assembly - that is, discerning the impairment of BAM-nascent polypeptide chain interaction from the impairment of intrinsic folding.</p><p>4. Providing further clarification of the discrepancy between in vitro assay and in vivo assay regarding the effect of the mutation Y286A on OMP assembly.</p><p>5. More elaboration on the rationale, interpretation, and representation of neutron refractory data.</p><p>6. An explanation is lacking why the strain with BamD R197A does not display VCN sensitivity in contrast to the strain with BamD Y62A.</p><p>Those concerns were well addressed in the revised manuscript in a rigorous manner.</p><p>Overall, this study comprehensively addresses an important question in the field. The notion that additional signals assist in biogenesis is a novel concept that has been tested and verified at least for a subset of model OMPs in this study. The generalization of the conclusion awaits a further proof of the concept.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id

the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The biogenesis of outer membrane proteins (OMPs) into the outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria is still not fully understood, particularly substrate recognition and insertion by beta-assembly machinery (BAM). In the studies, the authors present their studies that in addition to recognition by the last strand of an OMP, sometimes referred to as the beta-signal, an additional signal upstream of the last strand is also important for OMP biogenesis.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>1. Overall the manuscript is well organized and written, and addresses an important question in the field. The idea that BAM recognizes multiple signals on OMPs has been presented previously, however, it was not fully tested.</p><p>1. The authors here re-address this idea and propose that it is a more general mechanism used by BAM for OMP biogenesis.</p><p>1. The notion that additional signals assist in biogenesis is an important concept that indeed needs fully tested in OMP biogenesis.</p><p>1. A significant study was performed with extensive experiments reported in an attempt to address this important question in the field.</p><p>1. The identification of important crosslinks and regions of substrates and Bam proteins that interact during biogenesis is an important contribution that gives clues to the path substrates take en route to the membrane.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Major critiques (in no particular order):</p><p>1. The title indicates 'simultaneous recognition', however no experiments were presented that test the order of interactions during OMP biogenesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We have replaced the word “Simultaneous” with “Dual” so as not to reflect on the timing of the recognition events for the distinct C-terminal signal and -5 signal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Aspects of the study focus on the peptides that appear to inhibit OmpC assembly, but should also include an analysis of the peptides that do not to determine this the motif(s) present still or not.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. Our study focuses on the peptides which exhibited an inhibitory effect in order to elucidate further interactions between the BAM complex and substrate proteins, especially in early stage of the assembly process. In the case of peptide 9, which contains all of our proposed elements but did not have an inhibitory effect, there is the presence of an arginine residue at the polar residue next to hydrophobic residue in position 0 (0 Φ). As seen in Fig S5, S6, and S7, there are no positively charged amino acids in the polar residue positions in the -5 or last strands. This might be the reason why peptide 9, as well as peptide 24, the β-signal derived from the mitochondrial OMP Tom40 and contains a lysine at the polar position, did not display an inhibitory effect. Incorporating the reviewer's suggestions might elucidate conditions that should not be added to the elements, but this is not the focus of this paper and was not discussed to avoid complicating the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The β-signal is known to form a β-strand, therefore it is unclear why the authors did not choose to chop OmpC up according to its strands, rather than by a fixed peptide size. What was the rationale for how the peptide lengths were chosen since many of them partially overlap known strands, and only partially (2 residues) overlap each other? It may not be too surprising that most of the inhibitory peptides consist of full strands (#4, 10, 21, 23).</p></disp-quote><p>A simple scan of known β-strands would have been an alternative approach, however this comes with the bias of limiting the experiments to predicted substrate (strand) sequences, and it presupposes that the secondary structure element would be formed by this tightly truncated peptide.</p><p>Instead, we allowed for the possibility that OMPs meet the BAM complex in an unfolded or partially folded state, and that the secondary structure (β-strand) might only form via β-argumentation after the substrate is placed in the context of the lateral gate. We therefore used peptides that mapped right across the entirety of OmpC, with a two amino acid overlap.</p><p>To clarify this important point regarding the unbiased nature of our screen, we have revised the text:</p><p>(Lines 147-151) &quot;We used peptides that mapped the entirety of OmpC, with a two amino acid overlap. This we considered preferable to peptides that were restricted by structural features, such as β-strands, in consideration that β-strand formation may or may not have occurred in early-stage interactions at the BAM complex.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. It would be good to have an idea of the propensity of the chosen peptides to form β-stands and participate in β-augmentation. We know from previous studies with darobactin and other peptides that they can inhibit OMP assembly by competing with substrates.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's suggestion. However, we have not conducted biophysical characterizations of the peptides to calculate the propensity of each peptide to form β-stands and participate in β-augmentation. The sort of detailed biophysical analysis done for Darobactin (by the Maier and Hiller groups, The antibiotic darobactin mimics a β-strand to inhibit outer membrane insertase Nature 593:125-129) was a Nature publication based on this single peptide. A further biophysical analysis of all of the peptides presented here goes well beyond the scope of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The recognition motifs that the authors present span up to 9 residues which would suggest a relatively large binding surface, however, the structures of these regions are not large enough to accommodate these large peptides.</p></disp-quote><p>The β-signal motif (ζxGxx[Ω/Φ]x[Ω/Φ]) is an 8-residue consensus, some of the inhibitory peptides include additional residues before and after the defined motif of 8 residues, and the lateral gate of BamA has been shown interact with a 7-residue span (eg. Doyle et al, 2022). Cross-linking presented in our study showed BamD residues R49 and G65 cross-linked to the positions 0 and 6 of the internal signal in OmpC (Fig. 6D).</p><p>We appreciate this point of clarification and have modified the text to acknowledge that in the final registering of the peptide with its binding protein, some parts of the peptide might sit beyond the bounds of the BamD receptor’s binding pocket and the BamA lateral gate:</p><p>(Lines 458-471) &quot;The β-signal motif (ζxGxx[Ω/Φ]x[Ω/Φ]) is an eight-residue consensus, and internal signal motif is composed of a nine-residue consensus. Recent structures have shown the lateral gate of BamA interacts with a 7-residue span of substrate OMPs. Interestingly, inhibitory compounds, such as darobactin, mimic only three resides of the C-terminal side of β-signal motif. Cross-linking presented here in our study showed that BamD residues R49 and G65 cross-linked to the positions 0 and 6 of the internal signal in OmpC (Fig. 6D). Both signals are larger than the assembly machineries signal binding pocket, implying that the signal might sit beyond the bounds of the signal binding pocket in BamD and the lateral gate in BamA. These finding are consistent with similar observations in other signal sequence recognition events, such as the mitochondrial targeting presequence signal that is longer than the receptor groove formed by the Tom20, the subunit of the translocator of outer membrane (TOM) complex (Yamamoto et al., 2011). The presequence has been shown to bind to Tom20 in several different conformations within the receptor groove (Nyirenda et al., 2013).&quot;</p><p>Moreover, the distance between amino acids of BamD which cross-linked to the internal signal, R49 and Y62, is approximately 25 Å (pdbID used 7TT3). The distance of the maximum amino acid length of the internal signal of OmpC, from F280 to Y288, is approximately 22 Å (pdbID used 2J1N). This would allow for the signal to fit within the confines of the TRP motif of BamD.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-90274-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors highlight that the sequence motifs are common among the inhibiting peptides, but do not test if this is a necessary motif to mediate the interactions. It would have been good to see if a library of non-OMP related peptides that match this motif could also inhibit or not.</p></disp-quote><p>With respect, this additional work would not address any biological question relevant to the function of BamD. To randomize sequences and then classify those that do or don’t fit the motif would help in refining the parameters of the β-signal motif, but that was not our intent.</p><p>We have identified the peptides from within the total sequence of an OMP, shown which peptides inhibit in an assembly assay, and then observed that the inhibitory peptides conform to a previously published (β-signal) motif.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In the studies that disrupt the motifs by mutagenesis, an effect was observed and attributed to disruption of the interaction of the 'internal signal'. However, the literature is filled with point mutations in OMPs that disrupt biogenesis, particular those within the membrane region. F280, Y286, V359, and Y365 are all residues that are in the membrane region that point into the membrane. Therefore, more work is needed to confirm that these mutations are in parts of a recognition motif rather than on the residues that are disrupting stability/assembly into the membrane.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer pointed out, the side chains of the amino acids constituting the signal elements we determined were all facing the lipid side, of which Y286 and Y365 were important for folding as well as to be recognized. However, F280A and V359A had no effect on folding, but only on assembly through the BAM complex. The fact that position 0 functions as a signal has been demonstrated by peptidomimetics (Fig. 1) and point mutant analysis (Fig. 2). We appreciate this clarification and have modified the text to acknowledge that the all of the signal element faces the lipid side, which contributes to their stability in the membrane finally, and before that the BAM complex actively recognizes them and determines their orientation:</p><p>(Lines 519-526) After OMP assembly, all elements of the internal signal are positioned such that they face into the lipid-phase of the membrane. This observation may be a coincidence, or may be utilized by the BAM complex to register and orientate the lipid facing amino acids in the assembling OMP away from the formative lumen of the OMP. Amino acids at position 6, such as Y286 in OmpC, are not only component of the internal signal for binding by the BAM complex, but also act in structural capacity to register the aromatic girdle for optimal stability of the OMP in the membrane.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The title of Figure 3 indicates that disrupting the internal signal motif disrupts OMP assembly, however, the point mutations did not seem to have any effect. Only when both 280 and 286 were mutated was an effect observed. And even then, the trimer appeared to form just fine, albeit at reduced levels, indicating assembly is just fine, rather the rate of biogenesis is being affected.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this point and have revised the title of Figure 3 to be:</p><p>(Lines 1070-1071) &quot;Modifications in the putative internal signal slow the rate of OMP assembly in vivo.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In Figure 4, the authors attempt to quantify their blots. However, this seems to be a difficult task given the lack of quality of the blots and the spread of the intended signals, particularly of the 'int' bands. However, the more disturbing trend is the obvious reduction in signal from the post-urea treatment, even for the WT samples. The authors are using urea washes to indicate removal of only stalled substrates. However a reduction of signal is also observed for the WT. The authors should quantify this blot as well, but it is clear visually that both WT and the mutant have obvious reductions in the observable signals. Further, this data seems to conflict with Fig 3D where no noticeable difference in OmpC assembly was observed between WT and Y286A, why is this the case?</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this point by adding a statistical analysis on Fig. 4A. As the reviewer points out, BN-PAGE band quantification is a difficult task given the broad spread of the bands on these gels. Statistical analysis showed that the increase in intermediates (int) was statistically significant for Y286A at all times until 80 min, when the intermediate form signals decrease.</p><p>(Lines 1093-1096) &quot;Statistical significance was indicated by the following: N.S. (not significant), p&lt;0.05; *, p&lt;0.005; **. Exact p values of intermediate formed by Wt vs Y286A at each timepoint were as follows; 20 minutes: p = 0.03077, 40 minutes: p = 0.02402, 60 minutes: p = 0.00181, 80 minutes: p = 0.0545.&quot;</p><p>Further regarding the Int. band, we correct the statement as follows.</p><p>(Lines 253-254) &quot;Consistent with this, the assembly intermediate which was prominently observed at the OmpC(Y286A) can be extracted from the membranes with urea;&quot;</p><p>OMP assembly in vivo has additional periplasmic chaperones and factors present in order to support the assembly process. Therefore, it is likely that some proteins were assembled properly in vivo compared to their in vitro counterparts. Such a decrease has been observed not only in <italic>E. coli</italic> but also in mitochondrial OMP import (Yamano et al., 2010).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The pull-down assays with BamA and BamD should include a no protein control at the least to confirm there is no non-specific binding to the resin. Also, no detergent was mentioned as part of the pull downs that contained BamA or OmpC, nor was it detailed if OmpC was urea solubilized.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed pull down experiments with a no-protein (Ni-NTA only) control as noted (Author response image 1). The results showed that the amount of OmpC carrying through on beads only was significantly lower than the amount of OmpC bound in the presence of BamD or BamA. The added OmpC was not treated with urea, but was synthesized by in vitro translation; the in vitro translated OmpC is the standard substrate in the EMM assembly assay (Supp Fig. S1) where it is recognized by the BAM complex. Thus, we used it for pull-down as well and, to make this clearer, we have revised as follows:</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Pull down assay of radio-labelled OmpC with indicated protein or Ni-NTA alone (Ni-NTA) .</title><p>T; total, FT; Flow throw, W; wash, E; Elute.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-90274-sa2-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>(Lines 252-265) &quot;Three subunits of the BAM complex have been previously shown to interact with the substrates: BamA, BamB, and BamD (Hagan et al., 2013; Harrison, 1996; Ieva et al., 2011). In vitro pull-down assay showed that while BamA and BamD can independently bind to the in vitro translated OmpC polypeptide (Fig .S9A), BamB did not (Fig. S9B).&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.</p><p>• The neutron reflectometry experiments are not convincing primarily due to the lack controls to confirm a consistent uniform bilayer is being formed and even if so, uniform orientations of the BamA molecules across the surface.</p><p>• Further, no controls were performed with BamD alone, or with OmpC alone, and it is hard to understand how the method can discriminate between an actual BamA/BamD complex versus BamA and BamD individually being located at the membrane surface without forming an actual complex.</p><p>• Previous studies have reported difficulty in preparing a complex with BamA and BamD from purified components.</p><p>• Additionally, little signal differences were observed for the addition of OmpC. However, an elongated unfolded polypeptide that is nearly 400 residues long would be expected to produce a large distinct signal given that only the C-terminal portion is supposedly anchored to BAM, while the rest would be extended out above the surface.</p><p>• The depiction in Figure 5D is quite misleading when viewing the full structures on the same scales with one another.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed these five points individually as follows.</p><p>i. The uniform orientation of BamA on the surface is guaranteed by the fixation through a His-tag engineered into extracellular loop 6 of BamA and has been validated in previous studies as cited in the text. Moreover, to explain this, we reconstructed another theoretical model for BamA not oriented well in the system as below. However, we found that the solid lines (after fitting) didn’t align well with the experimental data. We therefore assumed that BamA has oriented well in the membrane bilayer.</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Experimental (symbols) and fitted (curves) NR profiles of BamA not oriented well in the POPC bilayer in D2O (black), GMW (blue) and H2O (red) buffer.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-90274-sa2-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><p>ii. There would be no means by which to do a control with OmpC alone or BamD alone as neither protein binds to the lipid layer chip. OmpC is diluted from urea and then the unbound OmpC is washed from the chip before NR measurements. BamD does not have an acyl group to anchor it to the lipid layer, without BamA to anchor to, it too is washed from the chip before NR measurements. We have reconstructed another theoretical model for both of BamA + BamD embedding in the membrane bilayer, and the fits were shown below. Apparently, the fits didn’t align well with the experimental data, which discriminate the BamA/BamD individually being located at the membrane surface without forming an actual complex.</p><fig id="sa2fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Experimental (symbols) and fitted (curves) NR profiles of BamA+D embedding together in the POPC bilayer in D2O (black), GMW (blue) and H2O (red) buffer.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-90274-sa2-fig4-v1.tif"/></fig><p>iii. The previous studies that reported difficulty in preparing a complex with BamA and BamD from purified components were assays done in aqueous solution including detergent solubilized BamA, or with BamA POTRA domains only. Our assay is superior in that it reports the binding of BamD to a purified BamA that has been reconstituted in a lipid bilayer.</p><p>iv. The relatively small signal differences observed for the addition of OmpC are expected, since OmpC is an elongated, unfolded polypeptide of nearly 400 residues long which, in the context of this assay, can occupy a huge variation in the positions at which it will sit with only the C-terminal portion anchored to BAM, and the rest moving randomly about and extended from the surface.</p><p>v. We appreciate the point raised and have now added a note in the Figure legend that these are depictions of the results and not a scale drawing of the structures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In the crosslinking studies, the authors show 17 crosslinking sites (43% of all tested) on BamD crosslinked with OmpC. Given that the authors are presenting specific interactions between the two proteins, this is worrisome as the crosslinks were found across the entire surface of BamD. How do the authors explain this? Are all these specific or non-specific?</p></disp-quote><p>The crosslinking experiment using purified BamD was an effective assay for comprehensive analysis of the interaction sites between BamD and the substrate. However, as the reviewer pointed out, cross-linking was observed even at the sites that, in the context of the BAM complex, interact with BamC as a protein-protein interaction and would not be available for substrate protein-protein interactions. To complement this, analysis and to address this issue, we also performed the experiment in Fig. 6C.</p><p>In Fig. 6C, the interaction of BamD with the substrate is examined in vivo, and the results demonstrate that if BPA is introduced into the site, we designated as the substrate recognition site, it is cross-linked to the substrate. On the other hand, position 114 was found to crosslink with the substrate in vitro crosslinking, but not in vivo. It should be noted that position 114 has also been confirmed to form cross-link products with BamC, we believe that BamD-substrate interactions in the native state have been investigated. To explain the above, we have added the following description to the Results section.</p><p>(Lines 319-321) &quot;Structurally, these amino acids locate both the lumen side of funnel-like structure (e.g. 49 or 62) and outside of funnel-like structure such as BamC binding site (e.g. 114) (fig. S12C).(Lines 350-357) Positions 49, 53, 65, and 196 of BamD face the interior of the funnel-like structure of the periplasmic domain of the BAM complex, while position 114 is located outside of the funnel-like structure (Bakelar et al., 2016; Gu et al., 2016; Iadanza et al., 2016). We note that while position 114 was cross-linked with OmpC in vitro using purified BamD, that this was not seen with in vivo cross-linking. Instead, in the context of the BAM complex, position 114 of BamD binds to the BamC subunit and would not be available for substrate binding in vivo (Bakelar et al., 2016; Gu et al., 2016; Iadanza et al., 2016).&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The study in Figure 6 focuses on defined regions within the OmpC sequence, but a more broad range is necessary to demonstrate specificity to these regions vs binding to other regions of the sequence as well. If the authors wish to demonstrate a specific interaction to this motif, they need to show no binding to other regions.</p></disp-quote><p>The region of affinity for the BAM complex was determined by peptidomimetic analysis, and the signal region was further identified by mutational analysis of OmpC. Subsequently, the subunit that recognizes the signal region was identified as BamD. In other words, in the process leading up to Fig. 6, we were able to analyze in detail that other regions were not the target of the study. We have revised the text to make clear that we focus on the signal region including the internal signal, and have not also analyzed other parts of the signal region:</p><p>(Lines 329-332) &quot;As our peptidomimetic screen identified conserved features in the internal signal, and cross-linking highlighted the N-terminal and C-terminal TPR motifs of BamD as regions of interaction with OmpC, we focused on amino acids specifically within the β-signals of OmpC and regions of BamD which interact with β-signal.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The levels of the crosslinks are barely detectable via western blot analysis. If the interactions between the two surfaces are required, why are the levels for most of the blots so low?</p></disp-quote><p>These are western blots of cross-linked products – the efficiency of cross-linking is far less than 100% of the interacting protein species present in a binding assay and this explains why the levels for the blots are ‘so low’. We have added a sentence to the revised manuscript to make this clear for readers who are not molecular biologists:</p><p>(Lines 345-348) &quot;These western blots reveal cross-linked products representing the interacting protein species. Photo cross-linking of unnatural amino acid is not a 100% efficient process, so the level of cross-linked products is only a small proportion of the molecules interacting in the assays.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.</p><p>• Figure 7 indicates that two regions of BamD promote OMP orientation and assembly, however, none of the experiments appears to measure OMP orientation?</p><p>• Also, one common observation from panel F was that not only was the trimer reduced, but also the monomer. But even then, still a percentage of the trimer is formed, not a complete loss.</p></disp-quote><p>(i) We appreciate this point and have revised the title of Figure 7 to be:</p><p>(Lines 1137-1138) &quot;Key residues in two structurally distinct regions of BamD promote β-strand formation and OMP assembly.&quot;</p><p>(ii) In our description of Fig. 7F (Lines 356-360) we do not distinguish between the amount of monomer and trimer forms, since both are reflective of the overall assembly rate i.e. assembly efficiency. Rather, we state that:</p><p>&quot;The EMM assembly assay showed that the internal signal binding site was as important as the β-signal binding site to the overall assembly rates observed for OmpC (Fig. 7F), OmpF (fig. S15D), and LamB (fig. S15E). These results suggest that recognition of both the C-terminal β-signal and the internal signal by BamD is important for efficient protein assembly.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.</p><p>• The experiment in Fig 7B would be more conclusive if it was repeated with both the Y62A and R197A mutants and a double mutant. These controls would also help resolve any effect from crowding that may also promote the crosslinks.</p><p>• Further, the mutation of R197 is an odd choice given that this residue has been studied previously and was found to mediate a salt bridge with BamA. How was this resolved by the authors in choosing this site since it was not one of the original crosslinking sites?</p></disp-quote><p>As stated in the text, the purpose of the experiment in Figure 7B is to measure the impact of pre-forming a β-strand in the substrate (OmpC) before providing it to the receptor (BamD). We thank the reviewer for the comment on the R197 position of BamD. The C-terminal domain of BamD has been suggested to mediate the BamA-BamD interface, specifically BamD R197 amino acid creates a salt-bridge with BamA E373 (Ricci et al., 2012). It had been postulated that the formation of this salt-bridge is not strictly structural, with R197 highlighted as a key amino acid in BamD activity and this salt-bridge acts as a “check-point” in BAM complex activity (Ricci et al., 2012, Storek et al., 2023). Our results agree with this, showing that the C-terminus of BamD acts in substrate recognition and alignment of the β-signal (Fig. 6, Fig S12). We show that amino acids in the vicinity of R197 (N196, G200, D204) cross-linked well to substrate and mutations to the β-signal prevent this interaction (Fig S12B, D). For mutational analysis of BamD, we looked then at the conservation of the C-terminus of BamD and determined R197 was the most highly conserved amino acid (Fig 6C). In order to account for this, we have adjusted the manuscript:</p><p>(Lines 376-377) &quot;R197 has previously been isolated as a suppressor mutation of a BamA temperature sensitive strain (Ricci et al., 2012).&quot;</p><p>(Lines 495-496) &quot;This adds an additional role of the C-terminus of BamD beyond a complex stability role (Ricci et al., 2012; Storek et al., 2023).&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. As demonstrated by the authors in Fig 8, the mutations in BamD lead to reduction in OMP levels for more than just OmpC and issues with the membrane are clearly observable with Y62A, although not with R197A in the presence of VCN. The authors should also test with rifampicin which is smaller and would monitor even more subtle issues with the membrane. Oddly, no growth was observed for the Vec control in the lower concentration of VCN, but was near WT levels for 3 times VCN, how is this explained?</p></disp-quote><p>While it would be interesting to correlate the extent of differences to the molecular size of different antibiotics such as rifampicin, such correlations are not the intended aim of our study.

While Fig 8I indeed shows diminished levels for FY as stated, little difference was observed for the trimer for the other mutants compared to WT, although differences were observed for the dimer. Interestingly, the VY mutant has nearly WT levels of dimer. What do the authors postulate is going on here with the dimer to trimer transition? How do the levels of monomer compare, which is not shown?</p></disp-quote><p>The BN-PAGE gel system cannot resolve protein species that migrate below ~50kDa and the monomer species of the OMPs is below this size. We can’t comment on effects on the monomer because it is not visualized. The non-cropped gel image is shown here. Recently, Hussain et al., has shown that in vitro proteo-liposome system OmpC assembly progresses from a “short-lived dimeric” form before the final process of trimerization (Hussain et al., 2021). However, their findings suggest that LPS plays the final role in stimulation of dimer-to-trimer, a step well past the recognition step of the β-signals. Mutations to the internal signal of OmpC results in the formation of an intermediate, the substrate stalled on the BAM complex. This stalling, presumably, causes a hinderance to the BAM complex resulting in reduced timer and loss of dimer OmpF signal in the EMM of cells expressing OmpC double mutant strain, FY. cannot resolve protein species that migrate below ~50kDa and the monomer species of the OMPs is below this size.

The first point is that the region (formed by BamD engaged with POTRA domains 1-2 and 5 of BamA) is not sufficient to accommodate five β-strands. Structural analysis reveals that the interaction between the N-terminal side of BamD and POTRA1-2 is substantially changed the conformation by substrate binding, and that this surface is greatly extended. This surface does have enough space to accommodate five beta-strands, as now documented in Fig. 9D, 9E using the latest structures (7TT5 and 7TT2) as illustrations of this. The text now reads:</p><p>(Lines 506-515) &quot;Spatially, this indicates the BamD can serve to organize two distinct parts of the nascent OMP substrate at the periplasmic face of the BAM complex, either prior to or in concert with, engagement to the lateral gate of BamA. Assessing this structurally showed the N-terminal region of BamD (interacting with the POTRA1-2 region of BamA) and the C-terminal region of BamD (interacting with POTRA5 proximal to the lateral gate of BamA) (Bakelar et al., 2016; Gu et al., 2016; Tomasek et al., 2020) has the N-terminal region of BamD changing conformation depending on the folding states of the last four β-strands of the substrate OMP, EspP (Doyle et al., 2022). The overall effect of this being a change in the dimensions of this cavity change, a change which is dependent on the folded state of the substrate engaged in it (Fig 9 B-E).&quot;</p><p>ii. The second point raised regards the orientation of the substrate recognition residues of BamD. Both Y62A and R197 were located on the lumen side of the funnel in the EspP-BAM transport intermediate structure (PDBID;7TTC); Y62A is relatively located on the edge of BamD, but given that POTRA1-2 undergoes a conformational change and opens this region, as described above, both are located in locations where they could bind to substrates. This was explained in the following text in the results section of revised manuscript.</p><p>(Lines 377-379) &quot;Each residue was located on the lumen side of the funnel-like structure in the EspP-BAM assembly intermediate structure (PDBID; 7TTC) (Doyle et al., 2022).&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>**Reviewer #2 (Public Review):&quot;</p><p>Previously, using bioinformatics study, authors have identified potential sequence motifs that are common to a large subset of beta-barrel outer membrane proteins in gram negative bacteria.

Of these, peptide 23 corresponds to the canonical β-signal of OMPs: it is the final β-strand of OmpC and it contains the consensus motif of the β-signal (ζxGxx[Ω/Φ]x[Ω/Φ]). The inhibition seen with peptide 23 indicated that our peptidomimetics screening system using EspP can detect signals recognized by the BAM complex. In addition to inhibiting EspP assembly, five of the most potent peptides (4, 17, 18, 21, and 23) inhibited additional model OMPs; the porins OmpC and OmpF, the peptidoglycan-binding OmpA, and the maltoporin LamB (fig.
