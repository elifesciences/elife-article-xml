Histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) methylation is a chromatin modification associated with repressed facultative heterochromatin, but the mechanism of this repression remains unclear. We used a forward genetic approach to identify genes involved in transcriptional silencing of H3K27-methylated chromatin in the filamentous fungus <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic>. We found that the <italic>N. crassa</italic> homologs of ISWI (NCU03875) and ACF1 (NCU00164) are required for repression of a subset of H3K27-methylated genes and that they form an ACF chromatin-remodeling complex. This ACF complex interacts with chromatin throughout the genome, yet association with facultative heterochromatin is specifically promoted by the H3K27 methyltransferase, SET-7. H3K27-methylated genes that are upregulated when <italic>iswi</italic> or <italic>acf1</italic> are deleted show a downstream shift of the +1 nucleosome, suggesting that proper nucleosome positioning is critical for repression of facultative heterochromatin. Our findings support a direct role of the ACF complex in Polycomb repression.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>All the cells in an organism contain the exact same DNA, yet each type of cell performs a different role. They achieve this by turning specific genes on or off. To do this, cells wind their genetic code into structures called nucleosomes, which work a bit like spools of thread. Chemical modifications on these nucleosomes can determine whether a cell will use the genes spooled around it or not.</p><p>In many organisms, cells can turn genes off using a modification called H3K27 methylation. This mark attracts a protein complex called PRC1 that packs the genes away, making them inaccessible to the proteins that would activate them. But the filamentous fungus <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> does not produce PRC1. This suggests that this organism must keep genes with the H3K27 mark switched off in a different way. One possibility is that H3K27 methylation somehow leads to changes in the position of nucleosomes on the genome, since having nucleosomes near the beginning of gene sequences can stop the cell from reading the code.</p><p>One protein complex responsible for positioning nucleosomes is known as the ATP-utilizing chromatin assembly and remodeling factor (ACF) complex, but it remained unknown whether it interacted with H3K27 methylation marks. To investigate further, Wiles et al. generated strains of <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> that did not synthesize ACF and discovered that many of their genes, including ones marked with H3K27, were turned on. This was probably because the nucleosomes had shifted out of position, allowing the proteins responsible for activating the genes to gain access to the start of the genes’ sequences.</p><p>Turning genes on and off at the right time is crucial for development, cell survival, and is key in tissues and organs working properly. Understanding the role of ACF adds to what we know about this complex process, which is involved in many diseases, including cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ISWI</kwd><kwd>H3K27 methylation</kwd><kwd>facultative heterochromatin</kwd><kwd>PRC2</kwd><kwd>chromatin remodeler</kwd><kwd>nucleosome positioning</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>N. crassa</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM127142</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Selker</surname><given-names>Eric U</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM093061</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Selker</surname><given-names>Eric U</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>14POST20450071</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wiles</surname><given-names>Elizabeth T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HD007348</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McNaught</surname><given-names>Kevin J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The ACF chromatin-remodeling complex positions the +1 nucleosome in facultative heterochromatin to mediate transcriptional repression at Polycomb target genes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) methylates lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27), marking facultative heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Müller et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Margueron and Reinberg, 2011</xref>). Facultative heterochromatin contains regions of the genome that must remain transcriptionally plastic in order to respond to developmental or environmental cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wiles and Selker, 2017</xref>). Although H3K27 methylation has been established as a repressive chromatin modification, the mechanisms of repression are not fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Margueron and Reinberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ridenour et al., 2020</xref>). One model for repression involves PRC1 binding to the H3K27 methyl-mark to facilitate chromatin compaction by self-association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grau et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheutin and Cavalli, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyle et al., 2020</xref>). However, PRC1 is not present in all eukaryotes that bear H3K27 methylation-associated silencing, such as the filamentous fungus <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jamieson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schuettengruber et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wiles et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting the existence of additional mechanisms of H3K27 methylation-associated repression.</p><p>In addition to histone modifications, nucleosome positioning may be critical for facultative heterochromatin function. The nucleosome, which is the fundamental unit of chromatin, consists of approximately 147 base pairs of DNA wrapped around an octamer of histone proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kornberg, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Luger et al., 1997</xref>). Nucleosomes can be precisely positioned on DNA by ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling proteins to produce a chromatin landscape that modulates accessibility for DNA transactions, such as transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lai and Pugh, 2017</xref>). In particular, the precise positioning of the +1 nucleosome, the first nucleosome downstream of the transcription start site (TSS), is thought to be an important determinant of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rhee and Pugh, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nocetti and Whitehouse, 2016</xref>). This dynamic nucleosome can occlude binding elements for transcriptional regulatory sites such as the TATA box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kubik et al., 2018</xref>) and can serve as a barrier to RNA polymerase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weber et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, the <underline>A</underline>TP-utilizing <underline>c</underline>hromatin assembly and remodeling <underline>f</underline>actor (ACF) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ito et al., 1997</xref>) has been indirectly linked to the repression of Polycomb targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fyodorov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Scacchetti et al., 2018</xref>). The ACF complex is composed of the ATPase, Imitation Switch (ISWI), and the accessory subunit ACF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ito et al., 1999</xref>). ACF is thought to act as a global nucleosome spacer and to contribute to repression genome-wide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baldi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Scacchetti et al., 2018</xref>). Mutations in <italic>Acf1</italic> act as enhancers of <italic>Polycomb</italic> mutations and disrupt nucleosome spacing in facultative heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fyodorov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Scacchetti et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In order to improve our understanding of the control and function of facultative heterochromatin, we used forward genetics to identify factors required for silencing H3K27-methylated genes in <italic>N. crassa</italic>. As described here, this identified <italic>iswi</italic> (also known as <italic>crf4-1</italic>) and <italic>acf1</italic> (also known as <italic>crf4-2; Itc1</italic> in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>). We show that these proteins interact to form an ACF complex in <italic>N. crassa</italic>, that ACF is necessary for repression of a subset of H3K27-methylated genes, and that derepression is not simply due to loss of H3K27 methylation. ACF interacts with chromatin targets throughout the genome, yet specific interactions with H3K27-methylated regions are partly dependent on SET-7, the H3K27 methyltransferase. Finally, we show that when members of ACF are absent, H3K27-methylated genes that become upregulated display a specific downstream shift of the +1 nucleosome. Our findings support a model in which ACF remodels the chromatin landscape at H3K27-methylated regions of the genome to contribute to Polycomb silencing.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Forward genetic selection for genes required for Polycomb silencing identifies <italic>iswi</italic> and <italic>acf1</italic></title><p>We previously designed and employed a forward genetic selection to identify novel genes required for silencing of H3K27-methylated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McNaught et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wiles et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, the open reading frames of two genes (<italic>NCU05173</italic> and <italic>NCU07152</italic>) that require the H3K27 methyltransferase (SET-7) for repression were replaced with the hygromycin (<italic>hph</italic>) and nourseothricin (<italic>nat-1</italic>) resistance genes, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The resulting strain, which was sensitive to both antibiotics, was subjected to UV mutagenesis and grown on hygromycin- and nourseothricin-containing medium to select for drug-resistant colonies. As a step to identify mutations causing drug resistance, these strains, which were in an Oak Ridge genetic background, were crossed to the polymorphic Mauriceville strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Metzenberg et al., 1985</xref>). Spores from these crosses were germinated on hygromycin- and/or nourseothricin-containing media to select for the mutant segregants, and genomic DNA from the progeny was pooled for whole-genome sequencing. Critical mutations were mapped by examining the ratio of Oak Ridge to Mauriceville single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genome-wide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pomraning et al., 2011</xref>).

These proteins were purified by immunoprecipitation and subjected to MS to identify interacting partners. Interactions between ISWI and all four proteins were confirmed, with each HA-tagged protein pull-down yielding high unique peptide counts for ISWI. Additional interactions, with lower unique peptide counts, and typically lack of reciprocal pull-downs, were also found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These data suggest that ISWI forms multiple distinct protein complexes and, importantly, that ISWI and ACF1, two proteins identified in our selection for factors involved in the repression of H3K27-methylated genes, interact. The ACF1-HA pull-down identified two histone fold proteins, NCU03073 (HFP-1) and NCU06623 (HFP-2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borkovich et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kamei et al., 2021</xref>), as interacting partners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Considering that our data support a functional role in transcriptional repression at H3K27-methylated genes, we restricted our analysis to these regions (H3K27-methylated SD genes; n=358).

Although much has been learned, the importance of Polycomb repression in the development of multicellular organisms has stymied progress toward a full understanding of its control and function. Moreover, there are indications of variable underlying mechanisms. For example, the PRC1 complex, which is widely regarded as central to Polycomb function in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and higher organisms, is less conserved than PRC2, and at least in some organisms, is absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schuettengruber et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, Polycomb response elements (PREs), cis-acting DNA sequences controlling the distribution of H3K27 methylation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, do not appear to be universal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kassis and Brown, 2013</xref>). The complexity and importance of the Polycomb system in multicellular organisms led us to dissect the control and function of H3K27 methylation in the filamentous fungus <italic>N. crassa</italic>. We defined the PRC2 complex of Neurospora, demonstrated that it methylates H3K27 in roughly 7% of the genome, and is necessary for repression of scores of genes even though it is not essential in this organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jamieson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McNaught et al., 2020</xref>). Utilization of special genetic resources for Neurospora revealed that the organism has at least two distinct forms of H3K27 methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jamieson et al., 2018</xref>), namely: 1. position-dependent, associated with telomere regions and characterized by involvement of the Neurospora p55 homolog (NPF) and the PRC2 accessory subunit (PAS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McNaught et al., 2020</xref>), and 2. position-independent, which is found interstitially and does not depend on NPF or PAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jamieson et al., 2018</xref>). We have also previously shown that ASH1, an H3K36 methyltransferase, is critical for maintaining repression of many genes, including most of those in facultative heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bicocca et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The nonessential nature of H3K27 methylation, and the convenience of Neurospora for genetics and biochemistry, allowed us to design and implement a powerful selection for mutants defective in silencing genes in facultative heterochromatin. This unbiased scheme revealed both expected factors required for repression, including members of the PRC2 complex, and unanticipated players such as EPR-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wiles et al., 2020</xref>) and the ACF complex reported here. A particularly interesting general finding is that repression is not simply due to a linear pathway of factors. While some factors cooperate to maintain repression, results of mRNA-seq revealed considerable variation in the spheres of influence of the various factors. For example, loss of the H3K27 methyl-mark itself, or of the apparent H3K27 methyl-reader, EPR-1, each lead to derepression of somewhat different subsets of H3K27-methylated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wiles et al., 2020</xref>), while loss of elements of the ACF remodeling machine leads to loss of silencing of a larger set of H3K27 methyl-marked genes, even without loss of this characteristic mark of facultative heterochromatin.

In this model, the ACF complex transiently interacts with chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gelbart et al., 2005</xref>) throughout the nucleus in an autoinhibited conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clapier and Cairns, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ludwigsen et al., 2017</xref>) until some, still undefined, feature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clapier and Cairns, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hwang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ludwigsen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donovan et al., 2021</xref>) releases the autoinhibition and allows it to engage, activate, and move nucleosomes by hydrolyzing ATP. Our results suggest that ACF localizes broadly throughout the genome but has specific activity at H3K27-methylated regions, raising the possibility that a feature of facultative heterochromatin influences ACF activity. The transient nature of this chromatin interaction could account for our inability to confirm our ACF1 DamID findings with ChIP. Attempts to identify the targets of the homologous complex by ChIP have been also unsuccessful in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Scacchetti et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The <italic>N. crassa</italic> ACF complex positions the +1 nucleosome in promoters of H3K27-methylated genes to mediate transcriptional repression</title><p>In theory, nucleosome movement could be either a cause or consequence of transcriptional activation. Our finding that H3K27-methylated genes did not show changes in the position of the +1 nucleosome when they are derepressed by deletion of <italic>set-7</italic> suggests that changes in nucleosome position are not simply due to transcriptional activation. Moreover, the fact that genes that are upregulated outside of facultative heterochromatin domains in strains with deletions of <italic>iswi</italic> or <italic>acf1</italic> do not display a nucleosome shift suggests that ACF acts directly and has some specificity for H3K27-methylated regions. These findings support the idea that transcriptional derepression of H3K27-methylated genes in ∆<italic>iswi</italic> and ∆<italic>acf1</italic> strains is a consequence of a misplaced +1 nucleosome. It is noteworthy that while Isw2-mediated repression is thought to occur by the placement of the +1 nucleosome over important DNA regulatory elements, occluding transcriptional machinery and/or general regulatory factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Whitehouse et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yen et al., 2012</xref>), full repression at some targets, such as the early meiotic genes, also requires histone deacetylase activity from Rpd3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goldmark et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fazzio et al., 2001</xref>). Clearly, the mechanism of repression by ACF, including the identification of additional players, perhaps including transcription factors, histone deacetylases, and other chromatin modifying factors, deserves further study.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Despite differences in the modes of action of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Isw2 and <italic>Drosophila</italic> ACF, their biological outcomes are the same—transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goldmark et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fyodorov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ocampo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Scacchetti et al., 2018</xref>). We found that nucleosome positioning by the <italic>N. crassa</italic> ACF complex also leads to transcriptional repression, particularly at H3K27-methylated regions of the genome, establishing the ACF complex as a player in transcriptional repression characteristic of facultative heterochromatin. It will be valuable to determine if interplay between Polycomb-mediated repression and ISWI chromatin remodelers holds in other organisms. Interestingly, ACF has been indirectly linked to Polycomb repression in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Scacchetti et al., 2018</xref>), and notably, ISWI components were identified in a screen for factors required for Polycomb repression in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nishioka et al., 2018</xref>), raising the possibility that the role of the ACF complex in Neurospora is general.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Jerry L Workman as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor.</p><p>The three reviewers discussed the manuscript in depth. The reviewers all felt that the manuscript is interesting and contains novel findings. Other aspects of the manuscript seemed somewhat underdeveloped and needed additional experimentation. In particular, the reviewers wanted to see the effect of the mutants on H3K36 methylation, more evidence that nucleosome repositioning was responsible for derepression and the dependence of nucleosome positioning by ISWI on H3K27 methylation. As it is anticipated that these experiments will require more time than allowed per <italic>eLife</italic> policy for revision, we will not further consider this version of the manuscript, but we would be to consider a new version if the reviewers' comments can be addressed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Polycomb repression of heterochromatic genes differs in different organisms but has been most widely studied in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.

Please clarify.</p><p>2. A table presenting at least the relative parts of the mass spec data needs to be included in the manuscript so the readers can judge the spectrum counts relevance.</p><p>3.

The authors should limit their conclusions about Iswi protein complexes etc. Without more biochemistry we don't know how many complexes there are, and which components are in each. This would require co-fractionation experiments and probably more purifications. The authors can conclude that the interactions they detect by ms are consistent with iswi being in multiple complexes similar to that described in other organisms.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this paper Wiles et al. show that mutations in the iswi and acf genes, which encode components of a nucleosome remodeling complex, lead to expression of a subset of H3K27me-repressed genes. The strengths of the paper include the detailed genomic analysis supporting the statements that Iswi and Acf regulate a subset of H3K27me3-repressed genes. Data showing that the +1 nucleosome shifts 50bp in H3K27me-genes upregulated in the iswi mutant is also very strong. There is strong data documenting the proteins that Iswi interacts with in <italic>N. crassa</italic>. The data showing the nucleosome shift in the acf mutant is not as strong. The summary figure is highly speculative because there is no data for discrete localization of Acf. Another piece of data that is lacking is what happens to H3K36me in iswi and acf mutants. Knowing this is important because a similar set of genes seem to be derepressed in an ash1 mutant as in the acf and iswi mutants, although the level of depression in ash1 is not as great as in iswi mutants. The summary diagram shows loss of H3K36me as a separate mechanism than loss of the ACF complex. We don't know that since there was no analysis of H3K36me in iswi or acf mutants. Still, the major findings of the paper are important.</p><p>1) The paper would be strengthened by an examination of H3K36me in an iswi mutant.</p><p>2) Please comment more extensively on why the iswi mutant phenotype is so much stronger than the acf phenotype.</p><p>3) How do you think Acf gets localized to H3K27me domains?</p><p>4) In Figure 4 you show by qPCR that H3K27me is still present at the two genes used in the initial mutant screen. Please show additional examples of the H3K27me levels on other upregulated genes in the iswi and acf mutants. Are the H3K27me levels altered in any of these genes, or did I miss this?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This manuscript clearly shows that, in Neurospora, ACF chromatin remodeler represses some of H3K27-methylated genes in an H3K27me-dependent fashion. This is the first report to demonstrate ISWI class remodeler functions through H3K27me. The main weakness of the manuscript is the modest impact on mechanistic understanding of how ACF or H3K27me functions. Also, the authors' model needs additional support to firmly establish the causality between ACF-dependent nucleosome repositioning and transcriptional repression.</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors showed that the ACF chromatin remodeler in <italic>N. crassa</italic> is required for repression of H3K27-methylated genes. The authors further demonstrated that ACF is targeted to these genes through H3K27me, and proposed a model in which ACF-dependent nucleosome repositioning around TSSs causes transcriptional repression. Molecular mechanisms underlying transcriptional repression at facultative heterochromatin is an important topic, and the authors provided convincing data that ACF plays critical roles through H3K27me, which has not been directly demonstrated for any ISWI class remodelers. On the other hand, this manuscript does not provide much advancement on molecular mechanism. Even if the authors' model that ACF-dependent nucleosome repositioning causes transcriptional repression is correct (see below), that mechanism has been described in budding yeast. Therefore, the mechanistic novelty is the H3K27-dependent ACF targeting.</p><p>Another issue in the authors' model that ACF-dependent nucleosome repositioning is the cause of transcriptional derepression. As far as I can tell, the data are also equally consistent with the possibility that ACF loss causes transcriptional derepression through other means, and the nucleosomes around TSSs reposition as a result of transcriptional derepression. The authors need to establish the causality more firmly. For example, are there loci where ACF repositions nucleosomes around TSSs similarly to other targets, but transcription is not derepressed upon ACF mutations? If there are many genes that fall into category, that would be consistent with the authors' model. On the other hand, if the authors look at genes that are not direct ACF targets but are derepressed similarly to ACF targets upon ACF mutations, do they see nucleosome repositioning similar to ACF targets? If not, that would argue transcriptional derepression is not sufficient to reposition nucleosomes around TSSs, supporting the authors' model.</p><p>1. Line 122: What is an &quot;early condition phenotype&quot;?</p><p>2. Lines 233-238: What is the conclusion drawn from this data?</p><p>3. Figure 2: It is interesting that transcriptional de-repression is much more robust in iswi mutant than acf1. Given that ISWI purification did not yield other form of ISWI complexes, this is not because of other forms of ISWI-containing remodelers (CHRAC also depends on ACF1). So, another possibility is that, in an iswi mutant, ACF1 functions in a dominant negative fashion to derepress genes further. If this is the case, iswi acf1 double mutants should behave like an acf1 single mutant. The authors should test this for a few targets genes to establish how ACF functions.</p><p>4. Figure 2S1: ~1/3 of genes repressed by Set7 are not repressed by ACF. Do these genes have any special features?</p><p>5. Do ACF signals by Dam-ID mapping show something specific at H3K27me genes that are derepressed and/or show changes in nucleosome positioning? If the authors can show specific localization at these genes, it would help support the model that the transcriptional effects mediated by ACF are direct.</p><p>6. ISWI regulates only a small subset of H3K27me genes (98 of 836). Are there unique properties of these genes that may contribute to our understanding of their mechanism of derepression? For example, are they regulated by a common transcription factor? Are their nucleosome positions in WT different from H3K27me genes not regulated by ISWI?</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The ACF chromatin remodeling complex is essential for Polycomb repression&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Jerry L Workman as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jerry L Workman (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this re-submitted manuscript, the authors addressed issues raised by the reviewers. As a result, this manuscript was substantially strengthened. The main conclusions from Figures1 through 3 are consistent with those of Kamei et al. (2021). However, this manuscript provides strong evidence that ACF directly functions to promote Polycomb-dependent repression through chromatin remodeling, which has not been demonstrated. In addition, PRC2/H3K27me-dependent ACF targeting is novel. Finally, the authors' model that facultative chromatin can be classified into several groups based on their dependence on SET7, ASH1, and ACF (Figure 6) is potentially important for guiding future research directions of the field.</p><p>The data that the effect of ACF on the position of +1 nucleosomes is distinct between H3K27me positive vs negative loci (Figure 5, Figure 5 Supplemental 2) is quite interesting. Is the degree of targeting of ACF and its effect on transcription similar between H3K27me positive and negative genes? If so, this result suggests currently unknown effects of H3K27me on ACF activity. In this case, Figure 5 Supplemental 2 should be move to the main Figure and the result deserves more extensive discussions as this would increase the impact of the manuscript. On the other hand, if the degree of ACF targeting and/or the level of transcription can explain the difference in the +1 nucleosome position, it needs to be stated in the text.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77595.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

We found that there was no observable shift in the +1 nucleosome at these genes.

To clarify, we have added the following sentences to the discussion.</p><p>“We found that nearly all H3K27 methylated genes that are upregulated in ∆acf1 also showed increased expression in ∆iswi, whereas ∆iswi had several uniquely upregulated genes. This is consistent with a model in which ACF1 is required for targeting ACF to chromatin targets but requires ISWI to catalyze nucleosome movement and allow for increased transcription. ISWI is also part of other protein complexes which may lead to direct or indirect upregulation of distinct genes.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) How do you think Acf gets localized to H3K27me domains?</p></disp-quote><p>ACF may interact with transcription factors to target H3K27me domains. Targeting of ACF by transcription factors been demonstrated in budding yeast (although not H3K27me targeting as this mark is absent in yeast) and is discussed in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In Figure 4 you show by qPCR that H3K27me is still present at the two genes used in the initial mutant screen. Please show additional examples of the H3K27me levels on other upregulated genes in the iswi and acf mutants. Are the H3K27me levels altered in any of these genes, or did I miss this?</p></disp-quote><p>We used the RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data to address this question and added two new figure panels (Figure 3E,F) showing a scatter plot of the correlation between gene expression changes and changes in H3K27me2/3 level at all H3K27me2/3-marked genes. We found a substantial portion of genes that are upregulated in ∆iswi and ∆acf1 do not show significant loss of H3K27me2/3. We also added expression data for ∆iswi with corresponding ChIP-seq tracks in Figure 3K.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This manuscript clearly shows that, in Neurospora, ACF chromatin remodeler represses some of H3K27-methylated genes in an H3K27me-dependent fashion. This is the first report to demonstrate ISWI class remodeler functions through H3K27me. The main weakness of the manuscript is the modest impact on mechanistic understanding of how ACF or H3K27me functions. Also, the authors' model needs additional support to firmly establish the causality between ACF-dependent nucleosome repositioning and transcriptional repression.</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors showed that the ACF chromatin remodeler in <italic>N. crassa</italic> is required for repression of H3K27-methylated genes. The authors further demonstrated that ACF is targeted to these genes through H3K27me, and proposed a model in which ACF-dependent nucleosome repositioning around TSSs causes transcriptional repression. Molecular mechanisms underlying transcriptional repression at facultative heterochromatin is an important topic, and the authors provided convincing data that ACF plays critical roles through H3K27me, which has not been directly demonstrated for any ISWI class remodelers. On the other hand, this manuscript does not provide much advancement on molecular mechanism. Even if the authors' model that ACF-dependent nucleosome repositioning causes transcriptional repression is correct (see below), that mechanism has been described in budding yeast. Therefore, the mechanistic novelty is the H3K27-dependent ACF targeting.</p><p>Another issue in the authors' model that ACF-dependent nucleosome repositioning is the cause of transcriptional derepression. As far as I can tell, the data are also equally consistent with the possibility that ACF loss causes transcriptional derepression through other means, and the nucleosomes around TSSs reposition as a result of transcriptional derepression. The authors need to establish the causality more firmly. For example, are there loci where ACF repositions nucleosomes around TSSs similarly to other targets, but transcription is not derepressed upon ACF mutations? If there are many genes that fall into category, that would be consistent with the authors' model. On the other hand, if the authors look at genes that are not direct ACF targets but are derepressed similarly to ACF targets upon ACF mutations, do they see nucleosome repositioning similar to ACF targets? If not, that would argue transcriptional derepression is not sufficient to reposition nucleosomes around TSSs, supporting the authors' model.</p></disp-quote><p>We feel that our finding that H3K27-methylated genes that are upregulated when the H3K27 methyltransferase set-7 is deleted do not have a nucleosome shift suggest that transcriptional upregulation in regions of facultative heterochromatin is not sufficient to result in the +1 nucleosome shift (we have moved this figure panel from the supplementary figures to the main figures – Figure 5M). We have also added new data (Figure 5 —figure supplement 2C,D) showing that non-H3K27 methylated genes that are upregulated in ∆iswi and ∆acf1 do not have a nucleosome shift, again suggesting that transcriptional upregulation is not sufficient to induce a nucleosome shift. These data are consistent with the reviewer’s second scenario (above) where non-H3K27me upregulated genes (and presumably indirect targets) show increased transcription without the +1 nucleosome shift.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Line 122: What is an &quot;early condition phenotype&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>We’ve modified the sentence to clarify, as follows.</p><p>“We noticed that disruption of these two genes resulted in an early conidiation (production of asexual spores) phenotype that appeared as more dense growth in the spot tests (Figure 1C,D) but this was not accompanied by an increased linear growth rate.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Lines 233-238: What is the conclusion drawn from this data?</p></disp-quote><p>We removed the original Figure 4F,G showing the position of H3K27me2/3 gains and losses in ∆iswi and ∆acf1 relative to the telomere as we felt these observations were tangential. The new Figure 3 now shows more relevant information regarding changes in H3K27me2/3 and changes in gene expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 2: It is interesting that transcriptional de-repression is much more robust in iswi mutant than acf1. Given that ISWI purification did not yield other form of ISWI complexes, this is not because of other forms of ISWI-containing remodelers (CHRAC also depends on ACF1). So, another possibility is that, in an iswi mutant, ACF1 functions in a dominant negative fashion to derepress genes further. If this is the case, iswi acf1 double mutants should behave like an acf1 single mutant. The authors should test this for a few targets genes to establish how ACF functions.</p></disp-quote><p>While we are unable to make firm conclusions about ISWI-containing complexes with our mass spec data, we do feel they are consistent with ISWI forming multiple protein complexes, as it does in other organisms (see reviewer 1, comment 4). Therefore the most parsimonious explanation for the more robust transcriptional derepression in ∆iswi is because it is a member of multiple protein complexes. However, we do agree that it is interesting that genes that are upregulated in both iswi and acf1 are much more highly expressed when iswi is deleted. We tested the reviewer’s hypothesis by doing RT-qPCR on three genes that were more robustly upregulated in ∆iswi than ∆acf1 based on mRNAseq (NCU07152, NCU08796, NCU04860) in WT, ∆iswi, ∆acf1 and ∆iswi;∆acf1 double mutant strains. We found that gene expression in the double mutant was robust, similar to the ∆iswi single mutant strain, thus ruling out the dominant negative hypothesis. Because this yielded a negative result we did not include it in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 2S1: ~1/3 of genes repressed by Set7 are not repressed by ACF. Do these genes have any special features?</p></disp-quote><p>We performed a transcription factor binding site motif analysis (+1 nucleosome +/- 50 bp) using HOMER in the subset of genes that are uniquely upregulated in ∆set-7 (n=23), but the program did not return any motifs predicted to be true positive binding sites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Do ACF signals by Dam-ID mapping show something specific at H3K27me genes that are derepressed and/or show changes in nucleosome positioning? If the authors can show specific localization at these genes, it would help support the model that the transcriptional effects mediated by ACF are direct.</p></disp-quote><p>While we are able to detect a significant decrease in the ACF1 DamID signal in ∆set-7 at H3K27 methylated regions compared to non-H3K27 methylated regions of the genome, we are unable to detect a further significant decrease at the subset of H3K27 methylated genes that increase expression and have a nucleosome shift in ∆acf1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. ISWI regulates only a small subset of H3K27me genes (98 of 836). Are there unique properties of these genes that may contribute to our understanding of their mechanism of derepression? For example, are they regulated by a common transcription factor? Are their nucleosome positions in WT different from H3K27me genes not regulated by ISWI?</p></disp-quote><p>As illustrated in Figure 2 H, iswi regulates 180 (98+82) of H3K27-methylated genes. This is even more than the number that are derepressed by loss of the methyl mark itself (the set-7 mutant causes de-repression of 63 genes) and it is important to consider that some H3K27me-marked predicted genes may be “pseudogenes” or else regulated by unknown processes. We attempted to identify a transcription factor that worked with ACF by looking for a binding motif surrounding the +1 nucleosome (+1 nucleosome +/- 50 bp) in the subset of genes that were upregulated and showed a nucleosome shift in ∆iswi (n=93) and ∆acf1 (n=61). No motif was found to be enriched in these regions. By comparing the WT nucleosome positions in genes that are H3K27 methylated and upregulated in ∆acf1 or ∆iswi (Figure 6I, K) to those that are H3K27 methylated and not upregulated in ∆acf1 and ∆iswi (Figure 6J, L) we do notice some differences. We find that overall nucleosomes tend to be more well positioned (smoother, sharper peaks and valleys) in the genes that are not upregulated in these mutants. We also see a less pronounced NDR in the genes that are not upregulated. While these are interesting observations, it is hard to draw any biological conclusions from these differences.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this re-submitted manuscript, the authors addressed issues raised by the reviewers. As a result, this manuscript was substantially strengthened. The main conclusions from Figures1 through 3 are consistent with those of Kamei et al. (2021). However, this manuscript provides strong evidence that ACF directly functions to promote Polycomb-dependent repression through chromatin remodeling, which has not been demonstrated. In addition, PRC2/H3K27me-dependent ACF targeting is novel. Finally, the authors' model that facultative chromatin can be classified into several groups based on their dependence on SET7, ASH1, and ACF (Figure 6) is potentially important for guiding future research directions of the field.</p><p>The data that the effect of ACF on the position of +1 nucleosomes is distinct between H3K27me positive vs negative loci (Figure 5, Figure 5 Supplemental 2) is quite interesting. Is the degree of targeting of ACF and its effect on transcription similar between H3K27me positive and negative genes? If so, this result suggests currently unknown effects of H3K27me on ACF activity. In this case, Figure 5 Supplemental 2 should be move to the main Figure and the result deserves more extensive discussions as this would increase the impact of the manuscript. On the other hand, if the degree of ACF targeting and/or the level of transcription can explain the difference in the +1 nucleosome position, it needs to be stated in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed further analyses to address the question of whether ACF targeting or level of transcriptional upregulation could explain the difference in ACF activity at genes that are upregulated in <italic>∆acf1</italic> strains with and without H3K27 methylation. We examined the ACF1-DamID signal at the +1 nucleosome (+/- 500bp). Upstream of the +1 nucleosome we found that the level of targeting was similar at genes that were methylated and unmethylated with a slight shift in the peak methylation, while downstream we saw ACF1-Dam targeting was slightly higher in H3K27-methylated regions. These findings were consistent with what we report for all genes (H3K27 methylated <italic>vs.</italic> non-methylated) in Figure 4. The level of transcription (log2FC <italic>∆acf1</italic>/WT) was slightly higher (p=0.041) at H3K27-methylated genes compared to non-methylated genes. We did not find these data convincing enough to warrant inclusion in the manuscript. However, since the difference in ACF activity cannot clearly be ascribed to differences in targeting or transcriptional activity, following your suggestion, we decided to better highlight the data suggesting some specificity for H3K27-methylated regions. Thus, we moved the nucleosome plots showing no shift in non- H3K27 methylated that are upregulated in <italic>∆iswi</italic> and <italic>∆acf1</italic> to the main Figure 5. To make room for this, we relegated two of the three analyses of the accessory factors (<italic>iaf-1</italic> and <italic>iaf-2</italic>) to the supplementary figure (Figure 5 Sup2 panels C&amp;D). We also made a minor change to the conclusion drawn from these data in the Results section and added a sentence regarding this in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
