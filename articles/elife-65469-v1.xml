lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients contributes to remyelination failure. Inflammation activates a cytoprotective pathway, the integrated stress response (ISR), but it remains unclear whether enhancing the ISR can improve remyelination in an inflammatory environment. To examine this possibility, the remyelination stage of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), as well as a mouse model that incorporates cuprizone-induced demyelination along with CNS delivery of the proinflammatory cytokine IFN-γ were used here. We demonstrate that either genetic or pharmacological ISR enhancement significantly increased the number of remyelinating oligodendrocytes and remyelinated axons in the inflammatory lesions. Moreover, the combined treatment of the ISR modulator Sephin1 with the oligodendrocyte differentiation enhancing reagent bazedoxifene increased myelin thickness of remyelinated axons to pre-lesion levels. Taken together, our findings indicate that prolonging the ISR protects remyelinating oligodendrocytes and promotes remyelination in the presence of inflammation, suggesting that ISR enhancement may provide reparative benefit to MS patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>integrated stress response</kwd><kwd>remyelination</kwd><kwd>interferon gamma</kwd><kwd>oligodendrocyte</kwd><kwd>cuprizone</kwd><kwd>multiple sclerosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS034939</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Popko</surname><given-names>Brian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005984</institution-id><institution>Dr. Miriam and Sheldon G.

Although current immunomodulatory therapies can reduce the frequency and severity of relapses, they have demonstrated limited impact on the progression of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dargahi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hauser and Cree, 2020</xref>). Complementary strategies are therefore urgently needed to protect oligodendrocytes and promote repair of the CNS in order to slow or even stop the progression of MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hart and Bainbridge, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rodgers et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Way and Popko, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Remyelination is the process of restoring demyelinated nerve fibers with new myelin, which involves the generation of new mature oligodendrocytes from oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Franklin and Ffrench-Constant, 2008a</xref>). Failure of myelin repair during relapsing-remitting MS leads to chronically demyelinated axons, which is thought to contribute to axonal degeneration and disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Franklin and Kotter, 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fancy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chari, 2007</xref>). The inflammatory environment in MS lesions is considered a major contributor to impaired remyelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Starost et al., 2020</xref>). Strategies to enhance myelin regeneration could preserve axonal integrity and increase clinical function of patients. A number of small molecules have recently been described to promote OPC maturation and/or enhance remyelination, but most of these molecules were identified in in vitro screens under ideal conditions and tested in animal models of non-inflammatory demyelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deshmukh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mei et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rankin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Najm et al., 2015</xref>). Given that remyelination in MS occurs in lesions with ongoing inflammation, a remyelination model with an inflammatory environment would provide a better indication of the potential of remyelinating-promoting compounds for MS treatment.</p><p>The integrated stress response (ISR) plays a key role in the response of oligodendrocytes to CNS inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Way et al., 2015</xref>). The ISR is a cytoprotective pathway that is activated by various cytotoxic insults, including inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Costa-Mattioli and Walter, 2020</xref>). The ISR is initiated by phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor two alpha (p-eIF2α), by one of four known stress-sensing kinases, to diminish global protein translation and selectively allow for the synthesis of protective proteins. p-eIF2α is dephosphorylated by the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1)- DNA-damage inducible 34 (GADD34) complex to terminate the ISR upon stress relief (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang and Kaufman, 2008</xref>). Sephin1, a recently-identified small molecule, disrupts PP1-GADD34 phosphatase activity and prolongs elevated p-eIF2α levels, thereby enhancing the ISR protective response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Das et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carrara et al., 2017</xref>). We previously showed that GADD34 deficiency or Sephin1 treatment protects matures oligodendrocytes, diminishes demyelination, and delays clinical symptoms in a mouse model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). It is not known whether a protracted ISR would protect newly generated remyelinating oligodendrocytes and enhance remyelination in an inflammatory environment.</p><p>Here, we investigated the potential impact of genetic or pharmacological ISR enhancement on remyelinating oligodendrocytes and the remyelination process in the presence of inflammation. In these studies, we used the EAE model, as well as the cuprizone-induced demyelination model on GFAP-tTA;TRE-IFN-γ double-transgenic mice, which ectopically express interferon gamma (IFN-γ) in the CNS in a regulated manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2005</xref>). IFN-γ is a pleotropic T-cell-specific cytokine that stimulates key inflammatory aspects of MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lees and Cross, 2007</xref>). Using these inflammatory demyelination models, we show that prolonging the ISR protects remyelinating oligodendrocytes and increases the level of remyelination. Moreover, we explored the effects of combining Sephin1 treatment with bazedoxifene (BZA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rankin et al., 2019</xref>) on remyelination. BZA has been shown to enhance OPC differentiation and CNS remyelination in response to focal demyelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rankin et al., 2019</xref>). We demonstrate that BZA increases the number of remyelinating oligodendrocytes and enhances remyelination in the presence of inflammation. When combined with Sephin1, BZA further facilitates the remyelinating process.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sephin1 treatment enhances remyelination in late-stage EAE</title><p>To determine whether pharmacological prolongation of the ISR can enhance remyelination after inflammatory demyelination, we first examined C57BL/6J mice in the late stage of EAE. Sephin1 (8 mg/kg) or vehicle treatment was initiated in each EAE mouse on the day it reached the peak of disease (clinical score = 3) and was continued to the late stage of EAE, which resulted in diminished EAE disease severity in the final week of Sephin1 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Spinal cord axons were examined under electron microscope (EM). We sorted remyelinated axons by examining g-ratios (axon diameter / total fiber diameter) in the lumbar spinal cord white matter of EAE mice after vehicle or Sephin1 treatment. The presence of axons with thinner myelin sheaths and a higher g<italic>-</italic>ratio is considered the hallmark of remyelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duncan et al., 2017</xref>). A recent study indicated that axons in the spinal cord with a g-ratio greater than 0.8 are likely remyelinated axons in the EAE model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mei et al., 2016</xref>).

To examine this possibility, we used a more quantitative demyelination/remyelination model (cuprizone model) for further exploration. We have previously shown that in response to IFN-γ, myelinating oligodendrocytes with a <italic>Ppp1r15a (Gadd34)</italic> mutation display increased levels of p-eIF2α, indicating a prolongation of the ISR, and increased oligodendrocyte survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lin et al., 2008</xref>). We hence mated GADD34 KO;GFAP-tTA mice with GADD34 KO;TRE-IFN-γ mice to generate GFAP-tTA;TRE-IFN-γ double-transgenic mice homozygous for the <italic>Ppp1r15a</italic> mutation (GADD34 KO) to prolong the ISR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lin et al., 2008</xref>). GFAP-tTA;TRE-IFN-γ double-transgenic mice allow for ectopic release of IFN-γ in the CNS in a doxycycline (Dox)-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lin et al., 2008</xref>). Expression of the tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA) is driven by the astrocyte-specific transcriptional regulatory region of the <italic>Gfap</italic> gene. In the TRE-IFN-γ mice, the IFN-γ cDNA is transcriptionally controlled by the tetracycline response element (TRE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The expression of the IFN-γ transgene is repressed in the GFAP-tTA;TRE-IFN-γ mice by providing water treated with Dox from conception. At 6 weeks of age, transgenic mice were taken off Dox water to induce CNS expression of IFN-γ (IFN-γ+) and placed on a diet of 0.2% cuprizone chow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2004</xref>). After 5 weeks of cuprizone exposure, mice were placed back on a normal diet for up to 3 weeks to allow remyelination to occur. Control mice received Dox water throughout the study to repress CNS expression of IFN-γ (IFN-γ-) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Mice with the highest level of IFN-γ expression in the CNS were selected by isolating the cerebellum of each mouse and using real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR to determine IFN-γ expression levels. We found that at 5 weeks of cuprizone exposure (W5) and during remyelination (W8), removal of Dox significantly increased the levels of IFN-γ in the cerebellum of mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Schematics of GFAP-tTA;TRE-IFN-γ double-transgenic mouse model of cuprizone demyelination/remyelination.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) GFAP-tTA mice are mated with TRE-IFN-γ mice to produce double-positive animals.

It has been demonstrated that cuprizone-fed mice exhibit apoptotic death of oligodendrocytes and demyelination in the corpus callosum. Complete remyelination spontaneously occurs a few weeks after the cuprizone challenge is terminated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Matsushima and Morell, 2001</xref>). We found no significant difference in the number of cells labeled with the mature oligodendrocyte marker ASPA between GADD34 wildtype (WT) and GADD34 KO, GFAP-tTA;TRE-IFN-γ double-transgenic mice before cuprizone exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). After 5 weeks on cuprizone chow, both GADD34 WT and KO double-transgenic mice presented similarly with a significantly reduced number of ASPA+ mature oligodendrocytes in the presence of IFN-γ (IFN-γ+) (WT, p&lt;<italic>0.001</italic>; KO, p&lt;<italic>0.05</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). During the remyelination period, ASPA+ oligodendrocytes reappeared and reached approximately 800/mm<sup>2</sup> in both IFN-γ-repressed GADD34 WT and KO mice (IFN-γ-) after 3 weeks of normal chow. In the presence of IFN-γ (IFN-γ+), this number dropped in the lesions of WT double-transgenic mice to roughly 500/mm<sup>2</sup> of ASPA+ cells (p&lt;<italic>0.05</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,C</xref>), which is consistent with our previous finding that IFN-γ expression in the CNS suppresses the repopulation of oligodendrocytes following cuprizone-induced oligodendrocyte toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lin et al., 2006</xref>). Compared to GADD34 WT, GFAP-tTA;TRE-IFN-γ mice with the <italic>Gadd34</italic> mutation had significantly increased numbers of ASPA+ oligodendrocytes during remyelination in the presence of IFN<italic>-γ</italic> (IFN-γ+/W8) (p&lt;<italic>0.01</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,C</xref>). Myelin status in these mice was also evaluated with EM. After 5 weeks of cuprizone chow, a significant number of axons exhibited myelin sheath loss in control mice (IFN-γ<italic>-</italic>), compared to 0 weeks (WT, p&lt;<italic>0.0001</italic>; KO, p&lt;<italic>0.001</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,C</xref>). Similarly, both WT and KO double-transgenic mice presented with markedly reduced numbers of myelinated axons in the presence of IFN<italic>-</italic>γ (IFN-γ+) (WT: 25.2 ± 3.0%, p&lt;<italic>0.0001</italic>; KO: 24.4 ± 2.7%, p&lt;<italic>0.0001</italic>). Nevertheless, no difference in the percentage of myelinated axons was observed between IFN-γ+ and IFN-γ- groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,C</xref>). At 3 weeks after cuprizone withdrawal, both IFN-γ-repressed WT and KO mice (IFN-γ-) showed spontaneous remyelination (WT: 42.7 ± 6.2%; KO: 42.6 ± 4.7%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,D</xref>). Meanwhile, remyelination was significantly suppressed in the corpus callosum of IFN<italic>-</italic>γ-expressing WT mice (WT: 29.4 ± 2.9%) (p&lt;<italic>0.05</italic>), but not in that of IFN<italic>-</italic>γ-expressing KO mice (KO: 49.1 ± 8.8%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,D</xref>).

In addition, Sephin1 protects mature oligodendrocytes against inflammation in the EAE model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, using Sephin1, we tested the ability of pharmacological enhancement of the ISR to protect remyelinating oligodendrocytes from inflammatory insults in the cuprizone model. Similar to the GADD34 mouse experiment, 6-week-old GFAP-tTA;TRE-IFN-γ double transgenic mice that had been on Dox water since conception were either kept on (IFN-γ-) or removed from Dox (IFN-γ+) and fed with a chow containing 0.2% cuprizone for 5 weeks. Mice were then placed back on a normal diet for 3 weeks. Sephin1 (8 mg/kg) or vehicle was administered daily to the mice by intraperitoneal injections beginning 3 weeks after the start of the cuprizone diet.

Next, we investigated the number of mature oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum by immunofluorescent staining of ASPA. 3 weeks of cuprizone exposure led to a significant decrease of the ASPA+ oligodendrocytes in both IFN-γ- (p&lt;<italic>0.01</italic>) and IFN-γ+ (p&lt;<italic>0.01</italic>) groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>).

We next tested the hypothesis that the effectiveness of a remyelination-enhancing agent would be augmented in an inflammatory environment when combined with an ISR enhancing agent. BZA is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that is currently FDA-approved to be used in combination with conjugated estrogen in menopausal women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McKeand et al., 2014</xref>).

To test whether the effectiveness of BZA would be enhanced in the presence of inflammation by ISR modulation, we combined BZA and Sephin1 treatments in our cuprizone GFAP-tTA;TRE-IFN-γ double transgenic model. We began the daily administration of BZA and Sephin1 3 weeks after the start of the cuprizone diet and withdrawal of Dox from the animal’s water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

Our mouse model used here, which combines primary demyelination induced by cuprizone with CNS delivery of IFN-γ, provides a unique platform to facilitate the assessment of remyelination therapies in the setting of inflammation. In our previous studies, we demonstrated that prolonging the ISR provides protection to mature oligodendrocytes, which maintain the myelin sheath, from inflammatory attack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Way and Popko, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Way et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2019</xref>).

IFN-γ delivery is required because cuprizone-induced demyelination/remyelination occurs in the absence of an adaptive immune response and thus does not reflect the inflammatory environment in the MS lesions. Importantly, the level of IFN-γ present in the CNS of GFAP-tTA;TRE-IFN-γ double transgenic mice is approximately equivalent to that of EAE mice (data not shown), which suggests that Dox-controlled IFN-γ release is within the range observed in inflammatory demyelination. Our previous studies with GFAP-tTA;TRE-IFN-γ double-transgenic mice demonstrated that ectopic expression of IFN-γ in the CNS results in a reduction in the number of myelinating oligodendrocytes and hypomyelination during development, and results in diminished remyelination following cuprizone-induced oligodendrocyte toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lin et al., 2006</xref>). In our current study we found that CNS expression of IFN-γ suppresses the repopulation of oligodendrocytes and results in diminished numbers of remyelinated axons following cuprizone-induced demyelination. In the GFAP-tTA;TRE-IFN-γ model, it takes about 2–3 weeks for IFN-γ levels to become elevated in the CNS following the removal of Dox from the animal’s diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lin et al., 2006</xref>). Since Dox removal occurred at the time of the initiation of cuprizone exposure, the majority of mature oligodendrocytes had already been lost (W3) by the time IFN-γ levels became elevated. Therefore, in this model, mainly newly generated remyelinating oligodendrocytes are exposed to IFN-γ. Using the same mouse model, our group previously showed that the effect of IFN-γ on the remyelination process in the cuprizone model is associated with an activated ISR response in remyelinating oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lin et al., 2006</xref>). Indeed, GADD34 deficiency or Sephin1 treatment, both of which prolong the ISR, significantly increased the number of remyelinating oligodendrocytes and myelinated axons in the presence of IFN-γ. Nevertheless, the enhancement of the ISR had no effect on remyelination in the absence of IFN-γ. This is consistent with a recent study that showed that guanabenz, a drug closely related to Sephin1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Das et al., 2015</xref>), did not improve remyelination in the non-inflammatory cuprizone model of demyelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Thompson and Tsirka, 2020</xref>).</p><p>The genetic and pharmacologic approaches used here to modulate the ISR do not target specific cell types in the CNS. The increased numbers of remyelinating oligodendrocytes that result from an enhanced ISR might originate from increased OPC survival in the lesion or from more efficient OPC differentiation to mature oligodendrocytes. We observed that proliferating OPC numbers at the peak of cuprizone-induced demyelination were diminished by the presence of IFN-γ, which is consistent with previous findings that showed that IFN-γ predisposed OPCs to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chew et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kirby et al., 2019</xref>). Nevertheless, prolonging the ISR by the <italic>Gadd34</italic> mutation or by Sephin1 treatment did not alter the number of proliferating OPCs in the presence of inflammation. Therefore, it is likely that the benefits of ISR enhancement on remyelination in the presence of inflammation are primarily due to the protection of actively myelinating oligodendrocytes, similar to what we have observed during developmental myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chew et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The FDA-approved SERM, BZA, has been shown to be capable of enhancing OPC differentiation and remyelination independently of its estrogen receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rankin et al., 2019</xref>). We show here that BZA can promote remyelination in the presence of the inflammatory cytokine IFN-γ, which provides valuable preclinical support to the current MS clinical trial of BZA as a remyelination-enhancing agent (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> Identifier: NCT04002934). Encouragingly, we found that the combination treatment of BZA and Sephin1 resulted in more axons with thicker myelin, indicating a more substantial recovery. Although with our current data we cannot exclude the possibility that this combination treatment might protect mature oligodendrocytes and myelin during cuprizone-induced demyelination, we believe that because the treatment was started at the time-point of substantial oligodendrocyte loss and demyelination in the corpus callosum, it is more likely that the primary beneficial effect is on the repopulation of oligodendrocytes and remyelination. The myelin sheaths of remyelinated axons are uniformly thin regardless of axon diameter, but the underlying mechanism that controls the thickness of remyelinated axons is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fancy et al., 2011</xref>). Although previous studies have shown that the transgenic overexpression of neuregulin (<italic>Nrg</italic>) or the conditional knockout of <italic>Petn</italic> increases myelin sheath thickness in developmental myelination, the remyelinated myelin sheaths remain thin in these models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brinkmann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harrington et al., 2010</xref>). Increased myelin thickness after the combination treatment of BZA and Sephin1 in our inflammatory de/remyelination model suggests that remyelination can be more efficiently induced by using therapies promoting OPC differentiation in combination with therapies that protect the remyelinating oligodendrocytes against inflammatory environment.</p><p>Effective MS therapies need to both suppress the aggressive CNS inflammation and promote restoring neuronal functions, including remyelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rodgers et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Titus et al., 2020</xref>). Our current study demonstrates that the ISR modulator Sephin1 protects remyelinating oligodendrocytes in the presence of an inflammatory environment, leading to remarkably improved remyelination. In our previous EAE study, we showed that Sephin1 protects mature oligodendrocytes, myelin and axons, in addition to indirectly dampening the CNS inflammation that drives EAE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). We also showed that combining Sephin1 with the anti-inflammatory MS drug IFN-β resulted in an additive effect in alleviating EAE. Combining current and previous findings, we believe that Sephin1 or similar ISR enhancing strategies will likely provide significant therapeutic benefit to MS patients when combined with current immunosuppressive treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">C57Bl/6J</td><td valign="top">Jackson lab</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:000664</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">GFAP-tTA mice</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2004</xref></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX:005964">IMSR_JAX:005964</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">TRE-IFN-γ mice</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2004</xref></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX:009344">IMSR_JAX:009344</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Ppp1r15a-/-</italic>(GADD34 KO) mice</td><td valign="top">Gift from David Ron</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:MGI:3040935">MGI:3040935</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">doxycycline</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat #

This paper demonstrates that the integrated stress response (ISR), a cytoprotective pathway, crucially contributes to the protection of oligodendrocytes and improves remyelination during inflammation. Both pharmacological and genetic approaches were used to prolong the ISR, which led to increased numbers of remyelinating oligodendrocytes and remyelinated axons in animal models of disease.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Prolonging the integrated stress response enhances CNS remyelination in an inflammatory environment&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

We initiated the combined treatment after three weeks of cuprizone exposure because substantial oligodendrocyte loss and demyelination has occurred in the corpus callosum at this time point. Although we cannot rule out a potential protective effect of the drug treatments on mature oligodendrocytes and myelin, we suspect that because extensive pathology is already present at week 3, the primary protective effect of ISR enhancement in this model is on the repopulation of oligodendrocytes and remyelination in the presence of inflammation. We have revised the manuscript (Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ISR indicators in the models.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer for this recommendation. We have previously reported that Sephin1 can prolong the phosphorylated status of eIF2α (p-eIF2α) in IFN-γ stressed oligodendrocytes in culture. We also observed a significant increased number of p-eIF2α positive oligodendrocytes in the spinal cords of Sephin1 treated EAE mice, compared to EAE controls (Chen et al., 2019). In addition, using this GFAP/tTA;TRE/IFN-γ double-transgenic transgenic model, our group previously showed that the effect of IFN-γ on the remyelination process in the cuprizone model is associated with an activated ISR response in oligodendrocytes (Lin et al., 2006). In the presence of IFN-γ, the levels of ISR markers (CHOP and p-eIF2α) were significantly increased during remyelination; whereas the ISR does not appear activated in the cuprizone model in the absence of IFN-γ. Furthermore, our previous report demonstrated that the genetic disruption of the ISR inhibited remyelination in the cuprizone model in the presence of IFN-γ (Lin et al., 2006). In the current manuscript we examined whether prolonging the ISR response would enhance remyelination in an inflammatory environment. We have more clearly described this background information in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ages and sex of mice used.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment, and we appreciate the opportunity to discuss this issue further. We agree that W8 (14 weeks of age) age-matched mice, in the absence of cuprizone or IFN-γ, would be the ideal control, and we regret not including an examination of such mice for this study. Myelination continues throughout adulthood, such that the 6-week-old timepoint does not precisely reflect the myelin landscape analyzed at the later time points. Therefore, in the revised manuscript we have tried to refer to W0 timepoint (six week of age) more as a reference point, with the primary comparisons being between ISR enhanced (genetic and pharmacological) and non-ISR enhanced animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Numbers of mice used.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for giving us the opportunity for clarifying these points. We used the same mice for the histology study and EM study; the detailed information can be found in the Materials and methods section. We used the WT mice at W0 mice also for W0 in the pharmacological study. We used WT mice at W5/IFN-γ- also for vehicle controls at W5/IFN-γ-. We included the total number of mice in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Which steps of EAE and cuprizone experiments were performed blinded.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the recommendation. We included the information of blinded experiments in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Presentation of figures and question about panels:</p><p>For presentation, it was suggested that Figures 2 and 3 be combined. There are also questions about panels in Figures 3C and 5C being duplicated.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment. We understand the desire to consolidate the schematic Figure 2 with the following data figure. Nevertheless, we are concerned that this will reduce the clarity of the manuscript. This schematic figure describes not only the IFN-γ inducible system that we used throughout the manuscript (panel A), but it also describes the genetic (panel B) and pharmacological studies (panel C) that were used in the subsequent figures. We hope the reviewers understand our desire to maintain these schematic diagrams as a separate figure to achieve clarity.</p><p>We apologize for our error with the incorrectly placed panel in Figure 3C. We have replaced this with the correct panel in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The combined Sephin1/BZA treatment experiment in Figure 8 need to be clarified both in terms of the rationale and interpretation of the resulting data. All three reviewers point this out. There is a need to clearly describe the rationale for combining BZA and Seph, justifications or revisions of the interpretation of the data and conclusions based on a change in the G-ratio of remyelinated axons without effects on number of ASPA cells and axons and how this can be interpreted as &quot;enhanced&quot; regeneration vs. accelerated regeneration. If it is not sufficiently strong, then the text and Abstract need to be toned down in conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for giving us the opportunity to clarify this point. BZA, which is a selective estrogen receptor modulator, has been shown to significantly enhance OPC differentiation and CNS remyelination. In our study, the enhancement of the ISR, genetically or with Sephin1, provided protection to remyelinating oligodendrocytes in the presence of inflammation. In other words, BZA promotes remyelination and ISR enhancement permits remyelination to occur in the presence of inflammation. We speculated that remyelination-enhancing agents would be even more effective when combined with Sephin1. We have included a more detailed description of the rationale behind these studies in the revised manuscript (Results). We agree that the differences in g-ratio likely reflect an increase in the rate of remyelination in the presence of BZA and Sephin1. We have now discussed this possibility in the revised manuscript. We have not, however, changed the Abstract, since the statement here is factual, not an interpretation of the results: “the combined treatment of Sephin1 with the oligodendrocyte differentiation enhancing reagent bazedoxifene increased myelin thickness of remyelinated axons to pre-lesion levels”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Discussion:</p><p>Clearer presentation of conditions during which augmenting ISR is protective of mature and remyelinating oligodendrocytes.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the opportunity to clarify this point. It is correct: the ISR does not appear to be activated in the cuprizone model in the absence of inflammation. Oligodendrocyte protection through an enhanced ISR only occurs when the ISR is activated in our model by the presence of IFN-γ. In our previous study, we showed that Sephin1 protected mature oligodendrocytes (i.e. those that are maintaining a myelin sheath) at the peak of EAE disease, where the ISR is activated by CNS inflammation (Chen et al., 2019). In the GFAP/tTA;TRE/IFN-γ transgenic model, it takes about 2 to 3 weeks for IFN-γ levels to become elevated following the removal of dox from the animal’s diet (Figure 2—figure supplement 1) (Lin et al., 2006). In this study, we remove dox at the time of the initiation of cuprizone exposure; therefore the majority of mature oligodendrocyte have already been lost by the time IFN-γ levels increase. We have clarified this in the revised manuscript (Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Implications of their study for regenerative medicines in the context of drug mediate suppression of inflammation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer for the recommendation. Our previous study showed that combining Sephin1 with the first-line anti-inflammatory IFN-β exhibited additive benefit in alleviating EAE. We believe that Sephin1 and other ISR enhancing compounds will likely provide significant reparative benefit to MS patients even when combined with current immunosuppressive treatments. We have addressed this point in the revised Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
