What were we doing wrong? Why was it not OK, according to these referees, to present the observations and the theory in a back-and-forth dialogue within the ‘Results’ section?</p><p>While I was bemused by these statements (relegated!), they resonated with my long experience with some in the biology community, namely that they see the significance of theory very differently from the way physicists understand it. For many biologists, theoretical results are simply not ‘Results’. Indeed, I suspect to many they are seen as a matter of opinion, without any intrinsic significance. In essence, they don’t add anything new. Hence the belief in the canonical Results/Discussion dichotomy in which theory (or ‘modelling’, as it is often called) plays second fiddle, or third.</p><p>In contrast, physicists are brought up to think by means of mathematical models: harmonic oscillators, random walks, idealized electrical circuits and so on are among the tools in our toolbox, whether we do experiment or theory. We use them as solvable examples in which a well-defined set of assumptions leads to precise outcomes, and where the dependence of the outcomes on the various parameters in the model can be interpreted. This approach allows us to estimate what is important and what is not in any setting. Models also help us to think about problems: “If this is the underlying physics, then A should vary with B quadratically…”, or “under these assumptions, the data should collapse like this…” or, when we spot something is not quite right, “here I argue that these claims are in conflict with basic laws of physics” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Meister, 2016</xref>).</p><p>The role of theory is also intimately connected with <italic>predictions</italic>. While I know biologists who would say “who cares about a prediction in the absence of experiment?”, physicists are brought up to celebrate them – they are the stuff of legend, from Dirac’s prediction of antiparticles and Einstein’s prediction of the bending of starlight, to the work by many that predicted the Higgs particle. We view predictions as motivations for experiment and as a means to move the discipline forward. Of course, sometimes they turn out to be wrong, but that is often how science works. Even if theoretical work does not take the form of a prediction, <italic>per se</italic>, it may still be very useful to design experiments with theory in mind, as emphasized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bialek (2018)</xref>, who has described many historical examples of the role theory has played in biology, from Rayleigh’s work on hearing to Watson and Crick.</p><p>My purpose here is to push back against the view that theory is not a ‘Result’. I argue for the unabashed inclusion of mathematical formulations and pedagogy within the body of papers published in <italic>eLife</italic> and other primarily biological journals. By interleaving the experimental and theoretical results it is possible to tell a story, and I firmly believe this makes for much more interesting and readable papers. It is also faithful to the scientific method, in which one goes back and forth with experiment and hypothesis.</p><p>Readers may be interested to learn that biological information, background and results are now routinely included in papers published in physics journals, although this has not always been the case: I vividly recall a situation several decades ago when a colleague, a high-energy physicist, saw a preprint about pattern formation in the slime mold <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> on my desk and asked: “Why would any physicist study something as ridiculous as that?” But by now many physicists do exactly that, and many physics journals are full of discussions of cAMP signaling, spiral waves, and chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Goldstein, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Rappel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Gholami et al., 2015</xref>). If we really take interdisciplinary research seriously then I assert there has to be a prominent place for theory within biology papers, both as Results in papers that combine experiment and theory, and as Results in theory papers.</p><p>This is nothing new. If you have not already done so, I highly recommend reading the celebrated paper by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hodgkin and Huxley (1952)</xref> to see experiments and theory interleaved. Theory is not relegated to the discussion, or worse, to supplementary material, but instead is incorporated into the body of the paper as if it is the most natural thing to do. And this was in the <italic>Journal of Physiology</italic>. The same structure is found in the Michaelis-Menten paper, which was published (in German) in a biochemistry journal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Michaelis and Menten, 1913</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Michaelis et al., 2011</xref>). If this was appropriate a century ago, why must details of mathematical models now be relegated to the back of papers (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Paulick et al. (2017)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ferreira et al. (2017)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Streichan et al. (2018)</xref>)?</p><p>Many readers will appreciate that the issue I am raising about quantitative descriptions of living systems is closely associated with the tension that exists between the stereotypes of the biologist, who wants to incorporate all the complexity of a particular system, and the physicist who seeks generality and minimalism. As has been emphasized in other recent opinion pieces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Shou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Riveline and Kruse, 2017</xref>), the role of theory in biology has been growing and this development requires new ways of training scientists on both sides of the physics/biology divide. Less attention has been paid to providing concrete examples for the biology community of how physicists think about understanding data, and this essay’s goal, in part, is to address this lacuna.</p><p>Well aware of the risks of trying to speak for an entire community, below I take the reader through an example of how (at least some) physicists might go about describing a well-known phenomenon that shows up everywhere in biology – from the functioning of cellular receptors to bacterial chemotaxis, the propagation of action potentials, and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments – namely, diffusion. Employing poetic license, I imagine that we are at a point in time when the diffusion equation itself was not known, nor was Fick’s Law, so both the experimental observations and theoretical analysis presented below are new and worthy of being described as Results.</p><p>I compose two versions of a Results section to indicate various ways of presenting the data and theory interleaved in a compact presentation that (I hope) is widely understandable by the community. The first version involves a ‘microscopic’ model that is a caricature of the biological system, but contains the essential ingredients to display the behavior observed on the large scale. The way in which microscopic parameters enter into the macroscopic answer turns out to be general (or, as physicists say, ‘universal’), a key take-home lesson. The second version – which is probably more challenging – involves the use of ‘dimensional analysis’, one of the most powerful methods of analyzing natural phenomena. Here, relationships between various quantities are deduced by examining the units in which they are measured (mass, length, time, charge, etc.). Introduced long ago, particularly in the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Clerk-Maxwell, 1869</xref>, this technique can often lead to exact answers to problems, up to the proverbial ‘factors of two’.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>A discovery</title><p>Allow me to introduce our fictitious Professor Lamarr, who has been investigating how the single-cell green alga <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> moves in response to light. She has discovered that if a narrow sheet of light is directed into an algal suspension in a petri dish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), the algae swim into the beam and form a concentrated line of cells. When the light is turned off and there is no more phototactic cue, the cells resume a random swimming motion described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Polin et al., 2009</xref>), in which every 10 seconds or so their roughly linear motion is interrupted by a turn: the angle of this turn falls within a distribution that has a mean of ~90 degrees. These random turns lead the population to spread out over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).

In one, a microscopic model led directly to the diffusion equation, whose structure led to the ‘rediscovery’ of Fick’s law, which was confirmed from the data. In the second, the principles of dimensional analysis and some phenomenological reasoning led us to postulate a ‘new’ diffusion equation as a concise encoding of the experimental observations. Each of these approaches used nothing more than basic algebraic manipulations and elementary differential equations.</p><p>Returning to the referees who spoke of inferences drawn directly from the data, I would ask: “What language does the data speak?” The answer would appear to depend on one’s background. The inferences I drew from Lamarr’s data were based on experience with understanding continuum and nonequilibrium phenomena, subjects which are less common in the undergraduate physics curriculum than one would hope, and very seldomly found in biology curricula. So, I would indeed advocate a more holistic education for both biologists and physicists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Goldstein et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>It might be argued that the particular example I presented here is unusual, but in fact these very same considerations (dimensional analysis, scaling collapse of data, etc.) are to be found in many other places in biophysics. Excellent examples are work on metabolic scaling laws (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">West et al., 1997</xref>) and on stem cell replacement dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Lopez-Garcia et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>More importantly, I am not trying to emphasize any particular method in the physicist’s toolbox, but rather a mindset that is about model-building <italic>and testing</italic> as part of the results presented to the reader. This mindset is particularly relevant when the theory is formulated first and the experiment is undertaken to test it. But even when the experiment comes first there may be a need to use theory as a sanity check on one’s observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Meister, 2016</xref>). This also brings us to the delicate issue of the extent to which research should actually be ‘hypothesis driven’, as discussed provocatively by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Milner, 2018</xref>: I will leave that Pandora’s box closed for the moment.</p><p>Finally, one could argue that the diffusion equation is ‘just a model’ or ‘just a theory’ and should, therefore, not be considered as a Result because, unlike the data, it could be shown to be incorrect. With my experimentalist hat on, I find that argument weak: almost every experiment has potentially confounding aspects, and despite our best efforts to control them, these effects can produce spurious results. After all, how many hundreds or thousands of papers must have been written about stomach ulcers before <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Marshall and Warren, 1984</xref> discovered that <italic>H. pylori</italic> was so often the culprit? So, while it is certainly the case that many of the models discussed in biology papers do not have the status of fundamental laws, I think that it is contrary to the scientific method to view the fact that they may be superseded as a weakness. If theories are crafted the right way they have utility even if proven wrong, sometimes especially if proven wrong!</p><p>This essay has touched on two tensions – between theory and experiment, and between the cultures of physics and biology. The differences between the cultures have implications not only for how data is interpreted, but also for what qualifies as “interesting” and who gets to frame the questions: an enlightening debate on this issue was aired more than 20 years ago by Adrian Parsegian and Robert Austin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Parsegian, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Huebner et al., 1997</xref>). For example, it might be argued that biologists may not really be interested in the fact that a new equation has been derived that provides an approximate description of a given system, and this could be a reason not to publish a theoretical work in a biology journal. The example I provide here shows how this need not be an empty exercise, but can lead to testable, mechanistic predictions such as the relationship between flux and concentration gradient (Fick’s Law, rediscovered). One need only consult the seminal work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Turing (1952)</xref> on biological pattern formation or of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hodgkin and Huxley (1952)</xref> on action potentials to see the importance of having a mathematical encoding of diffusion to study its mechanistic implications. Likewise, a physics-oriented experimental paper, even one that deals with living organisms, may also not be seen as interesting to biologists because the questions appear unfamiliar. For truly interdisciplinary journals, easing this tension is perhaps the greatest challenge.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Generating the data</title><p>Full disclosure – rather than do the experiments, I numerically solved the Langevin equation <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf135"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>η</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> for the time evolution of the position <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf136"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> for a single alga undergoing random motion, where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf137"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>η</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is a random variable with zero mean and temporal correlation function <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf138"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">⟨</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>η</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>η</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>′</mml:mo></mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">⟩</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>δ</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>′</mml:mo></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>.
