Progress in defining the ion channel function of GluDs in neurons has been hindered by a lack of pharmacological tools. Here, we used a chemo-genetic approach to engineer specific and photo-reversible pharmacology in GluD2 receptor. We incorporated a cysteine mutation in the cavity located above the putative ion channel pore, for site-specific conjugation with a photoswitchable pore blocker. In the constitutively open GluD2 Lurcher mutant, current could be rapidly and reversibly decreased with light. We then transposed the cysteine mutation to the native receptor, to demonstrate with high pharmacological specificity that metabotropic glutamate receptor signaling triggers opening of GluD2. Our results assess the functional relevance of GluD2 ion channel and introduce an optogenetic tool that will provide a novel and powerful means for probing GluD2 ionotropic contribution to neuronal physiology.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Neurotransmitters are chemicals released by the body that trigger activity in neurons. Receptors on the surface of neurons detect these neurotransmitters, providing a link between the inside and the outside of the cell. Glutamate is one of the major neurotransmitters and is involved in virtually all brain functions. Glutamate binds to two different types of receptors in neurons. Ionotropic receptors have pores known as ion channels, which open when glutamate binds. This is a fast-acting response that allows sodium ions to flow into the neuron, triggering an electrical signal. Metabotropic receptors, on the other hand, trigger a series of events inside the cell that lead to a response. Metabotropic receptors take more time than ionotropic receptors to elicit a response in the cell, but their effects last much longer.</p><p>One type of receptor, known as the GluD family, is very similar to ionotropic glutamate receptors but does not directly respond to glutamate. Instead, the ion channel of GluD receptors opens after being activated by glutamate metabotropic receptors. GluD receptors are produced throughout the brain and play roles in synapse formation and activity, but the way they work remains unclear. An obstacle to understanding how GluD receptors work is the lack of molecules that can specifically block these receptors’ ion channel activity.</p><p>Lemoine et al. have developed a tool that enables control of the ion channel in GluD receptors using light. Human cells grown in the lab were genetically modified to produce a version of GluD2 (a member of the GluD family) with a light-sensitive molecule attached. In darkness or under green light, the light-sensitive molecule blocks the channel and prevents ions from passing through. Under violet light, the molecule twists, and ions can flow through the channel.</p><p>With this control over the GluD2 ion channel activity, Lemoine et al. were able to validate previous research showing that the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors can trigger GluD2 to open. The next step will be to test this approach in neurons. This will help researchers to understand what role GluD ion channels play in neuron to neuron communication.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>photopharmacology</kwd><kwd>glutamate receptors</kwd><kwd>tethered ligands</kwd><kwd>ion channels</kwd><kwd>azobenzene</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-16-CE16-0014-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tricoire</surname><given-names>Ludovic</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FRM EQU201903007961</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Faure</surname><given-names>Philippe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>LABEX Dynamo</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Taly</surname><given-names>Antoine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-11-LABX-0011</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Taly</surname><given-names>Antoine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>LABEX Biopsy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lemoine</surname><given-names>Damien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A photoswitchable pore blocker was covalently attached to a cysteine-substituted glutamate delta 2 receptor, to provide optical control of its ion channel function.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The delta glutamate receptors, GluD1 and GluD2, belong to the ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) family, yet they don’t bind glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yuzaki and Aricescu, 2017</xref>). They are considered as glutamate receptors solely based on their strong sequence and structure homology with AMPA, NMDA and kainate receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lomeli et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araki et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schmid and Hollmann, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Elegheert et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burada et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burada et al., 2020b</xref>). GluD receptors are widely expressed throughout the brain, GluD1 predominantly in the forebrain, while GluD2 is highly enriched in cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Konno et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hepp et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nakamoto et al., 2020b</xref>). Both GluD1 and GluD2 play a role in the formation, stabilization, function and plasticity of synapses through their interaction with members of the cerebellin (Cbln) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fossati et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Matsuda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kakegawa et al., 2008</xref>). Cbln1 notably binds both the N-terminal domain of postsynaptic GluD2 and presynaptic neurexins, leading to a trans-synaptic bridge that promotes synaptogenesis and is essential for GluD2 signaling in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Elegheert et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Suzuki et al., 2020</xref>). Deletion of genes coding for GluD1 or GluD2 in mouse results in marked behavioral alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yadav et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lalouette et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yadav et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nakamoto et al., 2020a</xref>), and mutations in these genes in humans have been associated with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Griswold et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Treutlein et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Greenwood et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cristino, 2019</xref>), attesting to their functional importance in brain circuits.</p><p>Despite their structural similarity with other iGluRs, and notably the presence of a ligand-binding domain (LBD), GluDs stand out because they are not activated by glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araki et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lomeli et al., 1993</xref>). Nonetheless, recent studies revealed that GluD pore opening could be triggered indirectly, through the activation of Gq-coupled metabotropic receptors, and contributes to neurotransmission and neuronal excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ady et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dadak et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benamer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gantz et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, the activation of GluD channels triggered by metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGlu1/5) underlies the slow excitatory postsynaptic current in cerebellar PCs (GluD2, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ady et al., 2014</xref>) and in midbrain dopaminergic neurons (GluD1, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benamer et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, the demonstration that GluD1 channels carry the noradrenergic slow excitatory current in dorsal raphe neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gantz et al., 2020</xref>), suggests that the contribution of GluD channels to neuronal excitability and synaptic physiology may be widespread. The above studies relied largely on genetic tools, such as dead-pore mutants or targeted deletions, to assess the ion channel function of GluDs. Yet, due to the absence of specific pharmacological tools to block their ion permeation, the role of GluD1/2 channels in the regulation of neural activity remains largely elusive.</p><p>Pore blockers for GluDs, such as pentamidine and 1-Naphthyl acetyl spermine (NASPM), were previously identified using a point mutation (A654T) in GluD2 that confers constitutive ion flow and causes the degeneration of cerebellar PCs in <italic>Lurcher</italic> (GluD2<sup>Lc</sup>) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wollmuth et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zuo et al., 1997</xref>). These molecules are however also pore blockers of NMDA and AMPA receptors, respectively. Other ligands such as D-serine and glycine bind to the LBD and reduce spontaneous currents in GluD2<sup>Lc</sup>, which suggests a coupling between the LBD and the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Naur et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hansen et al., 2009</xref>), but these molecules have broad spectrum activity. Finally, 7-chlorokynurenic acid has been identified to modulate GluD2<sup>Lc</sup> current by binding to the D-serine site but it is also a GluN1 competitive antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kristensen et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>To fill this gap, we bestowed light-sensitivity to the GluD ion channel pore using a photoswitchable tethered ligand (PTL) approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Paoletti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mondoloni et al., 2019</xref>). Using structure-based design, we incorporated a cysteine point mutation at the surface of GluD2, right above the hypothetical channel lumen, onto which can be anchored a photoswitchable pore blocker. Different wavelengths of light are then used to modify the geometry of the PTL, thereby presenting/removing the blocker to/from the channel, resulting in optical control of ionotropic activity. Here we demonstrate rapid and reversible, optical control of ion current through a cysteine-substituted GluD2 receptor. This novel tool, called light-controllable GluD2 (LiGluD2), allows rapid, reversible and pharmacologically-specific control of ionic current through GluD2, and may help provide a mechanistic understanding of how this receptor contributes to brain circuit function and behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Designing a light-controllable GluD receptor</title><p>Our approach to probing the functionality of the ion channel in GluD is to install a photo-isomerizable pore blocker at the extracellular entrance to the channel lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The tethered ligand is site-specifically attached to a cysteine-substituted residue. In darkness or under green light (500–535 nm), the PTL adopts an elongated shape and reaches the lumen, resulting in ion channel blockade, while under violet light (380–390 nm), it switches to a twisted, shorter configuration, relieving blockade. Our design of the PTL was based on the chemical structure of pentamidine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), a pore blocker that efficiently blocks current through GluD2<sup>Lc</sup> receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Williams et al., 2003</xref>). The PTL, called MAGu, contains a thiol-reactive maleimide (M) moiety, a central photo-isomerizable azobenzene (A) chromophore, and a guanidinium (Gu) head group that resembles the amidinium groups of pentamidine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). MAGu was selected notably because its synthesis route has been described (referred to as PAG1c in the original article) and because it was shown to have no adverse effect on native brain tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin et al., 2015</xref>). In aqueous solution, MAGu could be converted to its <italic>cis</italic> form using 380 nm light, and converted back to <italic>trans</italic> either slowly in darkness (t<sub>1/2</sub> ~ 20 min) or rapidly upon illumination with 525 nm light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>), in agreement with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lin et al., 2018</xref>). To find the best attachment site for MAGu on GluD, we developed a homology model of the GluD2 receptor, based on the structure of the recently crystallized GluA2 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Twomey et al., 2017</xref>) (see methods). Using this model, we selected a series of 15 residues, located on the peptide that links the LBD to the third transmembrane domain (M3) that lines the channel lumen, for mutation to cysteine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Optogenetic pharmacology strategy to probe the ionotropic activity of GluD receptors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) GluD2 is genetically-modified to incorporate a cysteine residue (yellow) at the entrance to the pore, which serves as a handle for the covalent attachment of a synthetic, photoswitchable tethered ligand (PTL).

Accordingly, we found that heterologous expression of GluD2-A654T, but not of the wild-type (WT) protein, in HEK cells produces large currents that reverse at membrane potential close to 0 mV and are reduced by externally-applied pentamidine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Subtracted Lc current showed clear rectification at positive potentials, as reported with the blockade by NASP, another GluD blocker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kohda et al., 2000</xref>). Therefore, the A654T Lc mutant was subsequently used as a screening platform to find the best attachment site for MAGu on GluD2. Each of the 15 residues identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> were mutated individually to cysteine on the A654T background, and tested using patch-clamp electrophysiology. Cells were treated with MAGu (20 µM, 20 min) and Lc currents were measured in voltage-clamp mode (−60 mV) under different illumination conditions to toggle MAGu between its <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> states. As expected, current through A654T was not affected by light, indicating that in the absence of a properly-positioned cysteine, MAGu has no effect on this Lc channel. In contrast, we found several cysteine mutants for which current was significantly larger under 380 than under 535 nm light, and one mutant (Q669C) for which there was a tendency for ‘reverse photoswitching’, that is larger currents under 535 than under 380 nm light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We then quantified the degree of photoswitching by comparing the block in darkness (<italic>trans</italic> state) to the block evoked by a saturating concentration of pentamidine (100 μM). We excluded from the analysis mutants that displayed no pentamidine-decreased leak current (i.e. mutants for which pentamidine block was significantly smaller than that observed on A654T, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>), because they were likely either not expressed or not functional. Photoswitching was significant for Q666C, Q669C, D670C, Q674C, and I677C, suggesting that MAGu covalently reacted with these cysteine mutants and that, once tethered, it could modulate current in one of its conformer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Importantly, photomodulation was absent in the control A654T and the other cysteine mutants, indicating that the effect of light is specific to the attachment of MAGu to the above-mentioned cysteine mutants.

This suggested to us that the positive charge of MAGu may not sense the electrical field of the membrane as much as pentamidine does, and thus that the two molecules may bind to different sites. To investigate whether MAGu and pentamidine compete for the same binding site, we evaluated the dose-response relationship of pentamidine block on GluD2-A654T-I677C conjugated with MAGu, under both 380 and 535 nm light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Because their activation mechanism is still unknown, we adopted a different strategy for photocontrolling GluD receptors. We installed the photoswitchable ligand MAGu in proximity to the pore lumen, in hope to alter ion conduction through non-competitive antagonism. We found several cysteine mutants for which current was specifically modulated by light after attachment of MAGu, notably I677C (a.k.a. LiGluD2).

Here, the pharmacological specificity of LiGluD2 is exquisite: after MAGu treatment, only the I677C mutant, and not the WT receptor, became sensitive to light. Likewise, MAGu did not photosensitize other WT glutamate receptors expressed in native brain tissue, in agreement with previous report demonstrating that MAGu has no off-target effects on WT GABA receptors, glutamate receptors and voltage-gated ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, even though the maleimide group of MAGu reacts in principle with any extracellular cysteine freely accessible on the cell surface, the ability of the tethered ligand (here guanidinium) to reach a particular site of action on any given protein in one configuration, but not the other (e.g. <italic>trans</italic> but not <italic>cis</italic>), is highly improbable. In fact, the PTL approach has already demonstrated exquisite pharmacological specificity for a large variety of cysteine-substituted ion channels and receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Paoletti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mondoloni et al., 2019</xref>), even in complex biological settings such as brain slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berlin et al., 2016</xref>) or intact neuronal circuits in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Durand-de Cuttoli et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Attachment of MAGu to GluD2 requires a single amino acid substitution, which is unlikely to disrupt the function of the receptor.

Even though light-induced blockade in LiGluD2 is partial, the rapid kinetics of block/unblock, coupled to the genetic specificity of the methodology, provide a unique opportunity to detect even small variations in GluD2 current, such as the tonic current we observed in heterologous expression system. LiGluD2 remains to be deployed in neuronal setting, yet we believe it will be a crucial tool for probing the ionotropic contribution of this orphan receptor to synaptic physiology.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">HEK tsa201</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich #96121229</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_2737">CVCL_2737</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">MAGu</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2015.10.026">10.1016/j.neuron.2015.10.026</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Originally named PAG-1c.

Prior to whole-cell patch-clamp experiments, cells were incubated for 20 min with an extracellular solution containing 20 μM MAGu, and then washed for at least 5 min with a fresh external solution. Cells were perfused with an external solution containing (in mM): 140 NaCl, 2.8 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 12 glucose, 10 HEPES and NaOH-buffered at pH 7.32. The external NMDG solution contained (in mM): 140 NMDG, 2.8 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 12 glucose, 10 HEPES and was KOH-buffered at pH 7.32. Cells were patched with a borosilicate pipette (4–5 MΩ) containing an intracellular solution containing (in mM): 140 KCl, 5 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, and pH-adjusted to 7.32 with KOH. For recording metabotropic activation of GluD2 by mGlu1, the internal solution contained (in mM): 140 K-gluconate, 6 KCl, 12.6 NaCl, 0.1 CaCl2, 5 Mg-ATP, 0.4 Na-GTP, 1 EGTA, 10 HEPES, and was adjusted to pH 7.32 with KOH. Pentamidine and NMDG solutions were applied using a fast-step perfusion system equipped with three square tubes (SF77B, warning instruments), as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lemoine et al., 2016</xref>. Illumination was carried out using a high-power LED system (pE-2, Cooled) mounted directly on the epifluorescence port of a vertical microscope (SliceScope Pro 6000, Scientifica). Light output at the focal plane was 5 and 11.7 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> for the 380 and 535 nm LEDs, respectively. Currents were recorded with an axopatch 200B and digitized with a digidata 1440 (Molecular devices). Signals were low-pass filtered (Bessel, 2 kHz) and collected at 10 kHz using the data acquisition software pClamp 10.5 (Molecular Devices). Electrophysiological recordings were extracted using Clampfit (Molecular Devices) and analyzed with R.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Slice electrophysiology</title><p>Animal breeding and euthanasia were performed in accordance with European Commission guidelines and French legislation (2010/63/UE) and procedures were approved by the French Ministry of Research (Agreement APAFIS#16198–2018071921137716 v3). Mice at age P30-40 were anesthetized with isoflurane and decapitated. Cerebella were rapidly extracted and transferred into ice-cold ACSF supplemented with 50 mM sucrose and 1 mM kynurenic acid. The composition of ACSF in mM was as follows: 126 NaCl, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 glucose. pH was adjusted to 7.4 by continuous gassing with carbogen. Sagittal slices (250 µm) were sectioned from the vermis on a vibratome (Leica VT 1200S) and transferred to oxygenated ACSF. Slices were incubated for 15 min at 30°C then transferred at room temperature before recording. Unless stated otherwise, all the steps were performed at room temperature. Purkinje cells were visually identified using infrared Dodt contrast imaging with a 60 × water immersion objective. Whole-cell recordings from Purkinje cells in cerebellar lobules IV-VI (voltage-clamped at −70 mV, liquid junction potentials not corrected) were performed with borosilicate glass pipettes (WPI, 2–4 MΩ) pulled with a horizontal micropipette puller (Sutter instruments). Internal pipette solutions contained (in mM): 140 Cs-gluconate, 5 CsCl, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 EGTA, 2 Na-ATP (pH 7.3, adjusted with CsOH). Whole-cell currents were recorded at 20 kHz and filtered with a Bessel low-pass filter at 4 kHz using a patch-clamp amplifier (Multiclamp 700B, Molecular Devices) connected to a Digidata 1440A interface board (Molecular Devices). Only Purkinje cells with a series resistance &lt;12 MΩ (not compensated; monitored during experiments by applying 200 ms, −5 mV voltage pulses) were used for the analyses.</p><p>Slices were incubated for 20 min under continuous oxygenation with MAGu 20 µM or vehicle (DMSO 0.4%) dissolved in 750 µl ACSF in a well of 24-well plate. The slices were then washed in ACSF for at least 20 min, and transferred in the recording chamber. Photoswitching was achieved by illuminating the slice as described above alternatively at 380 nm and 535 nm for 1 s.</p><p>(RS)-DHPG (200 µM) was diluted in ACSF and locally pressure-applied using a patch pipette placed in the dendrites of the recorded Purkinje-cell. A pneumatic microinjector (Picopump, WPI) was used to deliver 0.1–0.2 ms air pressure pulses (4–10 PSI) every minute. DHPG-mediated currents were recorded at room temperature in presence of CNQX 10 µM, D-APV 25 µM, gabazine 10 µM and CGP 55845 0.5 µM. DHPG was applied immediately after the light stimulation.</p><p>Parallel fiber stimulation was achieved every 10 s with a glass pipette filled with ACSF and placed in the outer half part of molecular layer. A constant voltage isolation unit (DS3, Digitimer Ltd) was used to deliver 10 µs rectangular pulses (50–200 µA) for extracellular stimulation. Parallel fibers inputs were identified by paired-pulse facilitation at 50 ms inter stimulus interval. Amplitudes of evoked EPSCs were averaged from 6 to 12 traces. EPSCs were recorded at 30°C in presence of gabazine 10 µM. Electrical stimulations were performed immediately after the light stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Molecular modeling</title><p>The model of the GluD receptor has been obtained by homology modeling using the software modeller version 9.19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Webb and Sali, 2016</xref>). The template was that of the glutamate receptor GluA2 (PDB code 5weo) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Twomey et al., 2017</xref>). The automodel class has been used with slow level of MD refinement and the optimization has been repeated three times for each model. 500 models were prepared and the best, as assessed by the DOPE score, was retained for further studies.</p><p>The structure of the protein and ligand were converted to pdbqt files with the software open babel 2.4.1. Covalent docking was then performed with the software smina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Koes et al., 2013</xref>). The box of 25*25*25 angstrom was defined manually to encompass the mutated residue and extend to the axis of symmetry. Covalent docking forced the maleimide to be in direct contact with the SG atom of the cysteine with which it is shown experimentally to form a covalent bond. The geometry of the ion channel has been computed with MOLEonline webserver, with the 'pore' mode. The resulting ion channel was color-coded as a function of the diameter of the channel allowing to illustrate the reduction of the diameter from a large (green) to a small (red) diameter.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data are plotted as mean ± SEM.

The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Stephanie C Gantz (Reviewer #1); Lonnie Wollmuth (Reviewer #2); Anna Koster (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest; however, as described below, additional experiments are required to support the conclusions. Therefore, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). In recognition that many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Unlike other ionotropic glutamate receptors, GluD2 is not gated by glutamate. No specific or high-affinity chemical modulators that induce channel activity exist for this receptor. To address this challenge, the authors used a previously characterized photoswitchable tethered ligand (PTL) called MAGu to target a very non-specific blocker (pentamidine) to a new ion channel target (the GluD2 receptor). This approach (using this exact PTL) has been used to target knock-in cysteine mutants of the GABAA receptor in mouse brain slices and in vivo in an awake, behaving mouse. Based on this precedent, it is not unreasonable to believe that this tool could similarly be used for the GluD2 receptor, which would be a significant advance in the field for understanding the physiological role of this protein in disease. However, there are concerns about signal-to-noise, since the pore block by trans-MAGu is only a fraction of total presumed current through GluD; therefore, it has not yet been demonstrated that the MAGu response will be sufficient for physiological studies.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In order to evaluate the potential of this new tool, it is essential that the authors provide a more thorough quantification of its effects, as described below, which will be relevant to the signal:noise in physiological experiments.</p><p>The photo-switchable capability of MAGu is convincing, but what is not clear is how good of a blocker trans-MAGu is. It is clear that trans-MAGu is not producing full block of leak current, but it is not quantified. These data need to be added to have a clear understanding of the strategy and mechanism. cis-MAGu unblocks a portion of leak current, but it is not clear how much of the total leak current is blocked by trans-MAGu. Knowing how much leak current is blocked by trans-MAGu is critical to interpreting the effect on mGluR-activated GluD2 current.</p><p>In Figure 2C I677C, there is still substantial leak in 535 nm. The quantification in Figure 2C (% photoswitching) shows the % of I-Blockphoto over I-Blockpenta, but the arrows in the righthand trace, it would appear I-Blockphoto is actually the current unblocked. It would be helpful to quantify the amount of leak current blocked by trans-MAGu. In Figure 2C, the extent of block for photoswitching is being quantified relative to that for pentamidine, which is reasonable. However, for pentamidine, what is the concentration used for the experiments? Where is it at on the concentration-block curve for pentamidine? Presumably, if complete block the leak current should go to zero and hence the efficacy of block of photoswitching blocker would be less (e.g., Figure 4B). Please clarify. Additional discussion as the structural basis for incomplete block may also be helpful.</p><p>How does MAGu work on the cysteine-engineered receptor that would presumably be used for future in vivo studies? Because the GluD2-I677C point mutant (lacking the L654T background) does not show current, the authors use the known effect of mGlu1 receptor agonism as a readout of GluD2-I677C activity in response to light and only see a 23% decrease in mGlu1 current--is this very small effect physiologically significant or to be expected? It seems like MAGu might be a useful tool to modulate GluD2 in Lurcher mice (which harbor the L654T mutation), but it is hard to know what the probe efficacy and usefulness is for evaluating the physiology of the WT GluD2 receptor in the absence of a way to measure a direct functional effect on the channel. How else might this be addressed?</p><p>Discussion paragraph two states that the WT receptor is insensitive to MAGu, but it is not clear where those data are presented. It would be beneficial to show the magnitude of the DHPG-induced current in WT GluD2-expressing cells before and after addition of MAGu to address the possibility that MAGu affects the current irrespective of trans- or cis- conformation.</p><p>It is also not clear how MAGu will be selective for site-specific conjugation when introduced in a neuronal setting. Is it expected MAGu will react with any available cysteine? It would be helpful to discuss possible limitations going forward towards use in neurons.</p><p>2) The Introduction and Abstract are rather general and antiquated, to the disservice of the readers. It may be time to move away from the notion that ion channel function of GluD is debated. The authors have published many elegant studies demonstrating ion channel function. By appearances of the literature, the interpretation of these studies are not contested. In addition to pharmacology, ion channel function of GluD has been demonstrated using selective genetic strategies (e.g. Ady et al., 2013; Benamer et al., 2018; Gantz et al., 2020). To this end, the Abstract and Introduction should be changed. It does not seem fitting to state &quot;direct evidence for ionotropic activity of GluD in neuronal setting [sic] is lacking&quot; provided the studies referenced above. Broadly, the readers would benefit from restructuring of the Introduction and Abstract to state the specific issue addressed by the present study (i.e. the lack of specific antagonists/pore blockers to study GluD without affecting other iGluRs) and highlight the potential application of the ligand.</p><p>3) It would be helpful to define early and explicitly what the photoswitchable functional strategy is – that it is working via a pore block mechanism. In the Abstract, for example, instead of calling it “…a photoswitchable ligand.” how about just “…a photoswitchable pore blocker.&quot; The functional strategy – that you are generating a photoswitchable pore blocker – should also be explicitly stated in the Introduction, where right now it is touched on but not explicitly stated.</p><p>4) PTLs have been shown to generate a high local concentration of ligand to accelerate pharmacological response (and in this case, provide some level of specificity for a very non-specific, greasy cation), but it is hard to rationalize &quot;absolute&quot; pharmacological specificity claimed by the authors (Abstract, Discussion paragraph two). At the mid-μM concentrations required to elicit response, it seems unlikely that MAGu will not react with any other extracellular cysteines present in cells. Further, the guanidinium group by itself will certainly not direct the maleimide reactivity towards GluD2 over any other cation channel or electronegative protein surface. The language of this claim should be modified in the absence of other types of specificity assays.</p><p>5) Figure 4A.

Is it being fixed? And what is driving the change in the coloration – presumed pore blocking by trans MAGu?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Probing the ionotropic activity of glutamate GluD2 receptor in HEK cells with genetically-engineered photopharmacology&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

To address this issue, we now have compared, for the best mutant (A654T-I677C), the degree of block with pentamidine (100 uM) and with transMAGu to that induced by NMDG, a large impermeant organic cation that blocks virtually all leak current (see new Figure 3A). We found that pentamidine blocks about 75% of the leak current, while trans MAGu blocks about 33% of the leak current.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 2C I677C, there is still substantial leak in 535 nm.

In Figure 2C, current is first recorded in darkness, when MAGu is in its trans, blocking state. Illuminating with 380 nm light converts MAGu to cis and relieves blockade. The arrow in the figure has now been moved to the dark period for clarity on how we quantify Block<sub>MAGu</sub>.</p><p>For pentamidine, we used a saturating concentration (100 uM, see Figure 4B). This is now clearly stated both in the text and in the figure legend. Yet, even at saturating concentration, pentamidine does not block GluD fully (Figure 4B), as previously reported (Williams et al., 2003). Therefore, it makes sense indeed to quantify the degree of photoswitching by comparing the block under 535 nm light to that induced by NMDG. This is now done in Figure 3C, for the “best” mutant I677C (see response to previous comment).</p><p>In agreement with the study by Williams et al., 2003, we observed partial block of GluD2Lc current, even for saturating concentrations of pentamidine. It was suggested that pentamidine may easily permeate GluD channels. Our current manuscript does not add any new information regarding the structural basis for pentamidine block, and thus we believe adding such discussion would be too speculative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How does MAGu work on the cysteine-engineered receptor that would presumably be used for future in vivo studies?

How else might this be addressed?</p></disp-quote><p>The 23% decrease in mGlu1-induced current is not very different from the 33% photoswitching we are now reporting for MAGu blockade when compared to NMDG block (Figure 3A). We understand that such amount of photoswitching may appear small. However, the PTL technology has two important features that should relief the reviewers’ concerns.</p><p>First, the PTL technology is highly specific to the engineered cysteine mutation, as already demonstrated for a large variety of cysteine-substituted ion channels and receptors, including voltage-gated potassium channels, GABA receptors, metabotropic and ionotropic glutamate receptors and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (see our recent review Paoletti et al., 2019 for a detailed list). This pharmacological specificity lies in the strong geometrical constrains between the tethered ligand and the engineered receptor, notably the strict distance between the attachment site (the cysteine mutation) and the ligand binding pocket. As a result, during the engineering step, we usually find that only one (or a handful at most) of the screened cysteine mutants can be made photocontrollable using this strategy. The PTL technology has now been deployed in complex neuronal setting, including mice and fish in vivo, with absolutely no adverse effects (see our review). Most importantly, the photoswitch MAGu we have used here has already been deployed in mice in vivo to control cysteine-substituted GABAA receptors (Lin et al., 2015), and showed absolutely no off-target effect on wild-type GABA receptors, glutamate receptors, or voltage-gated ion channels (see Figure S3 in Lin et al., 2015). We now have conducted similar controls (new Figure 5—figure supplement 1) and demonstrate in this article the specificity of our approach. We notably show that after MAGu treatment, GluD and GluA currents remain insensitive to the photostimulations, most likely because they lack a properly-positioned cysteine residue near the pore lumen.</p><p>Second, with PTLs, antagonism (or agonism) can be switched on and off within (milli)seconds, owing to the rapid kinetics of azobenzene photoswitching (see Figure 3B). This contrasts with traditional pharmacological compounds: the onset of their effect upon exposure takes a long time to develop and they can be difficult to remove, especially when they have high affinity, highly selectivity for their receptor. Hence, with PTLs, even a slight change in receptor activation efficacy can be reported rapidly with high fidelity and accuracy. This is for instance illustrated in Figure 5A: switching between 380 and 525 nm light rapidly and reversibly changes the holding current in the absence of DHPG. The light-induced current is small in amplitude, but because it can be reversibly switched on and off with high reproducibility, it unveils the existence of a tonically-activated GluD2 receptor in these cells.</p><p>For these reasons, we are confident that LiGLuD2 will be useful, in combination with a sensitive technique such as electrophysiology, to measure the direct functional effect of GluD2 photocontrol on neuronal physiology. Additionally, antagonism does not have to be complete to observe a strong physiological and/or phenotypical impact (see for instance Durand-de Cuttoli et al., 2018). The I677C mutant could be virally transduced in neuronal cells, either of the WT or the GluD2 knock-out mouse, with the idea of understanding when and where GluD2 is active. We don’t think Lurcher mice would help address this question.</p><p>These aspects of the PTL technology are now discussed in greater details in the Discussion section of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion paragraph two states that the WT receptor is insensitive to MAGu, but it is not clear where those data are presented. It would be beneficial to show the magnitude of the DHPG-induced current in WT GluD2-expressing cells before and after addition of MAGu to address the possibility that MAGu affects the current irrespective of trans- or cis- conformation.</p></disp-quote><p>Our intention was to point that after MAGu treatment, the WT receptor remains insensitive to light, indicating that photocontrol is specific to the cysteine mutant. We agree with the reviewers that our sentence was misleading. We did not show that MAGu treatment per se has no effect on the WT receptor. Sentence was changed accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is also not clear how MAGu will be selective for site-specific conjugation when introduced in a neuronal setting. Is it expected MAGu will react with any available cysteine? It would be helpful to discuss possible limitations going forward towards use in neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>The maleimide group of MAGu will indeed react with freely available cysteines, yet just on cell surface proteins (the highly reductive environment of the cytoplasm precludes maleimide conjugation to intracellular proteins). Nevertheless, as discussed above, this approach to photosensitizing receptors has proved to be remarkably specific in both fish and mice, with wild-type neurons or animals being unaffected by light after PTL treatment. Indeed, cysteine is a relatively infrequent amino acid (about 3%) often engaged in disulfide bonds (-S-S-) within or between polypeptide chains. Only free cysteines are available for PTL conjugation. In addition, there is a strong geometrical constrain for photocontrol: the cysteine residue has to be located at an ideal distance to the ligand binding pocket to result in photocontrol of protein activity. These limitations are now included in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The Introduction and Abstract are rather general and antiquated, to the disservice of the readers.
