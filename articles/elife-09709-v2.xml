important roles in dietary restriction (DR)-mediated lifespan extension. In this study, we show that the Sir2's role for DR-mediated lifespan extension depends on cAMP-PKA and casein kinase 2 (CK2) signaling in yeast. Sir2 partially represses the transcription of lifespan-associated genes, such as <italic>PMA1</italic> (encoding an H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase) and many ribosomal protein genes, through deacetylation of Lys 16 of histone H4 in the promoter regions of these genes. This repression is relieved by Sir2 S473 phosphorylation, which is mediated by active cAMP-PKA and CK2 signaling. Moderate DR increases the replicative lifespan of wild-type yeast but has no effect on that of yeast expressing the Sir2-S473E or S473A allele, suggesting that the effect of Sir2 on DR-mediated lifespan extension is negatively regulated by S473 phosphorylation. Our results demonstrate a mechanism by which Sir2 contributes to lifespan extension.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09709.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09709.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09709.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>We know that cutting calorie intake through a restricted diet can slow down the aging process and prolong the lives of many organisms ranging from yeast to mammals. Calorie restriction also has protective effects on various age-related diseases including neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Many studies suggest that we may mimic the beneficial effects of calorie restriction by controlling the activities of some proteins involved in the aging process.</p><p>An enzyme called Sir2 is required for calorie restriction to be able to increase lifespan. This enzyme modifies proteins called histones, which are used to package DNA inside cells. In yeast, Sir2 modifies the histones in such a way that the genes contained in that section of DNA are inactivated (or ‘silenced’). As the yeast cells age, the activity of Sir2 declines, which allows these genes to become active and contribute to the aging process. However, when yeast cells are grown in the presence of little sugar—which mimics caloric restriction—Sir2 is activated and this restores gene silencing.</p><p>It is not clear how Sir2's ability to silence these genes contributes to prolonged lifespan. Kang et al. studied the role of Sir2 in yeast and observed that one of the genes that Sir2 inactivates is called <italic>PMA1</italic>. This gene encodes a protein that is known to restrict the lifespan of yeast cells. Further experiments show that other proteins attach or remove molecules called phosphate groups from Sir2 to regulate its activity. Sir2 is inactivated when a phosphate group is attached, and active in the absence of phosphate. Under a reduced diet, the proteins that add phosphate to Sir2 are inactive, which allows Sir2 to become active and reduce the expression of the <italic>PMA1</italic> gene.</p><p>These results show that Sir2 fine-tunes the expression of <italic>PMA1</italic> and other age-related genes and that the attachment of phosphate groups to Sir2 by other proteins interferes with this regulation. The next challenges will be to identify the proteins responsible for attaching phosphate groups to Sir2, and to find out how they work.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09709.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09709.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Sir2</kwd><kwd>lifespan extension</kwd><kwd>dietary restriction</kwd><kwd>cAMP-PKA</kwd><kwd>CK2</kwd><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2010-0013086</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Jeong-Yoon</given-names></name><name><surname>Kwon</surname><given-names>Ki-Sun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The deacetylase Sir2 fine-tunes transcription of PMA1 and other aging related genes in a cAMP-PKA and CK2 signaling dependent manner.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sirtuins, a highly conserved family of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent protein deacetylases, have been implicated as a key metabolic sensor to link dietary restriction (DR) with lifespan extension in yeast, worms, flies, and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Longo and Kennedy, 2006</xref>). In yeast, silent information regulator 2 (Sir2), the founding member of the sirtuin family, mediates transcriptional silencing at the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) locus, mating type loci and telomeres by deacetylating the acetylated lysine 16 of histone H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rine and Herskowitz, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hecht et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Smith and Boeke, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Imai et al., 2000</xref>). Sir2 is thought to affect replicative aging of yeast cells by repressing recombination and instability at the rDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sinclair and Guarente, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Falcon and Aris, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ganley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stumpferl et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kwan et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, Sir2 may regulate lifespan by deacetylating H4K16 at sub-telomeric regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dang et al., 2009</xref>) and by asymmetrically segregating damaged proteins and cellular organelles between mother and daughter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguilaniu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Erjavec and Nystrom, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McFaline-Figueroa et al., 2011</xref>). However, whether Sir2 mediates lifespan extension by DR in yeast is still under debate. Despite lots of reports supporting the role of Sir2 in DR-mediated lifespan extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lin et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lin et al., 2004</xref>), numerous studies challenged the hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jiang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kaeberlein et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fabrizio et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smith et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, in worms and flies, the role of Sir2 in lifespan extension is still controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tissenbaum and Guarente, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rogina and Helfand, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang and Tissenbaum, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burnett et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Viswanathan and Guarente, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banerjee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kanfi et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Here, we propose a new, potentially conserved, molecular mechanism of Sir2 in DR-mediated lifespan extension. Given the potential therapeutic implications of sirtuins, understanding the complex and controversial actions of sirtuins is one of central tasks in the sirtuin biology and aging field.

We show that Sir2 is able to increase RLS of yeast cells only under conditions where cAMP-PKA and CK2 signaling is not active. This result suggests that the role of Sir2 in DR-mediated lifespan extension depends on the metabolic status of cells, which is also supported by our previous report that the role of Sir2 in mediating oxidative stress resistance and chronological lifespan is growth-phase dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kang et al., 2014</xref>). We speculate that a similar paradigm may exist in higher eukaryotes, although the functions and molecular mechanisms of sirtuins are much more complex, because Sir2 S473 is a conserved phosphorylation site in all known sirtuins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gerhart-Hines et al., 2011</xref>) and numerous papers report the genetic and molecular interaction between cAMP-PKA and CK2 and SirT1 phosphorylation in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zschoernig and Mahlknecht, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gerhart-Hines et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dixit et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Park et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We also demonstrate that Sir2 fine-tunes transcription of the <italic>PMA1</italic> and RPGs by deacetylating H4K16 in the promoter. This finding indicates that Sir2-dependent H4K16 deacetylation plays a role in the regulation of actively transcribed genes in addition to the silencing of the rDNA locus, mating type loci, and telomeres in yeast. Considering previous studies showing that Sir2 binds on actively transcribed genes including <italic>PMA1</italic> and RPGs in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tsankov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2013</xref>), we expect this result will open a new perspective about the molecular functions of Sir2.</p><p>Pma1 protein level increases almost twofold in the absence of Sir2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Recent reports indicate that vacuolar acidity is functionally linked with mitochondria and autophagy, which have a central role in the aging process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hughes and Gottschling, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ruckenstuhl et al., 2014</xref>). And, vacuolar acidity declines in aging yeast cells because of Pma1 accumulation that reduces cytosolic protons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Henderson et al., 2014</xref>). It is thought that Pma1 expression affects yeast cell aging by changing intracellular pH, vacuolar pH, amino acid import into vacuole, and mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hughes and Gottschling, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Henderson et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, our study suggests a possibility that Sir2 contributes to DR-mediated lifespan extension at least in part by affecting mitochondrial function through cytoplasmic and vacuolar pH regulation in a context-dependent manner.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains and growth conditions</title><p>The yeast strains used in the study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

However, there were multiple technical points that would need to be addressed prior to publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Despite the title, the only experiment on life span extension, in the last figure, is wrongly interpreted. The lifespan data show that phosphorylation of Sir2 negatively regulates the lifespan extension activity of Sir2. This is in contrast to the title, Abstract, Results and Discussion, which interpret this result to indicate that the phosphorylation promotes lifespan extension. The text needs to be changed to appropriately interpret the data.</p><p>2) <italic>PMA1</italic> expression and H4K16 acetylation was affected by deleting <italic>PDE2</italic>, the high-affinity cAMP phosphodiesterase. This mutant showed hyperphosphorylated Sir2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, and this was speculated to alter Sir2 deacetylation activity. If this were the case, then it seems as though Sir2 activity at <italic>HMR</italic> would have been impacted, which it was not. You need to explain your ideas as to why <italic>HMR</italic> silencing was not changed.</p><p>3) The data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 3</xref>, that over expression of SIR2 causes resistance to salt and decreases <italic>PMA1</italic> expression, is an important finding and should be included in the main body of the text/figures.</p><p>4) The data regarding Sas2 and Sir2 do not fit your model and are inconsistent amongst themselves. Figure 1–figure supplement 4D shows that the <italic>sir2∆ sas2∆</italic> double mutant has less H4 K16ac, just like the <italic>sas2∆</italic>. This makes sense. However, the <italic>sir2∆ sas2∆</italic> double mutant has higher H4K16Ac by ChIP and has higher <italic>PMA1</italic> expression. The ChIP data suggest additional HATs for H4K16 at these loci; however the WB suggest that Sas2 is responsible for most of H4K16ac inside the cell. You need to explain what is a likely explanation for this contradiction.</p><p>5) Your proposal that <italic>PMA1</italic> and ribosomal protein gene regulation by Sir2 is a novel mechanism of regulating replicative lifespan and mediating DR effects, would be greatly strengthened by testing whether the <italic>sir2-S473</italic> mutants alter ribosomal DNA recombination/stability. Ideally, you should combine these mutants with a deletion of <italic>FOB1</italic> to stabilize the rDNA and then test if there is still an effect on lifespan.</p><p>6) Does the <italic>S473A</italic> mutant still interact with Cka2-flag through co-IP assays (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>)? According to the triple <italic>TPK</italic> mutant result, it shouldn't if phosphorylation at this site is required for the interaction. If it does, there could be other important phosphorylation sites involved. Similarly, they should show that the <italic>S473A</italic> mutant no longer shows the phosphorylation shift on the gel.</p><p>7) The Results and Discussion section is actually all results without any substantial discussion. At a minimum, you need to add an explanation of the proposed model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, and relate the new findings and model to other models of Sir2-mediated gene regulation or lifespan effects.</p><p>8) The actual <italic>P</italic> values for each yeast replicative lifespan assays need to be specifically stated in the figure legends or in a separate table.</p><p>9) For all real-time PCR data (RNA and ChIP), the number of biological replicates <italic>(n)</italic> performed needs to be indicated, to allow the reader to assess the quality and consistency of the data.</p><p>10) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>, panel B and C, the NaCl sensitivity by <italic>sir2∆</italic> seems much less than all the other NaCl or monovalent cation sensitivity experiments shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>;, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2A, C, E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 3B</xref>; Figure 1–figure supplement 4A; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, E</xref>).

The very low level of H4K16 acetylation shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 3D</xref> agrees well with other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kimura et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Suka et al., 2002</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 3A-C</xref> suggest additional HATs replacing Sas2 in the absence of Sir2, although we do not know which HAT acetylates H4K16 in the <italic>sir2</italic>Δ <italic>sas2</italic>Δ mutant. Actually, it is known that Esa1 (Essential SAS family Acetyltransferase) acts as a secondary HAT for H4K16 acetylation in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clarke et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Suka et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chang and Pillus, 2009</xref>; Oppikofer et al., 2011, A dual role of H4H6 acetylation in the establishment of yeast silent chromatin. EMBO J. 30: 2610-2621). We mentioned this possibility in the text (subsection “Sir2 negatively regulates <italic>PMA1</italic> transcription by deacetylating H4K16”).</p><p><italic>5) Your proposal that</italic> PMA1 <italic>and ribosomal protein gene regulation by Sir2 is a novel mechanism of regulating replicative lifespan and mediating DR effects, would be greatly strengthened by testing whether the</italic> sir2-S473 <italic>mutants alter ribosomal DNA recombination/stability. Ideally, you should combine these mutants with a deletion of</italic> FOB1 <italic>to stabilize the rDNA and then test if there is still an effect on lifespan</italic>.</p><p>We analyzed the replicative lifespan (RLS) of <italic>fob1</italic>Δ mutant cells expressing <italic>SIR2-S473E</italic> or <italic>SIR2-S473A</italic>. Under 2.0% glucose conditions, the RLS of the <italic>fob1</italic>Δ cells was decreased by the <italic>sir2-S473E</italic> mutation and increased by the <italic>sir2-S473A</italic> mutation. Under 0.5% glucose conditions, however, the <italic>sir2-S473A</italic> allele no longer extended the RLS of the <italic>fob1</italic>Δ cells. These results are similar with those obtained with <italic>FOB1</italic> cells. Thus, we conclude that the effect of phosphorylation at Sir2 S473 on RLS of yeast cells is independent of rDNA recombination/stability. The data are included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F-4G</xref> and in the text (subsection “Sir2 S473 phosphorylation inhibits DR-mediated lifespan extension by Sir2”).</p><p><italic>6) Does the</italic> S473A <italic>mutant still interact with Cka2-flag through co-IP assays (as in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3I</italic></xref><italic>)? According to the triple</italic> TPK <italic>mutant result, it shouldn't if phosphorylation at this site is required for the interaction.

Although Sir2-S473A proteins were still phosphorylated, the Sir2 phosphorylation induced by cAMP-PKA signaling was completely blocked in Sir2-S473A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>). This result suggests that Sir2 S473 is the major residue for Sir2 phosphorylation through cAMP-PKA signaling. The figure is shown as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref> and explained in the text (subsection “cAMP-PKA signaling inhibits Sir2 activity for the transcriptional repression of <italic>PMA1</italic> through serine 473 phosphorylation.”).</p><p><italic>7) The Results and Discussion section is actually all results without any substantial discussion.

But, LiCl sensitivity was similar (about 10-fold increase in the <italic>sir2</italic> mutant) in all strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1A, 1C</xref>). We repeated these experiments so many times and obtained consistent results. More importantly, the level of <italic>PMA1</italic> mRNA in the <italic>sir2</italic> mutant was consistently higher by about 40% than that in the wild type in all strains, and the amount of the Sir2 protein was increased at least two-fold in all strains tested (we added new western data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1E</xref>). Thus, we think that the seemingly inconsistent results are probably due to strain-specific characteristics related to NaCl sensitivity.</p><p><italic>11) In Figure 1–figure supplement 4, panel A</italic>, <italic>the</italic> sas2∆ <italic>strain grew poorly on YPD, which is even worse than in NaCl.
