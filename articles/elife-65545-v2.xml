(SERCA) plays a critical role in the contraction-relaxation cycle of muscle. In cardiac muscle, SERCA is regulated by the inhibitor phospholamban. A new regulator, dwarf open reading frame (DWORF), has been reported to displace phospholamban from SERCA. Here, we show that DWORF is a direct activator of SERCA, increasing its turnover rate in the absence of phospholamban. Measurement of in-cell calcium dynamics supports this observation and demonstrates that DWORF increases SERCA-dependent calcium reuptake. These functional observations reveal opposing effects of DWORF activation and phospholamban inhibition of SERCA. To gain mechanistic insight into SERCA activation, fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments revealed that DWORF has a higher affinity for SERCA in the presence of calcium. Molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations provide a model for DWORF activation of SERCA, where DWORF modulates the membrane bilayer and stabilizes the conformations of SERCA that predominate during elevated cytosolic calcium.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>calcium ATPase</kwd><kwd>membrane reconstitution</kwd><kwd>cellular calcium dynamics</kwd><kwd>fluorescence resonance energy transfer</kwd><kwd>molecular dynamics simulations</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL092321</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Robia</surname><given-names>Seth L</given-names></name><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>Howard S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL143816</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Robia</surname><given-names>Seth L</given-names></name><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>Howard S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM120142</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Espinoza-Fonseca</surname><given-names>L Michel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL148068</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Espinoza-Fonseca</surname><given-names>L Michel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL130231</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zima</surname><given-names>Aleksey V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN-2016-06478</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lemieux</surname><given-names>M Joanne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004411</institution-id><institution>Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>Howard S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Activation of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump and enhancement of cellular calcium homeostasis by dwarf open reading frame reveal how this small membrane protein opposes phospholamban inhibitory function in cardiac muscle.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium pump (SERCA) is an ion transporting ATPase that plays a critical role in intracellular calcium signaling. SERCA maintains calcium content of the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum, creating a 2000-fold gradient that can be mobilized for signaling via inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP<sub>3</sub>R) and ryanodine receptor (RyR) calcium channels. This signaling mechanism is essential for normal cell physiology, and disordered calcium handling underlies a diverse array of diseases including cardiomyopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">MacLennan and Kranias, 2003</xref>), skeletal muscle disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Treves et al., 2017</xref>), and neurological diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mekahli et al., 2011</xref>). In the heart, the cardiac-specific isoform SERCA2a maintains sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium stores, which is the major source of calcium for cardiac contractility. While SERCA calcium transport is essential for all cells, it is particularly important in cardiomyocytes where defects in SERCA activity or regulation are associated with cardiomyopathies and heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schmitt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haghighi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haghighi et al., 2003</xref>). This connection with heart failure has focused attention on SERCA as a possible target for therapy. An initially promising approach in animal models, increasing SERCA expression via gene delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Byrne et al., 2008</xref>), has proven challenging in human clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hulot et al., 2017</xref>). Nonetheless, the rationale for treating heart failure by improving calcium transport function remains compelling and orthogonal approaches may be required.</p><p>In the heart, SERCA activity is regulated to allow dynamic calcium homeostasis, which changes in response to the need for cardiac output during rest or exertion. A small transmembrane protein, phospholamban (PLN), is the primary regulatory subunit of SERCA in cardiac muscle. PLN inhibits SERCA by decreasing its apparent calcium affinity, thereby reducing both the rate of calcium reuptake and the amount of calcium in the SR. PLN inhibition of SERCA controls the rate of relaxation and the SR calcium load for subsequent contractions, modulating both the lusitropic and inotropic properties of the heart. PLN inhibition of SERCA is relieved by phosphorylation with the main mechanism involving protein kinase A (PKA) and the β-adrenergic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kirchberber et al., 1975</xref>). Under resting conditions, PLN is an important brake that prevents SR calcium overload and the arrhythmogenic consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Desantiago et al., 2008</xref>). In turn, regulation of PLN by phosphorylation – regulation of the regulator – creates a dynamic SR calcium load that can respond to the sympathetic need for increased cardiac output, the so-called ‘fight-or-flight’ response. Thus, there exists a pool of SERCA pumps in the SR membrane and their combined calcium transport capacity can be finely tuned – upregulated or downregulated – depending on the requirement for cardiac contractility.</p><p>Since the initial discovery of PLN decades ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kirchberber et al., 1975</xref>), it has stood as the only regulatory subunit of SERCA in ventricular muscle. This changed recently with the discovery of a small transmembrane SERCA-binding protein, dwarf open reading frame (DWORF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nelson et al., 2016</xref>). DWORF has weak sequence similarity to PLN and its skeletal muscle homolog sarcolipin (SLN), and it appears to comprise a transmembrane peptide of unknown structure and function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). DWORF was found to increase SERCA activity by opposing PLN function, leading to the hypothesis that DWORF is a non-inhibitory competitor that displaces PLN from the inhibitory groove of SERCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Makarewich et al., 2018</xref>). This raised the question, why is an additional means of reversing PLN inhibition necessary? PLN inhibition can be reversed by phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Karczewski et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Catalucci et al., 2009</xref>), elevated calcium concentrations, and we can now add DWORF as another level of redundancy in reversing SERCA inhibition by PLN. In the present study, we show that DWORF is a direct activator of SERCA activity, in addition to its role in displacing PLN from the inhibitory groove of SERCA. To elucidate DWORF function, we compared the ability of DWORF and PLN to directly regulate SERCA function. We measured the effects of DWORF on SERCA in a membrane reconstitution system, and we measured SERCA-dependent calcium dynamics and SERCA binding by DWORF during active intracellular calcium signaling in cells. We then modeled the structure of DWORF and the SERCA-DWORF complex, and evaluated their properties using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The results provide insight into DWORF structure and function and a role for DWORF in the direct regulation of the SERCA calcium pump.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Sequence alignment, secondary structure prediction, and transmembrane domain prediction for phospholamban and dwarf open reading frame (DWORF).</title><p>The predicted transmembrane domains are in bold letters.

These studies demonstrated that DWORF does not alter the apparent calcium affinity of SERCA. A recent study claimed to show that DWORF increases the apparent calcium affinity of SERCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2021</xref>), though our current data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and previous studies by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nelson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Makarewich et al., 2018</xref>) do not support their conclusion. To investigate if there was a direct functional effect of DWORF on the apparent calcium affinity (K<sub>Ca</sub>) or maximal activity (V<sub>max</sub>) of SERCA, we used an in vitro membrane co-reconstitution system (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ceholski et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Trieber et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Trieber et al., 2005</xref>). To achieve this, DWORF was co-reconstituted into membrane vesicles with SERCA and the calcium-dependent ATPase activity was measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The previously reported ATPase activity curves for SERCA in the absence and presence of PLN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Glaves et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gorski et al., 2013</xref>) were compared to the activity curves for SERCA in the absence and presence of DWORF. At a molar ratio of ~1–2 DWORF per SERCA, DWORF increased the turnover rate of SERCA at nearly all calcium concentrations tested (0.01–15 µM free calcium). The maximal activity (V<sub>max</sub>) of SERCA in the absence of DWORF increased 1.7-fold in the presence of DWORF (V<sub>max</sub> values were 4.1 ± 0. and 6.9 ± 0.1 µmol/min/mg, respectively). This level of SERCA activation is comparable to the small-molecule activator CDN1163 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kang et al., 2016</xref>). There was no significant effect of DWORF on the apparent calcium affinity of SERCA (K<sub>Ca</sub> values of 0.42 ± 0.03 and 0.48 ± 0.03 µM calcium, respectively). Thus, DWORF acted as a direct activator of SERCA by increasing its maximal activity (turnover rate).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>ATPase activity of sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium pump (SERCA) co-reconstituted into membrane vesicles in the absence and presence of dwarf open reading frame (DWORF).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) ATPase activity of SERCA membrane vesicles in the absence (black line) and presence of DWORF (gray line).

Our data are consistent with this observation, and we add a new facet of DWORF function as a direct activator of SERCA even in the absence of PLN. To determine whether increased ATPase activity was accompanied by increased cellular calcium transport activity, we utilized a newly developed approach for measuring calcium uptake into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of live cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bovo et al., 2019</xref>). The technique used an inducible human SERCA2a stable cell line (t-Rex-293 cells) containing the calcium release channel RyR2, which allows manipulation of ER calcium load, and an ER-targeted calcium indicator R-CEPIA1er, which allows measurement of ER calcium load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bovo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bovo et al., 2016</xref>). The cell line was transiently transfected with mCer-DWORF (or mCer-PLN) to assess regulation of SERCA2a. mCer-DWORF was predominantly expressed in the ER (estimated from the overlap between the mCer-DWORF and the R-CEPIA1er signals; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), with a distribution pattern similar to SERCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bovo et al., 2019</xref>). To determine SERCA2a function, the plasma membrane was permeabilized with saponin to allow control of the cytosolic-free calcium and ATP concentrations. ER calcium uptake was quantified from the increase in R-CEPIA1er fluorescence after full ER calcium depletion by caffeine followed by RyR2 inhibition with ruthenium red and tetracaine (RyR + Tetr; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), which blocks the principal calcium leak pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bovo et al., 2019</xref>). The first derivative of ER calcium uptake (<italic>d</italic>[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub>/<italic>d</italic>t) was plotted against the corresponding [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> to estimate the maximum ER calcium uptake rate and the maximum ER calcium load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). As expected, PLN transfection decreased ER calcium uptake compared to control. The opposite effect was observed with DWORF transfection, which almost doubled SERCA calcium uptake rate over the entire range of physiological ER calcium loads. These data indicated that DWORF acts as a potent activator of SERCA2a and this regulation is direct, not requiring pre-existing inhibition of SERCA by PLN. Moreover, it was noteworthy that DWORF enhanced the maximum ER calcium load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, arrow). Since the thermodynamic driving force for calcium transport is the ATP/ADP ratio, we conclude that DWORF enhances SERCA catalytic efficiency and reduces the energetic cost of calcium transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bovo et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Dwarf open reading frame (DWORF) enhances sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium pump (SERCA)-dependent calcium dynamics in cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Inducible human SERCA2a stable cell line (t-Rex-293 cells + Tetr) was transfected with mCer-DWORF together with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channel ryanodine receptor (RyR)2 and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-targeted Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator R-CEPIA1er.

Fluorescent protein tags were fused to SERCA, PLN, and DWORF, and intermolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) was quantified in cells expressing pairs of fusion proteins. This method was recently used to show that PLN and DWORF had similar apparent affinities for SERCA in intact cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Makarewich et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Singh et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, we previously showed that PLN affinity for SERCA is sensitive to calcium, where the affinity was decreased by high calcium in permeabilized cells or during extended calcium elevations in rapidly paced cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bidwell et al., 2011</xref>). This apparent change in affinity suggests that PLN binds more avidly to the conformations of SERCA that prevail under resting conditions when cytosolic calcium is low. The enhanced interaction with calcium-free forms of SERCA offers a mechanistic explanation for the effect of PLN on the apparent calcium affinity of SERCA. PLN binds to SERCA in a groove formed by transmembrane segments M2, M6, and M9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Toyoshima et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Winther et al., 2013</xref>). Upon calcium binding to SERCA, M2 undergoes a conformational change that closes the inhibitory groove and forms the calcium-bound E1 state of SERCA. PLN appears to act as a competitive inhibitor of calcium binding by impeding groove closure and formation of the calcium-bound E1 state.</p><p>To determine how the SERCA-DWORF regulatory complex responds to changes in calcium, we permeabilized cells expressing Cer-SERCA and YFP-PLN or YFP-DWORF in solutions mimicking low (diastolic; 0.1 µM) or high (systolic; 3 μM) intracellular calcium concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). FRET was quantified for each cell and compared to that cell's level of expression of the YFP acceptor. As previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kelly et al., 2008</xref>), FRET between SERCA-PLN was lowest for cells expressing low levels of protein and increased to a maximal level of ~25% FRET efficiency for high-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The relationship was well-described by a hyperbolic fit that yielded the apparent dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of the SERCA-PLN complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Permeabilization of cells in high calcium yielded a binding curve that was right-shifted to higher protein concentrations, suggesting a decrease in SERCA-PLN binding affinity compared to low calcium conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bidwell et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, the SERCA-DWORF regulatory complex showed the opposite response to calcium, with a small left-shift of the hyperbolic FRET versus protein concentration curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In this case, the binding curve was left-shifted to lower protein concentrations, suggesting an increase in SERCA-DWORF binding affinity at high calcium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The data indicate that high calcium decreases the affinity of PLN for SERCA, yet it has the opposite effect on DWORF where it increases the affinity for SERCA.

Hydrophobic moment analysis revealed an amphipathic helix comprising residues 1–13, which is remarkably like the N-terminus of PLN. However, DWORF has a shorter sequence following the proline residue (Pro<sup>21</sup> in PLN and Pro<sup>15</sup> in DWORF), which includes only the transmembrane domain. PLN has a polar helical region (residues Gln<sup>22</sup> to Asn<sup>30</sup>) that follows the proline residue and precedes the transmembrane domain (residues 31–51), and this feature is absent in DWORF. The presence of the amphipathic helix allows hydrophobic residues to be located on one side of the helix and hydrophilic residues on the other. In the molecular model, the hydrophobic residues are oriented towards the lipid bilayer, while the hydrophilic residues are exposed to the aqueous solvent.

The opposing functions of DWORF and PLN represent a previously unknown regulatory axis for fine-tuning SERCA-dependent calcium homeostasis in response to demand for cardiac output. Previous studies of DWORF overexpression in mouse models with normal PLN expression level demonstrated that peak systolic calcium transient amplitude and SR calcium load were significantly increased with DWORF overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nelson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Makarewich et al., 2018</xref>). While these findings were attributed to DWORF displacement of PLN and relief of SERCA inhibition, these findings are also consistent with a dual mechanism that includes direct activation of SERCA by DWORF.</p><p>The membrane reconstitution system allowed us to assess the effect of DWORF on SERCA function in a controlled membrane environment. This SERCA-DWORF two-component system is well-suited for measurements of ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ceholski et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Trieber et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Trieber et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gorski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Douglas et al., 2005</xref>) and calcium transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Smeazzetto et al., 2017</xref>) in the presence of regulatory subunits such as PLN and DWORF. PLN is a known inhibitor of SERCA in that it reduces the apparent affinity for calcium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Herein, we measured SERCA ATPase activity in the presence of DWORF, which allowed assessment of both the apparent calcium affinity and maximal activity of SERCA. Previous studies of DWORF function focused on the apparent calcium affinity of SERCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nelson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Makarewich et al., 2018</xref>). At a near equimolar ratio, DWORF acted as a direct activator by increasing the maximal activity of SERCA 1.7-fold without an effect on the apparent calcium affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The magnitude of the V<sub>max</sub> increase seen in the presence of DWORF (~1.7 fold) is similar to that seen in the presence of the small-molecule activator of SERCA, CDN1163 (~1.5-fold; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kang et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the important feature of DWORF and PLN regulation in cardiac muscle is that the regulatory subunits have different functions. The primary effect of PLN is to alter the apparent calcium affinity of SERCA, and the primary effect of DWORF is to alter the maximal activity of SERCA. These distinct but complimentary functions allow for a fine level of control of SERCA-mediated calcium homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Cellular effect of DWORF</title><p>Membrane co-reconstitution systems can provide mechanistic insight into SERCA regulation; however, it is both an advantage and disadvantage that they lack the complexity of a cellular environment. HEK293 cells have been established as a novel cardiomimetic system for evaluating SERCA-dependent calcium-handling and its regulation by PLN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bovo et al., 2019</xref>). This approach provides the complex environment of a cell, while avoiding the confounding effects of imaging cells during contractions. Co-expression of SERCA2a and RyR2 in this cell system causes periodic calcium transients (waves) similar to those that elicit contractions in cardiomyocytes. The HEK cell model lacks endogenous SERCA regulators, and it can be stably transfected with the exogenous regulators PLN and DWORF. This enabled the observation of ER calcium load, calcium uptake rate, and changes in the magnitude and frequency of calcium waves. These are SERCA-dependent cellular responses to changes in calcium concentration and the presence of SERCA regulatory subunits. This system was used to test the effects of DWORF on SERCA-dependent cellular calcium dynamics. As was observed for PLN, DWORF co-localized with SERCA in ER membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). DWORF increased two key parameters of SERCA function, ER calcium content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and ER calcium uptake rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These parameters reflect the kinetics and thermodynamics of SERCA in the absence and presence of DWORF, and the effects were opposite to what is seen for PLN.</p><p>An alternative measure of ER calcium load and SERCA activity was provided by the cardiomimetic HEK system, which generates periodic calcium waves due to spontaneous calcium release by RyR2 followed by SERCA calcium reuptake. Calcium release via RyR2 is known to depend on ER calcium load, which is determined by SERCA activity. Thus, the cytosolic calcium concentration during periodic calcium waves is an indirect measure of SERCA function in the absence and presence of DWORF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>). DWORF increased the amplitude and frequency of RyR-mediated calcium release events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, D</xref>). The SERCA-mediated calcium reuptake rate, ER calcium load, and calcium waves were all increased in DWORF-expressing cells, strongly suggesting that DWORF directly activates SERCA and increases its catalytic efficiency. These cellular data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>) agree with the activity data from reconstituted membranes containing SERCA and DWORF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>This raised the question, what is the mechanism by which DWORF activates SERCA? To address this, FRET efficiency between SERCA-PLN and SERCA-DWORF was measured at high and low calcium concentrations to assess the relative affinity of PLN and DWORF for the calcium-bound and calcium-free conformations of SERCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B</xref>). The data provided relative measures of the dissociation constants (K<sub>D</sub>) of the SERCA-PLN and SERCA-DWORF complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Previous studies have shown that PLN remains associated with SERCA even in the presence of calcium (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bidwell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dong and Thomas, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mueller et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2004</xref>). Consistent with these observations, elevated calcium did not abolish binding of PLN to SERCA, instead it reduced the apparent affinity of PLN for SERCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, C</xref>). In contrast, calcium increased the apparent affinity of DWORF for SERCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, C</xref>), revealing that DWORF prefers to interact with conformations of SERCA that prevail at high calcium. In the context of the current model of DWORF as a competitive inhibitor of PLN binding to SERCA, the data suggest that DWORF would compete more effectively when calcium is elevated, helping to relieve SERCA inhibition each time that increased transport function is required. In addition, the inverted calcium dependence of the SERCA-DWORF interaction offers an explanation for the direct activation of SERCA by DWORF observed in reconstituted membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and cellular calcium dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). While PLN inhibition involves preferential interaction and stabilization of SERCA enzymatic states that prevail at low calcium (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Asahi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jones et al., 2002</xref>), DWORF preferentially binds and stabilizes SERCA states that are populated during calcium elevations. This DWORF interaction enhances the kinetics of rate-limiting steps in the SERCA transport cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Unique structure of DWORF</title><p>A critical step was to evaluate the structure of DWORF in comparison to the well-characterized SERCA regulatory subunits PLN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Verardi et al., 2011</xref>) and SLN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Toyoshima et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Winther et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mascioni et al., 2002</xref>).

In the X-ray crystal structures of the SERCA-PLN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akin et al., 2013</xref>) and SERCA-SLN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Toyoshima et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Winther et al., 2013</xref>) complexes, PLN and SLN are found as continuous transmembrane helices (residues ~ 24–48 and ~1–31, respectively), though the cytoplasmic domain of PLN was not resolved. The helical transmembrane domains of PLN and SLN facilitate the structural interactions in the SERCA-bound states, and it is a critical feature of these peptides. In contrast, the DWORF transmembrane domain appears to be discontinuous (residues Leu<sup>17</sup> to Ser<sup>35</sup>), with a break at Pro<sup>15</sup> and an N-terminal helix that lies along the membrane surface (residues Met<sup>1</sup> to Leu<sup>13</sup>).</p><p>The molecular structure of the SERCA-DWORF complex remains unknown. The current hypothesis is that DWORF binds to the inhibitory groove and displaces PLN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nelson et al., 2016</xref>), and that DWORF and PLN have similar affinities for SERCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Singh et al., 2019</xref>). That said, the proposed helix-linker-helix structure of DWORF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6s</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>) allows us to speculate about potential mechanisms. The break at Pro<sup>15</sup> of DWORF occurs at a critical location for PLN and SLN inhibition of SERCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>). Asn<sup>34</sup> of PLN (Asn<sup>11</sup> in SLN) is an essential residue for SERCA inhibition, and it is positioned to interact with SERCA by the continuous transmembrane helix of PLN. Thus, if DWORF binds to SERCA and replaces PLN, DWORF lacks Asn<sup>34</sup> and N-terminal residues of PLN that contribute to SERCA inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). This model offers an explanation for why DWORF itself does not inhibit SERCA – the discontinuous transmembrane helix and the substitution of a proline residue are inconsistent with structural features known to contribute to SERCA inhibition. The model also offers an explanation for how DWORF activates SERCA. We have previously proposed that modulation of the lipid bilayer by PLN is a mechanism for enhancing SERCA maximal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Glaves et al., 2019</xref>). DWORF binding to the inhibitory groove of SERCA would be expected to modulate the lipid bilayer as suggested by the MD simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Importantly, the modulation of the lipid bilayer observed in the MD simulations is more pronounced on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane where it could impact the dynamics of transmembrane helices (e.g., M1 and M2) that form the calcium access funnel. The displacement of PLN, the absence of key inhibitory interactions (two essential residues of PLN include Leu<sup>31</sup> and Asn<sup>34</sup>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Trieber et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kimura et al., 1997</xref>), and perturbation of the membrane bilayer provide rationales for the higher maximal activity of SERCA in the presence of DWORF.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td valign="top">BL21(DE3)</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">CMC0016</td><td valign="top">Chemically competent cells</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pMAL c2x DWORF plasmid</td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">MBP-DWORF fusion; H.S.

The plots were constructed with Gnuplot v5.2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gnuplot.info">http://www.gnuplot.info</ext-link>) and figures were generated with PyMOL v1.7.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was supported in part through computational resources and services provided by Advanced Research Computing at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and Compute Canada (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.computecanada.ca">http://www.computecanada.ca</ext-link>).

peptide, dwarf open reading frame (DWORF), is a direct activator of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium pump (SERCA), which is responsible for maintaining high calcium within the SR. DWORF is the first known peptide activator of SERCA. Furthermore, they show that DWORF has a high affinity of SERCA in the presence of calcium.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Dwarf open reading frame (DWORF) is a direct activator of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump SERCA&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Amreen Mughal (Reviewer #1).</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after extensive consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that your work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>It was felt that the conclusions were not supported by the data. Also previous studies including by one of the current co-authors provided clear evidence that DWORF competes with phospholamban, contrary to the current study. The general interest is also unclear for the readership of <italic>eLife</italic> without some understanding of physiological regulation of DWORF's interaction with SERCA.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Fished and Bravo et al. show that DWORF can act as a direct activator of SERCA. Building on seminal earlier work from Nelson et al. (2016), they proposed that DWORF increases SERCA dependent calcium reuptake. The findings are interesting, but in the absence of in vivo experiments, have limited physiological relevance.</p><p>The authors raised an important question, namely why an additional DWORF dependent mechanism is necessary for reversing PLN inhibition, but they have not yet answered this question.</p><p>Comments for the authors:</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>1. Authors did not describe Sarcolipin in the introduction. As they performed experiments with Sarcolipin as well, it is important that authors introduce it and provide information to the readers: why those experiments are important for this manuscript.</p><p>2. Authors raised an important question &quot;This raised the question, why is an additional means of reversing PLN inhibition necessary?&quot; But they did not answer this question in the manuscript. It will be worth if authors include some relevant discussion based on their results to show why having DWORF dependent SERCA activation mechanism is important.</p><p>Results:</p><p>3. Figure 4A: There is a baseline shift in Ca<sup>2+</sup>[ER] in DWORF group compared to control and PLN. This shift could cause an increase in ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, but absolute change looks similar to other groups. Authors should clarify these results.</p><p>4. Figure 4: Please include representative cell images showing changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in different conditions.</p><p>5. All the experiments are performed in the absence of Phospholamban. However, phospholamban will be present in the physiological conditions, hence it is challenging to understand the physiological relevance of this work. There are no in vivo experiments performed to supports these results. Hence, authors should include this as a limitation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This work report the new finding that Dwarf open reading frame (DWORF) directly stimulates SERCA activity in vitro and in situ and it provides a molecular model for this action derived from FRET experiments and Molecular Dynamics simulations. The authors propose an interesting model for DWORF stimulation of SERCA, which awaits structural determination of the DWORF/SERCA2a complex: that the perturbation of the cytosolic side of the lipid bilayer may impact M1 and M2 movements near the Ca<sup>2+</sup> access funnel and facilitate pump loading and concomitantly stimulate transport efficiency.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The combination of multiple techniques to demonstrate the direct interaction between DWORF and SERCA, as well as the clear stimulation of SERCA enzymatic activity (ATPase) and transport activity (Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake) in the presence and more importantly absence of phosopholamban convincingly validates the hypothesis that DWORF directly activates SERCA. The co-reconstitution of SERCA with DWORF clearly shows enzymatic increases to levels comparable to maxes reported in the presence of high phospholamban and the known SERCA agonist CDN1163. The functional measurements of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport and ER loading in the stable SERCA2a HEK-293 cell line is an excellent complement to the enzymology and provides additional confidence for direct DWORF activation. Clearly, this observation expands our knowledge of how SERCA activity is cellularly regulated and is likely an important component to our understanding of excitation-contraction coupling.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>There are no apparent weaknesses with experimental results or the stated interpretation of these data. However, the discussion of the proposed model of DWORF stimulation generated by the modeling leaves a few unaddressed questions, the most significant being the following. The molecular modeling suggests that DWORF, like PLN binds in the inhibitory groove formed by M2, M6, and M9. Indeed, the proposed mechanism of PLN inhibition of SERCA is by competing for the enzyme conformation which binds Ca<sup>2+</sup>; specifically, the binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> causes a shift in M2 that closes the inhibitory groove such that the binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and PLN are mutually exclusive. It is then puzzling how Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding facilitates DWORF binding, if indeed it is within the same inhibitory groove.</p><p>Comments for the authors:</p><p>1) The only grammatical errors identified is in the Methods on page 12, line 6. &quot;Data was fit with….&quot; Should be &quot;Data were fit with….&quot;</p><p>2) The authors talk about structural differences between PLN and DWORF and the reader can make their own inferences as to how these minor differences might explain how DWORF binding is stabilized by Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding, where PLN is destabilized. Nevertheless, this is something the authors may consider discussing a bit further as they certainly must have pondered the dichotomy. Along these lines, a few of the authors published a recent paper suggesting that SERCA dimerization plays a role in pump stimulation (Biophysical J. 119(7), 2020). It may be worth discussing how DWORF may contribute (or not) to the quaternary structure of SERCA and its physiologic function.</p><p>3) A few years ago a couple of the current authors published similar work on DWORF stimulation of SERCA (Makarewich et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2018;7:e38319). In that report, they were pretty certain the DWORF mode of action was via competition with phospholamban. Indeed, the reviewers asked them to address the possibility that DWORF might directly modulate SERCA activity and they performed further experiments and concluded that DWORF only worked via PLN competition. Here is Makarewich et al. rebuttal to the reviewer's inquiry, &quot;We have performed suggested experiments 'a' and 'c' and have included these results as Figure 2—figure supplement 3. Consistent with our previous publication on DWORF (Nelson et al., 2016), we found that co-expression of DWORF with unregulated SERCA did not lead to a direct or additive stimulation of SERCA activity (Figure 2—figure supplement 3B and C). Instead, we found that the ability of DWORF to simulate SERCA activity lies in its capacity to compete PLN off of SERCA and reduce the inhibitory effects of PLN on SERCA. This competitive displacement of PLN from SERCA can be very clearly seen in immunoprecipitation experiments shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 3A.&quot; Thus, this apparent mechanistic reversal deserves some explanation beyond &quot;Compared to previous reports (12),…&quot; stated on page 3. Specifically, in the 2018 <italic>eLife</italic> paper, Figure 2, supplement Figure 3B and 3C (purple), the direct stimulation of SERCA by DWORF is not apparent. What was missing in those previous experiments that prevented the observation that seems clear in the current manuscript? This information may be useful to other investigators studying SERCA regulation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this study, Fisher et al. investigated the interaction of the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium pump (SERCA) and the SERCA-binding protein small dwarf open reading frame (DWORF). Previous studies have shown that DWORF does not directly activate the SERCA pump and does not change the apparent affinity of SERCA for Ca+2. The current consensus in the field is that DWORF regulates the relative affinity of SERCA for Ca<sup>2+</sup> by relieving the inhibition of PLN. In contrast to previous studies, the authors claim that DWORF directly regulates SERCA activity and calcium reuptake that is independent of its known role in relieving the inhibition of PLN. However, this major claim is not supported by the data presented in the manuscript.</p><p>Comments for the authors:</p><p>1. In Figure 2b it is shown that DWORF directly increases SERCA activity. Is this effect dose depended? Does the molar ratio of DWORF/SERCA affects the Vmax? It is also important to show the regulation of SERCA activity by DWORF in the presence and absence of PLN, phosphorylated PLN and SLN.</p><p>2. Related to the previous comment, there is a leftward shift of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity curve in the presence of DWORF (Figure 2b), suggesting that the affinity for Ca<sup>2+</sup> is increased. Is this significant? How do the authors explain this effect?</p><p>3. In Figure 2a the data shows that PLN increases the Vmax of SERCA. This is puzzling as PLN is known to regulate the affinity os SERCA for Ca<sup>2+</sup> but does not affect the Vmax. Is there an explanation for this observation? Also, the dose response curve and error bars should be shown on the graph.</p><p>4. The dose response curve of the small molecule CDN1163 should be shown in Figure 2C.</p><p>5. The authors used the skeletal muscle SERCA isoform SERCA1b in the reconstituted vesicles system and cardiac isoform, Serca2a, in the cell-based experiments. Are there any particular reasons why different isoforms were used in different experiments? Does DWORF regulate the activity of all SERCA isoforms?</p><p>6. Figure 3. How do the authors explain the discrepancies between the findings of the current study and the previous studies? For example, using a similar cellular model of DWORF overexpression (Cos7 cells co-transfected with SERCA2a) it has been reported that cells expressing SERCA2a and DWORF alone do not exhibit enhanced SERCA activity indicating that DWORF itself does not biochemically activate SERCA. Additional experiments are needed to clary this discrepancy. What is the effect of DWORF on SERCA2a in the presence of PLN and/or SLN in the cellular model used here? Is the Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake kinetics affected by the stoichiometry of the overexpressed proteins? As the levels of the overexpressed proteins are not titrated, it is likely that these observations represent artifacts associated with protein overexpression.</p><p>7. Figure 4a. The calcium transient frequency is significantly increased in the presence of DWORF. This suggest an increased RYR activity in the presence of DOWRF. Is there an indirect/direct effect of the RyR2 overexpression on the observed SERCA Ca<sup>2+</sup> kinetics? Is RyR2 necessary for the regulation of SERCA by DWORF?</p><p>8. Figure 4b. Ideally the Ca<sup>2+</sup> reuptake kinetics, eg Tau, should be measured under electrically stimulated conditions as the frequency of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> release will affected the kinetics. It is likely that the increase of Tau by DWORF reflect the increase of the oscillation frequency.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65545.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: The authors appealed the original decision.

Authors raised an important question &quot;This raised the question, why is an additional means of reversing PLN inhibition necessary?&quot; But they did not answer this question in the manuscript. It will be worth if authors include some relevant discussion based on their results to show why having DWORF dependent SERCA activation mechanism is important.</p></disp-quote><p>The answer to this question is that DWORF is more than just an additional means of reversing PLN inhibition. DWORF is a direct activator of SERCA, which increases the dynamic physiological range of calcium that can be mobilized in response to demand for cardiac output. This question appears in the Introduction (on page 3 of our manuscript) and we have modified this paragraph to provide an immediate answer and preview of our results. The statement now reads: “This raised the question, why is an additional means of reversing PLN inhibition necessary? PLN inhibition can be reversed by phosphorylation (13, 14), elevated calcium concentrations, and we can now add DWORF as another level of redundancy in reversing SERCA inhibition by PLN. In the present study, we show that DWORF is a direct activator of SERCA activity, in addition to its role in displacing PLN from the inhibitory groove of SERCA.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results:</p><p>3. Figure 4A: There is a baseline shift in Ca<sup>2+</sup>[ER] in DWORF group compared to control and PLN. This shift could cause an increase in ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, but absolute change looks similar to other groups. Authors should clarify these results.</p></disp-quote><p>We will be happy to clarify these results. The baseline shift is caused by an increase in ER calcium concentration, which is due to increased SERCA activity with DWORF expression. This can be seen in the upper panel of Figure 4B. DWORF causes both a baseline shift (increase in ER calcium load) and an absolute change (increase in the amplitude of calcium release from the ER). Changes in these two parameters are directly related to changes in SERCA function and they underscore the functional significance of the novel mechanisms described in our manuscript. We have clarified the description of these results to indicate that ER calcium load increases with DWORF co-expression (page 4). The text now reads:</p><p>“Coexpression of DWORF resulted in increased ER calcium load (Figure 4B; [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub>) and increased frequency (Figure 4B; Tau(s)) and amplitude of spontaneous calcium waves, suggesting a significantly faster calcium reuptake due to increased SERCA activity.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

All the experiments are performed in the absence of Phospholamban.

The original paper describing DWORF looked at WT, DWORF overexpression, and DWORF knockout mice (2). All mouse models had normal phospholamban expression levels. Peak systolic calcium transient amplitude and SR calcium load were significantly increased in the DWORF overexpression adult cardiomyocytes.

The following statements have been added:</p><p>“Previous studies of DWORF overexpression in mouse models with normal PLN expression level demonstrated that peak systolic calcium transient amplitude and SR calcium load were significantly increased with DWORF overexpression (11, 12).

Early models for the SERCA-PLN interaction suggested that calcium relieves SERCA inhibition by dissociating the complex. However, there is now extensive evidence indicating that PLN remains bound to SERCA in the presence of calcium (e.g. (3-6)). In addition, the crystal structure of the SERCA-PLN complex clearly shows that SERCA is in an E1-like state similar to the calcium-bound state of SERCA (7-9). Importantly, the FRET data shown in Figure 5 of our manuscript clearly shows that PLN remains associated with SERCA in the presence of calcium, though the binding affinity is lower.</p><p>We have clarified this point in the Discussion section of our manuscript (page 8). The statement now reads:</p><p>“Previous studies have shown that PLN remains associated with SERCA even in the presence of calcium (e.g. (24, 42-44)).

We do not have direct experimental evidence of a relationship between DWORF/PLN regulation and SERCA dimerization; as far as we know these are distinct structure/function mechanisms. However, both dimerization and DWORF/PLN modulate specific steps in the enzymatic cycle so there may be an undiscovered mechanistic connection. While this is beyond the scope of the present manuscript, a future detailed kinetic study may correlate SERCA dimer conformational coupling and SERCA regulation by DWORF/PLN.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A few years ago a couple of the current authors published similar work on DWORF stimulation of SERCA (Makarewich et al., eLife 2018;7:e38319).

The previous studies of DWORF, including the original paper (2) and the mentioned <italic>eLife</italic> paper (1), focused on the apparent affinity of SERCA for calcium (KCa), which is not significantly changed by DWORF. They did not examine the maximal activity (Vmax) of SERCA in these studies, which is the parameter modulated by DWORF. It is difficult to measure Vmax from mouse heart homogenates, but this parameter is accessible in the well-defined biochemical preparations used in the present study. In summary, we do not consider our present results to be in conflict with the previous papers (1,2), as we did not observe an effect of DWORF on the KCa of SERCA. Our results provide a new facet of SERCA regulation by DWORF and build on the important contributions of previous studies (1,2).</p><p>To clarify this point, we have added statements to the Results section of our manuscript (page 3).

We have addressed this inconsistency in the revised version of our manuscript. We have added the following statement to the Results section of our manuscript (page 3):</p><p>“A recent study claimed to show that DWORF increases the apparent calcium affinity of SERCA (15), though our current data (Figure 2) and previous studies by others (11, 12) do not support their conclusion.”</p><p>The publication of the Li et al. study further increases the urgency for dissemination of our data and manuscript, which clearly show that DWORF does not alter the KCa of SERCA and instead it increases the Vmax of SERCA.

Importantly, those previous studies did not look at the maximal activity (Vmax) of SERCA, thus our discovery of a direct effect on Vmax by DWORF are not in conflict with previous reports (1,2).

In support of these proposed novel mechanisms, we provide biochemical measurements of SERCA ATPase activity and unique, quantitative in-cell measurements of SERCA calcium transport kinetics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comments for the authors:</p><p>1. In Figure 2b it is shown that DWORF directly increases SERCA activity. Is this effect dose depended? Does the molar ratio of DWORF/SERCA affects the Vmax? It is also important to show the regulation of SERCA activity by DWORF in the presence and absence of PLN, phosphorylated PLN and SLN.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, we have done a dose response of DWORF in the presence of SERCA. At equimolar ratios of SERCA-DWORF, DWORF directly activates SERCA as presented. Based on the available literature, this condition best represents the physiological situation. Under extreme, non-physiological conditions of excess DWORF, we have observed modest SERCA inhibition manifested as a decrease in calcium affinity and a decrease in maximal activity. We have chosen not to include this latter data as it is certainly non-physiological, and it will confuse readers. The revised manuscript emphasizes the importance of controlling this parameter. The following statement has been added to the Methods section (page 10):</p><p>“To ensure the proper ratio of ~2 DWORF per SERCA in the reconstituted proteoliposomes, quantitative SDS-PAGE was used with known quantities of SERCA and DWORF proteins as standards (17, 18, 50).”</p><p>For the second point, our goal was to elucidate a direct effect of DWORF on SERCA and our results clearly support this novel mechanism. It is generally accepted that DWORF displaces PLN and our goal was not to reiterate the conclusions of previous reports (1,2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Related to the previous comment, there is a leftward shift of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity curve in the presence of DWORF (Figure 2b), suggesting that the affinity for Ca<sup>2+</sup> is increased. Is this significant? How do the authors explain this effect?</p></disp-quote><p>There is a small rightward shift (not a leftward shift) of the calcium affinity curve in the presence of DWORF (in Figure 2b), but this is not statistically significant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In Figure 2a the data shows that PLN increases the Vmax of SERCA. This is puzzling as PLN is known to regulate the affinity os SERCA for Ca<sup>2+</sup> but does not affect the Vmax. Is there an explanation for this observation? Also, the dose response curve and error bars should be shown on the graph.</p></disp-quote><p>SERCA and PLN are present together in cardiac SR membranes at molar ratios ranging from 1:1 to 1:4. At the higher molar ratios (1:4), PLN inhibits SERCA at low calcium concentrations (effect on KCa) and it increases the maximal activity of SERCA at higher calcium concentrations. The Young lab has previously studied this effect (10-15). Figure 2a showed fitted curves from previously published data and it was presented for comparison with the new SERCA-DWORF data. In retrospect, the effect of PLN on SERCA at different molar ratios is not important for this study and is confusing for the reader. We have modified the figure to show the effect of PLN on SERCA at an equimolar 1:1 ratio, which will better compare to the data for equimolar ratio of DWORF and SERCA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The dose response curve of the small molecule CDN1163 should be shown in Figure 2C.</p></disp-quote><p>The CDN1163 compound has been thoroughly studied and published by others (16).

Because it expresses high levels of the SERCA1a isoform, it is the standard source of enzyme in the field. The two isoforms (SERCA1a and 2a) are 84% identical, and their molecular structures have been determined to be identical (17). We have previously shown that PLN regulates SERCA1a and SERCA2a in a similar manner (18). Most important, DWORF has been shown to co-immunoprecipitate with all SERCA isoforms (2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Figure 3. How do the authors explain the discrepancies between the findings of the current study and the previous studies?

As the levels of the overexpressed proteins are not titrated, it is likely that these observations represent artifacts associated with protein overexpression.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our responses to similar questions above. In our revision, we have explained more clearly that there is no discrepancy. In a previous study, COS7 cells co-transfected with SERCA2a and DWORF were used for co-immunoprecipitation studies and measurement of the calcium affinity of SERCA (2). To quote this study “We found that coexpression of DWORF alone with SERCA2a did not change the apparent affinity of SERCA for Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but it relieved the inhibition by PLN in a dose-dependent manner (Figure S15).” Thus, these studies focused on the KCa of SERCA and not the Vmax. Our results are completely consistent with these prior studies by the Olson laboratory (2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Figure 4a. The calcium transient frequency is significantly increased in the presence of DWORF. This suggest an increased RYR activity in the presence of DOWRF. Is there an indirect/direct effect of the RyR2 overexpression on the observed SERCA Ca<sup>2+</sup> kinetics? Is RyR2 necessary for the regulation of SERCA by DWORF?</p></disp-quote><p>Our data shows that DWORF increases the ER calcium content, which is dependent on the presence of SERCA. As the ER calcium content increases, the frequency of spontaneous calcium release mediated by RyR2 also increases. A similar effect is observed in cardiomyocytes. Calcium transient (calcium wave) frequency is increased in cells expressing DWORF (Figure 4C). This effect is mediated by increased SERCA activity and the resulting increase in ER calcium load. Indeed, it is well known that an increase in SR calcium load during SERCA activation (adrenergic activation) increases the frequency of spontaneous calcium transients in myocytes.</p><p>We can rule out an effect of DWORF on RyR, since it has been shown by many labs (including (19)) that RyR activation would only transiently increase calcium transient frequency. As SR calcium gets depleted during RyR activation, calcium transients would be reduced to control levels. Sustained increases in spontaneous calcium transient frequency can only be achieved by increased SERCA activity.</p><p>Moreover, in vitro ATPase measurements show that RyR is not required for SERCA activation by DWORF. We express RyR for the live cell calcium uptake assay as a way to manipulate ER calcium load (by producing spontaneous CICR or by activating/inhibiting RyR), so SERCA function can be studied throughout a wide range of ER calcium loads.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Figure 4b. Ideally the Ca<sup>2+</sup> reuptake kinetics, eg Tau, should be measured under electrically stimulated conditions as the frequency of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> release will affected the kinetics.

Calcium release frequency only affects uptake kinetics insofar as it may affect the ER calcium load, a parameter that is carefully quantified here. An important aspect of our in-cell experiments is the calibration of the fluorescent ER calcium indicator at the end of each experiment. ER content calibration allows us to specifically determine uptake rate as a function of ER calcium load. We also control the cytosolic calcium concentration (buffered to 100 nM), and we quantify ER leak rate independent of SERCA and RyR. Our unique approach yields quantitative measurements of maximal uptake rate and maximal ER calcium load as intrinsic features of SERCA function.</p><p>References:</p><p>1. Makarewich, C.
