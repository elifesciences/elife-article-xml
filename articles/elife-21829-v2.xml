Some persistent viruses have evolved strategies to inhibit TAP so that they may go undetected by the immune system. The herpes simplex virus for example evades immune surveillance by blocking peptide transport with a small viral protein ICP47. In this study, we determined the structure of human TAP bound to ICP47 by electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) to 4.0 Å. The structure shows that ICP47 traps TAP in an inactive conformation distinct from the normal transport cycle. The specificity and potency of ICP47 inhibition result from contacts between the tip of the helical hairpin and the apex of the transmembrane cavity. This work provides a clear molecular description of immune evasion by a persistent virus. It also establishes the molecular structure of TAP to facilitate mechanistic studies of the antigen presentation process.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21829.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21829.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>cryo-electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>immune evasion</kwd><kwd>herpes simplex virus</kwd><kwd>transporter</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grigorieff</surname><given-names>Nikolaus</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Jue</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Herpes simplex virus evades the immune response by inhibiting the TAP transporter with a peptide inhibitor ICP47 that has an extensive interface at the peptide translocation cavity and locks the transporter in an inactive state.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cytotoxic T cells detect and eliminate infected cells by recognizing viral peptides displayed on the cell surface by major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I) molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blum et al., 2013</xref>). The viral peptides are generated in the cytosol and loaded onto MHC-I molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) transports these cytosolic peptides into the ER lumen, where a multi-component peptide-loading complex facilitates peptide-binding to nascent MHC-I molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Neefjes et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shepherd et al., 1993</xref>). Upon formation of a stable complex with peptides, MHC-I molecules are released from the ER and exported to the cell surface. Receptors on circulating T cells react to pathogen-derived and malignant peptides, leading to a cytotoxic event that kills the diseased cells. T cells that recognize peptides derived from normal cellular proteins are eliminated or inactivated during development to prevent an autoimmune response, a process called immune tolerance. TAP-deficient cells have a reduced surface expression of MHC-I molecules and are less sensitive to cytotoxic T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deverson et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Monaco et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Spies et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Trowsdale et al., 1990</xref>)</p><p>TAP is an ER-resident transporter formed by two homologous subunits, TAP1 and TAP2. Similar to other ABC transporters, it contains two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) that hydrolyze ATP and two transmembrane domains (TMDs) that bind the substrate. In addition, both TAP1 and TAP2 contain an N-terminal transmembrane region (TMD0) that interacts with tapasin to form the larger peptide-loading complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hulpke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Procko et al., 2005</xref>). TAP’s broad substrate specificity is one of the most important properties for its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Androlewicz and Cresswell, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Momburg et al., 1994a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Neefjes et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">van Endert et al., 1995</xref>). Humans typically express six different MHC-I molecules, each binding to a large variety of peptides and conferring a different specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Falk et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hunt et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jardetzky et al., 1991</xref>). The same TAP transporter provides peptides for all six MHC-I molecules; therefore, it must be more promiscuous than any single MHC-I molecule. The substrate specificity of TAP has been studied extensively. The only sequence constraint found for human TAP is a preference for a hydrophobic or basic residue at the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Momburg et al., 1994b</xref>). Interestingly, this peptide preference complements MHC-I specificity in that an acidic C-terminus is rarely seen in MHC-I presented peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rammensee et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Despite its ability to transport a diverse range of peptides up to 40 residues long (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Momburg et al., 1994a</xref>), TAP is still subject to inhibition by some viral peptides. For example, human herpes simplex virus (HSV) encodes the potent TAP inhibitor ICP47 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Früh et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hill et al., 1995</xref>). Peptides containing the N-terminal 34 residues of ICP47 are sufficient to bind TAP and prevent peptide translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galocha et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Neumann et al., 1997</xref>). Suppressing the presentation of viral peptides renders HSV-infected cells undetectable to cytotoxic T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">York et al., 1994</xref>). This mechanism contributes to the lifelong infection of HSV. It also raises an intriguing question: How does a viral peptide inhibit a promiscuous peptide transporter?</p><p>Previously, we determined the structure of a TAP/ICP47 complex using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Oldham et al., 2016</xref>). This structure, at 6.5 Å resolution, showed that the N-terminal region of ICP47 forms a helical hairpin, inserting itself into TAP’s substrate translocation pathway. We have continued to study this system to establish the molecular structure of TAP and to understand the chemical nature of the inhibition. Here we present a 4.0 Å cryo-EM reconstruction of the human TAP/ICP47 complex and describe the specific atomic interactions that allow the viral peptide to bind tightly to TAP and lock it in an inactive state.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cryo-EM attempts to improve the resolution</title><p>One major modification we incorporated for our new data collection was using a higher magnification. As the ordered region of the TAP/ICP47 complex has a molecular mass of only 130 kDa and exhibits a pseudo-twofold symmetry, two factors likely limiting resolution are the accuracy with which the noisy cryo-EM images of single particles can be aligned and the ability to distinguish pseudo-symmetrically related views. Since the predominant secondary structure observed in TAP/ICP47 complex is helical, we expect that the signal in the 7–8 Å resolution range is important for alignment. The higher magnification reduced the effective pixel size of the images from 1.35 Å used in our previous study to 1.04 Å (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), boosting the detective quantum efficiency (DQE) of the K2 Summit detector (Gatan, Inc.) at 7 Å resolution by about 6% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McMullan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ruskin et al., 2013</xref>). We also lowered the dose rate from 10 electrons per pixel to eight in order to minimize coincidence loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2013</xref>) and limited data collection to areas of the grids that showed good contrast of the particles, presumably correlating with regions of the grids that had the thinnest ice.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21829.002</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Summary of Cryo-EM data.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21829.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21829.002</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Imaging</th><th/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Microscope</td><td>Titan Krios I, 300keV (FEI)</td></tr><tr><td>Detector</td><td>K2 Summit direct electron detector (Gatan)</td></tr><tr><td>Energy filter</td><td>10 eV (Gatan)</td></tr><tr><td><bold>Data collection</bold></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Pixel size</td><td>1.04 Å</td></tr><tr><td>Movies</td><td>3875</td></tr><tr><td>Frames</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Total exposure time</td><td>10 s</td></tr><tr><td>Exposure time per frame</td><td>0.2 s</td></tr><tr><td>Total exposure</td><td>74 electrons/Å<sup>2</sup></td></tr><tr><td>Exposure per frame</td><td>1.48 electrons/Å<sup>2</sup>/frame</td></tr><tr><td>Defocus range</td><td>−1.5 to −3.5 μm</td></tr><tr><td><bold>Final reconstruction</bold></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Number of particles</td><td>501,973</td></tr><tr><td>B-factor correction</td><td>−150 Å<sup>2</sup></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>To optimize data processing, we compared three methods to correct electron beam-induced specimen movement: whole frame alignment using Unblur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grant and Grigorieff, 2015</xref>), individual particle alignment using alignparts_lmbfgs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rubinstein and Brubaker, 2015</xref>), and a combination of both. The best result was obtained by whole frame alignment followed by individual particle tracking. This combination of methods also works best for other small particles such as the γ-secretase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bai et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Reconstruction and refinement were performed in Frealign (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grigorieff, 2016</xref>) using the previous 6.5 Å reconstruction as an initial reference. As Frealign automatically weights each particle according to its correlation to the model, we obtained the best reconstruction without prior 2D or 3D classification using only Frealign’s score-based particle weighting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grigorieff, 1998</xref>). This resulted in weighting coefficients at 4 Å that varied by about ±10% (about 5% of the particles received such low scores that they were effectively excluded at 4 Å resolution). Hence, we used all 502,000 particles that were automatically extracted from the micrographs for the 3D reconstruction. To exclude variable density corresponding to the detergent micelles and the flexible TMD0 domains, alignment was performed with a mask surrounding only the structured region of the protein. This mask was generated from the 6.5 Å reconstruction and low-pass filtered to 8 Å to remove high-resolution information. The mask was then applied using Frealign’s 3D masking option (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grigorieff, 2016</xref>), specifying a smooth edge of about 5 Å and leaving the density outside the mask in place and low-pass-filtered to 30 Å resolution. This enabled parts of the disordered regions of the complex to contribute to the alignment at low resolution while only the signal from the well-ordered parts of the complex contribute at high resolution.</p><p>The final reconstruction has an average resolution of 4.0 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Analyzing regional variations in resolution using the program Blocres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cardone et al., 2013</xref>) indicates that the TM region is better resolved than the two NBDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The density map for ICP47 and the TMDs of TAP shows prominent side chain density sufficient to register the amino acid identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>). The density corresponding to the two NBDs is adequate to assign secondary structure but lacks side chain definition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). With this map, we built and refined a model containing the 12 core TM-helices of TAP and the N-terminal 55 residues of ICP47 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Poly-alanine models of the NBDs were generated from a rat TAP1 NBD crystal structure (PDB 1JJ7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gaudet and Wiley, 2001</xref>) using the program Modeller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Webb and Sali, 2016</xref>) and were placed into the cryo-EM density as rigid bodies.

In the inward-facing structures of other ABC exporters such as P-gp (pdb: 4F4C), access to the TM pathway is blocked from the extracellular side of the membrane by TM 1 and TM 6 of both subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jin et al., 2012</xref>). In TAP, however, this gating region is cracked open by ICP47 to a width approximately 4 Å in diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In addition, a lateral opening to the membrane leaflet is observed near the ER lumen side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The presence of ICP47 blocks both openings; otherwise there would be a continuous pathway across the membrane, a state violating the alternating access model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jardetzky, 1966</xref>). Therefore, it is most likely that the ER openings observed in the structure of TAP/ICP47 complex are induced by ICP47.

Previous studies suggest that this contact alone is sufficient to prevent substrate binding and subsequent conformational changes associated with transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galocha et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Neumann et al., 1997</xref>). Residues 35–55 of ICP47 continue to pack closely along TAP2 TM3 and make contact with IH1 (intracellular helix 1), a coupling helix at the TMD/NBD interface. The last ordered residue of ICP47, P55, interacts with Y477, which normally makes an aromatic stacking interaction with the adenine ring of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The interactions between ICP47 and TAP1 are less extensive and are largely confined to the loop region at the tip of the helical hairpin.</p><p>A better understanding of which residues contribute most to the overall energy of binding comes from functional data, where each of the first 35 residues on ICP47 were mutated to alanine one at a time and assayed for TAP inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galocha et al., 1997</xref>). Mutations that reduced the activity by more than 50% are located in one region, from positions 18 to 25, where the two helices are connected by a sharp turn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Previously, we generated a ‘turn-to-helix’ mutant by replacing residues in the same region (16–22) with alanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Oldham et al., 2016</xref>). This mutant, predicted to have a higher propensity to form a long alpha-helix rather than the hairpin structure, indeed reduced the activity of ICP47 by a factor of five (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Oldham et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>To understand which residues on TAP are critical for binding to ICP47, we compared sequences of TAP that are sensitive to ICP47 inhibition with those resistant to it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Previous studies showed that ICP47 from HSV inhibits TAP in human, monkey, pig, cow and dog cells, but not in rabbit, mouse and rat cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahn et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jugovic et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Verweij et al., 2011</xref>). Among the 36 residues that make contacts with ICP47, a small set of residues are highly conserved in ICP47-sensitive species but not in rabbit, mouse and rat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, boxed residues). When we map these residues onto the human TAP/ICP47 structure we observe that all but one of them are located near the apex of the TM cavity, interacting with the ‘hot spot’ residues in ICP47 that were identified in the alanine scan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galocha et al., 1997</xref>). Thus, it appears that in the setting of a very large interface between TAP and ICP47, amino acid changes in this region are particularly important and account for TAP susceptibility to ICP47 among the species analyzed here. For example, both mouse and rat contain a T425N substitution, which is incompatible with the close contacts between T425 and F11 and Y22 of ICP47 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Substituting F11 or Y22 with alanine reduced lCP47 inhibition by 40% and 60% respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galocha et al., 1997</xref>). The lack of ICP47 inhibition in rabbit cells can be explained by the substitution of S421 with the large, charged arginine residue, which probably prevents insertion of the helical hairpin into the top of TM cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Therefore, two independent approaches—mutagenesis to identify functional hotspots on ICP47 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galocha et al., 1997</xref>) and analysis of specificity determinants on TAP—both point to the same molecular interface at the tip of the helical hairpin as being crucial to the action of ICP47 to inhibit TAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21829.010</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Sequence alignment of the TAP residues that contact ICP47.</title><p>ICP47 inhibits TAP from human, owl monkey, pig, cow and dog (the top five sequences), but not that of rabbit, mouse and rat (the bottom three sequences).

TAP transports peptide antigens into the ER through conformational changes powered by ATP binding and hydrolysis. Based on what we have learned from homologous ABC transporters, we can envision that in the absence of substrate and ATP, TAP rests in an inward-facing conformation in which the two NBDs are separated and the translocation pathway faces the cytoplasm. Upon binding to the substrate and ATP, the two NBDs form a closed dimer and the translocation pathway orients towards the ER lumen to release the peptide. ATP hydrolysis at the closed NBD dimer interface resets TAP to its resting state, ready for the next transport cycle. ICP47 precludes substrate binding by inserting a long helical hairpin into the translocation pathway. The strong interaction between ICP47 and TAP traps TAP in an inward-facing conformation with the two NBDs separated, unable to progress to the NBD-closed conformation necessary for ATP hydrolysis. By blocking translocation of viral peptides into the ER, HSV suppresses the MHC-I antigen presentation pathway and thereby escapes cytotoxic T cell detection.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Structural comparison of peptide transporters in the ABC family</title><p>Previously, crystal structures were determined for two prokaryotic peptide transporters: the <italic>E. coli</italic> McjD in the AMPPNP-bound conformation (pdb: 4PL0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choudhury et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mehmood et al., 2016</xref>) and the peptidase-containing ABC transporter from <italic>Clostridium thermocellum</italic> (PCAT1) in two different conformations (inward-facing pdb: 4RY2; occluded, ATPγS-bound pdb: 4S0F) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2015</xref>). Unlike TAP, which is a promiscuous transporter found only in jawed vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hinz et al., 2014</xref>), McjD and PCAT1 are dedicated to specific substrates. McjD exports microcin J25, a 21-residue antibacterial peptide with a lasso fold. PCAT1 functions both as a maturation protease and exporter for a 90-residue peptide with an amino-terminal leader sequence. Correspondingly, PCAT1 contains two peptidase domains in addition to the canonical TMDs and NBDs. Despite these differences, the three transporters share a similar fold in the core region: the NBDs have very similar structures and the TM helices in each subunit are of similar length with a similar trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). One notable difference between TAP and the other two transporters occurs in TM 4-5, which in TAP appears to be pushed outward and bent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This difference, however, could possibly reflect a distortion due to the presence of ICP47. The overall structures of TAP, PCAT1, and McjD differ in the separation of the two halves, reflecting the different conformational states each structure represents. TAP shows the largest separation, again possibly induced by the viral inhibitor ICP47. The two NBDs of PCAT1 form a semi-open dimer in the absence of a nucleotide, separated at the TMD/NBD interfaces and making contacts at the distal end of the structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In the presence of ATP analogs and the absence of a substrate, both McjD and PCAT1 reveal an occluded conformation in which the NBDs are closed and the translocation pathway is shielded from both sides of the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The similarity in their structures suggests that these transporters may share a common evolutionary origin and a common mechanism for coupling ATP hydrolysis to peptide translocation.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21829.011</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Structures of three peptide transporters in the ABC family.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ribbon representations.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Aldrich (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Wesley I Sundquist (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors describe a 4Å cryo-EM reconstruction of the complex formed by the heterodimeric TAP transporter and the Herpesviral TAP inhibitor ICP47. The work builds on the previous 6.5Å structure reported by this same group in Nature last January. The enhanced resolution was made possible by collecting data at higher magnification (to improve alignment), optimizing other aspects of data collection (e.g., collecting images from regions of thin ice), and optimized data processing (e.g., in improved movie alignment protocols). The advance is that an atomic model can now be built for the core of the complex, which enables the authors to identify intermolecular contacts and interpret the structure in terms of comparative sequence analyses and previous mutational analyses of TAP and ICP47.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the manuscript focusing on the balance of the obviously important achievement of resolving the structure at 4 Å resolution, which allows the residue-specific model building, and somewhat limited mechanistic insights provided by the manuscript.</p><p>The following are comments to be addressed:</p><p>1) The authors should provide a bit better overview of the complex in the current manuscript so that it &quot;stands alone&quot; a bit better. For example, it would be helpful to give readers a better overview of how ICP47 binding alters the nucleotide binding cleft. The inhibition of ATPase activity is implied in the second paragraph of the subsection “The TAP/ICP47 interface”, but the actual bound nucleotide state (apo if I understand correctly) and an explanation of how NBD closure is prevented by ICP47 binding are not really addressed as far as I can see (though this issue was mentioned in the Nature paper).</p><p>2) I would have also liked a more extensive comparison with the homologous transporters.</p><p>3) It would be helpful if data collection strategy were further discussed and illustrated by figures. For example, quantitative evaluation of different methods to correct for specimen movements would have been informative.</p><p>4) The authors indicate that collecting data from areas of the grid with good contrast (presumably where the ice was thinnest) contributed to the improved resolution. This seems logical, but can the authors quantify how the selected regions were chosen (so that others can follow a similar protocol) and/or quantify how much this selection contributed to the increased resolution?</p><p>5) The number of particles (502K, minus the 5% that received such low Frealign scores that they were effectively eliminated) is mentioned in the text, but not in either of the two data tables.</p><p>6) A structure at 4 Å resolution cannot – and should not – be described as &quot;atomic&quot;. This is repeatedly and prominently the case, e.g. in the Abstract and summary. The inflationary use of the term &quot;atomic&quot; (structure, resolution, model, interactions etc.) in connection with lowish-resolution cryoEM maps is seriously misleading and has to be avoided (&quot;near-atomic&quot; is more appropriate and now widely used and accepted). Anyone can build an atomic model into a map of any resolution, and describe the result as an &quot;atomic structure&quot;. What is the point?</p><p>7) It is also potentially misleading and not to be encouraged to show van der Waals surfaces for interacting residues, instead of the genuine cryoEM map, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4D</xref>. If the map is good enough, why not show it?</p><p>8) The important interaction of ICP Pro55 with Tyr477 of TAP2 is not shown. Pro55 is modelled as a pink sphere, which seems to be too far from Tyr477 for direct, close interaction that would displace an ATP bound by strong π stacking.</p><p>9) I assume the structure is that of the human transporter. The manuscript does not state this important fact explicitly anywhere.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21829.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>The reviewers have discussed the manuscript focusing on the balance of the obviously important achievement of resolving the structure at 4 Å resolution, which allows the residue-specific model building, and somewhat limited mechanistic insights provided by the manuscript.</italic></p><p><italic>The following are comments to be addressed:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The authors should provide a bit better overview of the complex in the current manuscript so that it &quot;stands alone&quot; a bit better.
