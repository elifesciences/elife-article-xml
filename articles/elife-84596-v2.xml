them. During neural development in the spinal cord, motor nerves project to specific target muscles and receive proprioceptive input from these muscles via the sensorimotor circuit. LIM-homeodomain transcription factors are known to play a crucial role in successively restricting specific motor neuronal fates. However, their exact contribution to limb-based motor pools and locomotor circuits has not been fully understood. To address this, we conducted an investigation into the role of Isl2, a LIM-homeodomain transcription factor, in motor pool organization. We found that deletion of <italic>Isl2</italic> led to the dispersion of motor pools, primarily affecting the median motor column (MMC) and lateral motor column (LMC) populations. Additionally, hindlimb motor pools lacked Etv4 expression, and we observed reduced terminal axon branching and disorganized neuromuscular junctions in <italic>Isl2</italic>-deficient mice. Furthermore, we performed transcriptomic analysis on the spinal cords of <italic>Isl2-</italic>deficient mice and identified a variety of downregulated genes associated with motor neuron (MN) differentiation, axon development, and synapse organization in hindlimb motor pools. As a consequence of these disruptions, sensorimotor connectivity and hindlimb locomotion were impaired in <italic>Isl2-</italic>deficient mice. Taken together, our findings highlight the critical role of <italic>Isl2</italic> in organizing motor pool position and sensorimotor circuits in hindlimb motor pools. This research provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms governing motor control and its potential implications for understanding motor-related disorders in humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>motor neuron</kwd><kwd>LIM-HD transcription factor</kwd><kwd>Isl2</kwd><kwd>Etv4</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2018R1A5A1024261</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Mi-Ryoung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2022M3E5E8081194</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Mi-Ryoung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2023R1A2C1002690</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Mi-Ryoung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002582</institution-id><institution>Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>the GIST Research Institute (GRI) IIBR in 2023</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Mi-Ryoung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>SNUH Lee Kun-hee Child Cancer &amp; Rare Disease Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>22B-001-0500</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Mi-Ryoung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Isl2 orchestrates specific hindlimb motor pool arrangement, guaranteeing accurate motor control and sensorimotor circuit functionality.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The establishment of motor circuits in the spinal cord involves complex processes including the organization of motor neurons (MNs) into specific groups known as motor columns and motor pools along the rostrocaudal axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Romanes, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vanderhorst and Holstege, 1997</xref>). In each columnar group, MNs are further segregated into distinct motor pools. The development of this diverse repertoire of motor pools involves the sequentially activated various genetic programs during spinal cord development. Combinatorial gene expression of LIM-homeodomain (HD) transcription factors determines MN identity and positional information across multiple segments, including the median motor column (MMC), the hypaxial motor column (HMC), the lateral motor column (LMC), and the preganglionic column (PGC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pfaff et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tsuchida et al., 1994</xref>). <italic>Hox</italic> genes, crucial for body patterning, also contribute to segmental identity by selectively expressing in postmitotic MNs. The absence or misexpression of <italic>Hox</italic> genes such as <italic>Hox6</italic> and <italic>Hox10</italic> can lead to disorganization and misdirected targeting of LMC MNs toward specific limb muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de la Cruz et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wu et al., 2008</xref>). Foxp1, which interacts with <italic>Hox</italic> genes, is also essential for determining MN fates in the LMC, whose absence leads to scattered and misspecified LMC neurons as demonstrated in <italic>Foxp1</italic> mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dasen et al., 2008</xref>). Nevertheless, despite the involvement of <italic>Hox</italic> networks, the intricate three-dimensional organization of individual motor pools may require additional regulatory mechanisms, as elongated motor pools can span several spinal cord segments.</p><p>More than 50 limb muscles in tetrapods are innervated by distinct limb motor pools, suggesting the involvement of diverse molecular mechanisms in shaping individual limb motor pools during spinal cord development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sullivan, 1962</xref>). Specific LMC motor pools express ETS factors Etv4 and Etv1, playing a role in acquiring motor pool identities. In <italic>Etv4</italic> mutant mice, the position and terminal arborization of specific motor pools were perturbed, resulting in disorganized motor pools and impaired motor control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Livet et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vrieseling and Arber, 2006</xref>). Gdnf is suggested to act as a peripheral signal derived from limb tissues, guiding major axon bundles toward the hindlimb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gould et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kramer et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, Gdnf signaling appears to induce Etv4 expression in certain motor pools, as deletion of <italic>Gdnf,</italic> its receptor <italic>Ret</italic>, or <italic>Gfra1</italic> results in extinguished <italic>Etv4</italic> expression and affected terminal arborization of motor axons in target muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haase et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Livet et al., 2002</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether the development of Etv4-expressing motor pools solely depends on Gdnf signaling.</p><p>Insulin-related, LIM-homeodomain protein 1 (Isl1) and insulin-related, LIM-homeodomain protein 2 (Isl2) are two closely related LIM-HD transcription factors, sharing approximately 75% of their identity, and both are expressed in postmitotic MNs with overlapping patterns. Isl1 is first detected in all newborn MNs shortly after these neurons exit the mitotic cycle at E9.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pfaff et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thaler et al., 2004</xref>), while <italic>Isl2</italic> begins its expression slightly later, at E10.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thaler et al., 2004</xref>). Genetic studies in mice and zebrafish reveal that <italic>Isl1</italic> plays a significant role, as its removal induces defects in motor neuronal fates, axonal navigation, neurotransmitter identity, and electrical excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Moreno and Ribera, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pfaff et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wolfram et al., 2012</xref>). Although Isl1 has been considered more crucial than Isl2, evidence suggests that <italic>Isl2</italic> is also essential in MN development. In <italic>Isl2</italic>-null mice, thoracic MNs are affected, leading to scattered or misspecified MN subsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thaler et al., 2004</xref>). Similarly, misexpression of the dominant negative form of <italic>Isl2</italic> or knockdown (KD) of <italic>Isl2</italic> in zebrafish results in mispositioned MN cell bodies and defective axon growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hutchinson and Eisen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Segawa et al., 2001</xref>). Moreover, successful rescue experiments using <italic>isl2</italic> mRNA in <italic>isl1</italic> morphants demonstrate that both Isl1 and Isl2 are equally potent in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hutchinson and Eisen, 2006</xref>). While <italic>Isl2</italic> initially coexists with <italic>Isl1</italic> in pan-MNs, it later becomes enriched in lateral LMC (LMCl), which lacks Isl1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thaler et al., 2004</xref>). This suggests a possible independent role for <italic>Isl2</italic> in LMCl beyond its reported function in thoracic MN subsets. Recent advances in transcriptomic analysis reveal detailed spatiotemporal changes in the gene expression of Islet transcription factor during MN development, indicating persistent expression of Isl2 in postnatal MNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Catela et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Delile et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rayon et al., 2021</xref>). Overall, these findings suggest that the role of Isl2 in motor neuronal development may have been underestimated and warrants further investigation, despite the considerable similarities or redundancies in Islet transcription factor.</p><p>In this study, we have demonstrated the crucial role of Isl2 in the development and differentiation of hindlimb motor pools. Isl2 regulates the position of motor neuronal cell bodies and directs the assembly of the motor neuronal circuit. Our findings indicate that Isl2 is enriched in proximal motor pools expressing Etv4, and it is involved in neuromuscular junction (NMJ) formation, axonal and dendritic arborization, and hindlimb movement. Through transcriptomic analysis, we have identified <italic>Isl2</italic> as a master regulator of various genes involved in the development and differentiation of hindlimb motor pools. Our results indicate that LIM-HD transcription factors, together with Hox and ETS transcription factors, fine-tune the organization of hindlimb motor pools.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Spatiotemporal expression of Islet transcription factors during MN development</title><p>Islet transcription factors <italic>Isl1</italic> and <italic>Isl2</italic> are expressed immediately after MN generation. However, the detailed expression of these factors during MN development at the cellular level remains uncertain. To address this, we re-analyzed published single-cell RNA-sequencing data obtained from E12 MNs, sorted from the cervical to lumbar regions of the spinal cord, focusing on changes in their expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amin et al., 2021</xref>). We categorized approximately 3483 developing MNs into eight subgroups representing major motor columns, such as pMN, immature, MMC, phrenic/hypaxial motor column (P/HMC), LMCm, LMCl, PGCa, and PGCb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a and c</xref>). Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) analysis revealed the progression of pMN progenitors into immature MNs, MMC, P/HMC, LMCm, LMCl, PGCa, and PGCb MNs. In earlier immature MNs, we observed high <italic>Isl1</italic> expression, which slightly decreased in most differentiated MNs, such as MMC, P/HMC, LMCm, and PGCa MNs, but not LMCl MNs, which did not express <italic>Isl1. Isl2</italic> expression emerged later than <italic>Isl1</italic> in immature MNs, persisting in MMC and P/HMC neurons. Most LMC neurons showed low but even expression of <italic>Isl2</italic>, while a few PGCa and b cells expressed <italic>Isl2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). At E10.5, during MN generation, Olig2<sup>+</sup> pMNs were initially found in the middle part of the ventral spinal cord, co-expressing Lhx3, a marker for pMNs and MMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Thaler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). As these cells migrated, they transiently expressed markers for postmitotic MNs Isl1 and Hb9. <italic>Isl2</italic> expression emerged slightly later, found in more lateral regions across all levels analyzed. To analyze the distribution of Isl2 during the MN maturation, we compared the relative position of three populations: Olig2<sup>+</sup> pMNs, Olig2<sup>+</sup>Isl1<sup>+</sup> immature MNs, and <italic>Isl2</italic>-expressing MNs. Contour and density assessments revealed that <italic>Isl2</italic> expression began slightly after Isl1 expression in immature MNs and persisted in postmitotic MNs along with Isl1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). At E12.5, when motor columns became distinct, we identified them based on the expression of motor neuronal markers, including Foxp1 (marker for LMC neurons), Isl1 (marker for LMCm and PGC neurons), Lhx3 (marker for MMC neurons), nNOS (marker for PGC neurons), and Etv4 (marker for some LMC motor pools). Motor pools expressing Etv4 were located in the LMC neurons but not at the thoracic level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Isl2 exhibited broad expression across all motor columns, unlike other LIM-HD transcription factors that showed specific expression patterns. Overall, while <italic>Isl2</italic> is present in differentiated MNs, it is relatively enriched in MMC and LMCl populations, where its expression is more prominent compared to Isl1.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Spatiotemporal dynamics of <italic>Isl2</italic> expression and heterogeneity of motor neurons (MNs).</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) visualization of scRNA-seq data based on et al.âs study, highlighting distinct MN lineages: pMN progenitors, immature MNs, MMC, P/HMC, LMCm, LMCl, PGCa, and PGCb neurons, each depicted in distinct clusters.

We applied two search criteria. First, we focused on downregulated genes, as Isl2 is expected to act as an activator similar to Isl1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee and Pfaff, 2003</xref>). Second, we compared differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at the brachial and lumbar levels to select genes specifically downregulated at the lumbar level. To achieve this, we conducted bulk RNA-seq analysis using E12.5 brachial and lumbar ventral spinal cords. To obtain MN-enriched tissues, we dissected the ventral spinal cord from an open-book preparation. Segmental identity of the spinal cord was verified according to the expression of the correct <italic>Hox</italic> code at each axial level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hayashi et al., 2018</xref>). The DEG analysis between <italic>Isl2</italic> KO and <italic>Isl2</italic> heterozygote mice revealed 140 genes downregulated at the brachial levels and 159 genes downregulated at the lumbar levels (&lt;â0.5 log<sub>2</sub>-FC, raw p&lt;0.05). We then identified DEGs that overlapped with the list of genes from the scRNA-seq dataset obtained from embryonic MNs to further identify MN-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amin et al., 2021</xref>). As a result, 44 and 87 DEGs were specifically downregulated at the brachial and lumbar levels of <italic>Isl2</italic> KO spinal cords, respectively, whereas nine DEGs were commonly downregulated in both segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6aâe</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3a-b</xref>). Notably, gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that the downregulated genes at the lumbar level in <italic>Isl2</italic>-null embryos were predominantly associated with the neuropeptide signaling pathway, synaptic signaling, locomotion, neuron differentiation, and axon development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g</xref>). In contrast, at the brachial level, no categories involving synapse organization, axon development, and neuron differentiation were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>).

UMAP analysis of 273 cells identified five clades: two LMCl and three LMCm subclusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1aâh</xref>). Subcluster LMCl.1 (sb.LMCl.1) expressed <italic>Isl2</italic> and <italic>Lhx1</italic> but not <italic>Etv4</italic> and was further divided into two subclusters: sb.LMCl.1.v, consisting of vasti (V) motor pools expressing <italic>Isl2</italic>, <italic>Lhx1</italic>, and <italic>Etv1</italic>; and sb.LMCl.1.ta, consisting of Ta motor pools expressing <italic>Isl2</italic>, <italic>Lhx1</italic>, and <italic>Nkx6-1</italic>. sb.LMCl.2 contained Rf, Tfl, and Gl motor pools that expressed <italic>Lhx1</italic>, <italic>Nkx6-2</italic>, and <italic>Etv4</italic>. sb.LMCm.1 was characterized by the expression of <italic>Isl2</italic>, <italic>Isl1</italic>, and <italic>Etv1</italic>, with molecular profiles similar to the adductor/gracilis (A/G) motor pools. Subclusters sb.LMCm.2 and sb.LMCm.3 were both defined by the expression of <italic>Isl2</italic>, <italic>Isl1</italic>, and <italic>Nkx6-1</italic> and contained hamstring (H) and gastrocnemius (Gs) motor pools, with sb.LMCm.2 (<italic>Hoxd9</italic><sup>high</sup> and <italic>Aldh1a2</italic><sup>high</sup>) occupying a more rostral position than sb.LMCm.3 (<italic>Hoxd9</italic><sup>low</sup> and <italic>Aldh1a2</italic><sup>low</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, we successfully defined five subclusters of LMC motor pools.

Moreover, some genes were relatively enriched in specific motor pools, which is potentially useful for distinguishing individual motor pools. For instance, <italic>Epha3</italic>, <italic>Fgf10</italic>, and <italic>Sema5a</italic> transcripts were enriched in Gl motor pools and their expression was reduced in <italic>Isl2</italic> KO, as validated by in situ hybridization analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6i</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3c</xref>). In conclusion, our integrated approach, combining bulk and scRNA-seq analyses datasets, has proven valuable in identifying new potential motor pool markers and uncovering novel transcription target genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Defective arborization and sensorimotor connectivity of <italic>Isl2-</italic>deficient hindlimb motor pools</title><p>The downregulation of <italic>Etv4</italic> and the transcriptomic analysis of <italic>Isl2-</italic>deficient mice suggested that these mice have similar phenotypes to those found in <italic>Etv4</italic> mutant mice, such as scattered cell bodies, reduced dendrite patterning, and sensorimotor connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vrieseling and Arber, 2006</xref>). At the lumbar level of the spinal cord, there were three motor pools that expressed Etv4: Gl, Rf, and Tfl motor pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arber et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Marco Garcia and Jessell, 2008</xref>). Thus, we sought to investigate whether Isl2 plays a crucial role in dendrite formation of these motor pools. A previous study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thaler et al., 2004</xref>, had established that <italic>Isl2</italic> KO mice were unable to survive beyond a day after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thaler et al., 2004</xref>). Intriguingly, our study revealed that <italic>Isl2</italic> cKO mice also died on the first day after birth, while 11% of <italic>Isl2</italic> KO mice managed to survive (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). While the precise underlying cause for this disparity in survival rates among <italic>Isl2</italic> KO mutant mouse lines requires further investigation, we were able to examine adult MNs in the absence of Isl2. Overall, the total number of ChAT<sup>+</sup> MNs remained unchanged, and mislocalized MNs were observed in the P21 <italic>Isl2-</italic>null lumbar spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7aâc</xref>). We next examined the dendrite formation of motor pools by injecting rhodamine-dextran (Rh-Dex) retrograde tracer into individual muscles of <italic>Isl2</italic> KO postnatal pups at P4. In the wild-type animals, the Gl motor pools exhibited a stereotyped elongated crescent shape of the dextran-labeled dendritic arbor at the ventrolateral position in L3-L4 spinal cords (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>). However, in <italic>Isl2</italic> KO mice, dextran-labeled Gl motor pools split into two groups: 61% of cells were located at the correct ventrolateral position, and 39% were located at the ectopic ventromedial position. Regardless of position, <italic>Isl2-</italic>deficient Gl motor pools showed shorter and more randomly oriented dendritic arbors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>). Similarly, Tfl motor pools, whose axons diverged from one of the major branches of Gl ones, also displayed shorter and lesser dendritic arbors in <italic>Isl2</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gould et al., 2008</xref>). The position and dendritic arborization of Rf motor pools remained unchanged in <italic>Isl2</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>). Considering that Etv4 expression has been previously reported to be transient until E13.5 in Rf motor pools, it may not play a significant role in the dendritic arborization of Rf motor pools in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Marco Garcia and Jessell, 2008</xref>). To investigate the connectivity of Gl motor pools further, we next analyzed the density of sensory synaptic contacts in control and <italic>Isl2</italic> KO mice. Rh-Dex was injected into the Gl muscle at P16, and the number and density of vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGluT1), a marker of proprioceptive synapses, were analyzed at P21. We analyzed the synaptic density in two different regions: zone 1, containing normal LMC motor columns, and zone 2, where ectopic MNs reside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>).

These results differ from previous studies involving mice with defects in Gdnf ligands or receptors, where the peroneal nerves were severely affected, resulting in limited or no innervation of the target muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonanomi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gould et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kramer et al., 2006</xref>). Additionally, in our bulk RNA-seq analysis, we found that the expression levels of Gdnf receptors <italic>Ret</italic> and <italic>Gfra1</italic> was unchanged (â1.13-fold, â1.18-fold each), and their transcripts remained detectable in <italic>Isl2-</italic>deficient Gl motor pools when assessed by in situ hybridization analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1d</xref>). Thus, these findings suggest that Gdnf-dependent guidance of LMC projections in the hindlimb may not necessarily depend on Isl2.</p><p>We then examined the formation of the NMJ in the hindlimb muscles. Due to the postnatal lethality of <italic>Isl2</italic> cKO, we analyzed the muscles of these mice at E18.5, prior to birth, when NMJ formation is in progress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8âfigure supplement 2</xref>). GFP-labeled axons arrived in <italic>Isl2-</italic>deficient Gl muscles; however, their terminal arbors were defasciculated and misrouted. Fluorescence intensity of Î±-bungarotoxin (BTX) at the NMJs was greatly reduced in <italic>Isl2</italic> cKO. Furthermore, AChR clustering appeared to be incomplete, showing slender and elongated NMJs, or some NMJs were abnormally concentrated in proximity to the primary axon shaft in <italic>Isl2</italic> cKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8âfigure supplement 2b</xref>).</p><p>Because NMJs mature during the first postnatal weeks, we next examined the Gl muscles at birth when NMJ formation is ongoing, and at 2 weeks of age when synaptic elimination is almost complete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wyatt and Balice-Gordon, 2003</xref>). At P0, Hb9::GFP-labeled main motor axon bundles were comparable across <italic>Isl2-</italic>deficient Gl muscles; however, the branches originating from the main bundles and the terminal arbors were drastically diminished. The number of NMJs in Gl was reduced to 84% in the <italic>Isl2</italic> mutant group, and the length and complexity of the secondary branches were significantly reduced in P0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8aâc</xref>). Higher magnification views revealed that numerous short aberrant sprouts and NMJs had developed near the primary branches in <italic>Isl2-</italic>deficient muscles, which was not observed in the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>). The end plate band area occupied by motor axons was reduced to 55%, and the end plate band area occupied by AChR clusters marked by BTX was reduced to 58% in the Gl muscles of the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a, d, and e</xref>). At P14, a drastic loss in AChR clusters and excessive growth of motor axons that bypassed the AChR clusters were observed in <italic>Isl2</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a, f, and g</xref>). When the few surviving NMJs were visualized during the period of synaptic elimination, a significant portion of nerve terminals were aberrant in <italic>Isl2</italic> KO mice, showing faint AChR clusters, polyinnervation, denervation, and swelling of axons. The area of the NMJ defined by the nerve terminal and the area of AChR clusters were also enlarged in the muscles of <italic>Isl2</italic> KO mice. Fragmented and less compact AChR clusters were more abundant in <italic>Isl2</italic> KO mice than in heterozygote mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8kâr</xref>). In Tfl muscle, abnormal AChRs were formed along axon branches at P0, and a drastic loss in AChR clusters and polyinnervation were observed at P14 and P28 in <italic>Isl2</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8h, i, and j</xref>). However, Rf muscles, whose motor pools transiently express Etv4, showed normal arrangement of NMJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8âfigure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Marco Garcia and Jessell, 2008</xref>). Other muscles innervated by non-Etv4-expressing motor pools had normal NMJ development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8âfigure supplement 3</xref>). These findings collectively suggest that the primary role of Isl2 lies in the axon terminal arborization of Î±-MNs within Etv4-expressing motor pools.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Reduced terminal motor axon branching in gluteus (Gl) muscles of <italic>Isl2</italic> mutants.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Visualization of motor axons and neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) in P0 and P14 Gl muscles with Hb9::GFP (green) and Î±-bungarotoxin (BTX, red) immunoreactivity.

Previous studies have addressed the importance of motor neuronal cell body position, especially in genetic contexts related to <italic>Hox</italic> pathway, such as Foxp1 and Pbx, which establish neuronal subtype differentiation, organization, and connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dasen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hanley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">SÃ¼rmeli et al., 2011</xref>).

Remarkably, expression of representative motor pool markers, including Etv4, was downregulated in <italic>Foxp1-</italic>null mice and was spared in <italic>Pbx-</italic>null mice, implying the involvement of a complex and hierarchical transcriptional network in constructing sensorimotor connectivity in specific motor pools. Herein, we demonstrated that Isl2 plays a crucial role in the correct position and proper function of Etv4-expressing LMC motor pools, particularly at the hindlimb level.</p><p>Additional compelling evidence that Isl2 mainly functions in Etv4<sup>+</sup> motor pools comes from the striking similarities and differences observed in the mutant phenotypes of Isl2 and the Gdnf-Etv4 pathway, requiring a detailed comparison. Gdnf has been recognized as a critical factor for the survival and innervation of MNs during early MN development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Henderson et al., 1994</xref>). Deletion of <italic>Gdnf</italic> or its receptor <italic>Ret</italic> or <italic>Gfra1</italic> leads to impaired innervation of the peroneal nerve, resulting in no or disrupted axon innervation in major hindlimb muscles, such as Edl, Atib, psoas major, Gmax, and Tfl, to varying degrees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonanomi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gould et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kramer et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Isl2</italic> mutant mice showed normal axon projection of the peroneal nerve and relatively normal axon innervation in most hindlimb muscles, unlike motor axons of mice deficient in <italic>Gdnf</italic> or its receptors. Notably, discrepancies between the roles of Gdnf and Isl2 also emerged in types of motor pools affected. The removal of <italic>Gdnf</italic>, its receptor <italic>Ret</italic> or <italic>Gfra1,</italic> or <italic>Etv4</italic> has been mostly characterized in CM and LD motor pools, the Etv4-expressing motor pools at the forelimb level, but their roles in the lumbar motor pools have not been addressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arber et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haase et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Livet et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vrieseling and Arber, 2006</xref>). In our study, we observed a selective loss of <italic>Etv4</italic> expression only in the lumbar spinal cord of <italic>Isl2</italic> KO mice, specifically in Gl and Tfl motor pools. These motor pools displayed a phenotype almost identical to CM and LD motor pools of <italic>Etv4</italic>-null mice, including mispositioned cell bodies, impaired dendrite and axon arborization, defective NMJs, and reduced sensorimotor connectivity. In addition, acute KD of <italic>ISL2</italic> in the chicken neural tube and in MN-specific <italic>Isl2</italic> cKO mice was sufficient to abolish <italic>Etv4</italic> transcripts, suggesting that Isl2 positively regulates <italic>Etv4</italic> expression in a cell-autonomous manner. Thus, Gdnf likely plays broader roles in guiding most LMC projections and also promoting differentiation of Etv4-expressing motor pools at both limb levels. In contrast, Isl2 plays a precise role in fine-tuning the position of MNs, including MMC and LMCl, and also functions in selected lumbar motor pools at the hindlimb, particularly in establishing sensorimotor connectivity during the late period of development.</p><p>Nevertheless, Etv4 expression in the CM motor pool at the brachial level was intact in both <italic>Isl2</italic> KO mice and cKO mice, implying that another complex genetic program works in conjunction with Isl2 to contribute to segment-specific regulation. For instance, multiple <italic>Hox</italic> genes control Gdnf signaling, with <italic>Hoxc6</italic> activating <italic>Ret</italic> and <italic>Gfra1</italic> expression in rostral brachial spinal cords, regulating terminal arborization of CM and LD motor pools, while <italic>Hoxc8</italic> activates <italic>Ret</italic> and <italic>Gfra3</italic> expression in caudal brachial spinal cords, controlling limb innervation of distal nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Catela et al., 2022</xref>). Similar regulatory pathways involving Hox/Meis in <italic>Ret</italic> expression have been suggested at lumbar levels, with misexpression of <italic>Hoxc10</italic> or <italic>Hoxd10</italic> in chicken embryos resulting in <italic>Ret</italic> expression arising in the neural tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Catela et al., 2022</xref>). Our bulk RNA-seq analysis identified <italic>Hoxc11</italic> as one of the DEGs, indicating a potential compromise of proper lumbar identity in the absence of Isl2. However, the expression of <italic>Ret</italic> and <italic>Gfra1</italic> was not changed in <italic>Isl2</italic> KO mice when assessed by bulk RNA-seq analysis and in situ hybridization, and overall hindlimb motor projections remained intact. Although further investigation is necessary to fully elucidate the hierarchy among Hox, Gdnf, and Isl2, it is evident that each factor plays a crucial role, to varying degrees, in the proper expression of <italic>Etv4</italic> within proximal hindlimb motor pools.</p><p>Thaler et al. initially reported that <italic>Isl2</italic> KO mice died within a day after birth due to respiratory failure as well as MN developmental defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thaler et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast, we found that the identical mouse line exhibited a greater survival rate, about 10%. On the other hand, MN-specific <italic>Isl2</italic> cKO mice showed similar lethality, with all pups dying on the first day after birth. There are several possibilities to explain the variable mortality among different mouse lines lacking <italic>Isl2</italic>. First, acute elimination of <italic>Isl2</italic> gene in developing MNs could be more detrimental, minimizing potential developmental compensation through altered expression of other genes reconciling the impact of the target KO. Second, the genetic background of the mice may play a role, as it has been reported that different genetic backgrounds can cause varying phenotypes and lethality in KO mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">El-Brolosy and Stainier, 2017</xref>). For instance, the lethality of Lhx4 embryos was found to be different in C57BL/6J relative to the mixed background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gergics et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, the genetic background of original <italic>Isl2</italic> global null mice could be different from ours, with these mice being occasionally backcrossed onto the C57BL/6 genetic background. Despite the variable survival rates, the defects found in <italic>Isl2</italic>-null and conditional KO embryos were essentially identical, including scattered lumbar motor pools, absence of Etv4 expression, and defective NMJs, all of which are closely related to the adult behavioral phenotypes found in global <italic>Isl2</italic> KO mice. These findings further highlight the critical role of Isl2 in MN development and locomotion. Overall, our study provides a comprehensive analysis of the broad spectrum of phenotypes resulting from removal of <italic>Isl2</italic> expression.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Transcriptomic analysis to uncover Isl2-dependent genes for motor pool formation</title><p>Recent genome-wide transcriptomic studies have shed light on dynamic transcriptional changes occurring during the development of central nervous system, including spinal MNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Delile et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liau et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). However, the molecular signature responsible for the organization of multiple individual motor pools has remained elusive. In this study, we investigated the detailed spatiotemporal expression of Isl2 among multiple lineages of MNs using a published scRNA-seq dataset. We successfully segregated the clades of LMC motor pools into six subclusters that encompassed most of the major motor pools at the rostral lumbar segment. Our investigation revealed that sb.LMCl.2 exhibits a molecular signature corresponding to Etv4-expressing Gl, Tfl, and Rf motor pools, with Isl2 expression relatively enriched in this subcluster. Similar LMC subclusters expressing <italic>Etv4</italic> was also identified by other groups sharing similar molecular codes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liau et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, we aimed to integrate bulk and scRNAseq analyses datasets to narrow down the motor pools whose terminal differentiation is primarily dependent on the presence of Isl2, as well as to identify potential target genes under the control of Isl2. From the <italic>Isl2</italic>-deficient lumbar spinal cords, we identified 96 DEGs downregulated, and 87 of them were lumbar-specific. In particular, seven genes (<italic>C1ql3</italic>, <italic>Etv4</italic>, <italic>A830018L16Rik</italic>, <italic>Barx2</italic>, <italic>Kcnab1, Hrk,</italic> and <italic>Prph</italic>) were enriched genes in subcluster sb.LMCl.2, and five of them (<italic>C1ql3</italic>, <italic>Etv4</italic>, <italic>A830018L16Rik</italic>, <italic>Barx2</italic>, and <italic>Kcnab1</italic>) belonged to the top 30 of them (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1i</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3b-c</xref>). Upon comparing our DEGs with another scRNA-seq dataset analyzed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liau et al., 2023</xref> we found similar results. Ten genes (<italic>Anxa2</italic>, <italic>A730046J19Rik</italic>, <italic>Chodl</italic>, <italic>C1ql3</italic>, <italic>Etv4</italic>, <italic>Kcnab1</italic>, <italic>Lix1</italic>, <italic>Megf11</italic>, <italic>Prph</italic>, and <italic>Uts2b</italic>) were also found to be part of the molecular features characterizing the LMCl subcluster called c/rl4 (<italic>Lhx1</italic><sup>+</sup> <italic>Etv4</italic><sup>+</sup>), confirming the validity of our analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liau et al., 2023</xref>). We next aimed to determine whether our approach allowed us to discover new marker genes for designated motor pools. Among the list of enriched genes in sb.LMCl.2 retrieved from scRNA-seq analysis, we demonstrated that three genes <italic>Sema5a, Epha3,</italic> and <italic>Fgf10,</italic> exhibited selective expression in Gl motor pools and reduced expression in <italic>Isl2</italic>null mice according to our in situ hybridization results. Overall, our comprehensive approach, combining bulk and scRNA-seq analyses datasets, has proved highly valuable in identifying new potential motor pool markers and unraveling the genetic program underlying their development.</p><p>Our transcriptomic analysis and in vivo validation of candidate targets revealed that numerous genes involved in motor neuronal differentiation and diseases were indeed under the control of Isl2. Among the 96 DEGs downregulated in <italic>Isl2</italic> mutant spinal cords, 32 genes (i.e., <italic>Adra2c, Arhgap25, C1ql3, C3, Cck, Chrm5, Dkk1, Etv4, Fstl3, Gabra5, Gpr149, Grin2a, Hrk, Htr4, Kcnab1, Kcnj12, Mcf2, Mchr1, Mctp1, Nos1, Ntf3, Oprd1, P2rx4, Pcp4, Pnmt, Prph, Pvalb, Scnn1a, Sema3e, Tmem100, Tmsb15b2,</italic> and <italic>Tnc</italic>) were associated with axon- or synapse-related GO terms, or their protein expression was found in axons or synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dhaese et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fink et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martinelli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Molinard-Chenu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, 14 genes (i.e., <italic>Anxa2, Bcl2l15, C3, Chodl, Fam135b, Hrk, Lix1, Lrp1b, Moap1, Pcp4, Prph, Rnase4, Scg5,</italic> and <italic>Scnn1a</italic>) were reported as ALS- or MN disease-associated genes in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benoit et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ghavami et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gros-Louis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lederer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Orr et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sasongko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sheila et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sleigh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Su et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wei et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, approximately 40% of <italic>Isl2-</italic>dependent DEGs were involved in the maturation and pathological processes of MNs. <italic>Prph</italic>, a neuronal intermediate filament protein implicated in ALS, showed the largest fold changes (&lt;â0.5 log<sub>2</sub>-fold change) in our transcriptomic analysis and was selectively downregulated in specific motor pools in <italic>Isl2</italic> mutant mice. In addition, earlier extinction of <italic>Prph</italic> in developing MNs correlated with progressive degeneration of spinal MNs and NMJs, which indicated that the defects observed in <italic>Isl2</italic> mutant mice are relevant to early-onset progressive MN disorders such as SMA and ALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beaulieu and Julien, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gros-Louis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sabbatini et al., 2021</xref>). C1ql3 has been shown to promote synapse formation and maintenance in certain excitatory neurons, and its absence results in fewer excitatory synapses with diverse behavioral defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martinelli et al., 2016</xref>). Given that these MN disease-related genes were all selectively downregulated in specific motor pools that showed deteriorating features in the absence of <italic>Isl2</italic>, it is likely that proper regulation of these genes by Isl2 ensures proper MN development, whereas dysregulation leads to MN degeneration.</p><p>In summary, our findings suggest that pool-specific Isl2 activity is important for the fidelity of motor pool organization and motor circuit connectivity for hindlimb locomotion. Furthermore, Isl2 is responsible for the transcriptional control of a variety of genes involved in MN differentiation, axon development, and synaptic organization, and its absence may give rise to a pathological condition of MNs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

Wild-type C56BL/6 mice (6â8 weeks of age) were purchased from Damul Science Co. (Daejon, Korea). To selectively delete <italic>Isl2</italic> from MNs, we generated a novel <italic>Isl2</italic> flox mouse (Cyagen, China). The flox strategy was designed by Cyagen using the following procedure. The <italic>Isl2</italic> gene (NCBI reference sequence: NM_027397; Ensemble: ENSMUSG00000032318) was located on chromosome 9 in mice. Exons 2â4 were selected as cKO regions. In the targeting vector, the Neo cassette was flanked by SDA sites, and DTA was used for negative selection. C57BL/6N ES cells were used for gene targeting. The KO allele was obtained after specific Cre-mediated recombination. Genotyping assays were designed by Cyagen. First-generation mice were heterozygous for <italic>Isl2</italic> flox expression. Heterozygous mice were bred to generate mice with homozygous <italic>Isl2</italic> flox expression. The <italic>Isl2</italic> flox mouse line was maintained as a homozygous line for breeding with Cre strains.

In brief, P4 mice were anesthetized on ice, and the muscles were exposed by making a small incision in the skin. Approximately 2 Î¼l of 10% Rh-Dex was injected at a single site, and the skin was sutured. After 3 days, the spinal cords were analyzed for dextran labeling, and the muscles were isolated to check the injection site. Analyses of dendritic arborization patterns of the Gl motor pools primarily focused on the L3 and L4 spinal segmental levels. Free-floating 80-Î¼m-thick transverse sections were immunostained for further analysis.</p><p>For sensory bouton analysis, P16 mice were anesthetized, and the skin was incised to expose the muscle of interest. Muscles were injected at multiple sites with 10% tetramethylrhodamine dextran (3000 MW, Invitrogen) using a pulled glass microelectrode. At P21, the spinal cords were harvested and processed for immunostaining.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>EMG analysis</title><p>For EMG analysis, we used multistranded, Teflon-coated, annealed stainless steel wire (A-M systems, Cat. No. 793200) electrodes that were soldered to an IC socket. After mice were anesthetized with avertin, we implanted the electrodes subcutaneously into the middle of the left and right Gl muscles and secured the connector to the head. The mice were allowed to recover in their cages for at least 2 days before recording began. After the recovery period, we placed the animals in an open field where they could move freely. During locomotor activity, EMG signals were digitized and stored using Clampex 9.2 data acquisition software, while video recordings were made to monitor walking movement for 30 min. EMG and video data were recorded simultaneously. The EMG data was bandpass filtered at 200 Hz to 1 kHz using Clampfit 10.3. We measured and analyzed the number, frequency, and duration of EMG peaks over 1 s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Tail suspension test and gait analysis</title><p>For the tail suspension test, we suspended each mouse above the cage by its tail and captured its posture on a camera. In the gait analysis, we used 3-month-old <italic>Isl2</italic> KO and littermate female controls. We applied nontoxic water-based paints (red on forepaws and black on hindpaws) to the mouse paws and allowed the mice to walk on white paper.

For NMJ morphology assessment, confocal settings were optimized: 640Ã640 frame size, 30Ã objective, Ã6.0 zoom, and 0.74 Î¼m z-stack interval for quantification in P14 muscles; and 800Ã800 frame size, 30Ã objective, Ã4.5 zoom, and 0.74 Î¼m z-stack interval for quantification in P28 muscles. For quantification of Gl muscles, the number of NMJs was quantified along the entire Gl nerve within the Gl muscles in P0 and P14. Quantification of the length of secondary branches, end plate area occupied by motor axons or AChR clusters in P0, and the nerve terminal area, AChR cluster area, compactness, and fragmentation in P14 and P28 was performed using ImageJ software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jones et al., 2016</xref>). The number of axons extending the border of the target muscles was calculated by quantifying the overshooting axons per 100 Î¼m of end plate. The proportion of polyinnervated, faint, denervated NMJs was quantified within three to four random fields per animal. The proportion of polyinnervated NMJs was quantified in Gl nerves adjacent to Tfl muscles. The number of axonal inputs was quantified in individual NMJs in P14. In Tfl muscles, we quantified the number of NMJs along the entire nerve within the Tfl muscles at P14, and the number of axonal inputs in individual NMJs at P28.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Skeletal staining and X-ray imaging</title><p>E17.5 mouse embryos were prepared by removing the skin, viscera, and adipose tissues and fixed in 95% ethanol for at least 5 days.

The raw data from the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amin et al., 2021</xref>. were obtained from ArrayExpress accession: E-MTAB-10571. Reads from wild-type samples (E12 <italic>Hb9::GFP</italic>) were mapped to the mm10 mouse reference genome, and raw unique molecular identifiers were produced using Cell Ranger (version 3.1.0, 10x Genomics). The expression matrices were processed in R (v.3.6.0) using Seurat (v.3.2.3). Cells with fewer than 1000 detected transcripts were excluded and cells with over 8% of mitochondrial gene read counts were excluded. Filtered gene-barcode matrices were normalized using the <italic>NormalizeData</italic> function with <italic>LogNormalize</italic>, and the top 2000 variable genes were identified using the âvstâ method in <italic>FindVariableFeatures</italic>.

As a result, LMC clusters were further divided into seven clades composed of 276 cells: sb.LMCl.1.v, sb.LMCl.1.ta, sb.LMCl.2, sb.LMCm.1, sb.LMCm.2, and sb.LMCm.3. <italic>Lhx1</italic>, an LMCl marker, was enriched in sb.LMCl.1.v, sbLMCl.1.ta, and sb.LMCl.2 clades, whereas <italic>Isl1</italic>, an LMCm marker, was enriched in LMCm.1, LMCm.2, and LMCm.3. Visualized data were plotted using <italic>VinPlot</italic>, <italic>DotPlot</italic>, <italic>DoHeatmap</italic>, and <italic>FeaturePlot</italic> functions from the Seurat R packages.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data curation, Validation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Resources, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing - original draft</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST, No. GIST2021-072).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Paschalis Kratsios (Reviewer #1); NiccolÃ² Zampieri (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The issue of cell autonomy was raised by all three reviewers because the study primarily focuses on global Isl2 KO mice. Additional characterization of the conditional Olig2Cre;Isl2 mice would significantly strengthen the conclusions. The authors do not need to repeat every experiment in the conditional Olig2Cre;Isl2 mice, but the reviewers strongly encourage the authors to conduct the same behavioral and connectivity experiments in the conditional mice.</p><p>2) The writing is at times not very clear and makes it difficult to appreciate the findings and their relevance in the context of the literature. Please address specific comments by reviewer #1 (presentation of data on Figure 2; grammar issues and typos) and reviewer #2 (the Introduction is difficult to read; more emphasis should be given to what is known about Isl2 and Pea3 mutant mice, which is very relevant for the paper).</p><p>3) Based on this study and previous studies (e.g., Catela et al. 2016, Cell Reports, PMID: 26904955), it seems that there is differential regulation of Pea3 at brachial and lumbar levels. The Pea3 phenotypes described by Arber et al. were very dramatic-almost complete lack of innervation. Here the phenotypes appear to be less so and mostly at the NMJ, suggesting Pea3 partially controls aspects of the lumbar motor pool properties. So, if Isl2 regulates Pea3 differentially, it's possible that Pea3 is not gdnf-dependent at lumbar levels (is this known?). The explant experiments aren't that convincing because they contain all lumbar motor axons-if only a few pools are regulated by Isl2 why do none of them respond to gdnf. The authors should have a more thoughtful discussion about the gene regulatory networks at brachial vs lumbar levels and what the significance might be. They also must cite Catela et al. 2016, which nicely showed that Ret expression is dependent on brachial Hox genes, and that Hoxc10/d10 can also induce Ret expression at lumbar levels. They should incorporate these findings in their discussion.</p><p>4) Improve quantifications: The way MN numbers are given throughout the manuscript is confusing. The data should be recalculated and presented as average MN numbers/mouse (n=1 mouse and not 1 section). In Figure 2, quantification would be really good to have at both stages. The statistical difference in MMC and PGC numbers (Figure 2f) observed between WT and KO mice should be briefly commented on, in light of Thaler's results and in the context of the ectopic motor neurons.</p><p>5) Figure 3: The markers used in Figure 3a do not allow to clearly distinguish MMC, LMCm and LMCl neurons. A different combination should be used such as Lhx3 (MMC) Isl1 (LMCm) and Hb9 (LMCl). In addition, spatial analysis of columnar and divisional segregation should be provided to better support the statement.</p><p>6) Further experimentation and/or discussion is needed to clarify which exact motor pools are affected in Isl2 mutant mice. See comments by reviewers 1 and 3.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Figure 2 is confusing. The presentation and discussion of the data in Results (lines 149-162) need to be improved. The authors should also present their data more clearly in the context of Thaler et al. (2004), as that study found increased numbers of somatic motor neurons and decreased numbers of visceral motor neurons in the thoracic spinal cord. By doing so, the novelty of the current study will be clearer. Perhaps, switching the order of Figures 2 and 3 would address this issue and improve the flow.</p><p>In the transcriptomic analysis, the authors do a remarkable job to identify motor neuron-expressed genes and define subclusters of LMC motor pools. Although the RNA-Seq is done in bulk and without motor neuron specificity, the authors leverage published RNA-Seq data to ascribe MN specificity to their dataset. Hence, they identified several putative targets, which they validate with ISH (Figure 6H). However, they are strongly encouraged to also validate with ISH putative markers of the subcluster LMCl.2 in Isl2 global or conditional mice. This experiment would significantly strengthen the authors' conclusions (lines 356-366) about which motor pools are affected by Isl2 loss, especially because Pea3 is a marker for multiple motor pools.</p><p>The study will be strengthened by conducting hindlimb locomotion analysis in Olig2Cre;Isl2 fl/fl mice.</p><p>The text can be significantly improved by eliminating typos and improving grammar. The authors should go carefully through the text, sentence by sentence, and make the necessary changes.</p><p>In the first section of Results, the authors can cite Thaler et al. (2004), as their results are consistent with that study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In my opinion, the writing is at times not very clear and makes it difficult to appreciate the findings and their relevance in the context of the literature. The experiments are well executed and appropriately analyzed, there are a few things that can be improved, more to it in the following detailed comments:</p><p>1) I find the introduction difficult to read, it is more like a list of facts than a coherent narrative to properly frame the work. For example, the bit about neuromesodermal progenitors (lines 66-71), while interesting does not fit with the rest of the story. Also, at times the balance between subjects seems a bit off, more emphasis should be given to what is known about Isl2 and Pea3 mutant mice, which is very relevant to the paper.</p><p>2) Line 150: it is not specified which Isl2 KO mice is used. At the very least there should be a reference (Thaler et al., 2004). However, here it is very important to comment that these are the same mice that have been used in a previous study characterizing the role of Isl2 in spinal motor neuron development. In addition, the mice were originally reported to &quot;die within 24 hr of birth&quot; (Thaler et al., 2004), but the authors found that &quot;approximately 10% survived&quot; (lines 315-317). This important information should be introduced at the beginning when the mouse line is first introduced. It will be immediately relevant as in line 160 adult isl2 KO mice are used.</p><p>3) Line 159: &quot;Mislocalized motor neurons remained in the adult Isl2-null lumbar spinal cord with a similar number of motor neurons&quot; Mislocalised motor neurons are not very evident from pictures provided in figure 2h higher magnifications would be helpful. Regarding the &quot;similar number&quot;, I could not find quantification of mislocalised motor neurons either in embryos or adults, thus a quantitative statement is not justified. Indeed, quantification would be really good to have at both stages.</p><p>4) The statistical difference in MMC and PGC numbers (Figure 2f) observed between WT and KO mice should be briefly commented on, in light of Thaler's results and in the context of the ectopic motor neurons.</p><p>5) Line 169: &quot;We similarly found that MMC neurons were scattered dorsolaterally and located ectopically, either within the LMC columns or immediately dorsal to the motor columns in Isl2-deficient (Figure 3a)&quot; The markers used in Figure 3a do not allow to clearly distinguish MMC, LMCm and LMCl neurons. A different combination should be used such as Lhx3 (MMC) Isl1 (LMCm) and Hb9 (LMCl). In addition, spatial analysis of columnar and divisional segregation should be provided to better support the statement.</p><p>6) Figure 4b: I believe there must be a mistake as it is clear from the pictures in 4a that there are very few Pea3+ neurons in Isl2 KO mice, however in the plots in 4b (last row the three plots on the right) there are huge red contours for Pea3 neurons more or less similar to control mice. Indeed, the difference is clearly evident in the dot plots in Figure 4 supp 1b.</p><p>7) It is great that the authors generated an Isl2 conditional allele, however, its phenotype in combination with olig2::cre is not described other than in the experiments in Figure 5 aimed at studying the downregulation of Pae3. Does the Isl2 cKO mouse recapitulate the overall defects observed in Isl2 KO in terms of motor neuron generation, spatial organisation, connectivity, and behaviour? Comparison of the two can be very informative especially regarding the behavioural and sensorimotor connectivity phenotypes as many other cells (i.e., all somatosensory neurons) express Isl2 during development.</p><p>8) Do you observe arborization, sensorimotor connectivity, and NMJ defects shown for Gl motor neurons also in Rf and Tfl motor pools? It seems like it would be the case but it would be a great addition in order to generalise the role of Isl2-Pea3 transcriptional axis on all pools expressing it.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Specific concerns:</p><p>1) The behavioral phenotypes seen in the videos appear to be very dramatic, especially in the hindlimbs. However, the authors show that most hindlimb muscles are properly innervated, with the exception of the Gl. For example, the Rf seems to be properly innervated but its weight is dramatically reduced in Figure 9. What is the cause for this? Do the authors believe that the behavior correlates to defects in Gl development and connectivity or are there non-MN contributions to these phenotypes from sensory neurons and interneurons?</p><p>2) The connection between Isl2/gdnf signaling and Pea3 expression is not experimentally supported. The authors do show a specific downregulation of Pea3 at lumbar levels of the spinal cord but whether this is mediated through gdnf is not established. Is Ret or any other component of this signaling pathway downregulated in the RNA-seq data? The fact that lumbar explants do not respond to gdnf may suggest this but the connection is not explicitly shown.</p><p>3) The loss of synapses in Fig7b is interpreted as Isl2 controlling Gl connectivity. Since this is not a conditional allele, the synaptic loss could be due to defects in sensory neurons. The authors also show an ectopic soma (although this is not really well defined). Is there a difference between ectopic and Gl MNs that settle in the correct position? Are the authors suggesting that cell body position influences connectivity in a way that ectopic MNs lose more connections? This is not quantified or discussed.</p><p>4) The way MN numbers are given throughout the manuscript is confusing. The authors quantify MN/section. However, especially for motor pool counts, this results in a lot of variability since at the beginning and end of each motor pool you have 1-2 MNs, while higher numbers are in the middle. The data should be recalculated and presented as average MN numbers/mouse (n=1 mouse and not 1 section). This would reduce variability within the datasets.</p><p>5). Figure 1: The authors discuss the different spatiotemporal expressions of Isl1 and Isl2 but this is not shown (maybe inferred from RNAseq). Only one time point is shown in the figure (e12.5). It would be nice to show the temporal expression of both TFs at different embryonic time points and also in combination with motor pool markers. For example, the overlap of Isl2 with Pea3 at brachial and lumbar levels is not shown. Showing which motor pools express high and sustained levels of Isl2 in this figure would be a nice setup for the rest of the story.</p><p>6). Figure 2-4: MN numbers should be recalculated and presented so that n=1 mouse. It is likely that this might change some of the data. For example, in Figure 3a, there is a visible reduction of Scip+ MNs. When the source data for Figure 3c was reanalyzed, there seems to be a 30% reduction of FCU neurons with a P=0.03 (not significant but close, perhaps would be significant if n&gt;3). Is Isl2 highly expressed in Scip+ MNs at brachial levels (see point for Figure 1). Also the MN positional changes should be quantified in these figures.</p><p>7). Figure 6: After comparing their RNAseq data to scRNAseq the authors mention that only 50% seem to be MN-specific. Is this technical (not deep enough sequencing in the scRNA-seq datasets) or are the rest of the genes in interneurons? This relates to the comment about other affected populations in the null mouse. In the in situ data, the ventrolateral pools are indicated, however, the changes appear to be broader, affecting the entire lumbar spinal cord. The nNos data should be shown separately since that is in the thoracic spinal cord.</p><p>8). Figure 7: In the text, it is mentioned that the Pea3 pools are Gl, Rf, and Tfl and that a retrograde tracer was injected into individual muscles. However, only the Gl data are shown. What about the other pools? Do they have normal dendrites? It seems that Pea3 is not the whole story as Rf has normal NMJ innervation. What about sensory innervation? Is that synapse loss specific to Gl MNs? What about Rf and Tfl? What about non-Pea3+ pools?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84596.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The issue of cell autonomy was raised by all three reviewers because the study primarily focuses on global Isl2 KO mice.

Through meticulous observation, we identified that about 10% of global <italic>Isl2</italic> KO survived, allowing us to effectively examine their postnatal phenotypes. Regrettably, the <italic>Isl2</italic> conditional KO (cKO) mice showed a different survival rate, as they all succumbed within a day after birth. Thus, our ability to perform experiments utilizing postnatal animals was limited.</p><p>Detailed results and the interpretation surrounding the observed mortality discrepancy in these two mouse lines have been comprehensively presented in Table S1, Supplementary Videos 1-3, and elaborated within the Results and Discussion section.</p><p>Page 10: âA previous study by Thaler et al. (2004) had established that <italic>Isl2</italic> KO mice were unable to survive beyond a day after birth (Thaler et al., 2004). Intriguingly, our study revealed that <italic>Isl2</italic> cKO mice also died on the first day after birth, while 11% of <italic>Isl2</italic> KO mice managed to survive (Supplementary Table S1, Supplementary Video S3). While the precise underlying cause for this disparity in survival rates among <italic>Isl2</italic> KO mutant mouse lines requires further investigation, we were able to examine adult motor neurons in the absence of Isl2.â</p><p>Page 16: âThaler et al. initially reported that <italic>Isl2</italic> KO mice died within a day after birth due to respiratory failure as well as motor neuron developmental defects (Thaler et al., 2004). In contrast, we found that the identical mouse line exhibited a greater survival rate, about 10%. On the other hand, motor neuron-specific <italic>Isl2</italic> conditional KO mice showed similar lethality, with all pups dying on the first day after birth. There are several possibilities to explain the variable mortality among different mouse lines lacking <italic>Isl2</italic>. First, acute elimination of <italic>Isl2</italic> gene in developing motor neurons could be more detrimental, minimizing potential developmental compensation through altered expression of other genes reconciling the impact of the target knockout. Second, the genetic background of the mice may play a role, as it has been reported that different genetic backgrounds can cause varying phenotypes and lethality in knockout mouse models (El-Brolosy and Stainier, 2017). For instance, the lethality of Lhx4 embryos was found to be different in C57BL/6J relative to the mixed background (Gergics, Brinkmeier, and Camper, 2015). Similarly, the genetic background of original <italic>Isl2</italic> global null mice could be different from ours, with these mice being occasionally backcrossed onto the C57BL/6 genetic background. Despite the variable survival rates, the defects found in <italic>Isl2</italic> null and conditional KO embryos were essentially identical, including scattered lumbar motor pools, absence of Etv4 expression, and defective NMJs, all of which are closely related to the adult phenotypes found in global <italic>Isl2</italic> KO mice. These findings further highlight the critical role of Isl2 in motor neuron development and locomotion. Overall, our study provides a comprehensive analysis of the broad spectrum of phenotypes resulting from removal of <italic>Isl2</italic> expression.â</p><p>Nevertheless, we successfully investigated the progress of NMJ development in <italic>Isl2</italic> cKO at E18.5, just prior to birth, and identified congruent developmental anomalies comparable to <italic>Isl2</italic> null mice. Consequently, the phenotypes we observed during the embryonic stage were identical in both mouse lines, i.e., dispersed motor neurons, Etv4 expression absence in selective lumbar motor pools, disrupted NMJ formation within those pools. The new obtained data, along with pertinent explanations, have been integrated into Figure 8âfigure supplement 2 and incorporated within the Results and Discussion section, as outlined below.</p><p>Page 12: âDue to the postnatal lethality of <italic>Isl2</italic> cKO, we analyzed the muscles of these mice at E18.5, prior to birth, when NMJ formation is in progress (Figure 8âfigure supplement 2).

As suggested, we have cited the work of Catela et al. and improved the text with a more comprehensive description and discussion, as presented below.</p><p>Page 15: âAdditional compelling evidence that Isl2 mainly functions in Etv4<sup>+</sup> motor pools comes from the striking similarities and differences observed in the mutant phenotypes of Isl2 and the GDNF-Etv4 pathway, requiring a detailed comparison. GDNF has been recognized as a critical factor for the survival and innervation of motor neurons during early motor neuron development (Henderson et al., 1994). Deletion of <italic>GDNF</italic> or its receptor <italic>Ret</italic> or <italic>Gfra1</italic> leads to impaired innervation of the peroneal nerve, resulting in no or disrupted axon innervation in major hindlimb muscles, such as Edl, Atib, psoas major, Gmax, and Tfl, to varying degrees (Bonanomi et al., 2012; Gould, Yonemura, Oppenheim, Ohmori, and Enomoto, 2008; Kramer et al., 2006). In contrast, <italic>Isl2</italic> mutant mice showed normal axon projection of the peroneal nerve and relatively normal axon innervation in most hindlimb muscles, unlike motor axons of mice deficient in <italic>GDNF</italic> or its receptors. Notably, discrepancies between the roles of GDNF and Isl2 also emerged in types of motor pools affected. The removal of <italic>GDNF</italic>, its receptor <italic>Ret</italic> or <italic>Gfra1,</italic> or <italic>Etv4</italic> has been mostly characterized in CM and LD motor pools, the Etv4-expressing motor pools at the forelimb level, but their roles in the lumbar motor pools have not been addressed (Arber, Ladle, Lin, Frank, and Jessell, 2000; Haase et al., 2002; Livet et al., 2002; Vrieseling and Arber, 2006). In our study, we observed a selective loss of <italic>Etv4</italic> expression only in the lumbar spinal cord of <italic>Isl2</italic> KO mice, specifically in Gl and Tfl motor pools. These motor pools displayed a phenotype almost identical to CM and LD motor pools of <italic>Etv4</italic>-null mice, including mispositioned cell bodies, impaired dendrite and axon arborization, defective NMJs, and reduced sensorimotor connectivity. In addition, acute knockdown of <italic>Isl2</italic> in the chicken neural tube and in motor neuron-specific <italic>Isl2</italic> cKO mice was sufficient to abolish <italic>Etv4</italic> transcripts, suggesting that Isl2 positively regulates <italic>Etv4</italic> expression in a cell-autonomous manner. Thus, GDNF likely plays broader roles in guiding most LMC projections and also promoting differentiation of Etv4-expressing motor pools at both limb levels. In contrast, Isl2 plays a precise role in fine-tuning the position of motor neurons, including MMC and LMCl, and also functions in selected lumbar motor pools at the hindlimb, particularly in establishing sensorimotor connectivity during the late period of development.</p><p>Nevertheless, Etv4 expression in the CM motor pool at the brachial level was intact in both <italic>Isl2</italic> KO mice and cKO mice, implying that another complex genetic program works in conjunction with Isl2 to contribute to segment-specific regulation. For instance, multiple <italic>Hox</italic> genes control GDNF signaling, with <italic>Hoxc6</italic> activating <italic>Ret</italic> and <italic>Gfra1</italic> expression in rostral brachial spinal cords, regulating terminal arborization of CM and LD motor pools, while <italic>Hoxc8</italic> activates <italic>Ret</italic> and <italic>Gfra3</italic> expression in caudal brachial spinal cords, controlling limb innervation of distal nerves (Catela, Chen, Weng, Wen, and Kratsios, 2022). Similar regulatory pathways involving Hox/Mes in <italic>Ret</italic> expression have been suggested at lumbar levels, with misexpression of <italic>Hoxc10</italic> or <italic>Hoxd10</italic> in chicken embryos resulting in <italic>Ret</italic> expression arising in the neural tube (Catela et al., 2022). Our bulk RNA-seq analysis identified <italic>Hoxc11</italic> as one of the DEGs, indicating a potential compromise of proper lumbar identity in the absence of Isl2. However, the expression of <italic>Ret</italic> and <italic>Gfra1</italic> was not changed in <italic>Isl2</italic> KO mice when assessed by bulk RNA-seq analysis and in situ hybridization, and overall hindlimb motor projections remained intact. Although further investigation is necessary to fully elucidate the hierarchy among Hox, GDNF and Isl2, it is evident that each factor plays a crucial role, to varying degrees, in the proper expression of <italic>Etv4</italic> within proximal hindlimb motor pools.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Improve quantifications: The way MN numbers are given throughout the manuscript is confusing.

Specific LMC motor pools express ETS factors Etv4 and Etv1, playing a role in acquiring motor pool identities. In <italic>Etv4</italic> mutant mice, the position and terminal arborization of specific motor pools were perturbed, resulting in disorganized motor pools and impaired motor control (Livet et al., 2002; Vrieseling and Arber, 2006). GDNF is suggested to act as a peripheral signal derived from limb tissues, guiding major axon bundles toward the hindlimb (Gould et al., 2008; Kramer et al., 2006).

Consequently, we have made the necessary adjustment by excluding the in vitro data and, instead, dedicated our efforts to an in-depth discussion of the disparities observed between mice lacking gdnf signaling and those with Isl2 mutations in our study.</p><p>Page 15: âAdditional compelling evidence that Isl2 mainly functions in Etv4<sup>+</sup> motor pools comes from the striking similarities and differences observed in the mutant phenotypes of Isl2 and the GDNF-Etv4 pathway, requiring a detailed comparison. GDNF has been recognized as a critical factor for the survival and innervation of motor neurons during early motor neuron development (Henderson et al., 1994). Deletion of <italic>GDNF</italic> or its receptor <italic>Ret</italic> or <italic>Gfra1</italic> leads to impaired innervation of the peroneal nerve, resulting in no or disrupted axon innervation in major hindlimb muscles, such as Edl, Atib, psoas major, Gmax, and Tfl, to varying degrees (Bonanomi et al., 2012; Gould et al., 2008; Kramer et al., 2006). In contrast, <italic>Isl2</italic> mutant mice showed normal axon projection of the peroneal nerve and relatively normal axon innervation in most hindlimb muscles, unlike motor axons of mice deficient in <italic>GDNF</italic> or its receptors. Notably, discrepancies between the roles of GDNF and Isl2 also emerged in types of motor pools affected. The removal of <italic>GDNF</italic>, its receptor <italic>Ret</italic> or <italic>Gfra1,</italic> or <italic>Etv4</italic> has been mostly characterized in CM and LD motor pools, the Etv4-expressing motor pools at the forelimb level, but their roles in the lumbar motor pools have not been addressed (Arber et al., 2000; Haase et al., 2002; Livet et al., 2002; Vrieseling and Arber, 2006). In our study, we observed a selective loss of <italic>Etv4</italic> expression only in the lumbar spinal cord of <italic>Isl2</italic> KO mice, specifically in Gl and Tfl motor pools. These motor pools displayed a phenotype almost identical to CM and LD motor pools of <italic>Etv4</italic>-null mice, including mispositioned cell bodies, impaired dendrite and axon arborization, defective NMJs, and reduced sensorimotor connectivity. In addition, acute knockdown of <italic>Isl2</italic> in the chicken neural tube and in motor neuron-specific <italic>Isl2</italic> cKO mice was sufficient to abolish <italic>Etv4</italic> transcripts, suggesting that Isl2 positively regulates <italic>Etv4</italic> expression in a cell-autonomous manner. Thus, GDNF likely plays broader roles in guiding most LMC projections and also promoting differentiation of Etv4-expressing motor pools at both limb levels. In contrast, Isl2 plays a precise role in fine-tuning the position of motor neurons, including MMC and LMCl, and also functions in selected lumbar motor pools at the hindlimb, particularly in establishing sensorimotor connectivity during the late period of development.</p><p>Nevertheless, Etv4 expression in the CM motor pool at the brachial level was intact in both <italic>Isl2</italic> KO mice and cKO mice, implying that another complex genetic program works in conjunction with Isl2 to contribute to segment-specific regulation. For instance, multiple <italic>Hox</italic> genes control GDNF signaling, with <italic>Hoxc6</italic> activating <italic>Ret</italic> and <italic>Gfra1</italic> expression in rostral brachial spinal cords, regulating terminal arborization of CM and LD motor pools, while <italic>Hoxc8</italic> activates <italic>Ret</italic> and <italic>Gfra3</italic> expression in caudal brachial spinal cords, controlling limb innervation of distal nerves (Catela et al., 2022). Similar regulatory pathways involving Hox/Mes in <italic>Ret</italic> expression have been suggested at lumbar levels, with misexpression of <italic>Hoxc10</italic> or <italic>Hoxd10</italic> in chicken embryos resulting in <italic>Ret</italic> expression arising in the neural tube (Catela et al., 2022). Our bulk RNA-seq analysis identified <italic>Hoxc11</italic> as one of the DEGs, indicating a potential compromise of proper lumbar identity in the absence of Isl2. However, the expression of <italic>Ret</italic> and <italic>Gfra1</italic> was not changed in <italic>Isl2</italic> KO mice when assessed by bulk RNA-seq analysis and in situ hybridization, and overall hindlimb motor projections remained intact. Although further investigation is necessary to fully elucidate the hierarchy among Hox, GDNF and Isl2, it is evident that each factor plays a crucial role, to varying degrees, in the proper expression of <italic>Etv4</italic> within proximal hindlimb motor pools.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The loss of synapses in Fig7b is interpreted as Isl2 controlling Gl connectivity. Since this is not a conditional allele, the synaptic loss could be due to defects in sensory neurons. The authors also show an ectopic soma (although this is not really well defined). Is there a difference between ectopic and Gl MNs that settle in the correct position? Are the authors suggesting that cell body position influences connectivity in a way that ectopic MNs lose more connections? This is not quantified or discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We express our gratitude for the valuable comments provided by the Reviewer. Regrettably, the postnatal lethality exhibited by <italic>Isl2</italic> cKO mice precluded our ability to explore Gl connectivity in this context. However, the observed NMJ defects in <italic>Isl2</italic> cKO animals substantiate the pivotal role of Isl2 within motor neurons. In alignment with the Reviewerâs guidance, we undertook the categorization of motor neurons into two distinct zones: zone 1 encompassing motor neurons positioned correctly, and zone 2 encompassing ectopic somata. Our findings unveiled a trend wherein ectopic somata tended to exhibit a lower number of sensory boutons per soma, suggesting a clear influence of cell body positioning on connectivity. To provide a comprehensive representation, we have incorporated pertinent data within Figure 7e-k and incorporated them into the Results section as follows.</p><p>Page 11: âNext, we analyzed the synaptic density of vGluT1<sup>+</sup> boutons on motor neuronal somata. Overall, the density of vGluT1 immunoreactivity in zone 1 was higher than in zone 2, which is expected since more motor neurons reside in zone 1 where more sensorimotor synapses are present. Compared to the control mice, the density of vGluT1 immunoreactivity in <italic>Isl2</italic> KO mice did not change, indicating that overall sensorimotor connection is not affected in them (Figure 7h). However, when we analyzed the number of vGluT1<sup>+</sup> boutons in contact with soma of Rh-Dex<sup>+</sup> Gl motor neurons, we observed a great reduction in the number of boutons in <italic>Isl2</italic> KO mice (Figure 7i-k). Furthermore, the number of boutons in zone 2, but not in zone 1, was significantly reduced in <italic>Isl2</italic> KO mice (Figure 7k). Thus, ectopically located Gl motor neurons are more likely to receive fewer proprioceptive sensory inputs compared to the motor neurons in a normal position in the absence of <italic>Isl2</italic>. Collectively, our findings suggest that <italic>Isl2</italic> KO mice displayed reduced and misoriented dendrites of Gl motor pools, leading to defective sensorimotor connections.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The way MN numbers are given throughout the manuscript is confusing. The authors quantify MN/section. However, especially for motor pool counts, this results in a lot of variability since at the beginning and end of each motor pool you have 1-2 MNs, while higher numbers are in the middle. The data should be recalculated and presented as average MN numbers/mouse (n=1 mouse and not 1 section). This would reduce variability within the datasets.</p></disp-quote><p>We re-analyzed number of motor neurons as an average number of motor neurons per section derived from one embryo of each genotype in Figure 2 to Figure 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5). Figure 1: The authors discuss the different spatiotemporal expressions of Isl1 and Isl2 but this is not shown (maybe inferred from RNAseq). Only one time point is shown in the figure (e12.5). It would be nice to show the temporal expression of both TFs at different embryonic time points and also in combination with motor pool markers. For example, the overlap of Isl2 with Pea3 at brachial and lumbar levels is not shown. Showing which motor pools express high and sustained levels of Isl2 in this figure would be a nice setup for the rest of the story.</p></disp-quote><p>To refine the temporal depiction of Isl2 and Pea3 expression dynamics, we have enriched Figure 1d and e with contours or additional images. These results illuminate the spatiotemporal distribution of Isl1, Isl2 and Etv4 at E10.5 and/or E12.5. Furthermore, we have provided further details in Result section as below. In brief, our observations delineate the initiation of Isl2 expression in early postmitotic motor neurons, slightly lagging behind Isl1 across all motor neurons. Meanwhile, Etv4 expression remains confined to specific LMC motor pools.</p><p>Page 5: âAt E10.5, during motor neuron generation, Olig2<sup>+</sup> pMNs were initially found in the middle part of the ventral spinal cord, co-expressing Lhx3, a marker for pMNs and MMC (Lee, Lee, Ruiz, and Pfaff, 2005; Thaler, Lee, Jurata, Gill, and Pfaff, 2002) (Figure 1d). As these cells migrated, they transiently expressed markers for postmitotic motor neurons Isl1 and Hb9. <italic>Isl2</italic> expression emerged slightly later, found in more lateral regions across all levels analyzed. To analyze the distribution of Isl2 during the motor neuron maturation, we compared the relative position of three populations: Olig2<sup>+</sup> pMNs, Olig2<sup>+</sup>Isl1<sup>+</sup> immature motor neurons, and <italic>Isl2</italic>-expressing motor neurons. Contour and density assessments revealed that <italic>Isl2</italic> expression began slightly after Isl1 expression in immature motor neurons and persisted in postmitotic motor neurons along with Isl1 (Figure 1d). At E12.5, when motor columns became distinct, we identified them based on the expression of motor neuronal markers, including Foxp1 (marker for LMC), Isl1 (marker for LMCm and PGC), Lhx3 (marker for MMC), nNOS (marker for PGC), and Etv4 (marker for some LMC motor pools). Motor pools expressing Etv4 were located in the LMC but not at the thoracic level (Figure 1e). Isl2 exhibited broad expression across all motor columns, unlike other LIM-HD transcription factors that showed specific expression patterns. Overall, while <italic>Isl2</italic> is present in differentiated motor neurons, it is relatively enriched in MMC and LMCl populations, where its expression is more prominent compared to Isl1.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6). Figure 2-4: MN numbers should be recalculated and presented so that n=1 mouse. It is likely that this might change some of the data. For example, in Figure 3a, there is a visible reduction of Scip+ MNs. When the source data for Figure 3c was reanalyzed, there seems to be a 30% reduction of FCU neurons with a P=0.03 (not significant but close, perhaps would be significant if n&gt;3). Is Isl2 highly expressed in Scip+ MNs at brachial levels (see point for Figure 1). Also the MN positional changes should be quantified in these figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We re-analyzed number of motor neurons as an average number of motor neurons per section derived from one embryo of each genotype in Figure 2 to Figure 7. We replaced the image of Scip neurons, which provides a more representative depiction of their average distribution in C6 and C8 segments. We also reanalyzed FCU counts as the average number of MNs per embryo, revealing no significant difference. In addition, we provided density plots and boxplots showing distribution of neurons along V-D and M-L axes in Figure 3 and 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7). Figure 6: After comparing their RNAseq data to scRNAseq the authors mention that only 50% seem to be MN-specific. Is this technical (not deep enough sequencing in the scRNA-seq datasets) or are the rest of the genes in interneurons? This relates to the comment about other affected populations in the null mouse. In the in situ data, the ventrolateral pools are indicated, however, the changes appear to be broader, affecting the entire lumbar spinal cord. The nNos data should be shown separately since that is in the thoracic spinal cord.</p></disp-quote><p>In our investigation, we conducted bulk RNAseq analysis on tissue samples from the ventral part of embryonic spinal cord tissues. Thus, the analyzed transcripts could potentially originate from either motor neurons or other cell types. To pinpoint genes within motor neurons, we referred to the list of genes established to exist in motor neurons. Employing a threshold filter, we considered genes with a minimum raw read count greater than 1 per gene from the scRNA-seq dataset obtained from embryonic motor neurons. Such threshold filters are commonly used in transcriptomic analyses, often with varying read count threshold ranging from 1 to around 10, contingent upon specific research criteria (Corchete et al., 2020; Evrony, Lee, Park, and Walsh, 2016; Namboori et al., 2021). To capture potential DEGs affiliated with motor neurons without losing valuable candidates, we adopted a minimum raw read count &gt; 1 per gene. However, given that our data emanated from the entire ventral spinal cord and did not further refine genes exclusively expressed in motor neurons, some candidate genes showed broader expression. Regardless of the origin of the transcript, whether motor neuron or broadly expressed, we verified that the levels of transcripts were diminished in specific motor pools of interest in <italic>Isl2</italic> mutant mice, in alignment with our DEG analysis. In our revised manuscript, we have spotlighted ISH results from six DEGs and an additional three enriched genes identified from scRNAseq analyses. These genes collectively exhibit relatively specific expression in Gl motor pools, with a noticeable distinction of its transcript in <italic>Isl2</italic> null mice (Figure 6h, i). Lastly, we have removed nNos data since it is already reported earlier in Figure 2.</p><p>Page 10: <bold>â</bold>For instance, <italic>Epha3</italic>, <italic>Fgf10</italic> and <italic>Sema5a</italic> transcripts were enriched in Gl motor pools and their expression was reduced in <italic>Isl2</italic> KO, validated by in situ hybridization analysis (Figure 6i, Supplementary Table S3). Collectively, our integrated approach, combining bulk and scRNAseq analyses datasets, proves valuable in identifying new potential motor pool markers and uncovering novel transcription target genes.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8). Figure 7: In the text, it is mentioned that the Pea3 pools are Gl, Rf, and Tfl and that a retrograde tracer was injected into individual muscles. However, only the Gl data are shown. What about the other pools? Do they have normal dendrites? It seems that Pea3 is not the whole story as Rf has normal NMJ innervation. What about sensory innervation? Is that synapse loss specific to Gl MNs? What about Rf and Tfl? What about non-Pea3+ pools?</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely appreciate the valuable feedback offered by the Reviewer. Following the suggestion of our Reviewer, we expanded our study to encompass the developmental examination of other Etv4-expressing motor pools, namely Rf and Tfl, in addition to Gl. Our comprehensive analysis uncovered noteworthy developmental impacts on the Tfl motor pools, while the Rf motor pools remained unaffected. Considering the divergence of Tfl axons from Gl projections, it is plausible that these motor pools share analogous developmental genetic programs. A previous study reported that Etv4 expression is transient in Rf motor pools, lasting until E13.5 (De Marco Garcia and Jessell, 2008). Thus, the postnatal development of Rf motor pools could be independent of Etv4. These results support the notion that Isl2 exerts both a universal and distinct influence on Etv4+ motor pools, albeit to varying extents. We have supplemented our findings with illustrative images and quantification data (Figure 7d, Figure 8h-j and Figure 8âfigure supplement 3), providing further elaboration within the Results and Discussion sections of our manuscript.</p><p>Page 11: âSimilarly, Tfl motor pools, whose axons diverged from one of the major branches of Gl ones, also displayed shorter and lesser dendritic arbors in <italic>Isl2</italic> KO mice (Gould et al., 2008). The position and dendritic arborization of Rf motor pools remained unchanged in <italic>Isl2</italic> KO mice (Figure 7d). Considering that Etv4 expression has been previously reported to be transient until E13.5 in Rf motor pools, it may not play a significant role in the dendritic arborization of Rf motor pools (De Marco Garcia and Jessell, 2008).â</p><p>Page 13: âIn Tfl muscle, abnormal AChRs were formed along axon branches at P0, and a drastic loss in AChR clusters and polyinnervation were observed at P28 in <italic>Isl2</italic> KO mice (Figure 8h, i and j). However, Rf muscles, whose motor pools transiently express Etv4, showed normal arrangement of NMJs (Figure 8âfigure supplement 3) (De Marco Garcia and Jessell, 2008).â</p><p>To discern whether the defects evident in the global <italic>Isl2</italic> KO mice stem exclusively from motor neurons, we undertook a detailed characterization of motor neurons in <italic>Isl2</italic> cKO, where Isl2 was specifically lacking within motor neurons. Notably, the observed phenotypes in both mouse lines was remarkably similar, i.e., dispersed motor neurons, the absence of Etv4 expression in selective lumbar motor pools, disrupted NMJ formation. This congruence in outcomes was further underscored by our observations in the chicken neural tube, where acute knockdown of <italic>Isl2</italic> led to the distinction of <italic>Etv4</italic> expression.</p><p>Additionally, we investigated the spindle innervation of sensory Ia to Gl muscles in <italic>Isl2</italic> null mice. The results indicated an unaffected sensory nerve innervation, suggesting that Isl2 deficiency did not influence sensory nerve connections. It is important to note that, given the preliminary nature of this finding and its relevance ot ongoing studies, we have opted to present these results exclusively for the Reviewers at this stage (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1b</xref>). Also we examined dendrite patterning in Ta motor pools as an example of non-Pea3 motor pools. Our findings revealed no significant changes in dendritic arborization, as depicted below (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1a</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Assessment of dendritic arbors in Ta motor pools and proprioceptive innervation in Gl muscles.</title><p>(a) Representative dendritic arbors of Ta motor pools retrogradely labeled with rhodamin-dextran (red).

This allowed us to compare the number of synaptic boutons between ectopic and correctly positioned motor neurons. While we suspect that Tfl motor pools might also exhibit similar synaptic defects, these were not analyzed due to their smaller size and challenges associated with locating ectopic neurons. Similarly, other motor pools such as Rf or Ta, which showed relatively normal development, were not subjected to synaptic bouton examination, as the likelihood of synaptic defects in these pools was lower.</p><p>References</p><p>Arber, S., Ladle, D.
