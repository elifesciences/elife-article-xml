Using the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic salivary gland (SG) as a model, we uncover the role of the SP1/KLF transcription factor Huckebein (Hkb) in coordinating cell cycle regulation and morphogenesis. The <italic>hkb</italic> mutant SG exhibits defects in invagination positioning and organ size due to the abnormal death of SG cells. Normal SG development involves distal-to-proximal progression of endoreplication (endocycle), whereas <italic>hkb</italic> mutant SG cells undergo abnormal cell division, leading to cell death. Hkb represses the expression of key cell cycle and pro-apoptotic genes in the SG. Knockdown of <italic>cyclin E</italic> or <italic>cyclin-dependent kinase 1,</italic> or overexpression of <italic>fizzy-related</italic> rescues most of the morphogenetic defects observed in the <italic>hkb</italic> mutant SG. These results indicate that Hkb plays a critical role in controlling endoreplication by regulating the transcription of key cell cycle effectors to ensure proper organ formation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>salivary gland</kwd><kwd>Huckebein</kwd><kwd>endoreplication</kwd><kwd>cell cycle regulation</kwd><kwd>epithelial tube formation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008294</institution-id><institution>Louisiana State University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chung</surname><given-names>SeYeon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006952</institution-id><institution>Louisiana Board of Regents</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LEQSF(2019-22)-RD-A-04</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chung</surname><given-names>SeYeon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB 2141387</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chung</surname><given-names>SeYeon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The SP1/KLF transcription factor Huckebein controls endoreplication in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> salivary gland, ensuring proper morphogenesis during organ formation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The formation of tubular organs, such as the lungs and kidneys, begins with the folding of flat epithelial tissues into functional three-dimensional (3D) tubular structures. In humans, errors in tube formation can result in congenital defects such as spina bifida and lung hypoplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wilde et al., 2014</xref>). Studies in both vertebrates and invertebrates have revealed key morphogenetic mechanisms underlying epithelial tube formation during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrew and Ewald, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Herriges and Morrisey, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Girdler and Röper, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nikolopoulou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Spina and Cowin, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pradhan et al., 2023</xref>). While proper cell shape changes and cell rearrangement are critical, precise regulation of cell division and cell death is also essential for tissue morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huh et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">LeGoff and Lecuit, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Godard and Heisenberg, 2019</xref>). Notably, the interplay between cell division and cell death provides a homeostatic control system necessary for proper organ formation. Perturbations at any stage of the cell cycle can have detrimental effects on cell viability, leading to cell death, and activation of apoptosis can trigger compensatory proliferation in surrounding cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ryoo et al., 2004</xref>). In addition to their role in establishing and maintaining the correct number of cells in tissues and organs, cell division and cell death generate biophysical forces through actomyosin reorganization that help shape the final tissue morphology. For example, during <italic>Drosophila</italic> tracheal invagination, mitotic cell rounding drives the internalization of the tracheal primordium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kondo and Hayashi, 2013</xref>). During dorsal closure and leg folding in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Toyama et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Monier et al., 2015</xref>) and neural closure in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Massa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yamaguchi et al., 2011</xref>), apoptotic cells generate forces at both local and tissue scales that affect tissue remodeling. Therefore, to fully understand the mechanisms of organ formation, it is critical to know how the cell cycle, cell death, and morphogenesis are coordinated during epithelial tube formation.</p><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic SG is a premier model for studying the mechanisms of tube formation from a flat epithelial sheet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sidor and Röper, 2016</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo contains two SGs, each consisting of 140–150 cells, which initially reside on the embryo surface and invaginate to form single-layered, elongated tubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Once SG cells are specified, they do not divide or die. Cell death is actively inhibited during SG morphogenesis. The SG-upregulated transcription factors Fork head (Fkh), Senseless, and Sage inhibit apoptosis by downregulating proapoptotic genes, such as <italic>head involution defective</italic> (<italic>hid</italic>) and <italic>reaper</italic> (<italic>rpr</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Myat and Andrew, 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chandrasekaran and Beckendorf, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fox et al., 2013</xref>). Instead of cell division, SG cells undergo endoreplication (endocycle), a variant of the cell cycle that involves DNA replication without subsequent cell division forming polyploid cells, upon invagination at stage 11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Follette et al., 1998</xref>). SG cells that have completed one round of endoreplication arrest the cell cycle in G2 until the larval stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Smith and Orr-Weaver, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chandrasekaran and Beckendorf, 2005</xref>). Endoreplication, which is more common in invertebrates and plants, was thought to be a rare cell cycle variation in mammals. However, recent studies have revealed endoreplication in various mammalian tissues, including humans, and endoreplication is emerging as a potential developmental timer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gandarillas et al., 2018</xref>). Like the conventional cell cycle, endoreplication is regulated by key cell cycle genes such as cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). In <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryogenesis, re-entry into S phase during endoreplication is regulated by the cyclin E-Cdk2 complex through the E2F proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duronio et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Follette et al., 1998</xref>). Because SG morphogenesis occurs in the absence of cell division and cell death, studies of SG morphogenesis have primarily focused on the mechanisms underlying cell shape changes, cell intercalation, and collective cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pirraglia et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Xu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Röper, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ismat et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Booth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sanchez-Corrales et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sánchez-Corrales et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Le and Chung, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vishwakarma et al., 2022</xref>).

SG invagination occurs in a stereotypical manner, with two predominant cell behaviors occurring in distinct spatial domains within the placode relative to the invagination pit forming in the dorsal/posterior region: clustered apical constriction near the pit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and cell intercalation far from the pit. Two early-expressed SG-upregulated transcription factors, Fkh and Hkb, play critical roles in SG invagination. Fkh, a winged-helix transcription factor that regulates more than two-thirds of the known SG genes, is essential for SG invagination; SG cells fail to invaginate in <italic>fkh</italic> mutants in which apoptosis is inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Myat and Andrew, 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maruyama et al., 2011</xref>). Hkb, an SP1/KLF transcription factor, is crucial for invagination positioning; SG cells invaginate in the central region of the placode in <italic>hkb</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Myat and Andrew, 2000b</xref>). A recent study proposed that the early patterning of Fkh and Hkb and their downstream effectors ensures positionally fixed cell behaviors with respect to invagination position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sánchez-Corrales et al., 2021</xref>). For example, a key downstream target of Fkh, Folded gastrulation (Fog), signals through its G protein-coupled receptor to activate Rho kinase and myosin to regulate apical constriction in the dorsal/posterior region of the SG placode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vishwakarma et al., 2022</xref>). Despite the intriguing phenotype of <italic>hkb</italic> mutants, the mechanism of how Hkb regulates SG invagination positioning remains largely unknown. Only two potential downstream targets of Hkb involved in SG formation have been identified: <italic>crumbs</italic> (<italic>crb</italic>), encoding a key apical membrane protein, and <italic>klarsicht</italic> (<italic>klar</italic>), encoding a Nesprin family protein that mediates dynein-dependent organelle trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Myat and Andrew, 2002</xref>).

In support of this, we observed DCP-1-positive cells with reduced apical areas in <italic>hkb</italic> mutant SGs at stage 11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Among the SG cells of lower 30% of apical areas, more than 40% were DCP-1-positive (n=29/72 cells in five SGs from different embryos). We did not detect a significant spatial bias in the distribution of DCP-1-positive cells among the four quadrants of the SG placode in <italic>hkb</italic> null mutants, although slightly more DCP-1-positive cells were observed in the posterior region in hypomorphs and transheterozygotes of null over deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I–J</xref>).

Fzr also regulates the transition from the normal cell cycle to the endocycle by degrading mitotic cyclins during G2 phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sigrist and Lehner, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zielke et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>fzr</italic> was not a ChiP-Seq target of Hkb, and the <italic>fzr</italic> mRNA levels in the SG were fairly high in both WT and <italic>hkb</italic> mutant embryos.

Through a comprehensive analysis of mutant phenotypes, modENCODE ChIP-Seq targets of Hkb, and genetic interaction analyses, we have revealed the role of Hkb in regulating endoreplication to enable the proper development of the SG.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Hkb regulates the cell cycle through transcriptional and possibly post-translational mechanisms</title><p>During <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic development, many tissues arrest the cell cycle in the G2 phase after the initial cell divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hartenstein and Campos-ortega, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Edgar and O’Farrell, 1989</xref>). Subsequently, several tissues, including the SG, switch to the endocycle. This switch is correlated with the development of three-dimensional organs, suggesting a metabolic need to inhibit active cell proliferation to allow for such a transition during development. Using the Fly-FUCCI system and EdU labeling, we observed progressive endoreplication from distal to proximal regions during normal SG morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Our data are consistent with a previous study showing that distal cells enter S phase first during SG invagination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chandrasekaran and Beckendorf, 2005</xref>). Notably, our observation that some distal SG cells in WT re-enter S phase during late SG morphogenesis suggests a potential second wave of endoreplication toward the end of embryogenesis that has not been described. In <italic>hkb</italic> mutant SGs, progressive endoreplication is lost.</p><p>We propose that endoreplication in SG cells is regulated, at least in part, by Hkb-mediated transcriptional repression of <italic>E2f1</italic> and <italic>CycE</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). E2f1 is usually destroyed as cells transit into S phase through degradation by the S-phase activated E3 ubiquitin ligase Cullin 4. Whenever E2f1 expression persists in S phase, as is seen with ectopic expression or overexpression of E2f1, cell cycle arrest is disrupted and the rate of cell cycle progression is increased, leading to a significantly higher number of cells in the mitotic phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Neufeld et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shibutani et al., 2008</xref>), as we observed in the <italic>hkb</italic> mutant SG. The changes in the cell cycle control mechanism caused by persistent E2f1 expression during the S phase ultimately lead to widespread apoptosis in affected tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shibutani et al., 2008</xref>). During normal SG development, E2f1 and CycE (which is also a transcriptional target of E2f1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ohtani et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duronio and O’Farrell, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Royzman et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duronio et al., 1998</xref>) may together control the transition to S phase to begin endoreplication. We propose that Hkb promotes SG cell progression through the S phase, at least in part, through its repression of <italic>E2f1</italic> and <italic>CycE</italic> expression. In support of this, knockdown of <italic>CycE</italic> partially rescued the <italic>hkb</italic> mutant phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>Notably, <italic>stg</italic> transcript levels remain low in <italic>hkb</italic> mutant SGs, suggesting that the abnormal mitotic entry of <italic>hkb</italic> mutant SG cells is not due to <italic>stg</italic> upregulation. We propose that Hkb prevents entry into mitosis, at least in part, by downregulating <italic>CycA</italic> expression. CycA acts in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> G2/M phases of the cell cycle, where it regulates aspects of the DNA replication mechanism and entry into mitosis by binding to Cdk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pagano et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Knoblich et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yam et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gong and Ferrell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bendris et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sallé et al., 2012</xref>). Loss of <italic>hkb</italic> may prevent inhibition of CycA-Cdk1 activity in the SG. In support of this idea, the knockdown of <italic>Cdk1</italic>, or overexpression of <italic>Fzr,</italic> an inhibitor of mitotic cyclins, partially rescued the <italic>hkb</italic> mutant phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Depletion of the zygotic <italic>CycA</italic> pool did not rescue the <italic>hkb</italic> mutant phenotypes, either because of the contribution of the maternal <italic>CycA</italic> pool or because of the presence of CycB and CycB3, two other cyclins that bind to Cdk1 to regulate mitotic entry.</p><p>Hkb may regulate the cell cycle not only through transcriptional control of cell cycle genes but also by influencing ubiquitination, a key mechanism of cell cycle regulation. ChIP-Seq analysis revealed that Hkb targets several key components involved in ubiquitination, including <italic>cullin 1</italic> and <italic>archipelago</italic> (<italic>ago</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).

Further studies will provide a deeper understanding of the comprehensive mechanisms by which Hkb regulates the cell cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Progressive endoreplication during organ formation</title><p>Endoreplication in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic SG, coupled with invagination, allows cells to increase the number of gene copies to provide sufficient proteins for morphogenesis. The regulatory mechanism behind the progressive distal-to-proximal endoreplication in the SG remains unclear. In agreement with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sánchez-Corrales et al., 2021</xref>, we observed higher levels of Hkb in the posterior region of the placode at stage 10, which became more uniformly distributed throughout all SG cells by stage 11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). The initial difference in Hkb levels within the SG placode may lead to the differential repression of cell cycle genes, contributing to the progression of endoreplication. Alternatively, SG invagination in the dorsal/posterior region could potentially trigger the sequential onset of endoreplication, as suggested by a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chandrasekaran and Beckendorf, 2005</xref>). We observed a disruption in the progressive entry of the SG cells into endoreplication when Hkb function is lost. The degree of disruption varied between samples, with some embryos showing no SG cells in S phase, while others had a small number of SG cells at random positions along the proximal-distal axis with weaker EdU signals compared to WT SGs of similar stages, suggesting that they may be entering a weak S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Further investigation of the relationship between endoreplication regulation and SG invagination will provide a better understanding of how cell cycle and morphogenesis coordinate during organ formation. It will also be interesting to test a role for Hkb in cell cycle (endocycle) regulation in other <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues, and to test a similarly conserved role for the mammalian SP/KLF transcription factors.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Hkb’s roles in cytoskeletal reorganization and intracellular trafficking</title><p>In line with previous studies on the cellular forces exerted by dividing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kondo and Hayashi, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pinheiro and Bellaïche, 2018</xref>) and apoptotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Monier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Toyama et al., 2008</xref>) cells on neighboring cells, the abnormal cell division, and excessive cell death observed in <italic>hkb</italic> mutant SGs are associated with a tissue-wide disruption of actomyosin and cell geometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Our data show that the centralized invagination phenotype results primarily from excessive cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). However, dividing cells, particularly those near the SG boundary, may contribute to this phenotype by undergoing cell surface area expansion during cell division, increasing the number of cells with larger apical areas along the SG boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Based on Hkb ChIP-Seq targets, we propose that Hkb also plays an active role in regulating cytoskeletal organization through transcriptional regulation of key cytoskeletal regulators. Hkb targets include key Rho signaling components and their regulators, such as the small GTPases Rho1 and Rac1, and several RhoGEFs, including RhoGEF2, a key activator of Rho signaling during epithelial morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barrett et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). We also propose a critical role for Hkb in regulating intracellular trafficking. Supporting previous research on Hkb’s role in regulating Klar, an important regulator of intracellular trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Myat and Andrew, 2002</xref>), our data show that Rab11 is mislocalized basally in <italic>hkb</italic> mutant SGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Multiple endocytic components, including <italic>βCOP</italic>, <italic>AP-1-2β</italic>, <italic>AP-2α</italic>, and <italic>Nuf</italic>, as well as several Rab GTPases, including <italic>Rab4</italic>, <italic>Rab10</italic>, <italic>Rab27</italic>, and <italic>Rab30</italic>, were also identified as Hkb ChIP-Seq targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>), providing further evidence for the involvement of Hkb in intracellular trafficking. The initial difference in Hkb levels in the SG placode may lead to differential expression of these genes, which could contribute to normal invagination positioning.</p><p>In conclusion, we have uncovered a role for the Hkb transcription factor in regulating endoreplication and preventing abnormal cell cycle progression during epithelial tube formation.

Their comments and suggestions have improved the paper. The details of the changes we have made in response to each reviewer’s comments are included in blue text below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>This manuscript by Matthew and colleagues reported the role of Hkb, a transcription factor, in coordinating the cell cycle and morphogenesis during embryonic salivary gland (SG) development. Although the phenotype of hkb SG has been described, the potential mechanism for how Hkb regulates the salivary gland invagination position was still unclear. The authors of this manuscript generated strong hkb mutant lines and confirmed the SG invagination defect. Also, the expression of Hkb in the SG was examined by using hkb knock-in reporter lines. Cell number analysis indicated that the SG cell number was reduced in the hkb mutant. Interestingly, the authors found that both cell proliferation (pH3-positive cells) and cell death (Dcp-1-positive cells) were increased in the hkb mutant SG. Regarding the mechanism, the authors found that Hkb may regulate cell cycle-related genes based on available ChIP-seq data. Overall, this work illuminates the role of Hkb during SG formation.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1. In lines 337-338, 'we found that the mispositioning of the SG was due to the malformation of the duct', this conclusion lacks sufficient evidence to support it. Does Hkb express in the duct cells? Can SG defects be rescued if duct defect is rescued?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment. First, we would like to clarify that many widely used SG markers, such as Fkh and CrebA, are specifically expressed in secretory cells from mid-stage 11 onward. When the SG is specified at stage 10, both secretory and duct cells express Fkh and CrebA, but soon thereafter they are restricted to the secretory cells. Only a few markers are expressed specifically in duct cells, such as Dead Ringer. In most of our analyses we have used CrebA signals to mark the SG, We have indicated in the text that CrebA is a nuclear marker for SG secretory cells when CrebA is first introduced.</p><p>As shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 5, a salivary duct is composed of one common and two individual ducts and forms in the head region of the embryo; the secretory portion of the salivary gland forms at the end of the individual duct. Our original statement that 'we found that the mispositioning of the SG was due to the malformation of the duct' was based on the mispositioning of the SG in the anterior head region, which is associated with the significantly shortened duct phenotype with fewer duct cells (a few duct cells show DCP-1 signals, suggesting cell death), the smaller apical domain of duct cells, and more cells around the circumference of the duct (Figure 1—figure supplement 5).</p><p>Using the Hkb<sup>WT</sup>-mCherry signals, we found a very transient expression of Hkb in some duct cells at early stage 11 of embryogenesis (Figure 1—figure supplement 5). While this suggests a potential role for Hkb in the duct, due to the lack of a driver that only expresses a transgene in the duct, we could not perform a rescue experiment to test whether the SG defect can be rescued when the duct defect is rescued. Therefore, we have modified our original statement to: ‘the mispositioning of the SG may be due in part to the defects of the duct, likely resulting from a combination of reduced cell number, aberrant apical domain size, and defective cell intercalation of duct cells’, implying that the defect we see in SG positioning may have multiple contributing factors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Hkb expression was restricted to the distal region of SG at stage 12, and no Hkb expression was detected after Stage 13 (Figure S5), how does Hkb determine the proper SG formation?</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to clarify the Hkb expression in the SG. Using Hkb<sup>WT</sup>-mCh signals, we show that Hkb expression is detected in the SG from stages 10-13 (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). At stages 10 and 11, strong Hkb<sup>WT</sup>-mCh signals are detected in the SG. While higher levels of Hkb are detected in the posterior region of the placode at stage 10, all SG cells show strong Hkb expression at stage 11. At stages 12 and 13, all SG cells express weak Hkb<sup>WT</sup>-mCh signals.</p><p>Our data show that Hkb primarily regulates the proper cell cycle progression and SG cell survival during stages 11-13 to ensure proper SG formation, which correlates with the timing of Hkb expression. In addition, as shown in Sanchez-Corrales et al., 2021 and some of the ChIP-seq targets of Hkb identified in our study, Hkb also plays a role in the SG beginning at the onset of SG morphogenesis at stage 11 with the potential function of regulating the actomyosin-mediated contractility of SG cells undergoing apical constriction. In our rescue experiment, we show that overexpression of Hkb in the SG using fkh-Gal4 was sufficient to rescue most of its loss-of-function defects (Figure 2; Figure 2—figure supplement 2), suggesting the tissue-autonomous role of Hkb in SG morphogenesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>Altogether this is an interesting article that contributes significantly to the function of Hkb in organ formation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the valuable and thoughtful comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>Matthew provide an in depth analysis of the role of the SP1/KLF-like Huckebein (hkb) transcription factor during embryonic development of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> salivary gland, which provides an excellent representative tissue for understanding tubulogenesis and how cell shapes and movements are coordinated with cell cycle progression during organ formation. Interestingly, hkb function represses both entry into mitosis and apoptosis, resulting in failures of proper salivary gland invagination and elongation. This work provides an interesting example of how coordinating cell cycle progression with morphogenesis is developmentally essentially. The ample data describing the observations is quite strong and well described. However, some of the interpretations of these data, particularly with respect to cell cycle control, do not fit what is generally known from previous work, and thus the final conclusions and summary model need to be supported by more extensive evidence or phrased to consider alternative hypotheses. The critique provides more detail on this point as well as an alternative way for the authors to consider their results.</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>The FUCCI system is great, but it only measures S phase indirectly. In the hkb mutants it seems that the E2f1 reporter never really goes away entirely, as typically happens during S phase, and rather seems variable at stage 13. Thus, it's unclear whether the SG cells of hkb mutants enter the first endo S phase at all, or whether they enter a weak S phase that might not eliminate all of the E2f1. The authors really should use EdU labeling in addition in the hkb mutants to assess DNA replication directly. This labeling in embryos can be a little tricky to do, but the results will be much more definitive.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the nice suggestion. As suggested, we used EdU labeling to confirm our data with the FUCCI system and added the new data to Figure 5. Consistent with the FUCCI data, we observed different intensities of EdU signals in <italic>hkb</italic> mutants; some SGs showed no EdU signals at all, suggesting that no cells are entering S phase, while others had a small number of cells with weaker EdU signals compared to WT SGs of similar stages, suggesting that they may be entering a weak S phase. A brief discussion of this has been added to Discussion.</p><p>In addition, after analyzing more Fly-FUCCI data for late-stage SGs in combination with EdU labeling, we found that the second endocycle in WT SGs at stage 15/16 also appears to be a progression from distal to proximal rather than a random, asynchronous one. The new data have been described (Figure 5R-R’’, T).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding the data, it seems odd to me that the Hkb rescue, which isn't very strong given that WT has NO mitotic cells, is called not significantly different from WT whereas the p35 rescue is, especially because the Hkb rescue and the p35 rescue are not called significantly different from one another. Seems like the Hkb rescue didn't work very well at all here. Thus, the conclusion of compensatory proliferation not being involved is rather weak and should just be taken out or softened substantially.</p></disp-quote><p>The original Hkb rescue experiment performed at 25℃ showed a partial rescue of the phenotypes. Even under this condition, we observed a significant reduction in the number of dividing cells, which was further reduced when we performed this rescue assay at 29℃. Since Hkb expression at 29℃ almost completely rescued all the <italic>hkb</italic> mutant phenotypes, we replaced the rescue data with those at 29℃ (Figure 2G’’, P; Figure 4M; Figure 2—figure supplement 2). On the other hand, p35 overexpression, which was shown to work well at 25℃ based on the significantly reduced number of dying cells, did not reduce the number of dividing cells; quite a few SG cells still express PH3 signals in this condition, leading to our conclusion that compensatory cell proliferation may not be at play in the <italic>hkb</italic> mutant SG placode. We have included a statistical analysis to show that the number of dividing cells in the Hkb and p35 overexpression assays are significantly different from each other (Figure 4M). However, since we cannot completely rule out the possibility that compensatory proliferation by a few remaining dying cells contributes to the population of dividing cells in the mutant SG, we have softened the conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Cdk1 activating phosphatase string (stg) controls entry into embryonic mitosis in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, but the authors never discuss stg or do any experiments. A stg knockdown in the hkb mutant SG might rescue all the phenotypes much better than any of the other knockdowns performed. Also, might stg be a hkb target gene, and might repression of stg by hkb account for all the phenotypes? I say this because this statement of data interpretation in the Discussion line 569 is likely false: &quot;We propose that Hkb promotes SG cell entry into the endocycle through its repression of E2F1 and CycE expression.&quot; False because E2f1 and CycE are REQUIRED for entry into S phase and endocycle progression (lots of previous publications). Thus, this conclusion doesn't make sense to me. Rather, perhaps hkb is only repressing string, or at least this is the important control, and when this doesn't happen the E2F1/CycE driven S phase (i.e. the first endo S in stage 12/13 in WT) results in entry into mitosis rather than a pause in G2 prior to the next asynchronous endo S phase in stage 15. I would argue that this could account for all the phenotypes and that the data showing elevated E2f1 and CycE transcripts (which is marginally convincing at best unfortunately) are a red herring.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the valuable comments. We also initially thought about the possibility of <italic>stg</italic> upregulation/derepression in <italic>hkb</italic> mutants but did not discuss it in the original manuscript because <italic>stg</italic> was not a Hkb ChIP-seq target (Supplementary file 3). In the revised manuscript, we added an explicit statement in the text that <italic>stg</italic> is not a ChIP-seq target. Furthermore, using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we confirmed that <italic>stg</italic> expression is NOT upregulated in <italic>hkb</italic> mutants and included these new data in Figure 6—figure supplement 1. <italic>stg</italic> expression in the SG is very low compared to neighboring tissues both in WT and <italic>hkb</italic> mutants, and quantification showed that <italic>stg</italic> expression levels were not significantly different in the <italic>hkb</italic> mutant SG compared to WT. We therefore rule out the possibility that the <italic>hkb</italic> mutant phenotype is due to <italic>stg</italic> upregulation.</p><p>We agree that our previous statement in the Discussion &quot;We propose that Hkb promotes SG cell entry into the endocycle through its repression of E2F1 and CycE expression.&quot; did not accurately explain the data. As the reviewer aptly pointed out, E2f1 and CycE are required for entry into S phase and endocycle progression. However, several studies have shown that E2F1 should be repressed at the onset of S phase of the endocycle, whereas CycE repression should occur later in S phase; a process that is also required for the switch back to G phase of the endocycle (Shibutani et al., 2008; Zielke et al., 2011). We have restated that “Hkb promotes SG cell progression through the S phase of the endocycle, at least in part through its repression of E2F1 and CycE expression”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, could fzr be a target of hkb? Activation of fzr and repression of stg by hkb would synergize to drive the cells into an endoreplication program.</p></disp-quote><p>Fzr is not a Hkb ChIP-seq target, and we have explicitly stated this in the text. Our fluorescence in situ hybridization data showed that <italic>fzr</italic> mRNA is upregulated in both WT and <italic>hkb</italic> mutant SGs (data not shown), and it is inconclusive whether <italic>fzr</italic> mRNA levels are different in <italic>hkb</italic> mutants compared to WT. We cannot rule out that <italic>fzr</italic> levels are slightly reduced in <italic>hkb</italic> mutant SGs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In sum, the authors provide a lot of excellent data but I feel should rethink their interpretations a little bit to build a model that might match better what is already known regarding cell cycle regulation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the thoughtful comments. We have carefully revised our interpretations to explain the role of Hkb in cell cycle regulation during <italic>Drosophila</italic> salivary gland morphogenesis. Some of our findings were indeed surprising, including the lack of a clear role for <italic>stg</italic> in this context. We believe that our findings provide a compelling illustration of the sophisticated regulatory mechanisms that control the cell cycle during organ formation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>The study by Matthew et al. provides a meticulous characterization of their newly generated null hkb alleles including mCherry tag to visualize Hkb localization during <italic>Drosophila</italic> salivary gland development in embryogenesis. In contrast to a recent report, the authors discover that Hkb primary function is to regulate cell cycle and cell death genes during tissue morphogenesis. This study finds that genetic loss of hkb primarily results in enhanced cell death (DCP1+) and increased mitotic division (P-HH3+) with a more minor contribution from apical constriction. To support this conclusion the authors show using FISH that genetic loss of hkb results in upregulation of cell death gene: reaper and cell cycle genes: E2F1, CycE, and CycA. However, the FISH staining is not quantified and in some cases the staining does not seem significantly changed weakening the author conclusions. Lastly, the authors show that the observed morphological defect in salivary gland development can be partially rescued by combining the hkb null mutant with the knockdown of either CycE, E2F1 or overexpression of Fizzy-related (an E3 ligase that inhibits mitotic cyclins). Therefore, the study has revealed a novel function for Hkb in regulation of SG cell cycle timing during development.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) The FISH assays need to be quantified to determine whether there is or not a significant change in gene expression (Figures 6 and S12). The change reported in text and a major conclusion of this study is not immediately apparent for E2F1 and CycE.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included quantifications of mRNA levels for <italic>rpr</italic>, <italic>E2f1</italic>, and <italic>CycE</italic> for stage 11 SGs in Figure 6, which show that there is a significant increase in the transcript levels of these genes in <italic>hkb</italic> mutants compared to WT, supporting our conclusion. We measured the mean gray value of the mRNA signal intensity in each SG placode and performed a careful background subtraction using the same regions of the embryo that showed low signal intensity in WT and <italic>hkb</italic> mutant conditions. Statistical comparison was performed in GraphPad Prism using Student’s t-test with Welch's correction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A negative control for the hkb rescue assay would be very helpful to further support the authors conclusion that the primary function of Hkb is to repress cell cycle genes and not via the regulation of apical constriction originally reported. This could be accomplished by expressing or knocking down regulators of apical constriction as reported in this study (i.e. Rok and/or myoII mutants).</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to point out that although our data suggest that the primary function of Hkb is to regulate key cell cycle genes, we are not arguing that Hkb does not have a role in regulating apical constriction. As we discussed in the Discussion, we propose that in addition to regulating key cell cycle genes, Hkb has a role in regulating apical constriction by regulating cytoskeletal networks. ChIP-seq targets identified key regulators of actomyosin networks, which also supports a model for Hkb in regulating actin polymerization, a process crucial for actomyosin-mediated contractility during apical constriction, and intracellular trafficking components, another important process linked to actomyosin contractility during apical constriction (Le and Chung, 2021). Moreover, SGs with blocked apoptosis still exhibited apical constriction defects (quantification of apical areas shown in a new Figure 3G, G’), supporting our model that Hkb regulates apical constriction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Also, it would further strengthen the authors conclusion that Hkb inhibition of both cell death and cycle genes is necessary for SG development if they could assess whether co-expression p35 and E2F1 RNAi in a hkb null mutant enhances the rescue of SG development.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the nice suggestion. As suggested, we performed an assay to simultaneously inhibit both cell death and cell division by overexpressing p35 and Fzr in the <italic>hkb</italic> mutant background (Figure 6—figure supplement 4). We chose to overexpress Fzr rather than knock down <italic>E2f1</italic>, as Fzr, when overexpressed in tissues, acts as a repressor of mitosis via its repression of the mitotic cyclins, shunting these tissues into the endoreplication cycle. We observed an enhancement of the rescue phenotype compared to inhibition of cell death or cell division alone; a more significant decrease in the number of dying and dividing cells, as well as an increase in the number of elongated SGs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>This study extends our knowledge of how a conserved transcription factor, Hkb, functions in tissue morphogenesis during animal development using the salivary gland of the fruit fly as a model. This study will be of particular importance to developmental biologist who seek to understand the mechanistic regulation of tubule formation and tissue morphogenesis. The study's conclusion that Hkb functions primarily as a regulator of cell cycle and cell death will warrant further investigation into its role in tissue morphogenesis in other tissues in the fruit fly as well as in mammalian development. Therefore, this study will be of broad interest to basic research community.</p><p>My field of expertise is cell biology and genetics with a focus on polyploidy.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the valuable and thoughtful comments.</p></body></sub-article></article>
