Here, we examine two knock-in mouse models replicating de novo sequence variations in the human <italic>HCN1</italic> voltage-gated channel gene, p.G391D and p.M153I (<italic>Hcn1<sup>G380D/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Hcn1<sup>M142I/+</sup></italic> in mouse), associated with severe drug-resistant neonatal- and childhood-onset epilepsy, respectively. Heterozygous mice from both lines displayed spontaneous generalized tonic‚Äìclonic seizures. Animals replicating the p.G391D variant had an overall more severe phenotype, with pronounced alterations in the levels and distribution of HCN1 protein, including disrupted targeting to the axon terminals of basket cell interneurons. In line with clinical reports from patients with pathogenic <italic>HCN1</italic> sequence variations, administration of the antiepileptic Na<sup>+</sup> channel antagonists lamotrigine and phenytoin resulted in the paradoxical induction of seizures in both mouse lines, consistent with an impairment in inhibitory neuron function. We also show that these variants can render HCN1 channels unresponsive to classic antagonists, indicating the need to screen mutated channels to identify novel compounds with diverse mechanism of action. Our results underscore the necessity of tailoring effective therapies for specific channel gene variants, and how strongly validated animal models may provide an invaluable tool toward reaching this objective.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>HCN1</kwd><kwd>ion channels</kwd><kwd>epileptic encephalopathy</kwd><kwd>lamotrigine</kwd><kwd>phenytoin</kwd><kwd>Dravet syndrome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS106983</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Siegelbaum</surname><given-names>Steven A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS109366</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Siegelbaum</surname><given-names>Steven A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS123648</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Siegelbaum</surname><given-names>Steven A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FOR 2715 (IS63/10-1/2)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Isbrandt</surname><given-names>Dirk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRC 1451 (project ID 431549029 - B01)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Isbrandt</surname><given-names>Dirk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002426</institution-id><institution>Fondazione Telethon</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GGP20021</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moroni</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Two genetic mouse models for <italic>HCN1</italic>-linked developmental epileptic encephalopathy display distinct biophysical changes in HCN1 ion channel properties but similar worsening of seizures in response to antiepileptic drugs, thereby recapitulating key features of the human disease.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEE) are a devastating group of diseases, often with poor response to pharmacological treatment, resulting in a lifelong burden of seizures, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. Since the original discovery over 20 years ago that de novo mutations in voltage-gated ion channels can directly cause early childhood epilepsy syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Singh et al., 1998</xref>), the number of genes and gene variants associated with DEE has grown exponentially. Current estimates indicate that ~30% of DEE patients carry at least one pathogenic variant in the top 100 known gene candidates for the disease, with about a third of the affected genes falling into the category of voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Noebels, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Oyrer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wang and Frankel, 2021</xref>). Despite the wealth of genetic data available and recent efforts to model the effects of the pathogenic variants in genetically modified mice, we understand very little about the mechanisms that underlie the brain and neuronal circuit alterations responsible for seizures or the reasons for their drug resistance.</p><p>Here, we focus on seizures and pharmacological response profile associated with mutations in the <italic>HCN1</italic> gene, which encodes a hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-regulated non-selective cation channel expressed prominently in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Santoro and Shah, 2020</xref>). To date, a total of 40 different missense variants in the <italic>HCN1</italic> gene have been reported in patients affected by epilepsy and/or neurodevelopmental disorders (source: HGMD Professional 2020.4). Among these, at least 12 different de novo HCN1 variants have been linked to DEE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nava et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Butler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marini et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The functional role of HCN1 channels is tied closely to their distinct subcellular localization in the two classes of neurons where HCN1 protein is primarily expressed, pyramidal neurons in neocortex and hippocampus, and parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons across the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Notomi and Shigemoto, 2004</xref>). Within these neuronal classes, the subcellular localization of HCN1 channel subunits is tightly regulated. In excitatory (pyramidal) neurons, the channel is targeted to the distal portion of the apical dendrites, where it constrains the dendritic integration of excitatory postsynaptic potentials, limiting excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tsay et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">George et al., 2009</xref>). In inhibitory (PV+) neurons, HCN1 channels are localized exclusively to axonal terminals, where they facilitate rapid action potential (AP) propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Roth and Hu, 2020</xref>) and may regulate GABA release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Southan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aponte et al., 2006</xref>). Decreased expression or activity of HCN1 channels, as observed in several rodent models of acquired epilepsy, has been thus posited to increase overall network excitability and contribute to epileptogenesis and seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jung et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McClelland et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brennan et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we examine two new genetic mouse models that reproduce de novo HCN1 variants previously shown to be associated with severe forms of neonatal- and childhood-onset epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Parrini et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marini et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fern√°ndez-Marmiesse et al., 2019</xref>). A prior attempt at modeling <italic>HCN1</italic>-linked DEE in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bleakley et al., 2021</xref>) resulted in a relatively mild phenotype, wherein spontaneous seizures could not be systematically documented, despite the presence of epileptiform spikes on electrocorticogram recordings (ECoG). Furthermore, it has been reported that mice with either global or forebrain-restricted deletion of HCN1 also lack spontaneous seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nolan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nolan et al., 2004</xref>), although seizure susceptibility is increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Santoro et al., 2010</xref>). This prompted the question whether there may be some general limitation to modeling <italic>HCN1</italic>-linked DEE in mice. To examine this question and probe further whether and how <italic>HCN1</italic> sequence variations may give rise to DEE, we generated mouse models for two other <italic>HCN1</italic> variants linked to DEE in humans.</p><p>We examined variants c.1172G&gt;A/p.Gly391Asp and c.459G&gt;C/p.Met153Ile based on three criteria: severity of disease; occurrence in at least two independent patients with similar epilepsy phenotypes; and differing biophysical effects on channel function when tested in heterologous expression systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marini et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, clinical reports suggest that seizures are poorly controlled with standard antiseizure medications and that certain anticonvulsants in fact exacerbate seizures in these patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marini et al., 2018</xref>). Our results show that both de novo variants lead to spontaneous seizures in mice and reproduce the paradoxical pharmacological responses seen in patients, providing new insights into the mechanistic basis for the limitations of current drug therapies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Pathogenic sequence variants orthologous to human <italic>HCN1</italic> variants p.G391D and p.M153I were generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 approach in the <italic>Hcn1</italic> gene of inbred C57BL/6J mice (see ‚ÄòMaterials and methods‚Äô; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tr√∂der et al., 2018</xref>).

It should be furthermore noted that recordings at the soma might not reveal changes in the input resistance occurring in distal dendrites, where HCN1 expression is highest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>).</p><p>The possibility that the expression of mutant HCN1 channels may cause secondary changes in CA1 pyramidal neuron function is consistent with our finding that CA1 cells in both mouse lines show an impaired ability to fire APs, a phenotype not observed with acute application of the HCN channel-specific blocker ZD7288 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gasparini and DiFrancesco, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5‚Äîfigure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, application of positive current steps from a common holding potential of ‚Äì70 mV revealed an abnormal firing pattern in CA1 neurons from both lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), wherein a majority of <italic>Hcn1<sup>GD/+</sup></italic> neurons and a significant fraction of <italic>Hcn1<sup>MI/+</sup></italic> neurons showed a reduction in the number of APs fired during 1-s-long depolarizing current steps (fraction of neurons with abnormal firing pattern: 16/21 cells = 76% <italic>Hcn1<sup>GD/+</sup></italic> versus 13/35 cells = 37% <italic>Hcn1<sup>MI/+</sup></italic>, p=0.006, Fisher‚Äôs exact probability test showing a larger effect in the former cohort; 1/44 cells = 2% in the combined set of WT littermate neurons). In contrast, rheobase was unaltered in both lines when measured from a holding potential of ‚Äì70 mV (GD: WT = 100 ¬± 9.6 pA, n = 20, versus <italic>Hcn1<sup>GD/+</sup></italic> = 114.3 ¬± 8.0 pA, n = 21; MI: WT = 101.0 ¬± 6.8 pA, n = 25 versus <italic>Hcn1<sup>MI/+</sup></italic> = 98.6 ¬± 6.4 pA, n = 38), and no changes were observed in AP threshold, AP peak or AP width (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5‚Äîfigure supplement 1</xref>). These findings suggest a lack of secondary changes in voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channel function, at least in pyramidal neurons, unlike what has been reported in the case of the p.M305L variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bleakley et al., 2021</xref>).

Overall, our combined findings on native protein expression in the cerebellar pinceau and virus-transduced protein expression in the axonal terminals of hippocampal basket cells suggest that disruption of PV+ interneuron function, due to HCN1 protein misfolding or altered trafficking, may represent an important component of neuronal circuit dysfunction in HCN1-linked epilepsy.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Paradoxical response of <italic>Hcn1</italic><sup><italic>GD</italic>/+</sup> and <italic>Hcn1</italic><sup><italic>MI</italic>/+</sup> mice to antiseizure medications</title><p>Clinical reports from at least four different patients with <italic>HCN1</italic>-linked DEE (carrying variants p.M305L, p.G391D, and p.I380F; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marini et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bleakley et al., 2021</xref>; C.

Both patients had neonatal seizure onset, characterized by daily asymmetric tonic seizures with apnea and cyanosis, severe developmental delay, and died between 14 and 15 months of age.

Although both drugs act as Na<sup>+</sup> channel blockers, LTG is also widely considered an HCN channel activator, a property thought to contribute to its antiepileptic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Poolos et al., 2002</xref>). Despite multiple reports on its action on <italic>I</italic><sub>h</sub> in neurons, showing somewhat inconsistent outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Peng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2016</xref>), no studies have been conducted to directly test the effect of LTG on isolated HCN channels expressed in heterologous systems. To obtain further clarification on the mechanism of action of LTG, we tested the drug on wildtype HCN1 and HCN2 channels after transient transfection in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Surprisingly, we found that LTG had no effects on either the midpoint voltage of activation or maximal tail current density of either HCN1 or HCN2 channels; LTG also had no effects when HCN1 was coexpressed with its auxiliary subunit TRIP8b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). In contrast, under the same conditions, LTG exerted its expected inhibitory effect on Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 sodium channel currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9‚Äîfigure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Qiao et al., 2014</xref>). These results clearly show that LTG is not a direct activator of HCN channels and suggest that any effects reported in neurons are the result of indirect regulation of <italic>I</italic><sub>h</sub>, perhaps secondary to Na<sup>+</sup> channel block, and likely contingent on cell-specific, state-dependent signal transduction pathways. Although further experiments in mouse brain slices are needed to fully rule out an effect of this drug on native HCN channels with pathogenic sequence variants, it seems likely the effects of LTG on <italic>Hcn1<sup>GD/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Hcn1<sup>MI/+</sup></italic> animals are due to its action to directly block Na<sup>+</sup> channels ‚Äì similar to the effects of phenytoin ‚Äì rather than an enhancement of HCN currents.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Lamotrigine (LTG) has no direct effect on HCN1 or HCN2 channel activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sample current traces from whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings in HEK293T cells transiently expressing HCN1 (top), HCN1 and TRIP8b (middle) or HCN2 (bottom), in the absence or presence of bath applied LTG (100 ŒºM).

At the same time, many of the most severe <italic>HCN1</italic> variants, including p.G391D, are located in the S6 transmembrane domain of the channel, which forms the inner lining of the pore. Such observations raise the question whether pathogenic mutations affecting pore structure may decrease the efficacy of currently available HCN-blocking compounds.</p><p>The structural models presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10F</xref> illustrate the proximity of the G391D mutation to the known binding site of ZD7288 in the HCN pore cavity, wherein the residue immediately preceding G391 (V390 in human HCN1, corresponding to V379 in mouse) was shown to critically affect the sensitivity of the channel to the drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2007</xref>). The presence of charged aspartate residues in G391D-containing subunits leads to a disruption in the symmetry of the pore in heteromeric channels containing at least one WT subunit, and consequently in the relative distance between the V390 side chains facing the cavity. To test whether this predicted disruption in the ZD7288 binding site leads to a reduced efficacy of the drug, we expressed heteromeric HCN1 channels containing WT and G391D subunits in HEK cells. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A and B</xref>, compared to the effect of ZD7288 to reduce the current expressed by WT HCN1 channels by ~67%, the drug was minimally effective in blocking either the instantaneous or the time-dependent current component generated by mutant WT/G391D channels (~15% inhibition). Addition of Cs<sup>+</sup>, another HCN channel blocker (albeit a less specific one, compared to ZD7288) with a different mechanism of action and binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DiFrancesco, 1982</xref>), led to a strong reduction in the current expressed by both WT and G391D channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>), confirming that the observed currents were indeed generated by HCN1 WT/G391D heteromeric channels.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Lack of effect of ZD7288 on <italic>Hcn1<sup>GD/+</sup></italic> neurons and heterologously expressed hHCN1-WT/G391D channels.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings in HEK293T cells heterologously expressing either human HCN1 (hHCN1) WT or heteromeric hHCN1 WT/G391D channels.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C‚ÄìE</xref>, application of the compound did not modify either the RMP or input resistance in <italic>Hcn1<sup>GD/+</sup></italic> neurons, while appropriately eliminating voltage sag, hyperpolarizing the RMP, and increasing input resistance in WT neurons. These results leave unanswered the question whether the positive shift in RMP in <italic>Hcn1<sup>GD/+</sup></italic> neurons is directly due to ‚Äòleaky‚Äô HCN1 channels or is a secondary response to changes in other conductances.

The overarching goal of such precision medicine is to identify the specific molecular and network mechanisms that link distinct epilepsy variants in individual genes to particular disease profiles, resulting in more effective gene- or variant-specific therapeutic strategies. Despite the fact that dysfunction in ion channels carrying missense mutations can be promptly modeled in heterologous expression systems, such assessments do not sufficiently reflect the dysfunction caused by the sequence variations in vivo, preventing the direct translation of such datasets into applicable clinical strategies. In our study, we set out to fill this information gap by designing new preclinical models, which reproduce key disease features of <italic>HCN1-</italic>linked DEE. The <italic>Hcn1<sup>GD/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Hcn1<sup>MI/+</sup></italic> knock-in mice we generated display not only an appropriate and robust epilepsy phenotype, along with comorbid behavioral abnormalities, but illustrate the difficulties intrinsic to the treatment of genetic developmental epilepsies, including the adverse response of individuals with <italic>HCN1</italic> variants to conventional antiseizure medications, and the potential for altered drug sensitivity of mutant channels. These results underscore how mutations in voltage-gated ion channels can fundamentally alter network properties and the response of neuronal circuits to pharmacological challenge. Some of these alterations may be acute, while others may result from HCN1 channel dysfunction impacting brain development, as multiple studies have demonstrated the influence of HCN channels on cortical maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schlusche et al., 2021</xref>) and the complex interplay between HCN isoforms in shaping developing neuronal networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Surges et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bender and Baram, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stoenica et al., 2013</xref>). In this scenario, our models provide a useful system for testing mechanistic hypotheses and developing new therapeutic approaches.</p><p>A notable feature of our models and patients with <italic>HCN1</italic> sequence variations is the paradoxical induction of seizures by LTG and phenytoin. A similar phenomenon has been reported both in Dravet syndrome patients carrying <italic>SCN1A</italic> pathogenic variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Perucca and Perucca, 2019</xref>) and in mice modeling <italic>Scn1a</italic> haploinsufficiency (<italic>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hawkins et al., 2017</xref>). In Dravet syndrome, loss-of-function mutations in the <italic>SCN1A</italic> sodium channel gene are thought to promote seizures by exerting a net effect to reduce the excitability of inhibitory interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Catterall, 2018</xref>). This has led to the suggestion that certain anticonvulsant drugs acting as Na<sup>+</sup> channel blockers paradoxically exacerbate seizures in this syndrome as a result of a synergistic action to further suppress inhibition. Interestingly, the axon-specific expression of HCN1 channels in PV+ interneurons matches the similarly polarized subcellular distribution of voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels, wherein Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 (encoded by <italic>SCN1A</italic>) is the predominant subtype expressed in the axon of PV+ interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ogiwara et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ogiwara et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dutton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hedrich et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hu and Jonas, 2014</xref>). To maintain ionic homeostasis during repetitive firing, PV+ interneuron axons also strongly express Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Peng et al., 1997</xref>), which will activate in response to Na<sup>+</sup> entry, leading to membrane hyperpolarization due to electrogenic pump activity. Recent pharmacological studies in vitro have proposed that axonal expression of HCN channels can counteract the hyperpolarizing Na<sup>+</sup> pump current during repetitive firing, allowing for fast AP firing and propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Roth and Hu, 2020</xref>). Thus, blockade of HCN channel activity in PV+ interneuron axon terminals results in a failure in AP propagation and reduced perisomatic inhibition onto target excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Southan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aponte et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Roth and Hu, 2020</xref>). Since the only HCN subtype expressed in PV+ interneuron terminals is HCN1, diminished GABAergic input onto excitatory neurons as a result of HCN1 protein dysfunction could contribute to excitation/inhibition imbalance and epilepsy. Such an effect could be exacerbated by further inhibition of Na<sup>+</sup> channel activity by antiseizure medications, similar to what is thought to occur in Dravet syndrome. HCN1 subunits also substantially contribute to regulating the excitability of a second class of inhibitory neurons, namely, somatostatin-positive interneurons, which target the dendrites of pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Matt et al., 2011</xref>). Here, HCN1 acts along with HCN2 to set the somatic resting potential and facilitate the spontaneous activity of this class of interneurons.</p><p>While our histological analysis provides some evidence as to the deleterious effects of the HCN1-GD variant on axonal function, there are some important limitations to the interpretation of this data in the absence of a direct physiological evaluation of the intrinsic and synaptic properties of PV+ interneurons. Future studies aimed at investigating the physiological effects of HCN1 mutations in genetically identified interneuron populations, along with conditional knock-in mouse lines that limit <italic>Hcn1<sup>GD</sup></italic> or <italic>Hcn1<sup>MI</sup></italic> allele expression to select classes of inhibitory neurons, will provide a more definitive answer to the question of how different variants may affect perisomatic and/or dendritic inhibition in <italic>HCN1</italic>-linked epilepsy.</p><p>When tested in heterologous expression systems, epilepsy-linked HCN1 mutations have been shown to affect the channel in several different ways. These actions include loss of function due to decreased HCN1 channel activation, decreased protein levels, and/or impaired targeting to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Porro et al., 2021</xref>). Some of the variants exert a dominant negative effect when a mutant subunit assembles into a heteromeric channel with WT subunits. Conversely, gain-of-function effects include accelerated activation kinetics, depolarized midpoint voltage of activation (as in M153I), and an increased voltage-independent component of the HCN current, that is, generation of a depolarizing ‚Äòleak‚Äô current (as in G391D). Why do <italic>HCN1</italic> mutations that in heterologous expression systems have divergent effects on channel function equally result in epilepsy, and a similar paradoxical response to certain Na<sup>+</sup> channel blockers? Our results in <italic>Hcn1<sup>GD/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Hcn1<sup>MI/+</sup></italic> mice show that both these variants ultimately led to a net decrease in <italic>I</italic><sub>h</sub>-dependent voltage sag, and a significant decrease in protein expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), despite the p.M153I variant yielding an apparent gain-of-function channel upon heterologous expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marini et al., 2018</xref>). This suggests that misfolding and impaired biosynthesis of mutant HCN1 subunits may be a prevalent consequence likely to affect the function of neurons in multiple ways. An increase in cellular stress, for example, would be expected to affect PV+ neurons in particular, as they are known to be extremely sensitive to metabolic and oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kann, 2016</xref>). Such a mechanism may explain why two variants with seemingly divergent biophysical alterations in channel functional properties ultimately cause overlapping phenotypes.</p><p>The divergent characteristics of the two variants do, however, lead to distinguishable phenotypes. This is demonstrated by the overall greater severity of the <italic>Hcn1<sup>GD/+</sup></italic> phenotype (reduced brain size, altered gait, impaired pole climbing, lack of spontaneous alternation, and greater reductions in HCN1 protein and AP firing), as well as the remarkable sex dependence of mortality in <italic>Hcn1<sup>MI/+</sup></italic> mice. This observation suggests that, while some fundamental mechanisms are affected in similar ways, there are distinctions in the manner in which physiological networks are perturbed by different <italic>HCN1</italic> variants. Moreover, similar to other ion channel-linked syndromes, a variety of disease phenotypes are observed in patients carrying <italic>HCN1</italic> pathogenic variants, with DEEs seen in ~20% of cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marini et al., 2018</xref>). Overall, if both familial and sporadic patients are considered, the predominant phenotypes are milder and include genetic generalized epilepsies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonzanni et al., 2018</xref>), as well as the spectrum of genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marini et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, some variants do not show full penetrance. An analogous picture emerges from the study of a third <italic>HCN1</italic> variant recently modeled in mice (<italic>Hcn1<sup>M294L</sup></italic>, corresponding to human p.Met305Leu; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bleakley et al., 2021</xref>). Similar to HCN1-G391D, this variant generates a channel with a significant ‚Äòleak‚Äô or voltage-independent current component, although protein levels in the <italic>Hcn1<sup>M294L</sup></italic> mouse brain are less dramatically affected. The epileptic phenotype of <italic>Hcn1<sup>M294L</sup></italic> mice is considerably milder than either <italic>Hcn1<sup>GD/+</sup></italic> or <italic>Hcn1<sup>MI/+</sup></italic> animals. Intriguingly, however, <italic>Hcn1<sup>M294L</sup></italic> mice are also adversely affected by LTG, which caused the induction of seizures, similar to heterozygous animals from the two lines presented here. From the therapeutic point of view, the observed mechanistic convergence does offer some hope that patients with genetic HCN1 channel dysfunction can be treated following similar principles or strategies across different variants. A larger convergence in treatment strategies, centered on the degree of interneuron dysfunction across multiple epilepsies, may also be envisioned to emerge in the future.</p><p>Finally, what may such strategies look like? Our data once again stress the difficulty of devising targeted therapeutic approaches for ion channel-associated DEE syndromes using existing tools. As stated above, several of the identified epilepsy-associated <italic>HCN1</italic> variants generate channels with what have been deemed ‚Äògain of aberrant‚Äô function properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bleakley et al., 2021</xref>), implying that HCN channel blockers may be potentially helpful. At the same time, several of the most severe pathogenic <italic>HCN1</italic> variants are located in the S6 segment, which forms the lining of the pore cavity, or in the immediate vicinity to the channel‚Äôs intracellular gate. These include G391D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) and two more variants at the same position, G391C and G391S, as well as M379R, I380F, A387S, F389S, I397L, S399P, and D401H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nava et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lucariello et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marini et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). While we do not have complete information available about the effects of known HCN inhibitors on the other variants, results presented here using ZD7288 on G391D-containing HCN1 channels strongly suggest that the mutations may decrease the efficacy of the pore-blocking compounds, reducing their ability to suppress both the time-dependent and time-independent current component generated by the mutant channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marini et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Porro et al., 2021</xref>). There is therefore a need to develop new small-molecule compounds that target the HCN1 channels at sites outside the pore cavity.</p><p>The available 3D structures of HCN1, combined with molecular dynamics simulations, coarse-grained modeling, and molecular docking, suggest that there are many opportunities for such a pharmacological-targeting approach to succeed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gross et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Porro et al., 2019</xref>). The structures have indeed revealed unique intracellular regulatory modules, including both the HCN domain and C-linker/CNBD, which may allow for the targeting of HCN channels through allosteric modulation of pore gating properties. Furthermore, the recently determined structures of HCN4, the main cardiac isoform of HCN channels, have demonstrated differences in the relative arrangement of these regulatory modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Saponaro et al., 2021</xref>), which may be exploited towards the development of subtype-specific drugs. Compound library screenings for small molecules with HCN1-isoform specificity have already yielded some initial and promising results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McClure et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harde et al., 2019</xref>). Other approaches include the design of cell-penetrant peptides, which interfere with the interaction between HCN channels and their regulatory auxiliary subunit, TRIP8b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Han et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Saponaro et al., 2018</xref>), as well as antisense oligonucleotide-based strategies aimed at HCN1 mRNA downregulation. Of note, the latter strategy may be particularly effective in light of the hypothesis that protein misfolding may be an important component of the pathology in <italic>HCN1</italic>-linked DEE, together with the observation that <italic>Hcn1</italic> null mice do not have spontaneous seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Santoro et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, the availability of strong preclinical models, such as the <italic>Hcn1<sup>GD/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Hcn1<sup>MI/+</sup></italic> mouse lines presented here, provides an ideal platform for further investigation of mechanisms underlying epileptic encephalopathies and testing new and paradigm-shifting therapeutic

Body temperature was maintained at 36.5¬∞C using a homeothermic heating pad (Stoelting, Germany). Mice were placed into a stereotaxic device (Kopf Instruments, CA), a midline skin incision was made above the skull, and the periosteum was denatured by a short treatment with 10% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, followed by rinsing with 0.9% NaCl solution, drying of the skull, and application of dental cement (OptiBond, Kerr Dental, Germany) to cover the skull surface. The transmitter body was implanted subcutaneously in a pouch made in the loose skin of the back. The two lead wires were tunneled subcutaneously through the incision on the skull. Using a dental drill, a small hole was drilled above the hippocampus (AP ‚Äì2.0, ML +2.0 in millimeters from Bregma, always on the right side) for the recording wire, and another hole was made above the cerebellum for the reference wire.

Runs were classified with the Catwalk XT 10 software (Noldus). Footprints were detected automatically by the software and manually corrected by visual inspection. The following parameters were used for analysis: running speed, stand (duration in seconds of contact of a paw with the glass plate), stride length (distance between successive placements of the same paw in centimeter), step cycle (the time in seconds between two consecutive paw placements), BOS (the average width between the front or hind paws), step sequence (contains information on the order in which four paws are placed), and regularity index (expresses the number of normal step sequence patterns relative to the total number of paw placements in percent).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-4"><title>Pole test</title><p>Mice were placed head upward on the top of a vertical wooden rod (60 cm long, 7 mm diameter) so that they grasp the rod with all four paws and had to climb down the pole in a headfirst position, as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Freitag et al., 2003</xref>). For motivation to climb down, nest material was placed at the bottom of the pole. The ability to turn the body 180¬∞ was evaluated, and the time needed to reach the floor with all four paws was assessed. A trial was considered successful if the mouse climbed down after a 180¬∞ body turn at levels 1 or 2 (i.e., the top and middle portion of the pole), and not successful if the turn occurred at the bottom level 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) or when the mice were sliding down or falling. To test motor learning, mice were scored three times with an intertrial interval of 30 s, during which they were placed in their home cage.

An entry into any arm was considered a transition. Alternation behavior was defined as consecutive entries into all three arms without repeated entries and was expressed as percentage of the total arm entries. As an example, if the three arms are labeled A, B, and C, and the mouse enters the arms in the following sequence ‚Äì ABCBACABCACBABCBACBC ‚Äì then the total alternation opportunities would be 18 (total entries minus 2); the actual behavioral alternations would be 12; and the percent alternation would be 66.7% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kitanaka et al., 2015</xref>).

Then, 1 hr later, during training, the mice were allowed to freely explore the box in the presence of two identical objects (blue cooling bottles) until they reached a total object interaction time of 20 s or for a maximum trial duration of 15 min. Mice that explored the objects for less than 20 s during the 15 min training were excluded. For testing, 24 hr later the mice were again placed in the box with two objects, but this time one object was replaced with a novel object (magic cube), whereas the location remained the same as during training. The determination of which object was replaced was randomized and balanced. Tracks were recorded and analyzed with the software EthoVision XT 16 (Noldus). Object interaction was quantified as the amount of time the mouse‚Äôs nose was within 2 cm around the object.

Healthy somas of CA1 pyramidal neurons were identified visually under √ó40 (20 √ó 2) magnification and patched under visual guidance using borosilicate glass pipettes (I.D. 0.75 mm, O.D. 1.5 mm, Sutter Instruments, UK) with a tip resistance of 4‚Äì5.5 MŒ©, connected to a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, CA) and filled with intracellular solution, containing (in mM): 135 K-gluconate, 5 KCl, 0.1 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 2 NaCl, 5 MgATP, 0.4 Na<sub>2</sub>GTP, 10 Na<sub>2</sub>-Phosphocreatin, adjusted to a pH of 7.2 with KOH. Recordings were only accepted if the series resistance after establishing a whole-cell configuration did not exceed 25 MŒ© and did not change by more than 20% of the initial value during the course of the experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-3"><title>Pharmacology</title><p>Stock solution of 10 mM ZD7288 (Tocris, UK) was stored at ‚Äì20¬∞C and diluted in ACSF to a concentration of 10 ¬µM before bath application to the slice. In some experiments, blockers of GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors, 2 ŒºM SR95531 and 2 ŒºM CGP55845 (Tocris, UK), respectively, were added to the bath solution. As application of the latter did not alter any of the reported measures and since synaptic transmission was not assessed in this case, data were pooled between experiments performed with and without blockers of inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-4"><title>Data acquisition and analysis</title><p>Electrophysiological recordings were digitized, using a Digidata 1322 A A/D interface (Molecular Devices), at a sampling rate of 20 kHz (low-pass filtered at 10 kHz) and recorded with the pClamp 10 software (Molecular Devices). The amplifier settings of the Multiclamp 700B were controlled through Multiclamp Commander (Molecular Devices).</p><p>After 50 ms baseline recording, 1 s current steps of ‚Äì350 to +350 pA were applied to the patched cells in increments of 25 pA, after which an additional 1 s of post-step membrane potential was recorded. The trigger time between these episodes was 3 s. Voltage deflections in response to current steps of ‚Äì50 to +50 pA were used to calculate the input resistance. Initial RMP was obtained immediately upon breaking into the cell. Voltage sag in response to negative current steps was calculated by dividing the steady-state voltage deflection during the late phase of the ‚Äì100 pA current step by the peak of the voltage deflection during the same step. AP threshold was determined as the membrane voltage at which the derivative of the voltage trace exceeded 40 mV/ms. AP width describes the width of the AP at 50% of its amplitude.</p><p>Data was analyzed using Axograph X software (Axograph Scientific, Australia), MATLAB (MathWorks), as well as Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp., WA) and Prism 8 (GraphPad, CA) and visualized in Acrobat Illustrator (Adobe, CA).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>HEK293 cell electrophysiology</title><sec id="s4-10-1"><title>Constructs</title><p>The cDNAs encoding full-length human HCN1 channel and mouse TRIP8b (splicing variant 1a-4) were cloned into the pcDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen) mammalian expression vector.

Green fluorescent cells were selected for patch-clamp experiments at room temperature (about 25¬∞C). Currents were recorded in whole-cell configuration either with a ePatch amplifier (Elements, Cesena, Italy) or with a Dagan3900A amplifier (Dagan Corporation, MN); data acquired with the Dagan3900A amplifier were digitized with an Axon Digidata 1550B (Molecular Devices) converter. All data were analyzed offline with Axon pClamp 10.7. Patch pipettes were fabricated from 1.5 mm O.D. and 0.86 mm I.D. borosilicate glass capillaries (Sutter, Novato, CA) with a P-97 Flaming/Brown Micropipette Puller (Sutter) and had resistances of 3‚Äì 6 M‚Ñ¶. For the recordings of HCN channels, the pipettes were filled with a solution containing 10 mM NaCl, 130 mM KCl, 1 mM egtazic acid (EGTA), 0.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM ATP (magnesium salt), and 5 mM HEPES‚ÄìKOH buffer (pH 7.2), while the extracellular bath solution contained 110 mM NaCl, 30 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 5 mM HEPES‚ÄìKOH buffer (pH 7.4). For the recordings of Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 channel, the pipettes were filled with a solution containing 5 mM NaCl, 140 mM CsCl, 4 mM ATP (magnesium salt), 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM EGTA, 10 mM HEPES‚ÄìCsOH buffer (pH 7.4) while the extracellular bath solution contained 135 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 mM D-glucose, 10 mM HEPES‚ÄìNaOH buffer (pH 7.4). To assess HCN channel activation curves, different voltage-clamp protocols were applied depending on the HCN subtype: for HCN1 and HCN1 coexpressed with TRIP8b, holding potential was ‚Äì20 mV (1 s), with steps from ‚Äì30 mV to ‚Äì120 mV (‚Äì10 mV increments, 3.5 s) and tail currents recorded at ‚Äì40 mV (3.5 s); for HCN2, holding potential was ‚Äì20 mV (1 s), with steps from ‚Äì40 mV to ‚Äì130 mV (‚Äì15 mV increments, 5 s) and tail currents recorded at ‚Äì40 mV (5 s). Patch-clamp currents were acquired with a sampling rate of 5 kHz and low-pass filtered at 2.5 kHz. Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 recordings were obtained from holding potentials of ‚Äì80 mV or ‚Äì130 mV, as indicated. Currents were elicited by stepping to ‚Äì30 mV for 50 ms followed by a step to the next holding potential (‚Äì60 or ‚Äì130 mV for 5 s) in a cycling manner. To measure the inactivation curves, a voltage step protocol was used starting from a holding potential of ‚Äì100 mV for 150 ms followed by a series of inactivating pulses (from ‚Äì30 to ‚Äì130 mV, for 500 ms); the fraction of channels that remain available after each inactivating pulse were assessed by the peak currents during the following short test pulse at 0 mV for 50 ms. LTG was applied to the (extracellular) bath solution of the experiments at 100 ¬µM concentration. For HCN channels, the effect was assessed after 20 min of application of LTG in the bath solution. The percentage of ZD7288 induced block (30 ¬µM concentration, bath applied) was assessed by measuring the current amplitude at the end of the hyperpolarizing pulse at ‚Äì110 mV, which includes both the instantaneous and the time-dependent component of the current. After reaching the full effect of ZD7288, a 5 mM CsCl-containing solution was added to the bath to verify current response to a second known HCN channel blocker. Mean activation curves were obtained by fitting maximal tail current amplitude, plotted against the voltage step applied, with the Boltzmann equation: y = 1/[1 + exp((V‚àíV<sub>1/2</sub>)/k)], where V is voltage, y the fractional activation, V<sub>1/2</sub> the half-activation voltage, and k the inverse-slope factor = ‚ÄìRT/zF (all in mV), using OriginPro software (OriginLab, Northampton, MA). Mean V<sub>1/2</sub> values were obtained by fitting individual curves from each cell to the Boltzmann equation and then averaging all the obtained values. All measurements were performed at room temperature.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Differential gene expression analysis</title><p>RNA was prepared from whole hippocampus (using material from both hemispheres per animal) from 6-month-old male mice (n = 4 per group; for WT samples, we used two WT littermates from the <italic>Hcn1<sup>GD</sup></italic> line and two WT littermates from the <italic>Hcn1<sup>MI</sup></italic> line) according to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions. Briefly, tissue from hippocampus (~40 mg) was submerged in RNAprotect Tissue Reagent (QIAGEN, Germany). Subsequent RNA isolation was performed with the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) and RNase-free DNase Set (QIAGEN). RNA concentration was determined by UV absorbance using an Epoch Microplate spectrophotometer (BioTek, USA). RNA integrity was assessed using an automated gel electrophoresis system (Agilent 4200 Tape Station System, Agilent Technologies, CA). RNA quality was evaluated by assessing RNA integrity number (samples‚Äô RIN range: 8.7‚Äì9.0) and optical density values at 260/280 nm (samples‚Äô ratio range: 1.96‚Äì2.12). cRNA synthesis, labeling, fragmentation, array hybridization, washing, and staining, as well as microarray scanning and signal processing were performed by the Gene Expression Affymetrix Facility (Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne). Briefly, 100 ng total RNA were used for reverse transcription and the resulting cDNA was fragmented and labeled via the GeneChip WT PLUS Reagent Kit as per the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions (Affymetrix, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The labeled cDNA samples were hybridized to Affymetrix Clariom S Mouse arrays (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# 902931) and incubated in GeneChip Hybridization Oven-645 (Affymetrix, Thermo Fisher Scientific) rotating at 60 rpm at 45¬∞C for 16 hr.

pathogenic role of two distinct sequence alterations in Hcn1 and extends from insights into ion channel physiology all the way to characterizing the animals' spontaneous seizure phenotype. The authors convincingly show that two clinically relevant sequence alterations in Hcn1 have distinct effects on HCN1 channel trafficking that vary with cellular context. They go on to correlate these changes in trafficking and cellular function to differences in seizure behavior and observe that these changes in Hcn1 lead to paradoxical responses to some antiseizure medications, consistent with clinical observations. Intriguingly, although the corresponding genetic changes produce a profound epileptic encephalopathy in human patients, mixed effects on cognition are seen in mice. A limitation of the study is that this difference is not investigated in more detail, but the authors have certainly made headway towards understanding the role of Hcn1 in certain genetic epilepsies.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70826.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Chetkovich</surname><given-names>Dane M</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05dq2gs74</institution-id><institution>Vanderbilt University Medical Center</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Nashville</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Chetkovich</surname><given-names>Dane M</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05dq2gs74</institution-id><institution>Vanderbilt University Medical Center</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Nashville</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Baram</surname><given-names>Tallie Z</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04gyf1771</institution-id><institution>University of California, Irvine</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.08.16.456452">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.16.456452v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Dane Michael Chetkovich as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Huguenard as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Tallie Z Baram (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please in discussion expound on the limitation to interpretation of data given the lack of physiological evaluation of PV neurons and direct evaluation of HCN channels in dendrites. Similarly please address the possibility that LTG experiments in vitro would not reveal direct effects on the channel in the context of neurons with their native binding partners.</p><p>2) Expound on the potential of other conductances that could have been impacted that may explain unexpected intrinsic excitability changes.</p><p>3) Please change instances of &quot;Mutant&quot; or &quot;mutation&quot; to &quot;pathological sequence variation&quot; in the context of humans, and revise other anthropomorphized terms referring to animal behavior as reflecting human psychiatric disease.</p><p>4) Address claims of differences with requested statistics.</p><p>5) Consider approach to consistently co-identify analogous mutations to avoid confusing readers with switches between mouse and human.</p><p>6) See reviewer 1 comments regarding figure 6. Figure 6 should be reproduced with PV costaining and uniform high-power magnifications with some attempt at quantitation.</p><p>7) Present functional tests of hippocampus or cortex dependent behaviors, regardless of the outcome. At a minimum, please modify the text to eliminate redundant panels in Figure 2. and downplay the cerebellar emphasis. (see Reviewer 3 comments 2a-c for potential discussion points.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>They study the impact of the mutations on the levels and distribution of the channel and identify abnormal targeting of the channels to among other findings, axon terminals of basket cell interneurons.</p><p>Seizures were found to be exacerbated by Na<sup>+</sup> channel blockers lamotrigine and phenytoin, consistent with clinical reports for patients with pathological HCN1 sequence variation, an important feature of good pre-clinical models.</p><p>Finally, the report identifies changes to HCN1 antagonist sensitivity in the variant channels.</p><p>The authors suggest this justifies screening mutated channels to identify novel compounds with diverse mechanisms of action.</p><p>Abstract</p><p>The abstract is clear and concise and communicates the major findings of the paper.</p><p>One suggested style consideration: &quot;In line with clinical reports from HCN1 patients&quot; Would change to &quot;patients with pathological HCN1 sequence variation.&quot; Would consider this in lieu of mutation throughout the article as many physicians and patient advocacy groups take issue with negative connotations of &quot;mutation&quot; and &quot;mutant&quot; in the context of animal work as applied to patients.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>The authors review of the background and problem is thorough; In Para 4, they address the conundrum that mice might not be able to recapitulate the epilepsy phenotype seen with certain variants. Here would be appropriate to mention that HCN1 KO mice also lack seizures. This suggests it is possible that most of the pathological HCN variants impart gain of function directly on the channel or impacts non-HCN targets (distinct from simple loss of channel function), as well as that gain of function might manifest in seizures distinctly in mouse and man.</p><p>Regarding the approach: the choice to generate mice in which phenotypes analogous human variations were replicated in multiple patients and the phenotype was severe was logical and a good example to others about increasing odds of success.</p><p>Results</p><p>General phenotypic features and gross brain anatomy</p><p>Although it looks true, it is not clear statistics were employed to assert death of males significantly more than females; &quot;there was a clear split in Hcn1M142I/+ animals with females more affected than males and most deaths occurring at an age older than three months (Figure 1C, right).&quot; What analysis was done to conclude this?</p><p>Page 6 line 1; would not use &quot;increased anxiety&quot; as it anthropomorphizes animal behavior. &quot;considered a potential anxiety-like behavior in mice&quot;</p><p>They find complex effect of the two variants on phenotype, with an overall more severe impact on the general fitness of Hcn1G380D/+ compared to Hcn1M142I/+ animals, reflected in smaller body size, reduced brain size, as well as altered gait and locomotion.</p><p>Hcn1G380D/+ and Hcn1M142I/+ mice show spontaneous convulsive seizures</p><p>The characterization of epilepsy in these mice is solid.

The authors base their proposed mechanism for the pro-epileptic effects of the mutation on the notion that HCN1 Channels are localized to axons only of PV interneurons. Whereas this fact may be true for the adult, during development, axonal targeting is not unique to basket-type interneurons. It is observed in the developing hippocampal circuit, in medial entorhinal cortex neurons innervating dentate gyrus granule cells, i.e., the perforant path. Have the authors looked at axonal targeting in this region in the mutant mice during appropriate developmental stages? Its absence might modulate the firing of GCs, specifically during development (Bender et al., J Neurosci 2007). At a minimum this point merits discussion.</p><p>c. The authors identify developmental epilepsies in the mutants. Therefore, they shouldn't disregard the distinct developmental profiles for HCN1 and the other HCN subunit (e.g.,Surges et al., 2006). First, HCN1 may not function in isolation, and seizures might trigger heteromer formation (e.g., Brewster et al., 2005). In addition, might expression of other subunits 'take over' some functions of HCN1 (even without overexpression). including HCN1, and these profiles might contribute to age-specific defects leading to seizures. This point merits discussion.</p><p>d. Whereas the focus of this paper is on the role of genetic mutations in HCN1 in epilepsy, the paper may be enriched by being placed in the context of the overall contributions of HCN1 channels to human epilepsy, including &quot;acquired epilepsy&quot;&quot; via potential epigenetic changes in the expression of normal HCN channels (Bender et al., 2003 and others). They might cite recent reviews of the role of HCN channels in epilepsy (e.g., Brennan et al., 2016).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70826.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please in discussion expound on the limitation to interpretation of data given the lack of physiological evaluation of PV neurons and direct evaluation of HCN channels in dendrites.

Importantly, the seizures of the HCN1 mutant mice are unlikely to arise from the cerebellum, and the encephalopathies elements of HCN1-related neonatal epileptic encephalopathies clearly derive from cortex and hippocampus.</p><p>Therefore, it should be excellent if the authors presented functional tests of hippocampus or cortex dependent behaviors, regardless of the outcome. At a minimum, they should modify the text, eliminate redundant panels in Figure 2. and downplay the cerebellar emphasis.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the Reviewer‚Äôs helpful recommendations, we have added new behavioral experiments testing short-term and long-term memory (see new Figure 3) and modified the panels in Fig 2. The manuscript text has been revised accordingly (pages 6 and 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. The authors base their proposed mechanism for the pro-epileptic effects of the mutation on the notion that HCN1 Channels are localized to axons only of PV interneurons. Whereas this fact may be true for the adult, during development, axonal targeting is not unique to basket-type interneurons. It is observed in the developing hippocampal circuit, in medial entorhinal cortex neurons innervating dentate gyrus granule cells, i.e., the perforant path. Have the authors looked at axonal targeting in this region in the mutant mice during appropriate developmental stages? Its absence might modulate the firing of GCs, specifically during development (Bender et al., J Neurosci 2007). At a minimum this point merits discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer correctly points out that HCN1 channels are present not only in the axons of PV+ interneurons but also in the axons of certain subclasses of excitatory neurons (see Huang et al., 2011, 2012, and 2019). Regarding axons from medial entorhinal cortex neurons innervating dentate gyrus granule cells, i.e., the perforant path, there is an interesting difference between mice and rats. While HCN1 channel subunits at this site are downregulated in adult rats, they persist in adult mice. This can be seen in the immunostainings shown in Figure 5A (formerly 4A) of the manuscript. Similar to hippocampal PV+ axons in CA3 (Figure 7A, formerly 6A), it can be noted that HCN1 expression in the perforant path is considerably decreased in Hcn1GD/+ mice compared to wildtype and Hcn1MI/+ mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. The authors identify developmental epilepsies in the mutants. Therefore, they shouldn't disregard the distinct developmental profiles for HCN1 and the other HCN subunit (e.g.,Surges et al., 2006). First, HCN1 may not function in isolation, and seizures might trigger heteromer formation (e.g., Brewster et al., 2005). In addition, might expression of other subunits 'take over' some functions of HCN1 (even without overexpression). including HCN1, and these profiles might contribute to age-specific defects leading to seizures. This point merits discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point and have added text underscoring the potential contribution of altered HCN1 channel function to brain development (page 19) to address this issue, and in accord with the comments raised by Reviewer #1 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d. Whereas the focus of this paper is on the role of genetic mutations in HCN1 in epilepsy, the paper may be enriched by being placed in the context of the overall contributions of HCN1 channels to human epilepsy, including &quot;acquired epilepsy&quot;&quot; via potential epigenetic changes in the expression of normal HCN channels (Bender et al., 2003 and others). They might cite recent reviews of the role of HCN channels in epilepsy (e.g., Brennan et al., 2016).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer and now refer to these datasets in the Introduction, citing the excellent review by Brennan et al., 2016 (page 4).</p></body></sub-article></article>
