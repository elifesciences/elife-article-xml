Disruption of epigenetic regulation not only increases the risk of cancer, but can also cause various developmental defects. However, the question of how epigenetic changes lead to tissue-specific responses during neural crest fate determination and differentiation remains understudied. Using palatogenesis as a model, we reveal the functional significance of <italic>Kdm6b</italic>, an H3K27me3 demethylase, in regulating mouse embryonic development. Our study shows that <italic>Kdm6b</italic> plays an essential role in cranial neural crest development, and loss of <italic>Kdm6b</italic> disturbs P53 pathway-mediated activity, leading to complete cleft palate along with cell proliferation and differentiation defects in mice. Furthermore, activity of H3K27me3 on the promoter of <italic>Trp53</italic> is antagonistically controlled by <italic>Kdm6b</italic>, and <italic>Ezh2</italic> in cranial neural crest cells. More importantly, without <italic>Kdm6b</italic>, the transcription factor TFDP1, which normally binds to the promoter of <italic>Trp53</italic>, cannot activate <italic>Trp53</italic> expression in palatal mesenchymal cells. Furthermore, the function of <italic>Kdm6b</italic> in activating <italic>Trp53</italic> in these cells cannot be compensated for by the closely related histone demethylase <italic>Kdm6a</italic>. Collectively, our results highlight the important role of the epigenetic regulator KDM6B and how it specifically interacts with TFDP1 to achieve its functional specificity in regulating <italic>Trp53</italic> expression, and further provide mechanistic insights into the epigenetic regulatory network during organogenesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>craniofacial development</kwd><kwd>epigenetic regulation</kwd><kwd>cleft palate</kwd><kwd>transcription regulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DE012711</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chai</surname><given-names>Yang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DE022503</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chai</surname><given-names>Yang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01 DE028729</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chai</surname><given-names>Yang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A comprehensive analysis of mutant animal model shows the important role of KDM6B and how it cooperates with TFDP1 to achieve its functional specificity in regulating <italic>Trp53</italic> expression to control the fate of cranial neural crest cells during palatogenesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Embryonic development is a highly complex self-assembly process during which precursor cells are coordinated to generate appropriate cell types and assemble them into well-defined structures, tissues, and organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shahbazi et al., 2016</xref>). During this process, precursor cells undergo extensive and rapid cell proliferation until they reach the point of exit from the cell cycle to differentiate into various cell lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ruijtenberg and van den Heuvel, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Miermont et al., 2019</xref>). How these precursor cells modulate expression of different genes and proceed through diverse proliferation and differentiation processes is a very complex and interesting question. Growing evidence shows that epigenetic regulation, which includes mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin accessibility, and higher-order organization of chromatin, provides the ability to modify gene expression and associated protein production in a cell type-specific manner, thus playing an essential role in achieving signaling specificity and regulating cell fate during embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hanna et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Among these various layers of epigenetic regulation, DNA methylation and histone methylation are the best characterized and known to be key regulators of diverse cellular events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bannister and Kouzarides, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Smith and Meissner, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Molina-Serrano et al., 2019</xref>). For example, methylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me) by methyltransferases is a feature of heterochromatin that renders it inaccessible to transcription factors, thus maintaining transcriptional repression, across many species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wiles and Selker, 2017</xref>). On the other hand, methylation of H3K4me3 found near the promoter region can couple with the NURF complex to increase chromatin accessibility for gene activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wysocka et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Soares et al., 2017</xref>). Demethylation, which results from removing a methyl group, also plays important roles during development. For instance, demethylation of H3K4 is required for maintaining pluripotency in embryonic stem cells, and demethylases KDM6A and KDM6B are required for proper gene expression in mature T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lessard and Crabtree, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jambhekar et al., 2019</xref>). These studies clearly show that failure to maintain epigenomic integrity can cause deleterious consequences for embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Henckel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Palatogenesis is a complex process known to be regulated by multiple genetic regulatory mechanisms, including several signaling pathways (BMP, SHH, WNT, FGF, and TGFβ) and different transcription factors (such as <italic>Msx1</italic>, <italic>Sox9</italic>, <italic>Lhx6/8</italic>, <italic>Dlx5</italic>, and <italic>Shox2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Satokata and Maas, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chai and Maxson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Levi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cobourne et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee and Saint-Jeannet, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nakamura et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bush and Jiang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">He and Chen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Parada and Chai, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Xu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Reynolds et al., 2019</xref>). However, environmental effects can also contribute to orofacial defects, which lends further support to the notion that genetic factors are not sufficient to fully explain the etiology of many birth defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dixon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Roessler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Seelan et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, case studies have revealed that heterozygous mutation of a chromatin-remodeling factor, <italic>SATB2</italic>, and variation in DNA methylation can cause cleft palate in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leoyklang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chandrasekharan and Ramanathan, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Young et al., 2021</xref>). These cases have drawn our attention to the function of epigenetic regulation in palatogenesis.</p><p>The contribution of cranial neural crest cells (CNCCs) is critical to palate mesenchyme formation. Recently, studies have begun to address the role of epigenetic regulation in neural crest cell fate determination during development. For instance, homozygous loss of <italic>Arid1a</italic>, a subunit of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, in neural crest cells results in lethality in mice, associated with severe defects in the heart and craniofacial bones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chandler and Magnuson, 2016</xref>). In addition, both lysine methyltransferase <italic>Kmt2a</italic> and demethylase <italic>Kdm6a</italic> are essential for cardiac and neural crest development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shpargel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sen et al., 2020</xref>). However, how these epigenetic changes lead to tissue-specific response during neural crest fate determination remain to be elucidated.</p><p>In this study, using palatogenesis as a model we investigated the functional significance of the demethylase <italic>Kdm6b</italic> in regulating the fate of CNCCs during palatogenesis. We have discovered that loss of <italic>Kdm6b</italic> in cranial neural crest (CNC)-derived cells results in complete cleft palate along with soft palate muscle defects. We also found cell proliferation and differentiation defects of CNC-derived cells in <italic>Kdm6b</italic> mutant mice. More importantly, our study shows that the level of H3K27me3 on the promoter of <italic>Trp53</italic> (also known as P53 in human) is antagonistically controlled by <italic>Kdm6b</italic> and <italic>Ezh2</italic>. Furthermore, without <italic>Kdm6b</italic>, the transcription factor TFDP1, which binds to the promoter of <italic>Trp53</italic>, cannot activate expression of <italic>Trp53</italic> in palatal mesenchymal cells. More importantly, the function of <italic>Kdm6b</italic> in activating <italic>Trp53</italic> in these cells cannot be compensated for by the closely related histone demethylase <italic>Kdm6a</italic>. Our study highlights the importance of epigenetic regulation on cell fate decision and its function in regulating activity of <italic>Trp53</italic> in CNC-derived cells during organogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Loss of <italic>Kdm6b</italic> in CNC-derived cells results in craniofacial malformations</title><p>Previous research has shown that the X-chromosome-linked H3K27 demethylase KDM6A is indispensable for neural crest cell differentiation and viability as it establishes appropriate chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schwarz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shpargel et al., 2017</xref>). However, we do not yet have a comprehensive understanding of the roles of two other members of the KDM6 family, <italic>Kdm6b</italic> and <italic>Uty</italic>, in regulating CNCCs during craniofacial development. More importantly, we have yet to understand how demethylase achieves its functional specificity in regulating downstream target genes. In order to elucidate the functions of <italic>Kdm6b</italic> and <italic>Uty</italic>, we first evaluated the expression patterns of KDM6 family members in the palatal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–F</xref>). We found that, of these, <italic>Kdm6b</italic> is more abundantly expressed than <italic>Kdm6a</italic> and <italic>Uty</italic> in both palate mesenchymal and epithelial cells, which indicated it might play a critical role in regulating palatogenesis.</p><p>To investigate the tissue-specific function of <italic>Kdm6b</italic> during craniofacial development, we generated <italic>Wnt1<sup>Cre</sup>;Kdm6b<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and <italic>Krt14<sup>Cre</sup>;Kdm6b<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice to specifically target the deletion of <italic>Kdm6b</italic> in CNC-derived and epithelial cells, respectively. Loss of <italic>Kdm6b</italic> in CNC-derived cells resulted in complete cleft palate in <italic>Wnt1<sup>Cre</sup>;Kdm6b<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice (90% phenotype penetrance, N = 10) and postnatal lethality at newborn stage (100% phenotype penetrance, N = 10) without interrupting expression of other KDM6 family members ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–N</xref>). To evaluate when <italic>Kdm6b</italic> was inactivated in the CNC-derived cells, we also investigated the expression of <italic>Kdm6b</italic> at E9.5, well prior to the formation of the palate primordium, and found that <italic>Kdm6b</italic> was efficiently inactivated in the CNC-derived cells at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1O and P</xref>). Interestingly, loss of <italic>Kdm6b</italic> in epithelial cells did not lead to obvious defects in the craniofacial region in <italic>Krt14<sup>Cre</sup>;Kdm6b<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–H</xref>). These results emphasized that <italic>Kdm6b</italic> is specifically required in CNC-derived cells during palatogenesis. CT images also confirmed the complete cleft palate phenotype and revealed that the most severe defects in the palatal region of <italic>Wnt1<sup>Cre</sup>;Kdm6b<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice were hypoplastic palatine processes of the maxilla and palatine bones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). Except for a minor flattened skull, other CNC-derived bones did not show significant differences between control and <italic>Wnt1<sup>Cre</sup>;Kdm6b<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2I–N</xref>). To evaluate the phenotype in more detail, we performed histological analysis and found that although the palatal shelves were able to elevate, the maxilla and palatine bones, as well as the palate stromal mesenchyme and soft palate muscles, failed to grow towards the midline in <italic>Wnt1<sup>Cre</sup>;Kdm6b<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–R</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A–P</xref>). Furthermore, in the posterior soft palate region, <italic>Wnt1<sup>Cre</sup>;Kdm6b<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice also showed morphological defects related to the orientation of muscle fibers and the pterygoid plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A–X</xref>). However, since the soft palate forms subsequent to the hard palate, it is difficult to identify whether the soft palatal muscle phenotype is a primary defect or a consequence resulting from an anterior cleft. Therefore, we focused on the anterior hard palate for further investigation. Collectively, these data indicate that mesenchymal <italic>Kdm6b</italic> is indispensable for craniofacial development and plays an essential role during palatogenesis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Loss of <italic>Kdm6b</italic> in cranial neural crest (CNC)-derived cells results in cleft palate.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Whole-mount oral view shows complete cleft palate phenotype in <italic>Wnt1<sup>Cre</sup>;Kdm6b<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice.

Previous research showed that MDM2, a ubiquitin ligase, specifically targets P53 for degradation and there is increased P53 activity in <italic>Mdm2</italic> mutant mice, which exhibit a range of developmental defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arya et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bowen and Attardi, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bowen et al., 2019</xref>).

We treated pregnant mice with Nutlin-3 at a dosage based on their body weight at E10.5, E12.5, and E14.5 of pregnancy and then collected samples at E16.5 for analysis. To assess the potential influence of the solvent used to dissolve Nutlin-3 (10% DMSO in corn oil), we also treated mice with 10% DMSO in corn oil at the same embryonic stages. None of the <italic>Kdm6b</italic> mutant mice were rescued after this treatment (N = 3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). In contrast, Nutlin-3 treatment successfully rescued the cleft palate in three out of five <italic>Wnt1<sup>Cre</sup>;Kdm6b<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–R</xref>).

Western blot analysis showed that the protein level of P53 was successfully restored in the Nutlin-3-treated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F and G</xref>). This result further revealed that downregulation of <italic>Trp53</italic> in <italic>Wnt1<sup>Cre</sup>;Kdm6b<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice plays an essential role in the palatal defects. The genetic interaction between <italic>Kdm6b</italic> and <italic>Trp53</italic> is important for the development of post-migratory CNCCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Level of H3K27me3 is antagonistically regulated by <italic>Kdm6b</italic> and <italic>Ezh2</italic> during palatogenesis</title><p>The lysine-specific demethylase KDM6B is able to activate gene expression via removing the H3K27me3 repressive mark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>). To investigate whether <italic>Kdm6b</italic> regulates the expression of <italic>Trp53</italic> through modifying the level of H3K27me3, we first examined the status of H3K27me3 in our samples and found that loss of <italic>Kdm6b</italic> in CNC-derived cells resulted in accumulation of H3K27me3 in the nucleus of CNC-derived palatal mesenchymal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D</xref>). Furthermore, immunoblotting revealed that the level of H3K27me3 was increased in the palatal region of <italic>Kdm6b</italic> mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Since the level of H3K27me3 can also be modified by the methyltransferases EZH1 and EZH2, we further evaluated whether expression of EZH1 and EZH2 was affected in the palatal region. We found no obvious differences in either the distribution of <italic>Ezh1+</italic> cells or the EZH1 protein level between control and <italic>Kdm6b</italic> mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–J</xref>). Similarly, no dramatic changes were observed in either the distribution of EZH2+ cells or its protein level between control and <italic>Kdm6b</italic> mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K–O</xref>). These results indicated that increased H3K27me3 in <italic>Wnt1<sup>Cre</sup>;Kdm6b<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice was mainly caused by loss of <italic>Kdm6b</italic> in CNC-derived cells. However, we did notice a broader contribution and stronger signal of EZH2 than EZH1 in the CNC-derived palatal mesenchyme. To investigate whether an increase of H3K27me3 in the CNC-derived cells caused the cleft phenotype we observed in <italic>Wnt1<sup>Cre</sup>;Kdm6b<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice, we generated <italic>Wnt1<sup>Cre</sup>;Kdm6b<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Ezh2<sup>fl/+</sup></italic> mice and assessed the level of H3K27me3 in this model.

To target a specific sequence in genome, a histone demethylase needs to interact with DNA binding proteins such as transcription factors or IncRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dimitrova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gurrion et al., 2017</xref>). To identify a transcription factor that can interact with KDM6B, we performed ATAC-seq analysis of palate tissue at E13.5. Through motif analysis, we found that the promoter region of <italic>Trp53</italic> was accessible to members of the E2F transcription factor family (E2F4 and E2F6) and transcription factor TFDP1 (also known as Dp1), a binding partner of E2F family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8L</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We noticed that this open region was also located at the Transcription start site (TSS) of <italic>Wrap53</italic>, which was previously reported to regulate endogenous <italic>Trp53</italic> mRNA levels and P53 protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mahmoudi et al., 2009</xref>). To evaluate whether the decrease of <italic>Trp53</italic> was caused by altered expression of <italic>Wrap53</italic> in our model, we examined the expression of <italic>Wrap53</italic> in the palatal region at E13.5. Almost no expression of <italic>Wrap53</italic> was detected in the palatal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). Previous research reported that inactivation of E2Fs resulted in milder phenotypes than those associated with loss of <italic>Tfdp1</italic>, which leads to early embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kohn et al., 2003</xref>). This result suggested that TFDP1 may play a more critical role than E2Fs during embryonic development. A motif of TFDP1 was detected 1011 bp upstream of <italic>Trp53</italic> exon 1, which is very close to the H3K27me3 deposition site, by ATAC-seq analysis. ChIP-qPCR using palate tissue at E13.5 also revealed that binding of TFDP1 to the promoter region of <italic>Trp53</italic> decreased in the <italic>Kdm6b</italic> mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8M</xref>). Immunohistochemistry analysis showed that TFDP1+ cells were distributed in the palatal region and co-expressed with <italic>Trp53</italic> and <italic>Kdm6b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8N and O</xref>). We also confirmed co-expression of <italic>Kdm6b</italic> and <italic>Tfdp1</italic> in the palatal region (especially enriched in <italic>Pax9</italic>+, <italic>Aldh1a2</italic>+, and <italic>Twist1</italic>+ cells) using our previously published scRNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Han et al., 2021</xref>).

These data indicated that <italic>Tfdp1</italic> is not a downstream target of <italic>Kdm6b</italic>. To further test whether <italic>Tfdp1</italic> regulated expression of <italic>Trp53</italic> in the palatal mesenchymal cells, we transfected palatal mesenchymal cells from control mice at E13.5 using siRNA to knock down <italic>Tfdp1</italic>. qPCR revealed that the expression of <italic>Trp53</italic> was decreased in cells treated with siRNA for <italic>Tfdp1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8Q</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1I</xref>). This data further indicated that <italic>Trp53</italic> is a direct downstream target of <italic>Tfdp1</italic>.</p><p>To reveal the function of <italic>Kdm6b-Tfdp1</italic> interaction in the regulation of <italic>Trp53</italic> during palatogenesis, we transfected palatal mesenchymal cells with <italic>Tfdp1</italic>-overexpressing plasmid and found that the expression of <italic>Trp53</italic> increased in the cells from control mice but not in the cells from <italic>Wnt1<sup>Cre</sup>;Kdm6b<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8R and S</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1J and K</xref>).

Transcription factors, which are among the key regulators of this process, are intimately involved in cell fate commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nelms and Labosky, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Soldatov et al., 2019</xref>). However, a transcription factor by itself cannot act on densely packed DNA in chromatin form. Thus, transcription factors must work in coordination with epigenetic regulatory mechanisms such as histone modifications, DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, and others to dynamically regulate chromatin states for gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wilson and Filipp, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gökbuget and Blelloch, 2019</xref>). Insults to the epigenetic landscape due to genetic, environmental, or metabolic factors can lead to diverse developmental defects and diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hobbs et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zoghbi and Beaudet, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Flavahan et al., 2017</xref>). Cleft palate comprises 30% of orofacial clefts and can result from genetic mutations, environmental effects, or a combination thereof (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Seelan et al., 2012</xref>). Much progress has been made in taking inventory of the gene mutations associated with craniofacial defects in recent years, and growing evidence has shown that epigenetic regulation plays an important role during neural crest development. For example, haploinsufficiency of <italic>KDM6A</italic> in humans causes severe psychomotor developmental delay, global growth restriction, seizures and cleft palate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lindgren et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, studies have shown that <italic>Kdm6a</italic> and <italic>Arid1a</italic> are both indispensable during neural crest development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chandler and Magnuson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shpargel et al., 2017</xref>). DNA methyltransferase3A (DNMT3A) plays a critical role in mediating the transition from neural tube to neural crest fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu et al., 2012</xref>). Meanwhile, loss of <italic>Ezh2</italic>, a component of PRC2, in CNC-derived cells completely prevents craniofacial bone and cartilage formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schwarz et al., 2014</xref>). These studies have clearly shown that epigenetic regulation is crucial for neural crest development. In this study, we further demonstrate the important role of epigenetic regulation during the neural crest contribution to palate development using <italic>Wnt1<sup>Cre</sup>;Kdm6b<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice as a model. We show that the demethylase KDM6B is not only required for normal CNC-derived palatal mesenchymal cell proliferation, but also for maintaining cell differentiation.</p><p>Epigenetic regulators, transcription factors, and lineage-specific genes work together to achieve spatiotemporally restricted, tissue-specific gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hu et al., 2014</xref>). In this study, we reveal that <italic>Kdm6b</italic> works with the transcription factor <italic>Tfdp1</italic> to specifically regulate the expression of <italic>Trp53</italic> during palatogenesis. The molecular mechanisms underlying the function of <italic>Trp53</italic> in genomic stability and tumor suppression have been studied extensively. However, the role of <italic>Trp53</italic> in regulating the development of CNC-derived cells still remains largely unclear, although several studies have been conducted recently on certain aspects of this topic. For instance, it has been shown that <italic>Trp53</italic> is able to coordinate CNC cell growth and epithelial-mesenchymal transition/delamination processes by modulating cell cycle genes and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rinon et al., 2011</xref>). It has also been established that both deletion and overexpression of <italic>Trp53</italic> result in craniofacial defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tateossian et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bowen et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, nuclear stabilization of P53 protein in <italic>Tcof<sup>+/-</sup></italic> induces neural crest cell progenitors to undergo cell cycle arrest and caspase3-mediated apoptosis in the neuroepithelium. Inhibition of P53 function successfully rescues the neurocristopathy in an animal model of Treacher Collins syndrome, which results from mutation in <italic>Tcof1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jones et al., 2008</xref>). These studies have clearly shown that appropriate function of <italic>Trp53</italic> is indispensable in CNCCs. However, none of these studies have addressed upstream regulation of <italic>Trp53</italic> in CNCCs.</p><p>Here, we show that proper function of <italic>Trp53</italic> during the differentiation and proliferation of CNCCs is orchestrated by <italic>Kdm6b</italic> and <italic>Ezh2</italic> through H3K27me3. Altering the balance between <italic>Ezh2</italic> and <italic>Kdm6b</italic> can cause abnormal H3K27me3 function, which further affects the downstream transcription factor <italic>Trp53</italic>. In addition, we have detected spontaneous DNA damage in the developing palate and increased accumulation of DNA damage in the <italic>Wnt1<sup>Cre</sup>;Kdm6b<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice. These findings further demonstrate the critical function of <italic>Trp53</italic> in protecting embryonic cells from DNA damage during development. Furthermore, the ability of cells to proliferate is limited by the length of the telomeres, which gradually shorten during each cell replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blagoev, 2009</xref>). Once the telomeres are too short for DNA replication, the result is cellular senescence, which induces an irreversible inability to proliferate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernadotte et al., 2016</xref>). In this study, we show that downregulated expression of <italic>Trp53</italic> in <italic>Wnt1<sup>Cre</sup>;Kdm6b<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice results in hyperproliferation and increased DNA damage in the proliferative cells, which might further lead to increased cell senescence. Previous studies reported that few <italic>Trp53<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice exhibit cleft palate or other craniofacial abnormalities, which suggests that loss of <italic>Trp53</italic> alone is not powerful enough to cause defects during craniofacial development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rinon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tateossian et al., 2015</xref>) and that there might be other factors that can compensate for the loss of function of <italic>Trp53</italic>. In our study, <italic>Wnt1<sup>Cre</sup>;Kdm6b<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice showed a cleft palate phenotype with high penetrance, and using MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin-3 we successfully rescued cleft palate in <italic>Kdm6b</italic> mutant mice. Our results suggested that in the <italic>Kdm6b</italic> mutant mice the decrease of <italic>Trp53</italic> cannot be compensated for by other factors, and disturbed P53 signaling is the key factor causing cleft palate in <italic>Kdm6b</italic> mutant mice.</p><p>Previous research has shown that KDM3A functions as a cofactor of STAT3 to activate the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kim et al., 2018</xref>) and that KDM2A coordinates with c-Fos in regulating COX<italic>-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lu et al., 2015</xref>). Our study shows that KDM6B coordinates with the transcription factor TFDP1 to activate expression of <italic>Trp53</italic> in CNCCs, and that <italic>Ezh2</italic> and <italic>Kdm6b</italic> co-regulate H3K27 methylation status, which may affect the ability of TFDP1 to bind to the chromatin during palatogenesis. It has been reported that <italic>Tfdp1</italic> is crucial for embryonic development and regulating Wnt/β-catenin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kohn et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). Interaction between KDM6B and TFDP1 discovered in this study further increases our knowledge of the coordination between epigenetic regulators and transcription factors during organogenesis. As environmental insults can adversely affect the function of epigenetic regulators, our findings provide a better understanding of the epigenetic regulation and transcription factors involved in regulating the fate of CNC cells and craniofacial development, which can provide important clues about human development, as well as potential therapeutic approaches for craniofacial birth

Previous studies have shown that mice homozygous for germline loss of Kdm6b function die perinatally, but whether Kdm6b plays an important role in palate development has not been documented. In this manuscript, the showed that the palatal mesenchyme of the Wnt1-Cre;Kmd6bfl/fl embryos had a defect in osteogenic differentiation by analysis of Runx2 and Sp7 expression and by using an in vitro osteogenic differentiation assay. The defect in palatogenesis in the Wnt1-Cre;Kmd6bfl/fl embryos correlated with increased levels of H3K27me3 in the palatal mesenchyme cells. By genetically reducing the dosage of Ezh2, which is a major H3K27 methyltransferase, they show that Ezh2 heterozygosity reduced the H3K27me3 in the palatal mesenchyme and partly rescued cleft palate in the Wnt1-Cre;Kmd6bfl/fl;Ezh2+/- embryos, indicating that antagonistic actions of Ezh2 and Kdm6b in H3K27 methylation are important in regulating palatogenesis. They performed RNA-seq analysis and found that the Wnt1-Cre;Kmd6bfl/fl embryos exhibited significant down-regulation of expression of 382 genes and significant upregulation of 259 genes in the developing palatal shelves at E12.5. Ingenuity pathway analysis of the RNA-seq data showed that the &quot;Role of BRCA1 in DNA Damage&quot; pathway was most significantly upregulated, whereas Gene Ontology analysis showed that the &quot;p53 pathway&quot; was among the top 10 pathways affected. They validated that the Wnt1-Cre;Kmd6bfl/fl embryos had increased DNA damage (marked by H2AX foci) in proliferating cells in the palatal mesenchyme and reduced expression of p53 mRNAs. Remarkably, treating the Wnt1-Cre;Kmd6bfl/fl embryos in utero through maternal IP injection of Nutlin-3, a small molecule inhibitor of MDM2-p53 interactions that causes stabilization of p53 protein, was able to rescue the cleft palate defect, indicating that repression of p53 expression in the Wnt1-Cre;Kmd6bfl/fl embryos plays an important role in the cleft palate pathogenesis. The manuscript further shows that the Wnt1-Cre;Kmd6bfl/fl embryonic palate had increased H3K27me3 at the p53 gene promoter region by ChIP-qPCR analysis. They performed ATAC-seq analysis of E13.5 wildtype embryonic palate and found that an ATAC-seq peak in the p53 gene promoter region contained E2F transcription factor binding motif. They show that Tfdp1, a member of the E2F family, was expressed in the embryonic palate and its expression was unaltered in the Wnt1-Cre;Kmd6bfl/fl embryonic palate. The performed ChIP-qPCR, of which the result suggested decreased Tfdp1 occupancy at the p53 gene promoter in the Wnt1-Cre;Kmd6bfl/fl embryonic palate than in control samples. They show that siRNA knockdown of Tfdp1 in primary palatal mesenchyme cells resulted in decrease in p53 mRNA expression and that overexpression of exogenous Tfdp1 caused increased p53 mRNA expression in control but not the Wnt1-Cre;Kmd6bfl/fl embryonic palate cells. In addition, they performed co-immunoprecipitation analysis and found that Tfdp1 and Kdm6b proteins were pulled down together from embryonic palatal extracts. They concluded that these results collectively suggested that Kdm6b and Tfdp1 work together to activate p53 expression in the palatal mesenchyme and play an important role in regulating palatogenesis.</p><p>In addition, this study generated RNA-seq data from E12.5 control and the Wnt1-Cre;Kmd6bfl/fl mutant embryonic palatal shelves, as well as ATAC-seq data from E13.5 wildtype mouse embryonic palatal tissues, which will serve as useful resources for palate development research. However, as written, the results do not directly address the stated major aim for investigating &quot;how epigenetic regulators coordinate with tissue-specific regulatory factors during morphogenesis of specific organs&quot;.</p><p>The title, &quot; Kdm6b confers Tfdp1 with the competence to activate p53 signaling in regulating palatogenesis&quot;, is not an accurate summary of the findings presented. First, the manuscript reports that Kdm6b mutant mice exhibit 90% penetrance of cleft palate, but among thousands of p53-null mice that have been studied in the last two decades few p53-null mice have been shown to have a cleft palate (of many primary research papers on studies of p53-null mice, only Tateossian et al. 2015 reported cleft palate in 2 out of 10 p53 homozygous mutant mice in one particular genetic background). Thus, the decreased expression of p53 in the palatal mesenchyme alone could not account for the cause of the disruptions in palate development in the Kdm6b mutant mice even though Nutlin-3 treatment, presumably through stabilization of the p53 protein, was able to partly rescue palate morphogenesis in the Kdm6b mutant embryos. Second, no data has been shown to indicate that Tfdp1 mediated activation of p53 is required for palate development. Third, the data presented indicate that Kdm6b function in the neural crest cells resulted in reduction in the H3K27me3 repression mark in the palatal mesenchyme cells, including in the p53 gene promoter region near where Tfdp1 binds, but there is no evidence that Kdm6b function is specific for Tfdp1 binding nor whether Kdm6-mediated demethylation of H3K27me3 at the p53 gene region is mediated by interaction with Tfdp1. Tfdp1 could be one of many transcription factors that could only bind to their target sites after heterochromatin-like repressive marks are removed.</p><p>Many conclusions and/or interpretation of the results, particularly the statements in the Abstract, in the manuscript were inaccurate.</p><p>1. The third and fourth sentences (Lines 36 – 37) in the Abstract appear to suggest that the major aim of the study was to use palatogenesis as a model to answer the question &quot;how epigenetic regulators coordinate with tissue-specific regulatory factors during morphogenesis of specific organs&quot;, but the study does not address this aim at all. No &quot;coordination&quot; between Kdm6b mediated epigenetic regulation with any &quot;tissue-specific&quot; regulatory factor is demonstrated. The data show that lack of Kdm6b-mediated H3K27me3 demethylation in the neural crest cells resulted in repression of many genes, including p53, in the developing palatal mesenchyme and that Tfdp1 binding and activation of the p53 gene promoter may require prior Kdm6b-mediated removal of the H3K27me3 repressive mark.</p><p>2. Most of the conclusions/statements written in the Abstract were not accurate or not sufficiently supported by the data:</p><p>2a. Lines 41 – 42 (and similar sentences in Lines 99 – 100, Line 310, ) state, &quot;activity of H3K27me3 on the promoter of p53 is precisely controlled by Kdm6b, and Ezh2 in regulating p53 expression in cranial neural crest cells&quot;. The data presented indicate opposing effects of Kdm6b and Ezh2 on the total amount of H3K27me3 in the palatal tissues and on the levels of p53 mRNA, but does not address how &quot;precisely&quot; they control of H3K27me3 levels at any particular locus.</p><p>2b. Lines 42 – 44 state, &quot;Kdm6b renders chromatin accessible to the transcription factor Tfdp1, which binds to the promoter of p53 along with Kdm6b to specifically activate p53 expression during palatogenesis&quot;. There is no data presented to support for the second half of the sentence (and similar statements in Lines 101 and 426). There is no data showing binding of Tfdp1 and Kdm6b together at the p53 gene promoter. There is no data showing that binding of Tfdp1 at the p53 promoter is required for the p53 gene expression in the palatal mesenchyme. There is no data showing Kdm6b activates p53 expression through direct interaction with Tfdp1. There is no data showing that Tfdp1 mediated activation of p53 specifically occurs in the palatal tissues but not in other tissues when there is cellular stress.</p><p>2c. Lines 44 – 46, &quot;our results highlight the important role of the epigenetic regulator Kdm6b and how it cooperates with Tfdp1 to achieve its functional specificity in regulating p53 expression,…&quot; (and similar sentence in Lines 494 – 495). While the data showed that overexpression of Tfdp1 resulted in increased p53 mRNA expression in cultured palatal mesenchyme cells from control but not Kdm6b mutant embryos and the decrease in p53 mRNAs in the Kdm6b mutant palatal mesenchyme correlated with reduced Tfdp1 binding at the p53 gene promoter, the study has not provided evidence for direct cooperation between Kdm6b and Tfdp1 at the p53 gene promoter. It is quite possible that another unidentified factor interacts with Kdm6b to target Kdm6b to the p53 gene region among many other chromatin regions to remove the H3K27me3 repression mark in the developing palatal mesenchyme and Tfdp1 is only able to bind to the p53 gene promoter after the K3K27me3 demethylation. The results, particularly the demonstration of Ntlin-3 mediated rescue of palatal morphogenesis in the Kdm6b mutants, may have broad implications beyond Kdm6b mutant mouse model such that pharmacologically induced stabilization of p53 may be applicable for therapeutic intervention in cases where genetic-environment interactions disrupt developmental or other cellular processes while also inhibiting stress-induced activation of p53.</p><p>3. Lines 133 – 135 state, &quot; although the palatal shelves were able to elevate, the maxilla and palatine bones, as well as the palate stromal mesenchyme and soft palate muscles, failed to grow towards the midline in Wnt1-Cre;Kdm6bfl/fl mice&quot;. However, the histology data in Figure 2—figure supplement 4, panels C/D/G/H, clearly show a failure or delay in palatal shelf elevation at E14.0 and E14.5 in the mutant embryos. The manuscript needs to accurately describe the results and investigate whether delay in palatal shelf elevation was the likely cause of cleft palate in the mutant.</p><p>4. Some numbers used to describe the results were inaccurate. For examples, Lines 119 – 120, &quot;Loss of Kdm6b in CNC-derived cells resulted in complete cleft palate in Wnt1-Cre;Kmd6bfl/fl mice (90% phenotype penetrance, N=7).&quot;</p><p>5. Given that the manuscript is focused on the effect of Kdm6b on the regulation of p53 in palatogenesis, the authors should discuss why few p53-/- mice had cleft palate, but Nutlin3 treatment was able to rescue the cleft palate defect in Kdm6b mutant mice at high efficiency. The manuscript indicated N=5 for the Nutlin-3 rescue experiment but did not indicate whether all 5 mutants were rescued. In addition, whereas the p53 mRNAs were reduced by about 50% in the Kdm6b mutant palate, the western blot in Figure 4—figure supplement 5F appears to show that Nutlin-3 treatment resulted in similar or more p53 protein in the mutant sample than the control. It would be helpful to quantify the relative levels of p53 protein in the Nutlin-3 treated mutant and control samples, and to discuss, if that is the result, how Nutlin-3 could induce p53 protein more efficiently in the mutant than in the control samples.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have just a few comments that would not change the interpretation of the data nor would I request additional experiments.</p><p>1. Figure 2 - Figure Supplement 4, (A-B). Wnt1-Cre;Kdm6bfl/fl mice are compared to Wnt1-Cre;Kdm6bfl/+ , but why aren't they compared to a wild type control instead?</p><p>2. Figure 2 - Figure Supplement 4, (E-H). The TUNEL stain data should probably be quantified by using TUNEL+ cell numbers collected across several different sections/samples. The difference between the control and the mutant, as seen in the 4 images provided, is large if expressed as a percentage but still limited to 3 cells or fewer (especially at day E13.5). Even at E14.5, while there are 3 TUNEL+ cells seen in the palatal shelves of the mutant and 0 in the control, multiple TUNEL signals can be seen just outside of the dotted region in the control but not in the mutant; either the control has more cell death right next to the palatal shelves, or the small difference between the two can be explained as a sampling error without more data points.</p><p>3.

Paper shows that inhibition of p53 by siRNA results in increased CNCC proliferation and DNA damage and reduces markers of osteogenesis, as seen in the siRNA treated cells. But is it possible to treat an embryo with a p53 inhibitor to directly demonstrate that loss of p53 in this model produces cleft palate? For example, Jones et al. treated pregnant mice with pifithrin-α to inhibit p53 (Nat. Med. 2011).</p><p>8. The paper describes how the control cells were treated with Tfdp1 siRNA, which resulted in lower levels of p53. Why wasn't the same treatment applied to the Wnt1-Cre;Kdm6bfl/fl cells, especially if both the controls and the mutants were later treated with the Tfdp1 overexpression plasmid?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In the present study, Tingwei Guo et al. use the mouse secondary palate as a model to assess the function of Kdm6b, a H3K27me3 demethylase, in the regulation of embryonic development. Guo's study shows that Kdm6b plays an essential role in neural crest development, and that loss of Kdm6b perturbs p53 pathway-mediated activity, leading to complete clefting of the secondary palate along with cell proliferation and differentiation defects.</p><p>In addition, the study reveals that Kdm6b and Ezh2 control p53 expression in cranial neural crest cells and that Kdm6b renders chromatin accessible to the transcription factor TFDP1 to activate p53 expression during palatogenesis. Together, the findings presented in this manuscript highlight the important role of the epigenetic regulator KDM6B and how it cooperates with TFDP1 to achieve its functional specificity in controlling p53 expression, and further provide mechanistic insights into the epigenetic regulatory network during secondary palate organogenesis.</p><p>– Over the last years, it has been reported by multiple groups that among the various layers of epigenetic regulation, DNA methylation and histone methylation are key drivers of diverse cellular events and developmental processes. In addition, it has been demonstrated that demethylation also plays important roles during development. For instance, demethylation of H3K4 is required for maintaining pluripotency in embryonic stem cells, and the demethylases KDM6A and KDM6B are required for proper gene expression. Indeed, the concept that failure to maintain epigenomic integrity can cause deleterious consequences for embryonic development has been extensively explored by various groups and is not novel per se. In addition, both lysine methyltransferase Kmt2a and demethylase Kdm6a have been recently shown to be essential for cardiac and neural crest development. For example, Shpargel reported that mice carrying neural crest deletion of Kdm6a exhibit craniofacial defects, including cleft or arched palate, cardiac abnormalities, and postnatal growth retardation, modeling the clinical features of Kabuki syndrome (Shpargel et al. PNAS, 2017). In summary, roles of these demethylases in neural crest development are already known. However, how these epigenetic changes lead to tissue-specific responses during neural crest fate determination and differentiation remains poorly understood and understudied, making the current manuscript of interest and timely.</p><p>– Epigenetic regulation plays extensive roles in development and diseases and its disruption not only can cause multiple developmental defects, but also increases the risk of neoplastic transformation. However, our knowledge of how epigenetic regulators coordinate with tissue-specific regulatory factors to control tissue and organ morphogenesis is still rudimentary. Therefore, the present paper will be of interest to the craniofacial biology community and to the broader developmental biology community, as well as to all those devoted to the study of the epigenetic and transcriptional regulation of morphogenesis and organogenesis.</p><p>– The study is robust, detailed, and comprises a wealth of original results and data of high quality, illustrated through many elegant figures. There are only some points of concern that need to be addressed, mainly related to additional quantitative analyses that are required for some of the experiments discussed in the manuscript and the need for clarifications regarding the regulation of the p53 pathway.</p><p>– Nomenclature: protein names should be written in uppercase throughout the text and in the figures. In the current manuscript use of the nomenclature is not consistent. Often protein and gene names are not listed correctly. See: http://www.informatics.jax.org/mgihome/nomen/gene.shtml#ps</p><p>– Figure 1: In Wnt1-Cre;Kdm6bfl/fl embryos the tongue appears to be grossly dysmorphic and abnormally positioned (e.g. see panel Q). If this is only due to a technical artifact of the section, then a better image should be chosen for Figure 1Q. If the tongue is instead abnormally formed and enlarged, then this result should be discussed and well documented, given that withdrawal of the tongue from between the vertical palatal shelves is required for their seamless fusion and closure during embryonic development.</p><p>– Figure 2 – Figure Suppl 4E-H: The Authors state that there is increased cell death in the palatal mesenchyme of Wnt1-Cre;Kdm6bfl/fl mice compared to controls, based on TUNEL staining, as shown in the figure. It is difficult to be convinced of this result, given that the TUNEL-positive cells are extremely sparse in both the control and mutant shown in these panels. If the Authors are convinced of their finding based on multiple experiments, they should show sections that better illustrate the defect, as well as quantify the numbers of TUNEL-positive cells over multiple sections for both control and mutant samples. In addition, they should include a graph comprising the total numbers of cells that were counted, the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells in both control and mutant, the fold increase of TUNEL-positive cells in the mutant, and the statistical significance. Unless these quantitative experiments are included, the Authors should definitely delete &quot;increased cell death&quot; for the mutant from the summary model shown in Figure 8.</p><p>However, if the Authors were to prove the presence of an increase of cell death in the palatal mesenchyme of Wnt1-Cre;Kdm6bfl/fl mice by conducting additional experiments, this finding would somehow contradict the result – which is very convincing – that p53 expression is decreased in mutant tissue (shown currently in Figure 7). Interestingly, in the discussion the authors mention (line 517): &quot;In this study we notice that downregulated expression of p53 in Wnt1-Cre;Kdm6bfl/fl mice results in hyperproliferation and increased DNA damage in the proliferative cells, which might further lead to cell senescence.&quot; Assessing cell senescence, instead of cell death, in the mutant compared to the control could be revealing.</p><p>– Figure 2I-L: The Authors state: &quot;There was a decrease in the number of Runx2+ cells in the palatal mesenchyme at both E13.5 and E14.5 in Wnt1-184 Cre;Kdm6bfl/fl mice in comparison to the control&quot; (Line 182-184). Either the Authors quantify the &quot;number of cells&quot; (see also comment above), or they could do a qRT-PCR to evaluate Runx2 mRNA in mutant versus control tissues.</p><p>– Figure 3B: It would be beneficial to separate the genes that are upregulated from the genes that are downregulated in Wnt1-Cre;Kdm6bfl/fl mice versus controls. The overall message would be much clearer.</p><p>– Figure 6: The rescue experiments are one of the main strengths of this study: beautiful and rigorous use of genetics to validate the pathways under analysis! However, it would add a great deal of strength to the rescue experiments to also evaluate the rescue at the cellular level (i.e. assess the rescue of proliferation and/or DNA damage, even if partial, or alternatively, examine whether expression of Sp7 or Runx2 is rescued by qRT-PCR).</p><p>– Figure 7, panel I and Figure 7 – Figure Suppl 6: Red box that is described as highlighting the p53 promoter is placed instead over the promoter of a different gene, Wrap53. Indeed, this red box contains the TSS of Wrap53 and not p53. The Wrap53 gene encodes an essential component of the telomerase holoenzyme complex, a ribonucleoprotein complex required for telomere synthesis. The encoded protein interacts with other components of active telomerase and with small Cajal body RNAs (scaRNAs), which are involved in modifying splicing RNAs. It was reported that Wrap53 also functions as a p53 antisense transcript, which regulates endogenous p53 mRNA levels and the levels of P53 protein by targeting the 5' untranslated region of p53 mRNA (Mahmoudi et al. Mol Cell 2009). Therefore, Wrap53 can indirectly alter p53 levels of expression and regulation. siRNA knockdown of Wrap53 results in significant decrease in p53 mRNA and suppression of P53 induction upon DNA damage. Conversely, overexpression of Wrap53 increases p53 mRNA and protein levels (Mahmoudi et al. Molecular Cell 2009; Farnebo et al., Cell Cycle 2009; Saldana-Meyer et al., Genes and Development 2013). These studies unequivocally demonstrated that Wrap53 regulates p53. As it turns out, the primers used for the ChIP-qPCR experiment shown in Figure 7 were now blasted and they correspond to the Wrap53 promoter and not to the p53 promoter. Given all the knowledge discussed above, the current statement: &quot;factor Tfdp1 binds to the promoter of p53 along with Kdm6b to specifically activate the expression of this tumor suppressor gene&quot; should be re-evaluated and clarified. This point should be better investigated. As the distance between the Wrap53 and p53 genes is only approximately 1kb, in additional experiments the Authors should use primers specific to the p53 promoter and to the Wrap53 promoter together with chromatin sonicated to an average size of 300-600 bp, which should provide a clear answer as to whether TFDP1 binds directly to the p53 promoter, or to the Wrap53 promoter, or to both. If TFDP1 does not bind directly to p53 but to the Wrap53 promoter instead, regulation of p53 transcription would then be indirect, via Wrap53. This finding would still be of interest. This reviewer believes that this point is important and should be adequately clarified and examined in further depth.</p><p>– Figure 7 – Figure Suppl 6: The Authors also analyze expression patterns of Kdm6b and its co-expression with Tfdp1 by scRNAseq. The scRNAseq data sets have already been described by the same Authors in a(nother) interesting paper that was recently published. There appears to be a striking enrichment of both Kdm6b and Tfdp1 genes in a particular cell subpopulation emerging from the scRNAseq datasets. It would be very interesting to know which cell type comprises this particular cluster? Also, the individual Panels in B should be enlarged to better visualize each cell clusters. It would also be very helpful to the reader to list the specific cell types that comprise each cluster in the Panels in B.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74595.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agree that this is an interesting paper with the wealth of high quality data/ However, there are several areas that need further experimentation and clarification.</p><p>1) The results as written do not fully address the stated major aim of the study, i.e. investigating &quot;how epigenetic regulators coordinate with tissue-specific regulatory factors during morphogenesis of specific organs&quot;.

There is some variation at E14.5, but in most of the samples we investigated, the palatal shelves were able to elevate in <italic>Kdm6b</italic> mutant mice, as shown in Figure2 L and N. All the samples at E15.5 are accurately represented in Figure2 P. Furthermore, all the <italic>Kdm6b</italic> mutant mice are accurately represented by Figure1 M-R at newborn stage. We have never observed palatal shelves oriented vertically beside the tongue from E15.5 to newborn stage (n&gt;10). Therefore, we conclude there is no elevation defect in <italic>Kdm6b</italic> mutant mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Some numbers used to describe the results were inaccurate. For examples, Lines 119 – 120, &quot;Loss of Kdm6b in CNC-derived cells resulted in complete cleft palate in Wnt1-Cre;Kmd6bfl/fl mice (90% phenotype penetrance, N=7).&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer for this comment and have edited accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Given that the manuscript is focused on the effect of Kdm6b on the regulation of p53 in palatogenesis, the authors should discuss why few p53-/- mice had cleft palate, but Nutlin3 treatment was able to rescue the cleft palate defect in Kdm6b mutant mice at high efficiency. The manuscript indicated N=5 for the Nutlin-3 rescue experiment but did not indicate whether all 5 mutants were rescued. In addition, whereas the p53 mRNAs were reduced by about 50% in the Kdm6b mutant palate, the western blot in Figure 4—figure supplement 5F appears to show that Nutlin-3 treatment resulted in similar or more p53 protein in the mutant sample than the control. It would be helpful to quantify the relative levels of p53 protein in the Nutlin-3 treated mutant and control samples, and to discuss, if that is the result, how Nutlin-3 could induce p53 protein more efficiently in the mutant than in the control samples.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment regarding <italic>Trp53<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, which show a low penetrance of cleft palate. Regarding this question, we think <italic>Kdm6b</italic> as an epigenetic regulator acts on more downstream targets than just <italic>Trp53.</italic> In <italic>Trp53<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, there might be other factors that could compensate for the lost function of <italic>Trp53</italic>. However, in <italic>Kdm6b</italic> mutant mice, this compensation cannot occur. We have also added this point in our Discussion section. Nutlin-3 treatment successfully rescued the hard palate cleft in all observed <italic>Wnt1<sup>Cre</sup>;Kdm6b<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice (N = 5). Two of these five showed a posterior soft palate cleft. We appreciate the reviewer’s comments on this detail and its improvement to the discussion in our manuscript.</p><p>We have added quantification for the Western blot results in Figure 4—figure supplement 1G as per the reviewer’s suggestion. Regarding why Nutlin-3 is more efficient in the mutant than in the controls, we cannot offer a specific explanation but note that this phenomenon is very common with Nutlin-3 treatment. For example, in Li et al.’s study, they also observed Nutlin-3 treatment is more efficient in knockout cells compared to controls (Li et al. 2016).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I have just a few comments that would not change the interpretation of the data nor would I request additional experiments.</p><p>1.

Figure 2 - Figure Supplement 4, (E-H). The TUNEL stain data should probably be quantified by using TUNEL+ cell numbers collected across several different sections/samples. The difference between the control and the mutant, as seen in the 4 images provided, is large if expressed as a percentage but still limited to 3 cells or fewer (especially at day E13.5). Even at E14.5, while there are 3 TUNEL+ cells seen in the palatal shelves of the mutant and 0 in the control, multiple TUNEL signals can be seen just outside of the dotted region in the control but not in the mutant; either the control has more cell death right next to the palatal shelves, or the small difference between the two can be explained as a sampling error without more data points.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment.

In GO we did notice Wnt signaling pathway, which also has some crosstalk with Cadherin signaling, ranking as the top signaling pathway.

We agree with the reviewer that there are more signaling pathways that are worthy to investigate, but are beyond the scope of this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

L323-334, figure 5F-N; In contrast to what the authors claim, Ezh1 seems to have a stronger signal than Ezh2. Besides, the expression pattern between Ezh1 and Ezh2 is quite different.

Otherwise, can the authors elaborate why they chose to KO Ezh2 in the Wnt1-Cre; Kdm6bfl/fl model?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment regarding <italic>Ezh1</italic>. Our in vivo staining of <italic>Ezh1</italic> was done using RNAscope, while that of EZH2 was immunostaining. It’s hard to quantitatively compare these two signals directly based on the staining. However, we agree with the reviewer that the expression patterns of <italic>Ezh1</italic> and <italic>Ezh2</italic> are different. Expression of <italic>Ezh1</italic> is more enriched in the oral side of the palatal shelf, while expression of <italic>Ezh2</italic> is more universal. However, from the Western blot we could see at the protein level, the expression of EZH2 is higher than EZH1 when we load the same amount of total protein (based on a beta-actin internal control). Furthermore, conventional knockout <italic>Ezh1</italic> mice don’t have any abnormal phenotypes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/marker/MGI:1097695">http://www.informatics.jax.org/marker/MGI:1097695</ext-link>), while <italic>Wn1<sup>Cre</sup>;Ezh2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice show severe craniofacial defects.

Paper shows that inhibition of p53 by siRNA results in increased CNCC proliferation and DNA damage and reduces markers of osteogenesis, as seen in the siRNA treated cells. But is it possible to treat an embryo with a p53 inhibitor to directly demonstrate that loss of p53 in this model produces cleft palate? For example, Jones et al. treated pregnant mice with pifithrin-α to inhibit p53 (Nat. Med. 2011).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We did generate <italic>Wnt1<sup>Cre</sup>;Trp53<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice, and only about 20% of the mutant mice showed a cleft palate phenotype.

The paper describes how the control cells were treated with Tfdp1 siRNA, which resulted in lower levels of p53. Why wasn't the same treatment applied to the Wnt1-Cre;Kdm6bfl/fl cells, especially if both the controls and the mutants were later treated with the Tfdp1 overexpression plasmid?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. The purpose of treating control cells with <italic>Tfdp1</italic> siRNA is to test whether expression of <italic>Trp53</italic> is regulated by the transcription factor TFDP1, which is validated by ATAC-seq and ChIP-qPCR results. Therefore, we used cells from the palatal mesenchyme of control mice to test the function of TFDP1 in regulating <italic>Trp53</italic>. Expression of <italic>Trp53</italic> is already reduced in the <italic>Kdm6b</italic> mutant mice, so we think using cells from control mice is more appropriate for this experimental purpose.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>[…]</p><p>– Nomenclature: protein names should be written in uppercase throughout the text and in the figures.

It is difficult to be convinced of this result, given that the TUNEL-positive cells are extremely sparse in both the control and mutant shown in these panels. If the Authors are convinced of their finding based on multiple experiments, they should show sections that better illustrate the defect, as well as quantify the numbers of TUNEL-positive cells over multiple sections for both control and mutant samples. In addition, they should include a graph comprising the total numbers of cells that were counted, the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells in both control and mutant, the fold increase of TUNEL-positive cells in the mutant, and the statistical significance. Unless these quantitative experiments are included, the Authors should definitely delete &quot;increased cell death&quot; for the mutant from the summary model shown in Figure 8.</p><p>However, if the Authors were to prove the presence of an increase of cell death in the palatal mesenchyme of Wnt1-Cre;Kdm6bfl/fl mice by conducting additional experiments, this finding would somehow contradict the result – which is very convincing – that p53 expression is decreased in mutant tissue (shown currently in Figure 7). Interestingly, in the discussion the authors mention (line 517): &quot;In this study we notice that downregulated expression of p53 in Wnt1-Cre;Kdm6bfl/fl mice results in hyperproliferation and increased DNA damage in the proliferative cells, which might further lead to cell senescence.&quot; Assessing cell senescence, instead of cell death, in the mutant compared to the control could be revealing.</p></disp-quote><p>We really appreciate this suggestion.

Indeed, this red box contains the TSS of Wrap53 and not p53. The Wrap53 gene encodes an essential component of the telomerase holoenzyme complex, a ribonucleoprotein complex required for telomere synthesis. The encoded protein interacts with other components of active telomerase and with small Cajal body RNAs (scaRNAs), which are involved in modifying splicing RNAs. It was reported that Wrap53 also functions as a p53 antisense transcript, which regulates endogenous p53 mRNA levels and the levels of P53 protein by targeting the 5' untranslated region of p53 mRNA (Mahmoudi et al. Mol Cell 2009). Therefore, Wrap53 can indirectly alter p53 levels of expression and regulation. siRNA knockdown of Wrap53 results in significant decrease in p53 mRNA and suppression of P53 induction upon DNA damage. Conversely, overexpression of Wrap53 increases p53 mRNA and protein levels (Mahmoudi et al. Molecular Cell 2009; Farnebo et al., Cell Cycle 2009; Saldana-Meyer et al., Genes and Development 2013). These studies unequivocally demonstrated that Wrap53 regulates p53. As it turns out, the primers used for the ChIP-qPCR experiment shown in Figure 7 were now blasted and they correspond to the Wrap53 promoter and not to the p53 promoter. Given all the knowledge discussed above, the current statement: &quot;factor Tfdp1 binds to the promoter of p53 along with Kdm6b to specifically activate the expression of this tumor suppressor gene&quot; should be re-evaluated and clarified. This point should be better investigated. As the distance between the Wrap53 and p53 genes is only approximately 1kb, in additional experiments the Authors should use primers specific to the p53 promoter and to the Wrap53 promoter together with chromatin sonicated to an average size of 300-600 bp, which should provide a clear answer as to whether TFDP1 binds directly to the p53 promoter, or to the Wrap53 promoter, or to both. If TFDP1 does not bind directly to p53 but to the Wrap53 promoter instead, regulation of p53 transcription would then be indirect, via Wrap53. This finding would still be of interest. This reviewer believes that this point is important and should be adequately clarified and examined in further depth.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s comment about <italic>Wrap53</italic>. We checked our RNAseq results, which show a very low expression level of <italic>Wrap53</italic>. To further confirm this result, we performed in situ RNAscope staining of our sample. The result is shown below. As our data clearly shows that <italic>Trp53</italic> is widely expressed in palatal mesenchyme (Figure 3), it is very unlikely that <italic>Wrap53</italic> is involved in the regulation of <italic>Trp53</italic> during palatogenesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 7 – Figure Suppl 6: The Authors also analyze expression patterns of Kdm6b and its co-expression with Tfdp1 by scRNAseq. The scRNAseq data sets have already been described by the same Authors in a(nother) interesting paper that was recently published. There appears to be a striking enrichment of both Kdm6b and Tfdp1 genes in a particular cell subpopulation emerging from the scRNAseq datasets. It would be very interesting to know which cell type comprises this particular cluster? Also, the individual Panels in B should be enlarged to better visualize each cell clusters. It would also be very helpful to the reader to list the specific cell types that comprise each cluster in the Panels in B.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion.
