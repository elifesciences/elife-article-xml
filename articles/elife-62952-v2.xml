The progression of aging-related traits varies widely among individuals, influenced by their environment, lifestyle, and genetics. In this study, we conducted physiologic and functional tests cross-sectionally throughout the entire lifespan of male C57BL/6N mice. In parallel, metabolomics analyses in serum, brain, liver, heart, and skeletal muscle were also performed to identify signatures associated with frailty and age-dependent functional decline. Our findings indicate that declines in gait speed as a function of age and frailty are associated with a dramatic increase in the energetic cost of physical activity and decreases in working capacity. Aging and functional decline prompt organs to rewire their metabolism and substrate selection and toward redox-related pathways, mainly in liver and heart. Collectively, the data provide a framework to further understand and characterize processes of aging at the individual organism and organ levels.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Aging</kwd><kwd>Metabolism</kwd><kwd>gait</kwd><kwd>physiology</kwd><kwd>Metabolomics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG000335-04</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>de Cabo</surname><given-names>Rafael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A comprehensive cross-sectional assessment reveals functional decline in mice consistent with increased energetic cost of physical activity with age through metabolic rewiring in multiple organs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Genetics, lifestyle, and environmental factors contribute to different rates of aging. Across the lifespan, most species undergo complex phenotypical and functional changes that affect all organs of the body and the systems that allow communication and coordination between tissues. While this concept of aging has existed for a very long time, several milestones have recently been achieved in aging research, both in terms of the identification and modulation of pathways critical to aging in model organisms, and the characterization of factors relevant to human aging. In particular, important progress has been made in comparing the phenotypes and rate of decline due to chronological aging <italic>versus</italic> disease-related factors, the relationship between health risk factors and aging, and the impact of behavioral trends on health and risk of disease promotion in humans (Healthy Aging: Lessons from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, NIA, NIH, US DHHS, July 2010). There is significant variability in survival in the older population that cannot be explained solely by age and sex alone.</p><p>Under well-controlled environmental conditions, laboratory mice can live up to 4 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Miller et al., 2002</xref>). A wide range of physiological, functional, behavioral, and pathological changes occur with age that determine how long mice live. Mice develop many of the histopathological characteristics of human aging during their lifespan, such as lymphocyte infiltration, tissue inflammation and necrosis, cancer, and amyloidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mitchell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mitchell et al., 2019</xref>). Understanding the process of normal aging in mice and identifying murine aging predictors and biomarkers will aid in the development of interventions capable of improving health and quality of life that are translatable to humans.</p><p>Research on aging is shifting its focus toward understanding the underlying differences in the aging phenotype of <italic>chronological</italic> and <italic>biological</italic> aging. Resilience and associated compensatory homeostatic mechanisms slow functional decline, resulting in great variability in survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferrucci et al., 2020</xref>). For instance, physical performance metrics have provided important information about individualized estimates of survival as evidenced by the association of age-related decline in gait speed with reduced overall survival in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Studenski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">White et al., 2013</xref>). However, clinically detectable changes currently utilized to characterize the aging phenotype are only apparent when compensatory mechanisms begin to fail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferrucci et al., 2020</xref>). In this context, the nature of the processes (e.g. metabolic, immunologic) and underlying mechanisms causing these compensatory maladaptations are not well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferrucci et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adelnia et al., 2020</xref>). All hallmarks of aging exhibit prominent anabolic and catabolic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">López-Otín et al., 2013</xref>). In light of previous cross-sectional health studies in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Justice et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fischer et al., 2016</xref>), we performed an extensive characterization of the group differences in several relevant phenotypes, including glucoregulatory and physical performance metrics, in a cohort of male C57BL/6N mice ranging from 3 to 36 months of age. In addition, untargeted metabolite profiling of multiple organs and serum was conducted in this cross-sectional study, allowing a thorough characterization of the functional and molecular changes that occur with age. We report group differences in many functional and phenotypic biomarkers of aging in mice and provide an initial characterization of the specific biomolecular changes that occur in different organs that may contribute to these age-related conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Physiological, biochemical, and physical behavioral tests in a cross-sectional study of aging in mice</title><p>To characterize aging phenotypes in a cohort of male C57BL/6N mice, we utilized physiological, biochemical, and physical behavior tests to cross-sectionally assess group differences in these traits with age.

It is characterized by loss of gait speed, fatigue, loss of body weight and muscle strength, and cognitive decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Palliyaguru et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we used a multimodal approach to assess the impact of aging on the development of frailty and the associated impairment of several related phenotypic measures. The frailty index (FI) is a compilation of 31 clinical parameters, with 0 being not frail and one being frail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Whitehead et al., 2014</xref>). The values obtained from FI assessment increased progressively among different groups of mice, passing from 0.13 ± 0.01 in group Y to 0.24 ± 0.01 in group A, and 0.31 ± 0.02 in group O (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), in agreement with earlier results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Whitehead et al., 2014</xref>). The FI increased linearly as a function of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, p=3.80e-16, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.615), with age accounting for 61.5% of FI variation. These group differences in FI were associated with reduced forelimb muscle strength, expressed as latency to fall from a wire (p=0.0033, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.113), and gait speed (p=2.73e-16, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.608) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). Age accounted for 52.5% and 46.5% of the mean (p=2.61e-13) and maximal (p=1.87e-11) tail height variation, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). Given the strong relationship between FI vs. age and FI’s significance as a metric of age-dependent decline, we related other functional parameters, for example, wire hang, tail height and gait speed, to FI. Gait speed exhibited the strongest relationship with FI from that of age itself, since FI can explain ~33% of the gait speed decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) compared to only ~17–25% of the other variables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–J</xref>). As expected, clear deficits in muscle strength (wire hang test and mean/maximal tail height) and walking speed were significantly related with FI. Interestingly, since total gait speed variation could, in principle, be explained by age and FI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and G</xref>, respectively), it can be considered a major biomarker of aging-dependent decline. After adjusting for age, frailty lost the association with gait speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, p=0.477) but it remained strongly associated with forelimb muscle strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, p=0.00088). After including age, FI was only marginally associated with mean tail height (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, p=0.0792) while still being associated with maximal tail height (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>, p=0.0495). The effects of frailty on muscle strength were maintained after correction for age, indicating the presence of independent risk factors beyond chronological age that could reduce physical performance in the oldest mice.</p><p>Given the adaptive role of insulin resistance in aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barzilai and Ferrucci, 2012</xref>), venous blood was collected from 6 hr fasted mice. Blood glucose, plasma insulin concentrations, and HOMA-IR index, a surrogate for estimating insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Matthews et al., 1985</xref>), were largely similar from 6 to 16 months and were observed to be lower after 19 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K,L</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In contrast to physical performance measurements, only a weak association existed between fasting blood glucose and the FI score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>). These results may reflect a survivorship bias of the long-living mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Scheen, 2017</xref>), although other effects such as reduced body weight and age-associated regional distribution among fat depots could have profound metabolic implications vis-à-vis changes observed in fasting blood glucose and insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Girard and Lafontan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hardy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tran et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shuster et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In order to understand the impact of body composition on overall fitness, body composition analysis was performed next using low-field NMR spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Group differences in body weight and whole-body fat percentage were noted with a steady increase in values up to ~19 months and a decline thereafter (p=7.87e-07, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.319 and p=2.71e–07, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.340, respectively), whereas a weak positive association was observed between fasting glucose levels and percent body fat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To determine body fat distribution, a 7T MRI body scanner was used to quantify the subcutaneous/visceral fat ratio, which revealed a linear reduction in visceral adiposity as a function of age (p=3.38e-05, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.2996) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The whole-body lean tissue percentage was largely preserved during aging (p=2.15e-05, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.250) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Old mice exhibited marked and significantly lower femoral cortical bone thickness (p=7.20e-07, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.458) and trabecular bone mineral density (BMD) (p=0.0184, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.112) compared to the other two groups of mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Representative micro-CT scans of the femoral region are depicted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). No association between BMD and body weight was found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Remarkably, there was a lower percentage of fat around the tibia per unit of body mass in animals of increased age, with the oldest group of mice being the most affected (p=0.002, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.248), whereas the percentage of lean tissue surrounding the tibia trended higher in group O compared to group A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The presence of weaker bones is suggestive of age-related osteoporosis.</p><p>To assess whether the lower gait speed in old animals was caused by an altered cardio-metabolic phenotype, mice walked on a metabolic treadmill at their age-group's average gait speed (determined from the MotoRater data, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), while VO<sub>2</sub> and VCO<sub>2</sub> were simultaneously monitored. Although variability exists within age groups, there is a steady decline in gait speed measured from progressively older cohorts of mice, and therefore average gait speed emulated the natural walking pattern, which is defined as walking without hesitation (e.g. stopping frequently/exploring/sniffing) not sprinting across the platform. Remarkably, the energetic cost of walking increased exponentially from ~20 months of age and was paralleled by a sustained decrease in work capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, 1st and 4th panels). The running VO<sub>2</sub> values did not differ over the entire activity episode (800 s.) across age, thus ruling out a role for fatigue in the higher energetic cost in the oldest mice (data not shown). Respiratory exchange ratio (RER, defined as VCO<sub>2</sub>/VO<sub>2</sub>) varies between ~0.7 (i.e. predominant use of fats as fuel source) and 1.0 (i.e. exclusive carbohydrate utilization), with intermediate RER values implying mixed substrate use. Interestingly, RER and heat dissipation values, obtained during the treadmill monitoring, decreased from ~0.85 to ~0.80, and from 5 to 3 kJ h<sup>−1</sup>, respectively, indicating higher utilization of lipid than glucose as an energy source, and less heat dissipation in the older groups of animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> panels). The differences in work economy and heat production between the three age groups were maintained after adjusting for lean mass (data not shown). The diminished heat dissipation <italic>vs.</italic> age might not be due to an increase in the efficiency of energy use by the group O, but rather a predominant overall decrease in work capacity, that is, by working less, the mice dissipate less heat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, 2nd and 4th panels). These results are also consistent with the observation that, compared with young animals, older mice consume significantly more O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, 1st panel) and released more CO<sub>2</sub> per unit gait speed (not shown), because enhanced lipid catabolism demands more O<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Multiple linear regression analysis showed that from the initial set of explanatory variables, the interaction of gait velocity and age was found to be significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, left panel). Frailty status was more apparent with age as gait velocity increases: Specifically, at younger ages, the frailty index was inversely correlated with gait velocity while at older ages frailty status showed strong association with lower gait velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, right panel). Studies have shown that higher level of <italic>HOMA</italic>-IR is significantly associated with frailty in the elderly, but such association is not observed in the middle-aged population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Peng et al., 2019</xref>); moreover, fasting plasma glucose does not differ between frail and non-frail individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kalyani et al., 2012</xref>). Here, positive associations between HOMA-IR tertiles (Q1, median, Q3) and the risk of frailty were observed in old animals, while fasting blood glucose tertiles and frailty status were negatively correlated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). By incorporating bone density variables into the starting model, we found that frailty increases more steeply with age as cortical thickness increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, left panel) and that the effect of cortical thickness on frailty index is much larger in older ages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, right panel). The introduction of variables such as percent lean mass, percent fat and visceral-to-subcutaneous fat ratio as well as metabolic treadmill parameters such as energetic cost, heat generation or RER did not improve the initial model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>Of all the experimental variables analyzed, age and energetic costs were the only explanatory variables for gait speed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Gait speed tended to be lower in older animals than in group Y, consistent with the observations made in the human population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Studenski et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, at higher energetic costs there was a stronger decreasing relationship between gait velocity and age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, left panel). There was a marked positive association between gait velocity and energetic costs in groups Y and A, whereas no significant relationship was observed in group O (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, right panel).</p><p>To better understand the impact of age on energy balance and availability in mice, we conducted indirect calorimetry experiments in metabolic chambers for 72 hr to collect specific measurements such as the VCO<sub>2</sub>, VO<sub>2</sub>, RER, energy expenditure (EE), and ambulatory activity counts. Mice from Group A (12–20 mo) were significantly heavier than group Y (7 mo) and group O (26–36 mo) animals as they entered the metabolic cages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Hourly trajectories of energetic parameters were captured over two 24 hr cycles (D1-L2-D2-L3) and then were averaged. Distinctive diurnal patterns of O<sub>2</sub> consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> production were observed in the three groups of mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) that led to differences in the calculated values for RER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), with significantly higher area under the curve (AUC) in group O <italic>vs</italic>. groups Y and A, indicative of greater metabolic flexibility (AUC for Y, 2.563 ± 0.1163 [CI 2.335–2.791]; A, 2.311 ± 0.2188 [CI 1.883–2.74]; O, 3.277 ± 0.1421 [CI 2.999–3.556]). Moreover, EE was greater in group A compared with the other two groups consistent with their higher O<sub>2</sub> consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). While these differences are largely reflective of the higher body mass of group A mice, it was also clear that the relationships between these metabolic parameters and body weight were altered with age (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>). Lastly, the higher ambulatory activity during the dark cycle was significantly lower in group O mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>) and showed a strong negative correlation with age across the entire pool of animals. The diurnal changes in RER in the three age groups showed statistically significant differences in the dark cycle (D) between group Y <italic>vs.</italic> group O and group A vs. group O (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>), with higher RER in the oldest group of mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). No difference in RER could be observed in the light phase between the different groups of mice. Scatter plots of the averaged 48 hr values of various energetic parameters from groups Y (n = 8), A (n = 22), and O (n = 18) mice showed statistically significant differences in group Y <italic>vs.</italic> group A mice and A <italic>vs.</italic> O mice in VO<sub>2</sub> and EE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata3">Figure 2—source data 3</xref>). In contrast, there were no differences between groups Y and O mice in any of the measures except for the ambulatory activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata3">Figure 2—source data 3</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with the lower gait speed observed in older animals, metabolic cage analysis reveals a strong negative correlation between age and ambulatory activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), whereas no other respiratory parameters correlated significantly with age (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata4">Figure 2—source data 4</xref>). As expected, body weight was positively correlated with EE, oxygen consumption, and CO<sub>2</sub> production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata4">Figure 2—source data 4</xref>). The observed differences in the AUC of respiratory parameters were primarily a result of the higher body weight of group A mice, which is why a generalized linear model (ANCOVA) analysis was used to determine differences in the relationship of body weight with VO<sub>2</sub>, VCO<sub>2</sub>, and EE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata5">Figure 2—source data 5</xref>). This analysis demonstrated statistically significant differences in the relationship between body weight and respiratory parameters when comparing group Y vs. A mice and group Y vs. O mice. These metabolic alterations may complement many of the differences that were observed in body composition and other related parameters.</p><p>Overall, the data presented in this section show that gait speed is a major biomarker of healthspan, and that frailty, in addition to age, is able to explain to a great extent its functional deterioration. In contrast, morphometrics (e.g. body weight, % fat and % lean mass) and glucose homeostasis (e.g. blood glucose, insulin, and HOMA2-IR) metrics show a more nuanced relationship with age. In fact, many of these factors (e.g. blood glucose, insulin, body weight, % fat) do not start to show a reduction in values until after ~19 mo, whereas others (e.g. bone density parameters, % fat around tibia) steadily decline in the values from various groups of mice with age. Important exceptions to this include % lean mass, % lean mass around the tibia per whole body weight, and the ratio of subcutaneous/visceral fat, that tend to be higher in group O animals. These findings provide a coherent picture of the bioenergetic changes that occur as a function of age, marked by an exponential increase in the energetic cost of physical activity, which is paralleled by a sustained decrease in work (energy). Together with gait speed, these parameters constitute landmarks of aging-dependent decline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>), which led us to explore in further detail how the metabolomic landscape was altered with age in different tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Untargeted metabolomics analysis</title><p>To determine whether the differences in healthspan assessments, such as physical function, FI, energetics, and work economy can be linked to metabolic remodeling, we performed untargeted metabolomics analysis.

In contrast, in liver, skeletal muscle and serum, Y and O animals were clearly separated while group A mice partially overlapped with both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). To identify the main metabolites responsible for age-dependent metabolic differences, we analyzed the top 20–25 metabolites in each organ, ranked based on the variable importance in projection (VIP) score as a function of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>); the mini heat map on the right shows each metabolite’s level variation within the different age groups.</p><p>The age dependence of each metabolite’s concentration was further assessed by quantifying the Pearson correlation coefficient as a function of age; positive and negative values denote greater or lower levels in older mice. Depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> are the brain, heart, liver, serum and skeletal muscle results. For example, the top sixteen VIP score-ranked metabolites (VIP &gt;1.0) in the liver are also among the most important ones increasing (F6P, ribulose 5P, G6P, glutathione) or decreasing (pyruvate, xylitol, sorbitol, nicotinamide) with age. Extending this analysis to the other organs enabled us to visualize the emergence of a consistent ‘meta-pattern’ of metabolic change characterized by metabolites from redox-related pathways, such as pentose phosphate (G6P, ribulose 5P, ribose 5P), NAD<sup>+</sup> salvage (nicotinamide), methionine cycle (methionine) and transsulfuration (cysteine, taurine, glutamate, glycine, glutathione) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Unlike in liver and the heart, where higher relative accumulation levels of those metabolites were detected in older animals, skeletal muscle exhibited opposite comportment whereas the brain displayed an intermediate behavior. Specifically, G6P, ribulose 5P, ribose 5P and glutathione were elevated with age in liver and/or heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). There was also an apparent difference in the response of these organs to oxidative stress, as revealed by lower nicotinamide and cysteine in the liver, and higher methionine sulfoxide (a biomarker of oxidative stress that originates from oxidation of methionine) in the heart from aged mice. In skeletal muscle, nicotinamide, methionine and cysteine were lower in group O mice, whereas in the brain, nicotinamide was relatively low, in contrast to methionine, which was modestly higher, while methionine sulfoxide was diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, the higher levels of methionine sulfoxide in the serum from old animals along with lower levels of nicotinamide are consistent with increased oxidative stress as a function of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>Together, these data suggest that as mice age, organs such as liver and heart, which are exposed to higher oxidative stress as a result of their function (detoxification in the liver and energy generation in the heart), remodel their metabolism toward higher expression/activity of redox-related metabolic pathways, for example, pentose phosphate, NAD<sup>+</sup> salvage and transsulfuration. Oppositely, skeletal muscle and brain do not appear to be able to remodel those pathways thus becoming more vulnerable to increased oxidative stress with aging. This metabolic pattern agrees with the idea of different rates of aging among organs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Age and organ-specific metabolic remodeling</title><p>Next, we addressed the metabolic pathways involved in this remodeling, according to metabolite intermediates present in the profile. Serum metabolite profiles from old mice showed accumulation of intermediates from urea cycle function (urea, glutamine, ornithine), a pattern consistent with predominant amino acid degradation in the liver, and significant accumulation of the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) valine, isoleucine and leucine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Remarkably, the three top-ranked metabolites, glucose, 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-HB, a ketone body), and glycerol appear to be lower in the serum of old mice, suggesting a reduced supply of these fuel substrates from liver and adipose tissue to heart, brain, and skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Together, the lower levels of glycerol and serum fatty acids (myristic, linoleic, oleic, and palmitoleic, but not arachidonic) suggests potential liver and adipose tissue dysfunction in aged mice, in agreement with the body composition data and the metabolic cage data.</p><p>In liver, depletion of glucose, pyruvate, sorbitol, fructose 1P (F1P), xylitol, maltose, and maltotriose with age suggests active glycolysis and glycogen breakdown, less utilization of the polyol pathway, and hepatic release to the circulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The accumulation of tyrosine, tryptophan, glutamine, and glutamate, concomitant with the depletion of alanine and valine (but not glycine), is mirrored by the serum metabolite profile, consistent with active amino acid degradation and urea cycle function.</p><p>The heart shows a remarkable accrual of BCAAs with age. Glucose degradation pathways appear to be all very active including polyols (fructose, F1P) and glycogenolysis (maltose) also consistent with glucose 1P (G1P) depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Higher levels of the tricarboxylic acid intermediates fumarate, malate, and succinate suggest active mitochondrial function. Reduced production of 3-HB further contributes to the loss of 3HB circulating levels and reveals less fatty acid oxidation. In the brain, the accumulation of the top-ranked fatty acid ω6 linoleic acid together with stearic and palmitoleic acids is notably associated with the increased abundance of 3-HB, a preferred substrate of this organ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The higher levels of urea and glutamine in older mice, accompanied by depletion of ornithine, suggest active urea cycle function, a trait consistent with depletion of several amino acids (isoleucine, serine, tyrosine, glutamate) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Expectedly, the skeletal muscle from old mice exhibits high glucose catabolism as suggested by the accumulation of maltose, lactate and maltotriose. Higher levels of urea concomitant with lower levels of several amino acids, such as leucine, tyrosine, valine, serine, and cysteine, indicate of active amino acid degradation accompanied by urea cycle function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Metabolite set enrichment analysis (MSEA) shows the statistical significance of the metabolic pathways involved for each organ. The results obtained support the idea that metabolic remodeling in old mice occurs via redox-related pathways in liver and heart as compared to skeletal muscle and brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). MSEA also confirmed the relevance of the urea cycle and ammonia cycling likely due to amino acid degradation in skeletal muscle, brain, and liver, a metabolic trend that is also reflected by the serum metabolite profile. With aging, and in an amphibolic organ like the liver, amino acid degradation could be triggered in parallel with protein biosynthesis, as indicated by tissue enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In the aging phenotype of predominantly postmitotic catabolic organs like skeletal muscle, heart, and brain, protein synthesis might be less significant compared to that in liver.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Pathway enrichment in brain, heart, liver, serum, and skeletal muscle Metabolite set enrichment analysis (MSEA) showing the statistical significance of the metabolic pathways involved for each organ.</title><p>Note the metabolic remodeling occurring with age, as it pertains to redox-related pathways (green symbols), urea cycle and ammonia cycling through amino acid degradation (dark blue symbols), and one-carbon metabolism (light green symbols).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-62952-fig5-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Together, the data obtained show that each organ exhibits an age-specific metabolic remodeling which is, in part, associated with its function, for example, prominence of redox-related pathways in liver and heart, active glucose catabolism in skeletal muscle, activation of glucose metabolism in the heart and gluconeogenesis and urea cycle function in liver. Statistically significant pathways found by MSEA in old mice are consistent with major hallmarks of metabolic remodeling identified by other types of analysis. Many of the differences observed in this metabolomic profiling can be linked to the phenotypic alterations that were observed in group O mice, either as factors that may be involved in promoting or may arise as a result of these differences.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Patterns of metabolic signatures of biological aging from covariation of metabolites with physiological metrics</title><p>In order to cope with the increased energetic cost of maintaining health and energy balance, each organ must fine-tune their metabolism and substrate selection. To assess the strength of the links between metabolites and phenotypic outcomes, we generated correlation matrices between energetic cost, RER, or frailty index (FI) and metabolites representative of major pathways involved in the metabolic remodeling of the four organs (heart, skeletal muscle, liver, and brain) and serum. Firstly, a correlation matrix with the 46 significantly changed metabolites was constructed to investigate their covariation, independently of age and organ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). A big cluster of positively correlated metabolites accompanied by four minor ones were found, from which 24 metabolites from all clusters and representative pathways were selected. The energetic cost of walking and RER are two metrics closely related to gait speed, whereas FI, a major biomarker of aging, is only remotely related to metabolism. Next, the Pearson correlation coefficient for each of the 24 metabolites was calculated with respect to the energetic cost, RER or FI from scatter plot matrices (‘r’ with p&lt;0.05) for each of the four organs and serum (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> as an example and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). Hierarchically clustered heatmaps allowed for visualization of all correlation coefficients (positive and negative) corresponding to the 24 metabolites as a function of the phenotypic outcome in each organ and serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–D</xref>). Broadly speaking, the increase in energetic cost, RER, or FI was correlated with organ-specific patterns of increased abundance or depletion of select metabolites.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Heatmaps of hierarchically clustered correlation coefficients of representative metabolites from organs and serum vs. different physiological metrics.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Correlation matrix of the 46 metabolites significantly changed across age, organs and serum.

A second cluster of negatively correlated metabolites represented by nicotinamide, alanine, and myristic acid was present in heart, and to a lesser extent in liver and brain. BCAAs (valine, isoleucine, leucine) and several other metabolites, including 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-HB), correlated positively with energetic cost in the heart, while being negatively linked in liver. On the other hand, glutathione correlated positively with energetic cost in both organs (heart &gt; liver). For many metabolites, including glutathione, glycerol, and methionine sulfoxide, the brain presented a distinct pattern with respect to the other organs. The skeletal muscle resembled the heart profile with some exceptions.</p><p>Taken as a whole, the increase in energetic cost correlates with a pattern of metabolites related to substrate utilization. This pattern is consistent with a mixture of glucose, lipid, and amino acid metabolism in liver, and more predominant glucose and lipid metabolism in the heart, whereas lipids appeared to prevail over glucose in skeletal muscle. Remarkably, brain displayed a pronounced amino acid catabolism in addition to the expected dependence on glucose and ketone bodies. Regarding redox metabolism, heart exhibited the highest correlation between energetic cost and glutathione, followed by liver then SKM, while ribose from the pentose phosphate pathway was positively correlated in heart only, and the oxidative stress biomarker methionine sulfoxide showed a positive correlation in both cardiac and SKM, suggesting a more oxidative environment in these two organs along with brain.</p><p>As a function of RER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), liver and heart shared a cluster of both negatively and positively correlated metabolites. Again, the brain exhibited a clearly distinct pattern with respect to the other organs consisting of mostly positively correlated metabolites, whereas skeletal muscle presented a more mixed pattern with two noticeable clusters of negatively and positively correlated metabolites. An elevated RER is indicative of an increase in the proportion of carbohydrates utilized for energy production. Consistent with this, we observed an increasing abundance of glucose intermediates in both liver and heart concomitant with depletion of lipids and amino acids. In this regard, SKM and brain presented a distinct pattern which was more based on glucose rather than lipid metabolism. The increasingly mixed glucose and lipid utilization led to a trend toward higher abundance of methionine sulfoxide and depletion in glutathione in response to increased RER in heart, liver, and SKM, while brain had markedly less methionine sulfoxide, but greater accumulation of methionine and nicotinamide compared to glutathione. This pattern is consistent with systemic oxidative stress and lower antioxidant capacity.</p><p>Increasing energetic cost and higher RER elicited an enrichment of several lipids and amino acids, but depletion of glycerol in serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). These patterns are consistent with the metabolic remodeling exhibited by liver, a major sink of lipids and amino acids, and unveiled a reduced supply of 3-HB and glycerol from liver and adipose tissue to heart, brain, and skeletal muscle, at least in old mice.</p><p>The prevalent pattern of metabolites correlating positively with increasing FI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) appears to be inconsistent with the pattern profiles revealed by energetic cost and RER. This is expected given the less direct mechanistic relationship between metabolism and FI since the latter derives from a compilation of many different phenotypic features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Palliyaguru et al., 2019</xref>). Energetic cost results from the ratio of respiration (VO<sub>2</sub>) over gait speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), while RER includes only respiration-related variables (CO<sub>2</sub> release over O<sub>2</sub> uptake). Hence, because the latter is more directly related to metabolism, the mechanistic links between RER and metabolism can be more directly envisaged. Nevertheless, the energetic cost of walking/running is a relevant metric because of the presence of gait speed, a major biomarker of functional performance during aging. Remarkably, energetic cost and RER rendered a similar pattern of metabolic profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this cross-sectional study, male mice of various ages (3–36 months) were assessed for functional differences associated with aging, while pursuing the detection of major biomarkers and underlying energetic and metabolic mechanisms. Metabolic remodeling in serum, liver, brain, cardiac, and skeletal muscle, their interactions and consequences for diminishing bodily functions, morphometry and biochemistry, were extensively tested and analyzed. We performed an in-depth characterization of the phenotypic differences that exist between groups Y, A, and O animals. This analysis demonstrated that (i) gait speed decline, which appears to be fully explained by age and frailty, is a major functional biomarker of aging in mice; (ii) the deterioration of locomotor activity is associated with a dramatic increase in the energetic cost of physical activity from age ~19 months, and was paralleled by a sustained decrease of working capacity; (iii) other morphometric (e.g. body weight, % fat and lean) and biochemical (e.g. blood glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR) metrics show a more subtle relationship with age. To further explore the molecular changes that may contribute to or result from these alterations, we performed metabolomic analysis in a number of key metabolic tissues and showed that (iv) different organs remodel their metabolism in response to specific functional demands, for example, energy supply and detoxification; specifically, unlike brain and skeletal muscle, liver and heart in old mice rewire metabolism toward higher expression/activity of redox-related metabolic pathways such as pentose phosphate, NAD<sup>+</sup> salvage, and transsulfuration; (v) depletion of glucose, 3-HB, and glycerol in serum from old mice is consistent with reduced supply of these fuel substrates from liver and adipose tissue to other organs; (vi) aging in mice favors up-modulation of glucose metabolism in cardiac and skeletal muscle as well as in liver, where gluconeogenesis and urea cycle are also enhanced, as well as similar but less pronounced pattern in brain. We then evaluated the associations between metabolites and phenotypic covariates (energetic cost of walking/running, RER, and frailty) by selecting the 24 most representative metabolites independently from age and organ. The main results showed that (vii) variance in energetic cost and RER can be explained by a distinct signature pattern of metabolic remodeling in the liver (e.g. mixed glucose, lipid, and amino acid metabolism), cardiac and skeletal muscle (e.g. glucose and lipids), and brain (mixture of amino acids in addition to glucose and ketone body catabolism). The enhancement in energy demand elicited an increasingly mixed substrate utilization (glucose, lipids, amino acids) leading to a rise in oxidative stress in organs that have lower antioxidant capacity relative to the heart and liver. (viii) Frailty, as a complex phenotype less directly related to metabolism, did not show a consistent metabolic pattern compared to the other two physiological metrics.</p><p>Overall, the ensemble of data obtained from the cross-sectional correlation linking key metabolites to relevant phenotypes identified in this study is consistent with signatures of biological aging. These signatures correspond to patterns of metabolic remodeling that characterize age-associated changes in functional trajectory of mice coping with the increasing energetic cost to maintain health, energy, and redox balance. While many of these molecular alterations are likely to promote aging and aging-associated functional decline, other alterations are expected to maintain functional capacity with age.</p><p>The search for the biological mechanisms underlying healthy aging has shifted the focus of this research field toward the extension of healthspan and lifespan, and to delaying the onset of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Longo and Panda, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Cabo and Mattson, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mitchell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Di Francesco et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aon et al., 2020</xref>). This shift is helping to understand the differences between <italic>biological</italic> and <italic>chronological</italic> aging, underscoring that aging is not just the passage of time while emphasizing the notion that individuals age at a different pace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferrucci et al., 2020</xref>). For instance, the rate of change and onset of increase or decline in functional, behavioral, morphometric, and biochemical organismic indicators exhibit distinct time course as a function of age. This behavior agrees with the notion of <italic>biological</italic> rather than <italic>chronological</italic> aging, thereby showing that aging follows the trajectory of the organism and not merely the passage of time.</p><p>Body composition plays an important role in determining metabolic health, as can be judged by fat and lean content. Consistent with the body weight trajectory, younger male mice have a higher percent fat content than old animals due to larger visceral fat depots. Interestingly, a positive association was observed between fasting glucose levels and percent body fat, which, in turn, correlates with extended lifespan in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mitchell et al., 2016</xref>). Age-associated regional distribution among fat depots has strong metabolic implications. Visceral fat accumulation is associated with insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Girard and Lafontan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hardy et al., 2012</xref>), while subcutaneous fat plays a role in reducing insulin levels and improving insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tran et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shuster et al., 2012</xref>). Here, the increase in body fat percentage from young to adult mice was coincident with a greater subcutaneous/visceral fat ratio, which, in turn, was associated with a significant drop in circulating insulin levels and HOMA-IR. Noteworthily, the oldest mice had the highest ratio of subcutaneous-to-visceral fat and a likelihood of being insulin sensitive (lowest HOMA-IR). We surmise that in order to preserve body fat for insulation, the oldest mice fed ad libitum must eat a significantly greater amount of food despite their low body weight, resulting in negative energy balance. Since the food intake in proportion to body weight is increased and the energy expenditure is decreased in these animals, they are able to rely less heavily on fat oxidation and more on carbohydrate utilization for energy needs, yielding RER values close to 1.0 in the dark phase.</p><p>In vivo imaging using MRI and microCT enabled a precise monitoring of body composition and bone density. These assessments illustrated the marked and significant decline in bone thickness and mineral density, and the reduction in fat and relative increase in lean body composition as a function of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). These measurements are also of great interest in human aging; for example, the relationship between brain structure and composition with gait in humans has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rosso et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">for the Health ABC Study et al., 2016</xref>). In vivo imaging techniques were recently reviewed in the context of their importance to studying aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dall'Ara et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Previously, it was demonstrated that the frailty index, as measured with the Mouse Clinical FI, increases with age and is significantly reduced in response to CR in male C57BL/6J mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Whitehead et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kane et al., 2016</xref>). Frail animals lack resilience, causing them to die earlier due to the rapid deterioration of several tissue/organ systems. In this study, frailty was associated with an age-dependent decline in physical strength, tail height, gait speed, and circulating glucose levels. The rising energetic cost of walking is associated with steeper decline in gait speed in the elderly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schrack et al., 2016</xref>). The results reported herein support these findings. Specifically, the VO<sub>2</sub> / gait speed ratio (in mL O<sub>2</sub>/Kg/m) is energetically and physiologically consistent with the energetic cost of, for example, walking or running (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), to the extent that the cost of running depends upon the animal’s size rather than the speed at which an animal runs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Taylor et al., 1970</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schmidt‐Nielsen, 1984</xref>). Although the impact of age on skeletal muscle mass or fiber type was not assessed or considered in the present study, tendon length and other aspects of muscle/tendon elasticity have been reported to be a major contributor of the biomechanics of work economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Higham et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wilson and Lichtwark, 2011</xref>), and plans are underway to examine whether such changes in muscle/tendon properties are evident in old animals.</p><p>Biological aging represents a complex manifold and, in terms of the organism, widespread phenomenon. This is revealed by the intersection between its macroscopic manifestations such as physical performance and functional decline, with biological mechanisms deeply rooted in cellular energetics, repair, turnover, and detoxification. Our work highlights some of these potential functional/molecular interactions and demonstrates that these mechanisms operate differently at the level of an organ and its function, leading to a distinct and selective age-mediated impact, in turn, consistent with the differential metabolic remodeling observed.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>This was a cross-sectional study in male C57Bl/6N mice rather than a longitudinal study of male and female mice of different genetic background which would have accounted for genetic variability and sex. Resilience as well as immune and blood pressure measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bellantuono et al., 2020</xref>) were not carried out in this study. Future work will require, at least in part, untargeted proteomics and assessment of epigenetic marks in various organs. The age- and frailty-dependent reduction in gait speed and associated energetic cost indicates the need to assess mitochondrial function using high-resolution respirometry in permeabilized tissues and isolated mitochondria in parallel with skeletal muscle ultrastructure by electron microscopy. Other approaches include incorporating MRI of the brain to identify changes in brain structure and volume over time that correlate with collected variables such as motor function, as well as assessments of cognition.</p><p>Further integration of omics in an all-inclusive phenotypic investigation would be beneficial in order to unveil new mechanistic insights potentially translatable to humans. Examples of multi-tissue omics analysis include a recent transcriptome analysis in rats that revealed a top list of genes potentially important in aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shavlakadze et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>, males)</td><td>C57BL/6NCrl</td><td>Charles River Laboratories</td><td>Strain Code 701</td><td>a.k.a.

Mice were single housed with ad libitum access to water and food, and maintained at 20–22°C under a 12:12 hr light:dark cycle (light period 0600–1800). Food and water level in each chamber was checked once on a daily basis at approximately 8:30 AM and the amount of food left in the cage from the previous 24 hr of chamber time was collected and measured. All mice were acclimatized to monitoring cages for 12 hr prior to recording. Sample air was dried and passed through an oxygen sensor for determination of oxygen content. Oxygen consumption was determined by measuring oxygen concentration in air entering the chamber compared with air leaving the chamber. The sensor was calibrated against a standard gas mix containing defined quantities of oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen. Constant airflow (0.5 L/min) was drawn through the chamber and monitored by a mass-sensitive flow meter. The concentrations of oxygen and carbon dioxide were monitored at the inlet and outlet of the sealed chambers to calculate oxygen consumption. Measurement in each chamber was recorded for 30 s at 30 min intervals for a total of 72 hr. Ambulatory activity (both horizontal and vertical) was also monitored by dual axis detection using infrared photocell technology. Metabolic parameters were analyzed using CalR software as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mina et al., 2018</xref>). Young (n = 8), adult (n = 22), and old (n = 18) mice were studied.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Blood and serum markers and HOMA-IR calculation</title><p>Glucose concentrations in blood were measured from the submandibular vein in 6 hr fasted mice with the Blood Glucose Monitoring System Breeze 2 (Bayer, Mishawaka, IN). Coagulated blood was centrifuged at 12,000 x <italic>g</italic> at 4°C for 10 min. Serum was aliquoted and kept frozen at −80°C. Insulin levels were determined according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Crystal Chem, Inc, Downers Grove, IL). Homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated to assess group differences in insulin resistance using the HOMA2 Calculator software available from the Oxford Centre for Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism Diabetes Trials Unit website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dtu.ox.ac.uk/homacalculator/index.php">http://www.dtu.ox.ac.uk/homacalculator/index.php</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Metabolomics analysis</title><p>Metabolomic analysis was performed by the West Coast Metabolomics Center at UC Davis (Davis, CA) in brain, heart, liver, skeletal muscle, and serum from nonfasted animals as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mitchell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mitchell et al., 2016</xref>). In brief, tissue and serum were extracted in an acetonitrile:isopropanol:water (3:3:2) solution, vortexed, centrifuged, and the supernatants aliquoted for downstream analysis. After a series of evaporation and reconstitution steps in 50% acetonitrile, internal standards (C08-C30, fatty acid methyl esters) were added to the dried sample, which was then derivatized for trimethylsilylation of acidic protons. Data were acquired using the method as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fiehn, 2008</xref> and summarized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mitchell et al., 2016</xref>. In brief, metabolites were measured using a rtx5Sil-MS column (made of 95% dimethyl, 5% diphenyl-polysiloxane coated on fused silica; Restek Corporation; Bellefonte PA) protected by an empty guard column. This chromatography method yields excellent retention and separation of primary metabolite classes (amino acids, hydroxyl acids, carbohydrates, sugar acids, sterols, aromatics, nucleosides, amines, and miscellaneous compounds) with arrow peak widths of 2–3 s and very good within-series retention time reproducibility of better than 0.2 s absolute deviation of retention times. The mobile phase consisted of helium, with a flow rate of 1 mL/min, and injection volume of 0.5 μL. The following mass spectrometry parameters were used: a Leco Pegasus IV mass spectrometer with unit mass resolution at 17 spectra s-1 from 80 to 500 Da at −70 eV for elution of metabolites. As a quality control, for each sequence of sample extractions, one blank negative control was performed by applying the total procedure (e.g. all materials and plastic ware) without biological sample. Result files were transformed by calculating the sum intensities of all structurally identified compounds for each sample, and subsequently dividing all data associated with a sample by the corresponding metabolite sum. The resulting data were multiplied by a constant factor in order to obtain values without decimal places. Intensities of identified metabolites with more than one peak (e.g. for the syn- and anti-forms of methoximated reducing sugars) were summed to only one value in the transformed data set. The original non-transformed data set was retained. Relative metabolite levels represent the MS peak amplitude normalized with respect to the total metabolites returned, but disregarding unknowns that might potentially comprise artifact peaks or chemical contaminants.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. GraphPad Prism version 7.0 was used to determine whether data sets passed the D’Agostino and Pearson normality test (α = 0.05). Those that failed included body composition data (NMR-generated morphometric analysis), physical performance/motor coordination results and MRI quantitative data, whereas metabolic outputs, locomotor activity between light/dark cycles, and bone imaging followed a normal data distribution. One-way ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis H test was performed to determine if there were statistically significant differences between the three age groups for any given outcome. All regression models were either quadratic or linear regressions based on data’s fit. The R<sup>2</sup>, F-statistic and p-value are calculated through these models. Outliers were not omitted. As the mice aged, the different assessments took place. At times, the experiments were 3 or 6 months apart from previous assessments, which is why 36-month-old mice were enrolled in some measured outcomes, and not in others.</p><p>The polynomial variables for all curvilinear lines fitted to parameters are as follow:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref> (Glucose vs Age): −0.11821x<sup>2</sup> + 3.22945x + 149.09292</p></list-item><list-item><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> (Body Weight vs Age): y = -0.046141x<sup>2</sup> + 1.632253x + 25.087950</p></list-item><list-item><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> (%Fat vs Age): y = -0.040847x<sup>2</sup> + 1.266635x + 11.621481</p></list-item><list-item><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> (%Lean vs Age): y = 0.021048x<sup>2</sup> + −0.593099x + 62.762510</p></list-item><list-item><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> (%Lean Tibia vs Age): y = 0.003239x<sup>2</sup> + −0.127683x + 3.903823</p></list-item><list-item><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> (Energetic cost vs Age): 0.8025x<sup>2</sup> + −18.182x + 572.9071</p></list-item><list-item><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> (Heat vs Age): −0.001791x<sup>2</sup> + 0.011949x + 5.174154</p></list-item><list-item><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref> (RER vs Age, dark phase): y = 3.390e-04x<sup>2</sup>+−1.088e-02x+9.216e-01</p></list-item></list><p>Multiple linear regression analysis was used to examine the determinants of frailty index and gait speed, including, as covariates:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Frailty index vs. age + gait velocity + BW + mean tail height + latency to fall from wire hang + glucose + HOMA-IR;</p></list-item><list-item><p>#1 + %Lean mass + subcutaneous fat/visceral fat ratio;</p></list-item><list-item><p>#1 + trabecular BMD + cortical thickness + %fat around tibia/BW + %lean around tibia/BW;</p></list-item><list-item><p>#1 + Metabolic treadmill outputs (energetic cost + mean heat + RER).</p></list-item></list><p>The models were fitted with all explanatory variables as well as models that included interactions of Age with each of the other explanatory variables. All the interactions were then tested to assess whether they added anything to the original model (with only main effects). In almost all cases, the interactions did not improve the models. A backward elimination was then performed to obtain the final regression model. There was likely not enough power to detect significant interactions; however, these findings do not mean that significant interactions do not exist, but simply that we were not able to detect any significant interactions due largely to the limited size of this dataset. All analyses were performed with R Version 4.0.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">R Development Core Team, 2020</xref>) with RStudio Version 1.3.1073.</p><p>Although dozens of different health parameters were evaluated on the same animals, these were largely the results of independent experiments to test distinct hypotheses. Therefore, no correction for multiple comparisons to the p-values was made as each experiment was considered to be a separate question. p Value ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p><p>The software MetaboAnalyst, an integrated web-based platform for comprehensive analysis of metabolomics data, versions 3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xia and Wishart, 2016</xref>) and 4.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chong et al., 2019</xref>), was utilized. Univariate (ANOVA), clustering (heat map, correlation matrix) and multivariate (partial least square discriminant; PLSD) statistical analyses were applied to the metabolite profiles (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). PLSD analysis revealed that all tissues exhibited good separation as a function of age, and a subset of 49 metabolites responsible for the separation was identified. The autoscaling function of MetaboAnalyst used to normalize the metabolomics data closely resembles the Z ratio expression and requires the detection and removal of outliers.</p><p>One-way ANOVA (Prism 7.0, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) was performed with Tukey’s multi-comparison test for the three age groups (young, adult, old) within each tissue. The statistical significance of the effect of age was evaluated for those metabolites that exhibited a significant difference in at least one of the tissues analyzed. Venn diagrams were plotted with CanvasDraw v. 5.0 for Mac (Canvas GFX, Inc, Plantation, FL).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, MD, USA.

coupled with a meta-analysis transcriptomic and metabolomics data from mice fed ad libitum or maintained chronically on calorie restriction (CR). The new analyses linking organ-specific patterns of increased abundance or depletion of metabolites with primary functional measures (energetic cost of walking, RER, and FI) are phenomenal. The interpretations of differences in small metabolite signatures in energetic cost and RER vs FI are insightful. Overall, the authors have turned a compelling submission to an exceptional manuscript that is likely to advance the field.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A cross-sectional study of functional and metabolic changes during aging through the lifespan in male mice&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors performed a cross-sectional analysis of (1) physiologic and functional tests, and (2) untargeted metabolomics in multiple organs and tissues in male C57Bl/6N mice ranging from 3-36 months of age; and (3) transcriptomic and untargeted metabolomics data from liver of 24-mo-old mice fed ad libitum or maintained chronically on calorie restriction (CR). The impact of the present study is derived from the expansive breadth and depth of assessments performed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>A major limitation is use of a single sex and inbred strain, and lack of longitudinal assessment would strengthen study. While new experiments to address these deficiencies could enhance the study, all reviewers agree that these are addressed in discussion, are not essential for publication at this stage, and would require a timeline likely beyond the scope here.</p><p>Another over-arching concerned raised by reviewers is that the study is appears to be two or three separate studies combined together in one manuscript (healthspan assessment; metabolomics; caloric restriction). On one hand, this strengthens the study by providing an substantial amount of data. On the other hand, this also highlights a weakness: the study lacks cohesion, is highly descriptive, and does not make a convincing argument for causation (or even association with health). The major revision that is needed is a more cohesive narrative that unifies these areas.</p><p>1. A major element missing is omission of analyses and discussion linking healthspan assessment (physical function, frailty index, energetics, work economy) to the omics. If metabolomics and function performed in the same mice, it would be valuable to identify small metabolite signatures associated with gait speed or frailty index, etc.</p><p>2. Rationale for including CR data must be improved as cohorts, design, and measures are not consistent (different functional assessments, RNAseq included, etc).</p><p>3. Previous cross-sectional health studies in mice should be referenced for context (e.g. DOI: 10.1007/s11357-013-9589-9, 10.18632/aging.101059).</p><p>4. Figure 1. frailty and age are collinear; if age is used as a covariate is the effect of frailty removed?</p><p>5. Figure 2.</p><p>a. Legend and figure not aligned.</p><p>b. Panels 2E,F,G require clarification as interpretation is not intuitive. It looks as if higher gait velocity is associated with higher frailty index in old animals. Please consider alternative presentation format and check alignment with legend and text.</p><p>c. If curvilinear line fitted to parameters, please reference polynomial variables in methods.</p><p>d. Panel D – please report if differences in heat production and work economy are maintained after adjusting for lean mass. Also note if values generated differ over the entire activity episode or if energetic cost was initially similar across ages and then waned in old animals over time (if the latter, could there be a role for fatigue etc)</p><p>e. Consider segregating the Figure 2J and K data by light and dark cycle in addition to 24hr avg to better visualize the diurnal changes in these variables.</p><p>6. Interpretation of data in oldest group.</p><p>a. Additional comment on the extent that changes in the oldest group are an age effect per se versus negative energy balance effect are warranted (i.e. animals are in a gradual, chronic decline characterized by loss of weight and adiposity) – examples, reduction in HOMA-IR and circulating fatty acids. This deserve some discussion and delineation as such findings appear at odds with what is often thought to define metabolic changes with aging in mammalians, including humans, but appears periodically in studies using older rodents.</p><p>b. Authors propose &quot;survivorship bias&quot; in glucose homeostasis, but this is not consistent with other physiologic systems.</p><p>7. Describe feeding, collection of 24hr food intake. Comment of role of feeding in relation to energetics and raised RER in dark phase for oldest mice.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A cross-sectional study of functional and metabolic changes during aging through the lifespan in male mice&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Jessica Tyler (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>This is a thorough characterization of phenotypes and metabolomic profiles across male C57Bl/6N mice ranging from 3-36 months coupled with a meta-analysis transcriptomic and metabolomics data from mice fed ad libitum or maintained chronically on calorie restriction (CR).</p><p>In general, this is a meritorious and comprehensive examination of phenotypic, functional, and metabolomic profiles across the lifespan in male C57BL/6J mice of anticipated interest to those in biology of aging, geroscience, and preclinical interventions testing. Though primary study design is cross-sectional and in a single mouse strain and sex, the impact of the present study is derived from (1) the expansive breadth and depth of assessments performed, (2) the pairing of functional and metabolomic profiles in a single study, and (3) the exploration of CR compared with ad libitum fed animals.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1. Reviewers requested authors evaluate the associations between key metabolites and frailty or functional measures. Please address.</p><p>2. The new Discussion section on metabolome and phenotypes is lengthy and somewhat reaching; please shorten.</p><p>3. Though rationale for including the CR data in introduction is improved, there is remaining reviewer concern that transcriptomic data in the CR study vs main study is imbalanced. Do the metabolomes of the CR animals look more like those of the adult animals in the main study?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors were responsive to reviewer suggestion; most revisions and select omissions are justified. The revised Figure 2, additional analyses (e.g. age added to frailty model; diurnal patterns in RER ), text to add rational for CR meta-analysis, and clarifying text have improved readability and interpretation of findings. Some concerns either were not or could not be fully addressed. Overall the revisions have improved the quality and merit of the manuscript. This is a nice paper that is anticipated to have high impact.</p><p>1. Reviewers requested authors evaluate the associations between 'omics' and phenotypes (e.g. frailty); this was not addressed directly. Do key metabolites (e.g. pentose phosphate, NAD+ salvage and transsulfuration; depletion of glucose, 3-HB, and glycerol in serum) explain the variability in frailty with and without adjustment for chronologic age?</p><p>2. In lieu of modeling, the authors provided a lengthy and somewhat reaching review of multi-omics and phenotypes of aging in the discussion. A detailed description may be of interest in a dedicated review, but the Discussion section would benefit from a concise presentation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>I found overall that the manuscript was much improved, and the majority of the comments were well addressed.</p><p>However, I still feel the rationale for including the CR data is not strong, and I would recommend it be removed. As there was no transcriptomic data for the main study, the CR transcriptome feels especially out of place. It would have also been helpful for the authors to show how the metabolomes changes in their cross sectional and CR studies. Do the metabolomes of the CR animals look more like those of the adult animals in the main study?</p><p>In addition, while the authors expanded on their metabolomics interpretations some, they did not correlated their metabolite values to the functional values measured.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62952.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>A major limitation is use of a single sex and inbred strain, and lack of longitudinal assessment would strengthen study.

We and others have demonstrated that genetic heterogeneity and sex can have dramatic impact on functional and phenotypic aging and the effectiveness of anti-aging interventions in mice (Mitchell et al., 2016; Gonzalez-Freire et al., 2020). The knowledge gained from the current cross-sectional study led us to the design and early implementation of the Study of Longitudinal Aging in Mice (SLAM) in which inbred C57BL/6J and outbred UM-HET3 mice of both sexes are longitudinally evaluated for functional, phenotypic and biological health, and collection of biospecimens is conducted throughout their lifespan (Palliyaguru et al., 2020). The SLAM study is at an early stage but eventually will provide the tools needed to identify and characterize phenotypic and biological predictors of mouse aging and age-associated conditions, assess whether these changes are consistent with alterations observed in human aging, and evaluate the utility of mouse models for anti-aging interventions in the clinic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another over-arching concerned raised by reviewers is that the study is appears to be two or three separate studies combined together in one manuscript (healthspan assessment; metabolomics; caloric restriction).

We have made a significant effort to offer a more cohesive narrative of the various aspects of the study and provide arguments as to why multi-organ untargeted metabolomics and transcriptomics analyses along with a nutritional intervention were carried out in order to fill a gap of knowledge on the effect of age on key phenotypic aging domains associated with health and mortality.

Rationale for including CR data must be improved as cohorts, design, and measures are not consistent (different functional assessments, RNAseq included, etc).</p></disp-quote><p>While improved knowledge of the specific phenotypic and molecular changes that occur with aging is of considerable use to the research community, this type of characterization is further enhanced by the identification of specific alterations that are linked to lifespan extension through anti-aging interventions. One of the best non-pharmacological interventions that improves health and reduces mortality is calorie restriction (CR). CR contributes to negative energy balance by promoting loss of weight gain and reduction in adiposity, HOMA-IR, and circulating fatty acids compared to mice fed <italic>ad libitum</italic>. It is with that in mind that we performed a meta-analysis of an earlier study in which transcriptomic and untargeted metabolomics data were collected from liver of 24-mo-old C57BL/6 mice fed <italic>ad libitum</italic> or maintained chronically on CR (Mitchell et al., 2016). Although different functional assessments were carried out between the two studies, one common thread was our attempt to identify pathways enriched by both genes and metabolites that can be viewed as potential biomarkers of healthy aging in middle-aged mice. We found shared molecular and biochemical signatures between these two independent studies, which speaks to the robustness of these observations and highlights the importance of having the findings from the Mitchell et al. study to complement the current work. In the revised version of the manuscript, we have provided a more direct rationale for the inclusion of CR data and worked to better integrate the findings from this section into the discussion to more clearly demonstrate how these findings contribute to the overall conclusions of this work.</p><p>The rationale reads as follows: “In order to elucidate which of the specific phenotypic and molecular/metabolomic changes that occur with aging are altered in response to pro-longevity interventions, we conducted a multi-omics meta-analysis of the liver of 24-mo-old C57BL/6 male mice fed <italic>ad libitum</italic> (AL) or maintained chronically on 20% calorie restriction (CR) from one of our previous studies (Mitchell et al., 2016). These CR-fed mice had a ∼24% lifespan extension, which led us to hypothesize that pathways enriched by both genes and metabolites might be responsible for overcoming the impact of normal aging after lifelong CR and might be viewed as potential biomarkers of healthy aging in old mice.

However, this led to unrealistic interpretations such as having a frail old mouse with higher gait velocity than a young, nonfrail animal. The problem is that in certain regions the covariates can only take on a particular set of values (not the whole range of covariates). Therefore, to create more appropriate visualizations of the models, we set up a grid of intervals for the two variables being plotted.</p><p>Using the first model as an example:</p><p>FrailtyIndex ~ Age_months + GaitVelocity_ms + Glucose + HOMAIR + Age_months:GaitVelocity_ms</p><p>For the first plot shown in Figure 2E, Age had intervals: [0,5] [5,10] [10,15] [15,20] [20,25] [25,30] [30,35] and Gait Velocity had intervals: [0.05,0.15] [0.15,0.25] [0.25,0.35]. The intervals for the legend variable (Gait Velocity) were usually chosen so that there were about the same number of (or, at least, “enough”) observations in each group.</p><table-wrap id="resptable1" position="anchor"><label>Author response table 1.</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Age group</th><th/><th/><th/><th/><th/><th/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gait group</td><td>[0,5]</td><td>[5,10]</td><td>[10,15]</td><td>[15,20]</td><td>[20,25]</td><td>[25,30]</td><td>[30,35]</td></tr><tr><td>[0.05, 0.15]</td><td><bold>0</bold></td><td><bold>0</bold></td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>7</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>[0.15, 0.25]</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>13</td><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>[0.25, 0.35]</td><td>13</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td><bold>0</bold></td><td><bold>0</bold></td><td><bold>0</bold></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>As can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="resptable1">Author response table 1</xref>, certain combinations of these two group variables contain no observations.

Consequently, predictions should not be made in these regions. Other covariates in the model, Glucose + HOMA-IR, were set to their mean value in each grid cell to obtain model predictions. The x-values in the plot are the mean (Age) for each interval and the legend value is listed as the center of the intervals for that variable (e.g., 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 for gait group).

Additional comment on the extent that changes in the oldest group are an age effect per se versus negative energy balance effect are warranted (i.e. animals are in a gradual, chronic decline characterized by loss of weight and adiposity) – examples, reduction in HOMA-IR and circulating fatty acids. This deserve some discussion and delineation as such findings appear at odds with what is often thought to define metabolic changes with aging in mammalians, including humans, but appears periodically in studies using older rodents.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer has two main assumptions: (1) Aging is a ‘gradual’ decline that can be dissociated from negative energy balance; and (2) the energetic balance is negative with age as revealed by weight loss and adiposity.</p><p>Regarding point #1, our data do not support this assumption because of the fact that the increase in energetic cost is highly nonlinear (exponential) from ∼15 months of age, thus strongly associated with aging.</p><p>For point #2, one of the reasons for the negative energy balance in the oldest mice is the higher energetic cost of movement in general, as reflected by gait speed and other indicators. If the animals spend more energy for the same amount of movement/activity, this can explain, at least in part, the reduction in adiposity and weight. It follows that at some point during aging, the energy demand of movement/activity in general should offset the intake of food further contributing to the negative energy balance. Although the life extending properties of long-term CR is also associated with an increase in negative energy balance e.g., lower body weight gain combined with a reduction in adiposity, it also triggers a panoply of healthy physiological responses leading to enhanced health and survival. In this context, we surmise that the survival of the oldest mice (31-36 months of age) was accompanied by the slowing down of phenotypic aging domains (Gonzalez-Freire et al., 2020).</p><p>Within aging research, mice have been used to identify and characterize some of the key contributors of health and survival (e.g., fasting blood glucose, adiposity, body weight), and have served as a preclinical model to test anti-aging interventions (Gonzalez-Freire et al., 2020). In a soon-to-be published study, we compared age-associated metabolic indices across three increasingly genetically complex mouse strains (C57BL/6, HET3, and Diversity Outbred) with nonhuman primates and humans. The association of age with blood glucose and the relationship between blood glucose and mortality differs considerably between mice (in either strain) and what is observed among nonhuman primates and humans (Palliyaguru, Shiroma et al., submitted). These findings clearly illustrate the potential pitfall of generalizing age-associated changes in specific metabolic trajectories and biomarkers in mice <italic>vs.</italic> humans. More work is required to better evaluate the effectiveness of anti-aging interventions in the clinic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Authors propose &quot;survivorship bias&quot; in glucose homeostasis, but this is not consistent with other physiologic systems.</p></disp-quote><p>The initial sentence has been amended to acknowledge the reviewer’s reservation. It now reads: “These results may reflect a survivorship bias of the long-living mice (Scheen, 2017), although other effects such as reduced body weight and age-associated regional distribution among fat depots could have profound metabolic implications vis-à-vis changes observed in fasting blood glucose and insulin resistance (Girard and Lafontan, 2008; Hardy et al. 2012; Tran et al., 2008; Shuster et al., 2012).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Describe feeding, collection of 24hr food intake. Comment of role of feeding in relation to energetics and raised RER in dark phase for oldest mice.</p></disp-quote><p>We surmise that the reviewer refers to data collection while the mice were temporarily single housed in the metabolic testing chamber (Figure 2I-K). Food and water level in each chamber was checked once on a daily basis at approximately 8:30 AM and the amount of food left in the cage from the previous 24 h of chamber time was collected and measured. The Methods section has been amended to provide more details on this.</p><p>With regard to the role of feeding in relation to energetics and higher RER in the dark phase for the oldest mice fed <italic>ad libitum</italic>, we assume that in order to preserve body fat for insulation, old mice must eat a significant amount of food despite their low body weight, resulting in negative energy balance. Since the food intake in proportion to body weight is increased and the energy expenditure is decreased in these animals, they are able to rely less heavily on fat oxidation and more on carbohydrate utilization for energy needs, yielding RER values close to 1.0 in the dark phase. A statement has been added to the Discussion that highlights this important concept.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1.
