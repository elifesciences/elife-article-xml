lamination of cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) and Purkinje cells. Although in the cerebellum Plexin-B2 is only expressed by proliferating CGN precursors in the outer external granule layer (oEGL), its function in CGN development is still elusive. Here, we used 3D imaging, in vivo electroporation and live-imaging techniques to study CGN development in novel cerebellum-specific <italic>Plxnb2</italic> conditional knockout mice. We show that proliferating CGNs in <italic>Plxnb2</italic> mutants not only escape the oEGL and mix with newborn postmitotic CGNs. Furthermore, motility of mitotic precursors and early postmitotic CGNs is altered. Together, this leads to the formation of ectopic patches of CGNs at the cerebellar surface and an intermingling of normally time-stamped parallel fibers in the molecular layer (ML), and aberrant arborization of Purkinje cell dendrites. There results suggest that Plexin-B2 restricts CGN motility and might have a function in cytokinesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cerebellum</kwd><kwd>semaphorins</kwd><kwd>cell migration</kwd><kwd>cytokinesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-18-IAHU-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chédotal</surname><given-names>Alain</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CS 2018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chédotal</surname><given-names>Alain</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>3D imaging and time-lapse video-microscopy show that the PlexinB2 receptor controls the tempo of granule cell differentiation and sets the pace of their migration in mouse cerebellum.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plexins are single-pass transmembrane receptors for Semaphorins regulating cell-cell interactions in normal and pathological contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pasterkamp, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tamagnone et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Worzfeld and Offermanns, 2014</xref>).

There is also evidence linking plexins to a variety of neurological diseases such as autism spectrum disorders, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s, pathological pain, and spinal cord injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Van Battum et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Binamé et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Paldy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>B-type plexins form a small subclass of plexins, with three members (Plexin-B1, -B2, and -B3) in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pasterkamp, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Worzfeld et al., 2004</xref>). B-type plexins are not only expressed by neurons but also astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, with some overlapping expression. Like all plexins, their cytoplasmic domain contains a GTPase activating protein (GAP) in which a Rho-binding domain (RBD) is embedded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oinuma et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Seiradake et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tong et al., 2007</xref>). Their C-terminal region also interacts with the PDZ (PSD-95, Dlg-1 and ZO-1) domains of two guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF), PDZeRhoGEF and leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pascoe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Perrot et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Seiradake et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Swiercz et al., 2002</xref>). Plexin dimerization is induced by Semaphorin binding and activates GAP activity, but dimerization was reported to be weaker for Plexin-B2 which might primarily act as a monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Class four transmembrane semaphorins are the main ligands for B-type plexins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pasterkamp, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Seiradake et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tamagnone et al., 1999</xref>) but Plexin-B1 and Plexin-B2 were also shown to interact with the receptor tyrosine kinases ErbB-2 and MET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Giordano et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Swiercz et al., 2004</xref>). It was also recently demonstrated that Plexin-B2 is a receptor for angiogenin, a secreted ribonuclease involved in angiogenesis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Subramanian et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yu et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Knockout mice for all B-type plexins have been generated but surprisingly, no major brain anomalies have been detected so far in <italic>Plxnb1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deng et al., 2007</xref>) and <italic>Plxnb3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Worzfeld et al., 2009</xref>) knockouts.

In contrast, <italic>Plxnb2</italic> knockout mice display severe CNS defects including exencephaly and increased apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deng et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Friedel et al., 2007</xref>), nociceptive hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Paldy et al., 2017</xref>), and fear response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Simonetti et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The most striking neurodevelopmental defect reported in <italic>Plxnb2</italic> knockout mice is a severe disorganization of the layering and foliation of the cerebellar cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deng et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Friedel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maier et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Worzfeld et al., 2014</xref>). The cerebellum contains a limited and well-characterized number of neuronal types (about 9) and its cortex has only three layers: the inner granular layer (IGL), the deepest one, contains granule cells (CGNs), the Purkinje cell layer, and most externally, the molecular layer, which hosts Purkinje cell dendrites, CGN axons and two types of interneurons, the stellate and basket cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sotelo, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Voogd, 2003</xref>). Purkinje cell axons are the sole output of the cerebellar cortex. Cerebellar neurons originate from the ventricular zone of the cerebellum primordium, except CGNs and unipolar brush cells that arise in the so-called upper rhombic lip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leto et al., 2016</xref>). In the mouse brain, cerebellar CGNs account for about half of the neurons all generated after birth from progenitors localized in a transient neuroepithelium, the external granular layer (EGL), occupying the surface of the cerebellum until about the third postnatal week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chédotal, 2010</xref>). The EGL develops embryonically as CGN precursors migrate from the rhombic lip to colonize the surface of the cerebellar anlage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miale and Sidman, 1961</xref>). Symmetrical division amplifies the pool of precursors until birth, after which they start dividing asymmetrically to generate CGNs. Post-mitotic CGNs segregate from dividing precursors and move inward splitting the EGL into two sublayers: the outer EGL (oEGL) containing proliferating cells and the inner EGL (iEGL) containing newly born CGNs. In the iEGL, CGNs migrate tangentially (parallel to the cerebellar surface), grow two processes (their presumptive axons or parallel fibers) and adopt a bipolar morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Komuro et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cajal, 1909</xref>). CGNs next extend a third process perpendicular to the surface, which attaches to Bergmann glia fibers and guide the inward radial migration of CGNs across the molecular layer to the inner granule cell layer. Strikingly, Plexin-B2 is only expressed in the oEGL and downregulated in post-mitotic CGNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Friedel et al., 2007</xref>). The phenotypic analysis of two <italic>Plxnb2</italic> complete knockout lines showed that the lack of Plexin-B2 maintains some migrating CGNs in a proliferating state which leads to a massive disorganization of cerebellar cortex layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deng et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Friedel et al., 2007</xref>). This phenotype has been also observed in a conditional knockout lacking Plexin-B2 in CGN precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Worzfeld et al., 2014</xref>). However, the exact consequences of Plexin-B2 deficiency on CGN development are unknown and were not studied at a cellular level. Here, we used a combination of 3D imaging, in vivo electroporation and live imaging to study the development of CGNs in cerebellum-specific conditional knockouts. We show that the transition from a multipolar to a bipolar morphology, the migration speed and CGN axon distribution are altered in absence of Plexin-B2.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cerebellum-specific inactivation of Plxnb2 affects foliation and lamination</title><p>In the mouse cerebellum, which matures during the first three postnatal weeks, proliferating CGN precursors in the EGL, which can be labeled using 5-Ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU), express Plexin-B2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Friedel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Worzfeld et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>).

Cell body size and shape for proliferating and tangentially migrating CGNs was similar in both genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). As implied by the EdU and Ki67/Tag1 immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>), we observed that GFP<sup>+</sup> CGN precursors intermingled with migrating bipolar CGNs in the EGL of <italic>Plxnb2</italic> mutant animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Indeed, quantification of the location of multipolar and bipolar CGNs in the outer, inner EGL or ML, shows that multipolar and bipolar CGNs in the <italic>Plxnb2</italic> mutant were spread throughout the EGL and that bipolar CGNs sometimes even resided in the ML (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Intriguingly, in <italic>Plxnb2</italic> mutants, a fraction of the bipolar and tangentially migrating GFP<sup>+</sup> CGNs, were also labeled with EdU (which only labels dividing cells), administered 2 hr before fixation. By contrast, only a very small fraction of tangentially migrating bipolar GFP<sup>+</sup> CGNs were found in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,E</xref>). When combining the EdU staining with H3P to mark acutely dividing cells, we could confirm that, although rare, some of the bipolar GFP<sup>+</sup>/EdU<sup>+</sup> were indeed proliferating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Some bipolar GFP<sup>+</sup> CGNs also co-expressed H3P and Tag1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). This suggests that in <italic>Plxnb2</italic> mutants, the CGN switch from proliferation to tangential migration is altered and that these two phases are not spatio-temporally separated anymore. To further support this hypothesis, we next analyzed GFP<sup>+</sup> CGNs 48 hr after electroporation. Again, there was a significant reduction in the proportion of CGNs that had initiated radial migration in <italic>Plxnb2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). This, together with the slight delay in M-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), suggest that <italic>Plxnb2</italic>-deficient CGNs might remain longer in both their proliferative and tangential phases.</p><p>As soon as <italic>Plxnb2</italic> mutant CGNs started radial migration, their morphology closely resembled that of control CGNs. Differences in leading process length were no longer observed, and their ascending axons in the ML were of comparable length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). At this radial stage in both control and mutant GFP<sup>+</sup> CGNs, proliferation markers were seldom observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Conversely, during radial migration, CGN cell bodies had a slightly more circular shape in <italic>Plxnb2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Moreover, in <italic>Plxnb2</italic> mutants, CGNs in the IGL acquired their stereotypical CGN morphology with a cell body of 7–8 μm in diameter bearing 3–4 claw-shaped primary dendrites, slightly faster than in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F,G</xref>).

To better visualize the spatiotemporal organization of parallel fibers in the ML, we electroporated a GFP-expressing vector at P7, followed by a td-Tomato-expression vector at P11.

As evident from the fixed cultures, the proportion of multipolar cells at the beginning of the time-lapse acquisition period (at DIV1) was twice as big in mutant explants compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

The time-lapse acquisitions of multipolar CGNs confirmed their ability to proliferate.

We never observed more than one division of a single multipolar cell in our acquisitions, and whenever visible, all daughter cells eventually adopted a bipolar shape and started migration.

Here, we used two distinct Cre lines (<italic>En1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> and <italic>Wnt1-Cre</italic>) to silence <italic>Plxnb2</italic> function in the EGL and show that they fully phenocopy the null allele but have a normal viability. This, together with similar observation made with the <italic>Atoh1cre</italic> line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Worzfeld et al., 2014</xref>) and our time-lapse studies in EGL explants, shows that <italic>Plxnb2</italic> acts cell autonomously in cerebellar CGN precursors. However, the consequence of Plexin-B2 deficiency at cellular and subcellular levels were unknown as the extremely high number and density of cerebellar CGNs, as well as their molecular and genetic homogeneity do not facilitate the in situ analysis of the evolution of their morphology during development. Here, we show that the use of a tripolar electrode is an optimal method to express transgenes in postnatal CGNs. Mosaic analysis with double markers (MDAM) can reveal the individual morphology of developing CGNs but it requires specific lines and complex genetic crosses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zong et al., 2005</xref>). Viral vectors have been used to express fluorescent proteins in developing CGNs but the delay between the infection and the transgene expression does not allow to observe the early phases of CGN development in the EGL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Park et al., 2019</xref>). The size of the transgene is also limited. In rodents, CGNs are produced postnatally and the superficial location of the EGL under the skull makes it easily accessible. Therefore, direct electroporation of plasmids into the cerebellum using tweezer electrodes has been performed to target developing CGNs ex vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Govek et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Renaud and Chédotal, 2014</xref>) or in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Konishi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Umeshima et al., 2007</xref>). Here, we have successfully adapted a triple electrode method, previously designed to target ventricular zone progenitors in the embryonic cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">dal Maschio et al., 2012</xref>), to express fluorescent proteins in a large domain of the postnatal EGL covering multiple folia. The methods have been used between birth and at least P11 with comparable outcome. Importantly, we show that it allows multiple rounds of electroporation at different time-points, which allows to study parallel fiber layering in the molecular layer without viral vectors or MADM lines.</p><p>The analysis of CGN morphology with GFP electroporation, showed that in absence of Plexin-B2, CGNs still follow the normal sequence of differentiation that in controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Komuro et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Renaud and Chédotal, 2014</xref>). They become bipolar, migrate tangentially, then tripolar and migrate radially across the molecular layer leaving behind parallel fibers. They also extend three to four dendrites undistinguishable from controls. However, it also shows that their parallel fibers are not properly layered and that some CGN axons are lost in the white matter. Interestingly, our results suggest that the mislocalized CGN axons remain unmyelinated in agreement with previous studies showing that axons have a unique profile of myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tomassy et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Plexin-B2 controls the timing of cell division in the EGL</title><p>Our results show that the size of the cerebellum is only slightly reduced in <italic>En1<sup>Cre</sup>;Plxnb2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice thereby indicating that the generation of cerebellar neurons is almost unaffected by the lack of Plexin-B2. In addition, a significant fraction of tangentially migrating CGNs are still mitotically active in the EGL indicating that CGN precursors initiated differentiation before the completion of cell division. Interestingly, we also found that in EGL explant cultures the number of mitotically active CGNs with multipolar morphology is three times higher in <italic>Plxnb2</italic> mutant. Moreover, the time taken by the daughter cells to become bipolar after cytokinesis is increased in mutants compared to controls. This suggests that <italic>Plxnb2</italic> mutant CGNs might be maintained for a longer time in a multipolar and proliferating state, and that their ability to perform their final division could be altered, although they ultimately divide and produce a close to normal number of daughter cells. These results support a role for Plexin-B2 in cell division as previously described in cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gurrapu et al., 2018</xref>) and in the developing kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Xia et al., 2015</xref>) where Plexin-B2 controls the orientation of the mitotic spindle. Interestingly, several studies suggest that plexins could control abscission, the final step of cell division, by promoting cytoskeleton disassembly at the intercellular bridge linking the two daughter cells. MICALs (molecule interacting with CasL) are oxidoreductases which regulate actin depolymerization and act directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Van Battum et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Terman et al., 2002</xref>) or indirectly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ayoob et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Orr et al., 2017</xref>) downstream of plexins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pasterkamp, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Seiradake et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, MICALs have been shown to control F-actin clearance during abscission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Frémont et al., 2017</xref>). Likewise, LARG, which associates with B-type plexins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pascoe et al., 2015</xref>) is required for abscission in Hela cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martz et al., 2013</xref>). Although hypothetical, an involvement of Plexin-B2 in cytokinesis is also supported by a recent proteomic study which identified Plexin-B2 as one of the 489 proteins constituting the midbody, the large protein complex at the center of the intercellular bridge linking dividing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Addi et al., 2020</xref>). Of note, patients with mutations in citron kinase, a key component of the abscission machinery, display a severe disorganization of cerebellar cortex including the ectopic patches of CGNs observed in <italic>Plxnb2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Together, these results suggest that Plexin-B2 might control cell division in the outer EGL, a process which is also essential for orchestrating cerebellar foliation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Legué et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Otero et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Plexin-B2 controls CGN migration</title><p>Our present study also shows that Plexin-B2 influences the migration of cerebellar CGNs. The overall distance reached by CGNs in EGL explants cultures is reduced in <italic>Plxnb</italic>2 mutants, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maier et al., 2011</xref>). Although delayed cell division probably contributes to this defect, it cannot be explained by a slower tangential migration, as our time-lapse analysis rather indicates that in <italic>Plxnb2</italic> mutants, multipolar CGNs are more motile, and cover twice as much cumulative distance than in controls. Moreover, in <italic>Plxnb2</italic> mutants, tangentially migrating bipolar CGNs alternate between forward (away from the explant) and rearward direction while control CGNs essentially migrate forward in this culture setup. The significant increase of multipolar and mitotically active CGNs, migrating around the explants suggest that CGN precursors become more motile without Plexin-B2.</p><p>Our data also provide evidence for altered CGN migration in vivo. The combination of GFP electroporation and EdU labeling shows that in <italic>Plxnb2</italic> mutants, CGNs remain for a longer time in tangential migration and that they take longer to initiate their radial migration. Moreover, tangentially migrating CGNs mix with CGN precursors and a significant fraction divides during tangential migration. These observations are in good agreement with previous studies which reported enhanced motility of <italic>Plxnb2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Roney et al., 2011</xref>) and neuroblasts in the rostral migratory stream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Saha et al., 2012</xref>). Sema4D and Plexin-B2 were also reported to function as motogens for newborn cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hirschberg et al., 2010</xref>). A recent study also linked Plexin-B2 to microglial cell motility in the injured spinal cord, albeit negatively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). Together, these results show that in many developing tissue, Plexin-B2 is a key regulator of cell migration decisions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>What could be the ligands and downstream partners mediating Plexin-B2 function in CGNs?</title><p>Our results confirm the essential and unique function of Plexin-B2 in granule cell development but the underlying molecular mechanisms remains an enigma. At least five of the Class four semaphorins (Sema4A, 4B, 4C, 4D and 4G) bind to Plexin-B2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deng et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hirschberg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maier et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tamagnone et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Xia et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yukawa et al., 2010</xref>). However, knocking down, <italic>Sema4C</italic> and <italic>Sema4G</italic>, the two class four semaphorins expressed in the developing cerebellar cortex, results in a mild phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Friedel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maier et al., 2011</xref>). This suggests that additional semaphorins could act redundantly or that other Plexin-B2 ligands could be involved. Angiogenin was recently shown to bind and signal through Plexin-B2 ligand in various cell types, but angiogenin does not activate the same pathways as class four semaphorins downstream of Plexin-B2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yu et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, and although its expression in the developing cerebellum is unknown, angiogenin is unlikely to mediate Plexin-B2 function in the EGL. In addition, a spontaneous monkey mutant of angiogenin, does not display cerebellum defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhang and Zhang, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Elegant genetic studies showed that the GAP and RBD domains of Plexin-B2, which mediate semaphorin activity, are essential for Plexin-B2 function in developing CGNs, but that the PDZ-binding domain is dispensable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Worzfeld et al., 2014</xref>). In vitro experiments suggested that the RBD domain of B-type plexins regulates their activity by interacting with Rho family small GTPases such as Ras, Rac1, Rnd1-3, and Rap1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oinuma et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rohm et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Turner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vikis et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wylie et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zanata et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>However, structural biology studies showed that B-type plexins do not interact with M-Ras/R-Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2013</xref>) and accordingly, in vivo evidence indicate that CGN developmental defects in <italic>Plxnb2</italic> mutants do not involve M-Ras/R-Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Worzfeld et al., 2014</xref>). Rac1 and to a lesser extent Rac3 are expressed in the postnatal EGL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nakamura et al., 2017</xref>), but although their simultaneous inactivation perturbs CGN development, they primarily act on neuritogenesis and tangential migration of CGN precursors in the embryo, unlike Plexin-B2. Plexin-B2 interacts preferentially with Rnd3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azzarelli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McColl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wylie et al., 2017</xref>) and in radially migrating cortical neurons, Plexin-B2 and Rnd3 have antagonistic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azzarelli et al., 2014</xref>). Although Rnd3 is expressed in EGL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ballester-Lurbe et al., 2009</xref>), the structure of the cerebellum is normal in <italic>Rnd3</italic> knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mocholí et al., 2011</xref>) (and data not shown). Interestingly, mammalian plexins have a higher GAP activity for Rap1 GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2012</xref>) and Plexin-B2/Rap1 interaction does not required Rnd3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McColl et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, Rap1 GTPases could be the main Plexin-B2 partners in developing CGNs, regulating the transition of CGN precursors from the oEGL to the iEGL. Accordingly, Rap1A/Rap1B are required for the transition of newborn cortical neurons from a multipolar to a bipolar state and their radial migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jossin and Cooper, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shah et al., 2017</xref>). In the dentate gyrus, Plexin-A2 negatively regulates Rap1 in migrating neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>). Rap1 expression has been detected in postnatal CGNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Obara et al., 2007</xref>) and therefore it will be interesting in future studies to assess Rap1A/B function in CGN development.</p><p>In conclusion, we show here that the timing of expression of Plexin-B2 in CGN precursors in the EGL, sets the pace for cell division and migration and that its downregulation is required for segregating post-mitotic CGNs from cycling precursors. The abnormal association of proliferation and migration in the <italic>Plxnb2</italic> mutant together with an excessive motility probably explain the alteration of foliation and layering observed in <italic>Plxnb2</italic> knockout cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Legué et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, the transcription factor Zeb1, is also selectively expressed in CGN precursors in the outer EGL and inhibits the CGN differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Singh et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, it inhibits the expression of Rnd1 and Rnd3 GTPases. It will be interesting to determine if <italic>Plxnb2</italic> is a target of Zeb1.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain;

Your previous study showed that cerebellum foliation and layering are severely affected in full Plexin-B2 knockout. Now with a cerebellum-specific knockout, you have used use electroporation to label and follow cells in the EGL and elsewhere, 3D imaging, tissue clearing and time-lapse video-microscopy of cerebellum explants.

Your new analysis of mitosis in bipolar GFP cells also supports the existence (but not prominence) of mitotically active and tangentially migrating CGNs in the mutant. And, while the cell cycle has not been so readily assessed in vivo, you have nicely depicted the migration of cells and the positioning of parallel fibers as a consequence of the misplacement of the granule cells. This study illuminates new criteria for cerebellar development, still being uncovered with approaches such as those utilized for your study.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Plexin-B2 controls cell cycle exit and motility of cerebellar granule neurons&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Roman J Giger (Reviewer #1); Keiko Yamamoto (Reviewer #2); David J Solecki (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Your paper showing that one mammalian Plexin, Plexin-B2, is unusual in the CNS, as its expression is restricted to neuronal precursors in the subventricular zone and egl of the cerebellum. Your previous study showed that cerebellum foliation and layering are severely affected in full Plexin-B2 knockout. Now with two cerebellum-specific ko's, you have offset the poor viability in these mice, and use electroporation to label and follow cels in the egl, by 3D imaging, tissue clearing and time-lapse video-microscopy of cerebellum explants. These approaches have produced excellent and precise views of the mutant phenotype, from which you cite effects of reducing Plexin-B2 on cell division and the maintenance of undifferentiated granule cells progenitors in their niche. You indicate that granule cell precursors are more motile, their migration is perturbed, and their differentiation delayed, resulting in a severe disorganization of granule cell positioning but and parallel fiber layering.</p><p>All three reviewers thought that your paper was of great interest, well executed in the main, and that it provides new information on Plexin-B2, but that further analyses of your data would better explain your claims. We feel that your findings related to granule neuron progenitor cell cycle length as it pertains to the timing of maturation, and related to this, the effects on migration, and on parallel fiber extension and positioning, need additional characterization. These experiments should be doable, provided you have the mice, and in through additional analyses of your existing images. Details of necessary revisions are included below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. To verify that granule cell precursors are more motile in the mutants, yet still presumably capable of proliferation, but having delayed differentiation, the following amendments are suggested:</p><p>a. The current conclusion of extended cell cycle length is the least developed of your new findings. One could interpret Tag1 positive cells that are also Ki67 positive as precocious differentiation, instead of the interpretation provided. Standard assays like assessing the balance of actively proliferating progenitors via Ki67 and EdU double labeling and an assessment of cell cycle fractions via FACS to determine DNA conent of Dapi or Hoechst labeled would address this concern.</p><p>b. In Figure 5D, you show that EdU+ and GFP+ tangentially migrating bipolar CGNs are increased in Plxnb2 mutants, and interpreted these results to suggest that a significant fraction of tangentially migrating CGNs are mitotically active in the EGL of Plxnb2 mutants (lines 476-477). Are they are truly mitotic? Because EdU was administered 2 hours before the fixation, the differentiation step to tangentially migrate GCNs after the last mitosis might be more rapid in Plxnb2 mutants than in control EGL. This could be clarified by PH3 immunohistochemistry, that would indicate mitotic cells at the time of fixation, for comparison.</p><p>c. It would be good to see Tag1+ co co-stained cells that have the EdU and GFP signal to confirm that migrating cells are also proliferative.</p><p>2. To further demonstrate effects on motility of early CGNs in the mutants: You show that cells labeled with Ki67 and Tag1 are intermingled (Figure 4B), and conclude that motility of CGN precursors and tangentially migrating CGNs is altered in Plexin-B2 mutants. However, it is not clear how these aspects are altered. For example, even though the motility is altered in Plexin-B2 mutants, nicely shown in the explants, are tangentially migrating CGNs and CGN precursors in vivo still located within EGL, or are some of them located in the ML? Are both tangentially migrating CGNs and CGN precursors, or only CGN precursors ectopically localized? With your excellent technique of in vivo electroporation, and visualizing individual cells with GFP, in addition to quantitative analysis of morphological features shown in Figure 5C-E, localization of GFP-positive tangentially migrating CGNs and CGN precursors in the oEGL, iEGL, or ML could be quantitatively analyzed. This would a better connection to the scattered parallel fibers in Plexin-B2 mutants (Figure 6A). This could be done with the images you already have in hand.</p><p>3. Further analysis of parallel fiber organization, particularly for the scattered parallel fibers across the ML (Figure 6A): It is difficult to see the connection with the phenotypes of the earlier developmental steps and to picture how this happens. One possibility would be that Plxnb2 mutant parallel fibers move in either direction, close to and far from Purkinje cell somas, during or after CGNs radially migrate and parallel fibers extend. Another possibility would be that the scattered parallel fibers are due to dispersion of tangentially migrating CGN to the oEGL and to the ML. You could address these questions by:</p><p>a. Quantitative analysis of distribution of tangentially migrating CGNs in the ML, oEGL, and iEGL.</p><p>b. Quantitative analysis or clearer images of GFP-positive parallel fibers in the ML during development: Although you mention that in P9 Plxnb2 mutants, the young GFP+ CGN 'axonal' fibers fun throughout the entire ML (lines 306-307), it is not clear whether GFP+ signals in Figure 6B are parallel fibers or ascending axons.</p><p>c. By in vivo electroporation at P11 and to observe at P13, at which time the ML is wider than at P9. This (c.) is an optional suggestion.</p><p>4. The experiments using cultured EGL are powerful for directly observing the movement of CGNs. Even though authors referred to studies showing that CGNs in culture follow developmental process resembling in-vivo CGNs (lines 318-320), additional explanation regarding how they resemble in-vivo CGNs would help to understand the results obtained from cultured. For example, do &quot;multipolar&quot; and &quot;bipolar&quot; CGNs in culture correspond to mitotic and tangentially migrating CGNs in vivo, respectively. If so, can you relate this correspondence either from the literature or by your own analyses authors, in the Methods and Results text.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60554.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

This suggests that such double positive cells exist. (Figure 5F).</p><p>We also fully agree with the reviewer that it is still difficult to conclude on a possible alteration of the cell cycle.</p><p>We could not perform the FACS analysis as we don’t have enough mice (colonies had to be downsized due to the 2 successive and ongoing lockdowns). Moreover, we don’t really know how it could be done in this neuronal system as we could not find papers using this type of procedure to study cell cycle in dissociated granule cell progenitors.</p><p>However, we have performed the requested double labeling for Ki67 and EdU on P8 cerebellum sections instead, to estimate differences in cell cycle rate. The quantification of the proportion of Edu+/Ki67+ cells did not show any statistically-significant difference between controls and <italic>En1cre;Plxnb2fl/fl</italic> mutants (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B) confirming what we had seen before with Ki67/BrDU double labelling in complete Plxnb2-/- KO (Friedel et al., J Neurosci. 2007). Therefore, it is indeed difficult at this stage to conclude about cell-cycle progression and we now say:</p><p>“Together these results suggest that there is probably no alteration of cell cycle progression in absence of Plexin-B2 although more experiments will be required to determine if the M phase is affected”.</p><p>We have also modified the title of the paper accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b.

Although H3P/EdU double-positive bipolar GFP cells were very rare in the mutant, we never observed any of them in the control brains.

Instead of 2h EDU we use the mitotic marker H3P. The panels in Figure 5F show co-labeling of GFP and H3P in proliferating CGNs.

This could be done with the images you already have in hand.</p></disp-quote><p>To assess the position of multipolar and bipolar cells in the EGL and ML we have performed an additional analysis. The EGL was divided in two equal bins (bin 1 at the surface, encompassing roughly the oEGL, bin 2 at the lower part). Cells residing in the ML were counted as such. Because cells were only slightly dipping into the ML at this time, no additional bins were made within the ML. In controls, GFP+ cells were never found anywhere lower than at the top of the ML. As expected, multipolar progenitors reside in the upper part of the EGL, and bipolar cells are mostly migrating in the lower part of the EGL, and sometimes have just entered the ML. In the case of <italic>En1cre;Plxnb2fl/fl</italic> mutant mice, multipolar and bipolar cells are distributed more evenly over both the upper and lower bins of the EGL. Although many bipolar cells dip into the ML, multipolar GFP+ progenitors were never found there. The graph and example panels of the EGL bins can be found in Figure 5—figure supplement 1C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Quantitative analysis of distribution of tangentially migrating CGNs in the ML, oEGL, and iEGL.</p></disp-quote><p>We think this is similar to Comment 2 above and have added this quantification which confirm the “invasion” of the inner EGL and ML by tangentially migrating CGNs in Plxnb2 mutants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Quantitative analysis or clearer images of GFP-positive parallel fibers in the ML during development: Although you mention that in P9 Plxnb2 mutants, the young GFP+ CGN 'axonal' fibers fun throughout the entire ML (lines 306-307), it is not clear whether GFP+ signals in Figure 6B are parallel fibers or ascending axons.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested by this reviewer we are now providing on Figure 6B additional images which better illustrate this phenotype. We have chosen to present coronal sections as parallel fibers elongate along the medio-lateral axis (the initial sagittal panels have been moved to Figure 6-figure supplement 1). Therefore, parallel fiber morphology and location are easier to assess. In controls, the characteristic T-shape morphology normally emerged at the border between the iEGL and ML, close to the upper tips of the developing Purkinje cell dendrites. As development progresses, the dendritic tips grow past this point, and parallel fibers grow further in both directions of the ‘T’. By contrast, in Plxnb2 mutant, the T-shape, despite being as straight as in controls, is sometimes formed in the middle of the EGL or even lower in the ML, and the fibers extend in random positions within the ML, EGL or even past Purkinje cell bodies. Furthermore, Therefore, young (maximum 48h-old) parallel fibers enter the molecular layer and overlap with Purkinje dendrites in the <italic>Plxnb2</italic> mutant, whereas in controls, parallel fibers start extending in the iEGL above the tip of the Purkinje cell dendrites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. By in vivo electroporation at P11 and to observe at P13, at which time the ML is wider than at P9. This (c.) is an optional suggestion.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed the requested experiment. Mice were electroporated at P11 and their cerebellum was collected at P13 to see how the growing parallel fibers occupy the developing ML in the <italic>En1cre;Plxnb2</italic> mutant. Indeed, normally the new fibers lie just above the distal tips Purkinje dendrites, at P13. However, in the mutant we see that fibers run across the Purkinje dendrites. The tips of Purkinje dendrites sometimes reach far in the EGL. These new data are presented in Figure 6C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

This is supported by our data and earlier work such as Yacubova and Komuro, 2002 (now cited in the revised text). This has been corrected in the revised text.</p></body></sub-article></article>
