cytosol. Multiple molecular machines, chaperones, proteases, and other enzymes facilitate the translocation and assembly of OMPs. These helpers usually associate, often transiently, forming large protein assemblies. They are not well understood due to experimental challenges in capturing and characterizing protein-protein interactions (PPIs), especially transient ones. Using AF2Complex, we introduce a high-throughput, deep learning pipeline to identify PPIs within the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cell envelope and apply it to several proteins from an OMP biogenesis pathway. Among the top confident hits obtained from screening ~1500 envelope proteins, we find not only expected interactions but also unexpected ones with profound implications. Subsequently, we predict atomic structures for these protein complexes. These structures, typically of high confidence, explain experimental observations and lead to mechanistic hypotheses for how a chaperone assists a nascent, precursor OMP emerging from a translocon, how another chaperone prevents it from aggregating and docks to a β-barrel assembly port, and how a protease performs quality control. This work presents a general strategy for investigating biological pathways by using structural insights gained from deep learning-based predictions.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>All living cells are contained within a fatty cell membrane that allows water and only certain other molecules to pass through with ease. Bacteria only consist of a single cell, making their membrane the only interface with the surrounding environment. Gram-negative bacteria – which include <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, a bacterium found in the gut of all humans – have an extra layer of protection, the ‘outer membrane’. Proteins in this membrane are called ‘outer membrane proteins’ or OMPs and allow nutrients to enter the cell. But OMPs, which are made inside the cell, need to be transported to the outer membrane and folded correctly before they can perform their role. This multistep process, which involves interactions between many different proteins, is not fully understood.</p><p>The journey of an OMP from the center of the cell where it is made to the outer membrane is complicated. First, the OMP needs to pass through the cell’s inner membrane. To do this, it must interact with ‘channel proteins’ in the inner membrane that feed the OMP into the space between the two membranes, known as the bacterial envelope. This step requires the OMP to be unfolded<bold>.</bold> Once in the bacterial envelope the OMP interacts with proteins that help it fold correctly and integrate into the outer membrane.</p><p>The interactions between proteins in the bacterial envelope are short-lived, making them difficult to study using lab-based experiments. An alternative approach is predicting a protein’s structure from its amino acid sequence which is a difficult computational problem to solve. However, in 2020 developers behind the AlphaFold2, a deep learning program, were able to use a set of equations organized in a ‘neural network’ that can ‘learn’ from a library of known protein structures to predict unknown structures with high accuracy. Gao et al. used AF2Complex, a tool based AlphaFold2, tailored to predicting interactions between proteins, to investigate what interactions OMPs could be involved with on their way to the outer membrane.</p><p>With the help of a supercomputer at the Oakridge National Laboratory, Gao et al. screened nearly 1,500 <italic>E. coli</italic> proteins within the bacterial envelope to see how they might interact with OMPs. The screen identified previously unknown interactions between proteins that suggest that the formation of the bacterial outer membrane and the integration of proteins into it involve protein complexes and molecular mechanisms that have not yet been characterized. Additionally, the screen also identified interactions that had been previously described, confirming that the deep learning approach can correctly capture real interactions.</p><p>Overall, Gao et al.’s work inspires new hypotheses about the mechanisms through which OMPs are transported to the outer membrane, although further work will be needed to confirm the roles of protein interactions predicted by the computational model experimentally. Furthermore, the ability to design experiments based on computational predictions is exciting. If confirmed, the new protein interactions could help scientists better understand OMP transport, which is essential for bacterial biology. In the future, this could lead to the discovery of new targets for antibiotic drugs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>protein-protein interaction</kwd><kwd>protein complex structure prediction</kwd><kwd>virtual screening</kwd><kwd>deep learning</kwd><kwd>outer membrane protein biogenesis</kwd><kwd>translocon</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000015</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE-SC0021303</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Skolnick</surname><given-names>Jeffrey</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM118039</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Skolnick</surname><given-names>Jeffrey</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006192</institution-id><institution>Advanced Scientific Computing Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Mu</given-names></name><name><surname>Skolnick</surname><given-names>Jeffrey</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Advanced Computing Environment (PACE)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Skolnick</surname><given-names>Jeffrey</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An example of a deep learning-based strategy to discover novel protein-protein interactions and predict their complex structures at high accuracy.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A structural component unique to gram-negative bacteria is the outer membrane (OM), composed of lipopolysaccharides and phospholipids in an asymmetric bilayer with embedded lipoproteins and transmembrane β-barrel proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Silhavy et al., 2010</xref>). The latter group, OM proteins (OMPs), play vital functional roles, e.g., exchanging small molecules with the environment through their transmembrane β-barrel porins. OMPs are synthesized by cytosolic ribosomes, translocated across the inner membrane (IM), and finally delivered to the OM via the OMP biogenesis pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rollauer et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The translocation and folding of OMPs involve many proteins, including essential and auxiliary ones that form multiple complexes in cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Geyter et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Troman and Collinson, 2021</xref>). Two core complexes are the SecYEG translocon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rapoport et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Oswald et al., 2021</xref>) and the β-barrel assembly machine (BAM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tomasek and Kahne, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Noinaj et al., 2017</xref>). SecYEG, a hetero-trimer composed of the secretion channel SecY and two additional subunits SecE and SecG, is anchored to the IM and is responsible for moving most cell envelope proteins across the IM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rapoport et al., 2017</xref>). Periplasmic and OM proteins enter the channel in SecY via the SecA-dependent translocation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Oswald et al., 2021</xref>). They possess signal peptides recognized by SecA, which inserts a protein substrate into SecY and powers it through the channel using energy from ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collinson, 2019</xref>). The signal peptide, located at the N-terminus of a substrate, contains a hydrophobic segment that folds into a transmembrane α-helix once it exits the lateral gate of SecY. To release the substrate from the IM, a type I signal peptidase (SPase I) cleaves the signal peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Paetzel, 2014</xref>). At this point, a periplasmic protein has reached its destination, but an OMP, escorted by the chaperones SurA or Skp, continues its journey toward BAM harbored in the OM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sklar et al., 2007</xref>). Five subunits constitute BAM, of which BamA plays the major role in folding a β-barrel and releasing the matured product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tomasek and Kahne, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Noinaj et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>There are many open questions concerning the OMP biogenesis pathway. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, the SecYEG translocon recruits additional proteins, such as SecA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2016</xref>), SecDF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tsukazaki, 2018</xref>), YidC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kumazaki et al., 2014</xref>), and PpiD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antonoaea et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sachelaru et al., 2014</xref>), to form a variety of supercomplexes in different scenarios. We do not know the identities of all members of these supercomplexes, let alone their atomic structures. SurA plays a major role in chaperoning a nascent OMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sklar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Behrens-Kneip, 2010</xref>). How does it handle and deliver a substrate to BAM? Likewise, BAM recruits additional helpers, e.g., BepA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Narita et al., 2013</xref>), but how do they work together?</p><p>To answer these questions experimentally is challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Babu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maddalo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvira et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carlson et al., 2019</xref>). Recently, deep learning approaches have made tremendous progress in predicting the structures of protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Humphreys et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evans et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bryant et al., 2022</xref>). Here, we use one such method to address the above questions. The centerpiece of our approach is AF2Complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao et al., 2022b</xref>), built on AlphaFold2 (AF2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evans et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>). Using AF2Complex, we combine virtual screening for protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and supercomplex modeling and apply this strategy to several important proteins in the OMP biogenesis pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Virtual screening for PPIs in the <italic>E. coli</italic> envelopome</title><p>A workflow employing AF2Complex was implemented to search for interacting proteins within the <italic>E. coli</italic> cell envelope. We refer to these proteins collectively as the ‘envelopome,’ which consists of ~1450 proteins, or ~35% of the complete <italic>E. coli</italic> proteome. Given a query envelope protein sequence, screening is conducted against every envelope protein, including the query itself to test if it forms a homo-oligomer. For each pair of input proteins, AF2Complex predicts their structures simultaneously as a putative dimer and evaluates the interface score (iScore) of the resulting structural models to decide if they interact. The value of iScore ranges between 0 and 1. Interacting protein pairs typically return a positive iScore, whereas non-interacting proteins usually return 0 or low iScores. Typically, 20 final structures are produced in multiple independent runs using 10 different AF2 deep learning models. The highest iScore among all predicted structures of a target is used for ranking the entire envelopome.</p><p>According to previous benchmarks on a set of ~7000 putatively non-interacting protein pairs from <italic>E. coli</italic>, minimum iScore thresholds of 0.40, 0.50, and 0.70 yield false positive rates of 1.2, 0.4, and &lt;0.01%, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao et al., 2022b</xref>). With respect to the capability of identifying and modeling true PPIs, on a set of 440 heterodimeric complexes whose experimental structures have been recently determined and were not used for AF2 model training, AF2Complex recalls 81, 74, and 34% of these benchmark targets at the same three iScore thresholds, respectively, and yields medium- or high-quality complex structures for 84, 87, and 93% in the top ranked models of these positively identified targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao et al., 2022b</xref>). Hence, we consider predictions of medium, high, and very high confidence, progressively, at iScore cutoffs of 0.4, 0.5, and 0.7. Given a query protein, the top iScores of all scanned envelope proteins are then sorted to identify potential interacting partners with the query protein. Note that our computational predictions are about physical interactions between a pair of proteins subjected to screening, not about their biological roles even if they are predicted to interact physically. Moreover, the predicted physical interactions may not be relevant in a cellular environment due to various factors not considered in modeling, e.g., competition from other proteins with stronger binding affinities, post-translational modifications, etc. Thus, it is possible that many PPIs predicted by this pipeline do not necessarily have biological relevance. Nevertheless, since cognate PPIs required by their functions are more likely to be detected than randomly selected proteins, biologically interesting PPIs are enriched at the top of the screening results ranked by iScore. Thus, the screening procedure may provide valuable even critical clues for subsequent investigation. In this study, assisted by existing experimental evidence, we select from high confidence computational predictions those most likely to have significant biological implications and then predict the structures of larger complexes if more than two proteins are involved according to our predictions or based on literature information. The interactions that we ignored are either of unknown biological significance, physically interacting but biologically irrelevant, or simply false positives.</p><p>As a first test, we applied our PPI pipeline to the chaperones PpiD and YfgM because strong experimental evidence indicates that these two proteins belong to a super SecYEG translocon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antonoaea et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sachelaru et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maddalo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dartigalongue and Raina, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fürst et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jauss et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Matern et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Götzke et al., 2014</xref>), yet their structures remain elusive. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> shows the screening results of PpiD and YfgM against the envelopome. Reassuringly, these two proteins stand out at the very top of the predicted PPI rankings among the <italic>E. coli</italic> envelopome with iScores of ~0.73 in each case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Furthermore, PpiD hits SecY at the 12th rank (iScore = 0.43), corroborating previous experimental studies that SecY is an interacting partner of PpiD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antonoaea et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sachelaru et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fürst et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>E. coli</italic> super-translocon SecYEG/PpiD/YfgM.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Computational screening for protein-protein interaction partners of PpiD and YfgM within the <italic>E. coli</italic> envelopome, respectively.

The membrane anchoring helix is linked to a domain consisting of two discontinuous segments (residues 40–189, 581–623) from the terminal regions. Within this domain, two α-helices (residues 167–189, 581–609) are held by the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain of YfgM, which inserts itself into the IM via a single hydrophobic α-helix. Structurally, the PpiD/YfgM interface resembles a pair of ‘chopsticks’ (two PpiD helices) grasped by a ‘palm’ (the TPR domain). Their PPI interactions are quite extensive, including ~100 inter-protein residue-residue contacts involving both hydrophobic and polar partners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b and c</xref>), which may explain the strong binding affinity observed in experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maddalo et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the channel that connects the cytosol to the periplasm, SecY features a lateral gate embedded in the IM.

In vivo photo cross-linking studies found numerous sites at the lateral gate probed by PpiD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sachelaru et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jauss et al., 2019</xref>). Such cross-linking suggests direct physical contacts between the two proteins because the covalent linkers formed upon UV light radiation are very short, lying within 4 Å. Because PpiD has only a single transmembrane α-helix, a logical speculation is that the α-helix interacts with the lateral gate of SecY. Indeed, our structure reveals that PpiD guards the lateral gate of SecY with its α-helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b and d</xref>), which occupies the same position as a signal peptide leaving the SecY gate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In superposition with a SecY crystal structure co-crystallized with an OmpA signal peptide, the C<sub>α</sub> RMSD of SecY is 2.4 Å between the X-ray and computed structures. Thus, SecY in our model is open to accommodate the α-helix of PpiD, in comparison to an electron microscopy (EM) structure of <italic>E. coli</italic> SecY in which the gate is closed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Our model further elucidates why SecY residues located in transmembrane helices (TM2/3/7/8) can be cross-linked to PpiD, because they are located at the PpiD/SecY interface. For example, strong cross-linking signals have been found for five SecY residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sachelaru et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jauss et al., 2019</xref>), Ile91<sub>SecY</sub>, Leu94<sub>SecY</sub>, Leu127<sub>SecY</sub>, Phe130<sub>SecY</sub>, and Phe286<sub>SecY</sub>, and all make direct physical contacts (&lt;4.5 Å) with PpiD in our structural model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Moreover, we identified direct contacts between a hydrophobic pocket of PpiD and SecG, explaining the experimentally observed crosslinking of Phe122<sub>PpiD</sub> to SecG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fürst et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). The interaction assigns SecG a functional role in coordinating with PpiD. Overall, the predicted structure rationalizes the results of several experimental studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The chaperone PpiD interacts with the disulfide isomerase DsbA</title><p>Among the top hits for PPI partners of PpiD, a fascinating discovery is DsbA, ranked third with a high confidence iScore of 0.55. DsbA donates its disulfide bond to a substrate in need; thus, it is critical to the folding of a nascent protein as it leaves the SecY channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kadokura and Beckwith, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goemans et al., 2014</xref>). How does DsbA coordinate with the SecY translocon? The predicted interaction immediately provides an answer, i.e., by associating with the chaperone PpiD that is a part of a super translocon complex (SecYEG/PpiD/YfgM/DsbA). In a predicted structure of this supercomplex (iScore = 0.71, mean pLDDT = 78, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), PpiD uses its ‘hand’ to grip DsbA, as observed in the top model of the pair because their interactions do not interfere with other members of the translocon. The hand of PpiD is a parvulin-like domain, but it is devoid of the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) activity canonical to parvulin, due to the mutation of a critical histidine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Weininger et al., 2010</xref>). As our structure reveals, the catalytically inactive pocket of the PPIase domain is hydrophobic and buries the aromatic sidechain of Phe148<sub>DsbA</sub>, which becomes a hot-spot residue surrounded by six hydrophobic residues of PpiD upon complexation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). In addition, three pairs of salt-bridges are formed around the hydrophobic contacts, contributing to specific recognition. Notably, the catalytic cysteines of DsbA, Cys49<sub>DsbA</sub> and Cys52<sub>DsbA</sub>, are on the opposite side to the protein-protein interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>); thus, they are open to engage a substrate as it emerges from the SecY channel.

The modeled complex suggests that PpiD dissociation is realized by pushing a substrate out of the SecY gate, e.g., the signal peptide, which then repels the PpiD helix bound to the gate.

How does SurA chaperone a substrate such as OmpA? OmpA consists of a β-barrel (N-terminal) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pautsch and Schulz, 1998</xref>) and a periplasmic (C-terminal) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ishida et al., 2014</xref>). To model the OmpA polypeptide, we reduced the size of multiple sequence alignments provided to AF2Complex and removed all its structural templates. Consequently, we generated a monomeric OmpA structure with a non-native, collapsed N-terminal domain and a native-like periplasmic domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the presence of SurA, the periplasmic domain maintains the same fold, but remarkably, the non-native β-barrel region completely unravels and wraps around SurA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b–c</xref>). This is consistent with small angle neutron scattering data that suggests an expanded and unfolded OmpA substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marx et al., 2020</xref>). The SurA/OmpA dimer is not stable as different wrapping configurations were observed in two separate structure models, leading to very low iScores of ~0.05, reflecting uncertainty due to the possibility of many conformations. Nevertheless, the SurA/OmpA models appear physical and provide a hypothetical basis for how the chaperone SurA could prevent a polypeptide chain from aggregating and present an unfolded polypeptide to BAM for its final assembly. Intriguingly, in both predicted complex structures, the OmpA polypeptide passes through a SurA crevice at its core domain, where Tyr126<sub>SurA</sub> consistently attracts a substrate aromatic residue with π-π interactions. This may be one mechanism by which SurA recognizes OMPs, which are enriched with aromatic residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hennecke et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, the disordered β-barrel region has few interactions with SurA could explain how the system avoids high-energy expenditure for β-barrel release.

Powered by SecA, a precursor OmpA polypeptide (orange line) first passes through the SecYEG translocon in complex with PpiD and YfgM. PpiD, held in place by YfgM, senses the translocating substrate via its N-terminal α-helix bound to the lateral gate of SecY and temporarily dissociates from the translocon upon receiving the substrate OmpA. Protein disulfide isomerase DsbA is recruited by PpiD and promotes formation of a disulfide bond between two cysteine residues (yellow spheres) of OmpA. Meanwhile, peptidase LepB fills the vacancy left by SecYEG and cleaves the transmembrane signal peptide from OmpA, which is then handed over to chaperone SurA. At this point, the periplasmic domain of OmpA is folded, but the unfolded β-barrel region wraps around SurA, which carries OmpA to BAM. Lastly, SurA docks to POTRA1, the N-terminal domain of BamA, where the β-barrel domain of OmpA is folded and released from the lateral gate of BamA. If this folding and assembly process are stalled for some reason, metalloprotease BepA senses the failure with its flexible lid and cleans up by cleaving a stuck substrate.

The predicted supercomplex of SecYEG/PpiD/YfgM/DsbA provides a compelling answer for three reasons: first, the transient residence of DsbA on PpiD at the translocon dramatically improves its efficiency versus a random search in a crowded periplasm. Second, it predicts a function for the PPIase domain of PpiD that mysteriously lacks the PPIase function. Third, since PpiD is anchored to the IM, it can keep DsbA close to DsbB, an IM protein that recycles DsbA. Notably, two other <italic>E. coli</italic> chaperones, SurA and FkpA, possess two PPIase domains each, and AF2Complex predicts that DsbA interacts with FkpA (iScore = 0.47 versus 0.55 for PpiD) but not with SurA (iScore = 0.03).</p><p>Interestingly, the AF2 neural networks can model a partially unfolded polypeptide accompanied by chaperones, even though AF2 was trained on folded proteins. We attained structural models that appear to be at least partially physical. One example is the model of PpiD/YfgM/LepB/proOmpA, in which proOmpA is posed for cleavage by peptidase LepB. The cleavage alanine of OmpA is ~4 Å away from the catalytic triad of LepB. Considering that only apo or inhibitor bound structures of LepB are available, this computed model implies that AF2 has learned physical representations. More intriguing examples are the models of SurA/OmpA, where the periplasmic domain of OmpA is folded, but the β-barrel domain is completely unfolded and loosely wrapped around SurA. The predicted structures echo the NMR structures of an unfolded polypeptide bound to SecB, a cytosolic chaperone involved in the early stage of the SecA-dependent translocation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2016</xref>). Despite the low confidence due to weak interactions, the predicted structures delineate a picture for how SurA prevents OmpA from aggregating. Moreover, since it transports OmpA with a relatively small number of intermolecular contacts, the free energy required to dissociate OmpA from SurA is small. Notwithstanding these considerations, we caution that artifacts likely exist in these predicted structural models.</p><p>These results reinforce the notion that deep learning is a promising way to explore the conformational ensemble of proteins and to uncover the molecular mechanisms of biosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao et al., 2022b</xref>). The combination of advanced AF2 deep learning models, an effective PPI ranking metric, and a workflow optimized for large-scale screening generates illuminating structures of protein complexes. In the presented examples, we focused on those with obvious biological relevance according to the literature. There are of course other confident PPI predictions that were not described here. While some are promiscuous interactions or physically possible but biologically irrelevant, or simply false, there are likely functional interactions yet to be explored. More generally, these results are an example of a deep learning-based strategy that helps to elucidate mechanistic aspects of complex biochemical pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>E. coli</italic> cell envelopome</title><p>The proteome for <italic>E. coli</italic> strain K12 MG1655, consisting of 4400 protein sequences, was retrieved from UniProt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wu et al., 2006</xref>) in March 2022 (Proteome ID <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=proteome%3Aup000000625&amp;sort=score">UP000000625</ext-link>). Then, the subcellular location of each protein was parsed to collect all known and predicted cell envelope proteins. To be conservative, we included all proteins whose primary subcellular location is not the cytosol, yielding 1466 proteins defined as the envelopome. The set contains all proteins located in the IM, periplasm, OM, and extracellular surface, and some cytosolic proteins located primarily at the periphery of the periplasmic IM, e.g., SecA. For AF2Complex modeling, we removed 11 sequences that contain at least one non-standard amino acid.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>AF2Complex</title><p>An updated version of AF2Complex was built upon AlphaFold version 2.2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evans et al., 2021</xref>). AF2Complex supports three different set of deep learning neural network models provided with AF2, i.e., the original models for monomer prediction (AF version 2.0.1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>) and two set of models for multimer prediction (version 2.1.0 and version 2.2.0; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evans et al., 2021</xref>). Numerous changes were made; we list three major ones here. First, the iScore metric was introduced to rank the confidence of a predicted complex model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao et al., 2022b</xref>). The iScore metric was derived from the predicted alignment errors that give an estimated distance for interface residue <italic>j</italic> from its position in the experimental structure, as viewed from a local frame of residue interface residue <italic>i</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>). To better estimate confidence, the contribution of each interface residue to the iScore is calculated using local frames not located within the same protein chain, i.e., residue <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> belonging to different chains. Second, the data pipeline for generating input features was split from the neural network inference. This allows rapid assembly of input features for individual proteins of a putative complex from pre-generated input features of the full proteome. Third, five options for multiple sequence alignment (MSA) pairing are provided: no pairing, all paired, cyclic, linear, and arbitrary pairing. The last three options are experimental, and we only employed the first two MSA pairing modes in this work. All structural models, either of a monomer or a multimer, were predicted by AF2Complex using either the ‘<italic>monomer_ptm</italic>’ deep learning models without any MSA pairing or the ‘<italic>multimer_v2</italic>’ models with all MSA pairing; the latter only used for structure prediction of complexes. The input features of all monomers were derived using standard sequence libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">The Uniprot Consortium, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mitchell et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tunyasuvunakool et al., 2021</xref>) and a version of the Protein Data Bank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berman et al., 2000</xref>) released in November 2021. The confidence of an output structure is evaluated using three different metrics: the iScore for protein interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao et al., 2022b</xref>), the predicted TM-score for global structure of a monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang and Skolnick, 2004</xref>), and the pLDDT score for local domain structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mariani et al., 2013</xref>). According to AF2, a mean pLDDT score higher than 70 indicates high confidence in a predicted structure when evaluated on individual domain(s).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Envelopome PPI screening</title><p>We adapted a workflow for proteome-scale monomeric structure prediction with AF2 implemented on the Summit supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gao et al., 2022a</xref>). The workflow was applied to four query proteins: PpiD, YfgM, SurA, and BamA. Given a query sequence and an envelopome protein sequence, AF2Complex assembles the pre-generated monomeric input features and then feeds the composite features to the AF2 neural network models for inference. 10 different neural network models are used as mentioned above, and each deep learning model is invoked twice with two different random seeds and up to eight recycles. This procedure typically gives 20 final structural models per target for ranking, and the top ranked model by iScore is retained. Although the ‘<italic>multimer_v2</italic>’ set of models greatly reduces unphysical clashes in predicted structures compared to structures predicted by the original set of multimer deep learning models, there is still a small chance of generating severe clashes, which could yield an artifactually high iScore. We filter out these structures by applying a minimum interface clash indicator of 0.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao et al., 2022b</xref>). We did not apply model relaxation to these predicted structures because most are not actual protein complexes; as such, it is not worth expending the extra computing time. To avoid memory overflow, we limited the input MSA depth to 5000 for each monomer and allowed a maximum of four structural templates per monomer. A maximum of 1600 amino acids was imposed on the total size of each complex target. This limitation slightly reduced the total number proteins in the envelopome for screening, typically to ~1450 for the four proteins studied. Because about 30% of envelopome proteins have a signal peptide that is absent in their mature chains, only mature chains were used for screening. This is readily realized with AF2Complex because it provides an option to crop arbitrary segments of a monomer input feature during feature assembly. The residue ranges of the mature chains were obtained from the UniProt knowledgebase.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Modeling the OmpA polypeptide</title><p>It was necessary to model OmpA as a substrate of PpiD or SurA. OmpA was chosen mainly because it is a model OMP for studying the OMP biogenesis pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reusch, 2012</xref>). Many experimental data exist for validation. To minimize potential ‘memory’ effects due to large MSAs or structural templates, we reduced the number of sequences in the MSAs and removed all structural templates in the input features of OmpA. We tested MSA depths of 1, 10, 20, 50, and 100 to predict a structural model of proOmpA in complex with SecYEG. The goal is to generate a structural model that mimics the crystal structure of SecYEG translocating a proOmpA polypeptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Our tests found that an MSA depth below 50 can yield a model structure of an unfolded OmpA peptide through the channel of SecY, when used with either ‘<italic>model_1_ptm</italic>’ or ‘<italic>model_3_ptm</italic>’ of all AF2 neural network models. In this study, we used an MSA depth of 20 and the 2 AF2 models to predict structural models involving OmpA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Computational resources</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> envelopome PPI screening was performed on the Summit supercomputer, typically using 923 nodes for several hours of wall clock time.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, overseen by José Faraldo-Gómez as the Senior Editor. Two of the reviewers have agreed to reveal their identity, namely Nir Ben-Tal (Reviewer #1); Arne Elofsson (Reviewer #3).</p><p>As you will see below, the reviewers conclude the manuscript is not suitable for publication for <italic>eLife</italic> in its current form, but they make specific recommendations to resolve their concerns. I recognize some of these revisions are substantial – nevertheless, I encourage you to take the time required to address these concerns convincingly and then submit a revised version.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Gao et al., combine a very elegant virtual screening method (AF2Complex) based on Α Fold with known crystal structures to predict the structure of super-protein complexes in the <italic>E. coli</italic> cell envelope that play important roles in the biogenesis of outer membrane proteins (OMPs). The authors do an excellent job of validating their methodology. Their predicted structures both explain a considerable amount of biochemical data that has appeared in the literature (e.g., the crosslinking of PpiD to SecY and SurA to BamA) and provide compelling explanations for unresolved conceptual issues (e.g., how DsbA is recruited to the Sec machinery to form disulfide bonds as proteins are translocated into the periplasm). With one exception (see comment 4 below), the predicted structures also provide potentially important insights into the function of the assembly factors. In essence, this work describes an impressive example of the power of AI that should be of interest not only to investigators who study OMP biogenesis but also to the broader research community. I should also note that the manuscript is clearly and concisely written for a general audience.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) Lines 83-86 and Figures 1a, 4a and 6a: The authors selected predicted structures of known biological relevance for further study, but they do not comment on high confidence predictions of supercomplex structures of unknown biological significance. How can they distinguish predicted structures that have potential biological significance from those that simply represent noise/false positives? This is an important issue that requires further explanation, especially because the authors provide false-positive rates on lines 76/77.</p><p>2) In the paper by Alvira et al., (ref. 21) the authors argue that <italic>E. coli</italic> produce a &quot;holotranslocon&quot; in which SecDF and BAM interact across the periplasm. I was surprised that AF2Complex did not detect this interaction with a high confidence score. Does AF2Complex have a significant rate of &quot;false negatives&quot;? The authors should discuss this issue.</p><p>3) Lines 181-183 and Figure 4c: As suggested by many different studies, the C-terminal β signal of OmpA must be accessible to bind to the first β strand of BamA at a relatively early stage of assembly. Would the last β strand be accessible if the β barrel is wrapped around SurA? The authors should comment on this issue.</p><p>4) Lines 246-249: While the structural model of the BAM-BepA supercomplex shown in Figure 6 is intriguing, the idea that the protease activity of BepA is controlled by the probing of substrate β barrels as they bud from the BamA β barrel does not appear to be consistent with the literature. The authors propose that β barrels that are stalled within BamA permit the opening of the BepA lid and activation of the protease. This suggests that BepA degrades β barrels that are stalled at an early stage of assembly, but not at later stages. The work of Soltes, et al., (ref. 48), however, shows that BepA degrades an LptD mutant that has formed a nearly complete barrel (and that likely protrudes from the BamA barrel) while another protease (YcaL) degrades a second LptD mutant that engages BAM at an earlier stage of assembly. I realize that the stages of OMP assembly are currently rather vague, but the authors should discuss the work of Soltes et al., and state that it imposes a possible caveat on their model.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) What is the advantage of running both monomer and multimer versions of AF2? Does it provide an advantage? In our benchmarks, the multimer is slightly better and roughly doubles the computational cost. Also, did you run 2 multimer versions (version 2.1.0 should not be used it makes bad predictions often)?</p><p>2) Why is not the top-hit for surA (oppA) discussed? Or any other of the high-scoring pairs?</p><p>3) The authors claim that an iScore of 0.4 is related to a 1.2% FPR. This would mean that yfgM would have roughly 100 interactions. Is this correct? If so, this would need to be discussed (and possibly proven experimentally). Here only discussion with PPID at rank 12 is discussed. Should it not be more likely that the other 11 higher-ranked models interact? Why are these ignored?</p><p>4) Would it not be computationally more efficient to use MMseqs2 to make the MSAs?</p><p>5) Why is it only tested on 4 proteins? I think it should be computationally possible to run it on many more (in particular as you already have the MSAs). At a minimum, all complexes shown in Figure 7 should be run through the pipeline to ensure these can be modelled.</p><p>6) How would the pipeline handle stoichiometry?</p><p>7) WHat happens if a set of the high-scoring pairwise interactions are fed into alphafold-multimer (which can handle up ~5000 residues).

As a result, we must review other sources of evidence and select ones that likely have biological relevance according to existing literature.

While we were able to obtain high confidence models for some complexes found in previous experimental studies, in the case of BamA/SecDF, unfortunately we did not observe a confident computational model, despite multiple run efforts. In retrospect, it is unclear to us whether or not direct interactions between BamA and SecDF alone would be feasible in a normal periplasmic space, which is about 20 nm wide from the inner membrane to outer membrane. Having said that, it is entirely possible that our computational method missed the target as a false negative, as the reviewer speculated. In this revision, we have added statistics of the recall (1 – false negative rate), from line 77,</p><p>“With respect to the capability of identifying and modeling true protein-protein interactions, on a set of 440 heterodimeric complexes whose experimental structures have been recently determined and were not used for AF2 model training, AF2Complex recalls 81%, 74% and 34% of these benchmark targets at the same three iScore thresholds, respectively, and yields medium- or high-quality complex structures for 84%, 87%, and 93% in the top ranked model of these positively identified targets [23].”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Lines 181-183 and Figure 4c: As suggested by many different studies, the C-terminal β signal of OmpA must be accessible to bind to the first β strand of BamA at a relatively early stage of assembly.

We have verified that the so-called β-signal residues are accessible in our OmpA/SurA complex models.</p><p>We marked the two referred to residues in the revised Figure 4 and added the following sentence in line 211,</p><p>“Of note, two key ‘β-signal’ residues [47], Y189 and F191 of OmpA, do not make direct physical contact with SurA in both models.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Lines 246-249: While the structural model of the BAM-BepA supercomplex shown in Figure 6 is intriguing, the idea that the protease activity of BepA is controlled by the probing of substrate β barrels as they bud from the BamA β barrel does not appear to be consistent with the literature.

This suggests that BepA degrades β barrels that are stalled at an early stage of assembly, but not at later stages.

I realize that the stages of OMP assembly are currently rather vague, but the authors should discuss the work of Soltes et al., and state that it imposes a possible caveat on their model.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out these experimental observations that we had inadvertently overlooked. Our hypothesis is a quite simplified reasoning based on computational models and some experimental studies that we were aware of at the time we wrote the original version of this paper. We have now revised the hypothesis and added an alternative possibility on line 271,</p><p>“It is also possible that the lid of BepA somehow detects an abnormal β-barrel popping out of BamA, as suggested in an experimental study that shows BepA degrades a LptD mutant stalled at a late stage of β-barrel folding [51].”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) What is the advantage of running both monomer and multimer versions of AF2?

Also, did you run 2 multimer versions (version 2.1.0 should not be used it makes bad predictions often)?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the multimer_v2 deep learning models by DeepMind (AF version 2.1.0) provide improved accuracy in predicted models, and we employed this version of multimer models instead of the multimer_v1 version. However, in our benchmarks, we found that the original monomer deep learning models (AF version 2.0.1) make good predictions not seen with the multimer models in some cases. For example, as we mentioned in the Methods (line 382), only certain monomer deep learning models could generate models of an unfolded OmpA peptide through the channel of SecY mimicking the crystal structure (Ref. 12). For this reason, we included the monomer models in our procedure as well. This practice slightly improves the coverage of our approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Why is not the top-hit for surA (oppA) discussed?

Should it not be more likely that the other 11 higher-ranked models interact? Why are these ignored?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these good questions, which we have addressed in R1.2 as they were raised similarly by the other two reviewers. We again stress that our selections from predicted interacting protein pairs were based on biological relevance that we were aware of. With respect to the false positive rate, it was based on benchmarking a set of putatively non-interacting protein pairs in <italic>E. coli</italic> (Ref 23). It is possible that some of these false positives with high scores could physically interact if the proteins were actually present at the same subcellular location, but in the cell they cannot as they are located in different cellular compartments, one main criterion employed for selecting these control negatives. Obviously, such interacting pairs are unlikely to be biologically relevant. Moreover, even though we screened about 1,500 envelope proteins, the numbers of confident hits are generally low, e.g., 9 for BamA, 12 for PpiD, and it is clear that at least some of these hits are not false positives. The query protein with highest number of confident hits is YfgM, which has 98 hits above an iScore of 0.4. They are all attracted to the plam-like surface of YfgM (Figure 1c), the same surface where PpiD is predicted to make extensive contacts with YfgM. Thus, PpiD likely forms a very stable complex with YfgM that other hits may not be able to compete with. Therefore, the biological relevance of other YfgM hits is unclear. We skipped all hits that we could not convince ourselves by some molecular hypothesis that they are relevant to the OMP biogenesis pathway.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Would it not be computationally more efficient to use MMseqs2 to make the MSAs?</p></disp-quote><p>We cannot comment on the efficiency of MMseqs2 because we have not benchmarked its performance. However, as mentioned in the Methods, we have implemented a workflow in AF2Complex such that it can re-use the input features including the MSAs of monomers for multimer predictions. This means that one needs to generate MSAs only once for each protein in a proteome and reassemble them quickly for predicting arbitrary combinations of multimers. This eliminates the need for feature derivation for each multimer target as is required in DeepMind’s workflow, which is far less efficient, especially for large-scale screening. We have shared the input features of the full <italic>E. coli</italic> proteome at Zenodo (see Data availability), and we hope that they could be helpful for modeling other <italic>E. coli</italic> protein complexes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Why is it only tested on 4 proteins? I think it should be computationally possible to run it on many more (in particular as you already have the MSAs). At a minimum, all complexes shown in Figure 7 should be run through the pipeline to ensure these can be modelled.</p></disp-quote><p>All complexes presented in Figure 7 actually resulted from the modeling efforts of this study, though parts of these complexes were experimentally determined in previous studies. We wish that we could conduct all-against-all PPI screening of <italic>E. coli</italic>., but we could not afford the huge computational costs to do such a study. Another limiting factor is the brain power required for analyzing the results, as we have neither the resources nor the expertise to analyze hundreds or thousands of PPI predictions by ourselves. The main purpose of the study is to demonstrate the usefulness of a new approach to the study of biological pathways through what we believe biologically relevant and important examples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) How would the pipeline handle stoichiometry?</p></disp-quote><p>The pipeline requires a user to specify a stoichiometry of a complex target. In this study, we rely on the literature to determine the stoichiometry. If such information is not available, one could run some trials at different stoichiometries and select the stoichiometry that gives the most confident model. While this is possible in some cases, it is in general a challenging issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) WHat happens if a set of the high-scoring pairwise interactions are fed into alphafold-multimer (which can handle up ~5000 residues). Can the large complexes be modelled?</p></disp-quote><p>As we show for the BAM/BepA complex, it is possible to make confident models for large complexes that are made of multiple high-scoring pairwise interactions. However, it is also our experience that large scale modeling is challenging when the total size of the complex is over 3000 residues. This is very much a frontier research topic that requires further exploration.</p></body></sub-article></article>
