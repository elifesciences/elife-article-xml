(LUBAC) is the only known ubiquitin ligase for linear/Met1-linked ubiquitin chain formation. One of the LUBAC components, heme-oxidized IRP2 ubiquitin ligase 1 (HOIL-1L), was recently shown to catalyse oxyester bond formation between ubiquitin and some substrates. However, oxyester bond formation in the context of LUBAC has not been directly observed. Here, we present the first 3D reconstruction of human LUBAC obtained by electron microscopy and report its generation of heterotypic ubiquitin chains containing linear linkages with oxyester-linked branches. We found that this event depends on HOIL-1L catalytic activity. By cross-linking mass spectrometry showing proximity between the catalytic RING-in-between-RING (RBR) domains, a coordinated ubiquitin relay mechanism between the HOIL-1-interacting protein (HOIP) and HOIL-1L ligases is suggested. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, these heterotypic chains were induced by TNF, which is reduced in cells expressing an HOIL-1L catalytic inactive mutant. In conclusion, we demonstrate that LUBAC assembles heterotypic ubiquitin chains by the concerted action of HOIP and HOIL-1L.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>E3 ubiquitin ligase</kwd><kwd>HOIL-1L</kwd><kwd>oxyester-bond linkage</kwd><kwd>RBR</kwd><kwd>ubiquitin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP 18K19959</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ikeda</surname><given-names>Fumiyo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP 21H04777</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ikeda</surname><given-names>Fumiyo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP 21H00288</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ikeda</surname><given-names>Fumiyo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001822</institution-id><institution>Austrian Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ikeda</surname><given-names>Fumiyo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001003</institution-id><institution>Boehringer Ingelheim</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Clausen</surname><given-names>Tim</given-names></name><name><surname>Haselbach</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>FFG</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>852936</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Clausen</surname><given-names>Tim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PHOTOMASS 819593</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kukura</surname><given-names>Philipp</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The E3 ubiquitin ligase complex linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) forms a branched chain on linear ubiquitin chains depending on the RING-in-between-RING-type E3 ligase heme-oxidized IRP2 ubiquitin ligase 1 (HOIL-1L).</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Posttranslational modification of substrates with ubiquitin (ubiquitination) regulates a wide variety of biological functions. Ubiquitin forms chains via its seven internal Lys residues (Lys6, Lys11, Lys27, Lys29, Lys33, Lys48, and Lys63) through an isopeptide bond, or via Met1 through a peptide bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Komander and Rape, 2012</xref>). The different ubiquitin chain types contribute to determine the fate of the substrate and biological outcomes regulated.</p><p>For substrate modification, ubiquitin can be conjugated through isopeptide bonds to Lys residues, thioester bonds formed with the side chain of Cys residues, or oxyester bonds formed with side chains of Ser and Thr residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carvalho et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McClellan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McDowell and Philpott, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vosper et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Williams et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, some bacteria have evolved a ubiquitination mechanism, carried out by proteins of the SidE effector family, that results in phosphoribosyl-linked ubiquitin conjugated to Ser residues of the protein substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bhogaraju et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Qiu et al., 2016</xref>). Ubiquitin also contains seven Thr (Thr7, Thr9, Thr12, Thr14, Thr22, Thr55, and Thr66) and three Ser (Ser20, Ser57, and Ser65) residues that could potentially act as sites for chain formation. Recently, ubiquitin polymerization through Ser or Thr residues by a mammalian RING-in-between-RING (RBR)-type ubiquitin ligase, heme-oxidized IRP2 ubiquitin ligase 1 (HOIL-1L), has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kelsall et al., 2019</xref>). The E3 ligase MYCBP2 was also shown to conjugate the ubiquitin to Thr residues through an ester bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pao et al., 2018</xref>). Besides these examples, all other known instances of ubiquitin-associatedÂ (UBA) oxyester bonds are found in the linkage between the ubiquitin and a non-ubiquitin substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McClellan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McDowell and Philpott, 2013</xref>).</p><p>HOIL-1L is a component of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC). LUBAC is thus far the only known E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that assembles linear/Met1-linked ubiquitin chains. LUBAC consists of two RBR-containing proteins: HOIL-1-interacting protein (HOIP) and HOIL-1L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kirisako et al., 2006</xref>). LUBAC additionally contains the accessory protein Shank-associated RH domain-interacting protein (SHARPIN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gerlach et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ikeda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tokunaga et al., 2011</xref>). HOIP has a catalytic centre in its RING2 domain responsible for assembly of linear ubiquitin chains, while HOIL-1L and SHARPIN have been recognized as accessory proteins for the process. It is more recent that HOIL-1L has been shown to catalyse ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stieglitz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Smit et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tatematsu et al., 2008</xref>). Linear ubiquitin chains and the three LUBAC components are essential components in biological functions including immune signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gerlach et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ikeda, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rahighi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rittinger and Ikeda, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tokunaga et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Iwai and Tokunaga, 2009</xref>), development in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fujita et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Peltzer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Peltzer et al., 2014</xref>), protein quality control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">van Well et al., 2019</xref>), Wnt signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rivkin et al., 2013</xref>), and xenophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Noad et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">van Wijk et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, it is important to understand how LUBAC assembles ubiquitin chains at the molecular level including how the catalytic activity of HOIL-1L contributes to the process.</p><p>In a recent study, Kelsall et al. demonstrated that recombinant HOIL-1L can polymerize ubiquitin via oxyester bonds on Ser and Thr. They also showed that a HOIL-1L C458S mutation in which a predicted ubiquitin-loading site is mutated results in reduction of oxyester-linked ubiquitination signals in cells suggesting their dependency on HOIL-1L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kelsall et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, Fuseya et al. recently demonstrated that HOIL-1L catalytic activity negatively regulates the TNF signalling cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fuseya et al., 2020</xref>). However, understanding the precise mechanisms regulating this atypical form of ubiquitination and whether HOIL-1L as a part of LUBAC mediates this biochemical activity remains largely unresolved.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reconstitution and 3D reconstruction of LUBAC</title><p>We first set out to purify high-quality recombinant LUBAC for structural characterization and biochemical investigation. Purifications of the three LUBAC components expressed individually in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> consistently gave low yields and isolated proteins were co-purified with several contaminants; this was particularly severe in purifications of full-length HOIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Given that HOIP is destabilized in cells lacking SHARPIN or HOIL-1L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gerlach et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ikeda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tokunaga et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fujita et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Peltzer et al., 2018</xref>), we conjectured that HOIP could be unstable when recombinantly expressed in the absence of its interaction partners. To this end, we expressed HOIP (119.8 kDa), N-terminally His-tagged HOIL-1L (59.2 kDa), and N-terminally Strep(II)-tagged SHARPIN (43.0 kDa) in insect cells in order to co-purify the LUBAC holoenzyme by tandem affinity chromatography. Using this co-expression strategy, we were able to isolate three proteins of the expected molecular weights with no major contaminants as determined by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Furthermore, we verified the identities of these proteins as the three LUBAC components by immunoblotting indicating the successful isolation of recombinant LUBAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Some truncation products of HOIP were detected by immunoblotting; however, these were not visible by Coomassie-based staining, indicating that they are not a prominent contaminant.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Co-expression and purification of linear ubiquitin chain assembly complexÂ (LUBAC) yields high-quality protein.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) SDS-PAGE analysis of individually purified LUBAC components.

The elution profile of the complex contained two peaks eluting at 0.942 ml (peak I) and 0.972 ml (peak II) as well as one minor peak eluting at 1.158 ml (peak III). All of these peaks eluted earlier than the 158 kDa molecular weight standard, which eluted at 1.246 ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Given that the monomeric mass of purified LUBAC is expected to be 222 kDa, the elution profile suggests that these peaks all correspond to assembled LUBAC in at least three populations of different oligomeric states. However, while peaks I and II contained all LUBAC components, peak III contained predominantly HOIL-1L and SHARPIN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>, lower panel) indicating the presence of partially assembled complexes. To assess if this was a carryover from the purification or if the complex disassembles over time, we collected a fraction from peak II and reapplied it to the same column for a second isocratic elution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). The elution profile from this second tandem run contained almost exclusively peaks I and II, which correspond to assembled LUBAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>, lower panel). Conversely, peak III was almost entirely absent from the elution profile indicating that the complex is not prone to dissociation after purification.</p><p>To screen the homogeneity of the sample, we imaged fractions from peak II by negative staining electron microscopy. Micrographs show a monodisperse distribution of particles of similar size, which could be sorted into 2D class averages showing a distinct elongated dumbbell structure thus verifying the homogeneity of the sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>).

These were HOIL-1L K174, SHARPIN K318, and HOIP K454/458. The high degree of cross-linking formed by these residues suggests thatÂ they are located on flexible regions. This notion is supported by the cleavage of HOIL-1L in the vicinity of K174 by MALT1, which suggests thatÂ the residue is located on a protease-accessible structure such as a flexible loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elton et al., 2016</xref>).

Interestingly, we observed cross-links between the HOIL-1L RING1 and HOIP RING1/LDD domains, as well as between the HOIL-1L RING2 and the HOIP RING1/IBR/RING2/LDD domains, which suggest that the two enzymes have spatially connected catalytic activities. Additionally, HOIL-1L intra-protein cross-links were formed between its NZF domain and its RING1/IBR/RING2 domains, which could implicate the HOIL-1L NZF domain of unknown function in the catalytic action of HOIL-1L. In conclusion, the catalytic RBR domains of HOIP and HOIL1L seem to be close to each other, as well as the NZF and RBR regions of HOIL-1L.

One possible explanation is that mixing of the three components is sufficient to activate HOIP but may not suffice for LUBAC to be adequately assembled. To determine if the mixed components could assemble the trimeric LUBAC, we carried out MP measurements of the three components mixed at an equimolar ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Our measurements showed a single prominent population of molecules with an average mass of 104 kDa. However, we were unable to detect any populations with the expected masses of 222 or 444 kDa corresponding to assembled and dimerized LUBAC. The absence of these populations indicates that mixing HOIP, HOIL-1L, and SHARPIN does not suffice to assemble LUBAC. We therefore conclude that the absence of bands in reactions carried out using mixed LUBAC components is a result of improper LUBAC assembly preventing the full catalytic activity of the complex.</p><p>Ubiquitin chains containing different linkages resolve at different apparent molecular masses by SDS-PAGE separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Emmerich and Cohen, 2015</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that the two bands in each pair contained different ubiquitin linkages. To examine the presence of different Lys-linked bonds in the heterotypic chains, we carried out in vitro ubiquitination assays using different ubiquitin Lys to Arg (KR) mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Heterotypic ubiquitin chain assembly was observed with all the tested mutants, K6R, K11R, K27R, K29R, K33R, K48R, and K63R. To rule out the possibility that mutation of a single Lys could be compensated by ubiquitination of a separate Lys residue, we also performed in vitro ubiquitination assay using ubiquitin lacking all Lys residues (K<sub>0</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Despite reduced reaction efficiency, the K<sub>0</sub> mutant could also be used by LUBAC to generate the heterotypic ubiquitin chains. At present we cannot account for the apparent difference in the ratio between branched tri- and tetra-ubiquitin chains observed across different experiments, and which is particularly pronounced with the K<sub>0</sub> substrate. However, we speculate that these differences arise from varied reaction efficiencies. We propose this is the case given that branched tri-ubiquitin is the more prominent species when K<sub>0</sub> ubiquitin is used. With this mutant we also observe a drastic loss of overall reaction efficiency with respect to reactions containing wild-typeÂ (WT) ubiquitin. Nevertheless, both branched chains could be detected to some extent across all replicates of all experiments.</p><p>To further analyse the linkage types of ubiquitin chains, we performed ubiquitin chain restriction (UbiCRest) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hospenthal et al., 2015</xref>) on the ubiquitin chains generated by LUBAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). UbiCRest using linkage-specific deubiquitinasesÂ (DUBs) allows detection of specific ubiquitin chains by loss of signals when the linkage is targeted. Interestingly, the additional signals from ubiquitin chains assembled by LUBAC disappeared by treatment with Cezanne, a DUB specific for the Lys11Â linkage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bremm et al., 2010</xref>); or vOTU, a DUB targeting LysÂ linkages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akutsu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>; upper red arrow).

Restriction with OTULIN degraded the majority of the signal from ubiquitin chains leaving short di- and tri-ubiquitin polymers.

These results indicate that LUBAC assembles exclusively OTULIN-sensitive linear and hydroxylamine-sensitive oxyester linkages between ubiquitin moieties.</p><p>In our UbiCRest analysis we observed cleavage of the oxyester-linked branches from the LUBAC-assembled poly-ubiquitin chains by Cezanne and vOTU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

Both Cezanne and vOTU could fully degrade these short oxy-ester ubiquitin polymers, which is in agreement with a recent study reporting the ester-directed activity of the two DUBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">De Cesare et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Ubiquitin contains seven Thr residues, three Ser residues, and one Tyr residue, which could theoretically act as sites for ester bond formation. Therefore, we aimed to identify the positions of the ester-linked branches using mass spectrometry by searching for GG dipeptides covalently attached through oxyester bonds to Ser, Thr, or Tyr, as was previously done by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kelsall et al., 2019</xref>. To this end, we analysed ubiquitin chains formed by LUBAC by LC-MS. MS/MS spectra of GG-conjugated dipeptides at residues Thr12 and Thr55 of ubiquitin were detected from these samples, in which there was complete coverage of the ubiquitin amino acid sequence 1â73 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Structural analysis shows that these two residues are positioned at opposite sides of ubiquitin and neither of them is located in proximity to Met1 or the C-terminal Gly76 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>; PDB:1UBI). This suggests that branches could potentially exist on both sites of a single ubiquitin molecule located at any position of a linear ubiquitin chain without creating any steric hindrances.</p><p>To further investigate if Thr12 and Thr55 are the sites of oxyester bond formation, we performed in vitro ubiquitination assays using ubiquitin mutated at Thr12 and/or Thr55 to Val (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Individual or concomitant mutation of Thr12 and Thr55 (Ub T<sub>12</sub>V, Ub T<sub>55</sub>V, or Ub T<sub>12/55</sub>V, respectively) did not result in loss of chain branching. These results suggest that linear chain branching is not a strictly site-specific event. We next probed the existence of the hybrid chains in cells. It has recently been reported that these chains are formed on IRAK1, IRAK2, and Myd88 in response to activation of TLR signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kelsall et al., 2019</xref>). Given that LUBAC is involved in the TNFÂ signalling cascade, we examined the induction of these heterotypic ubiquitin chains in TNF-treated cells. Linear ubiquitin chains were enriched by GST pull-down using the NEMO-UBAN and zinc finger domains (NEMO<sub>250-412</sub>) from total cell extracts of TNF stimulated mouse embryonic fibroblastsÂ (MEFs). In this set-up, the GST-NEMO-UBAN was employed as a ubiquitin-binding matrix to enrich linear-linked chains and not as a substrate for LUBAC. The enriched poly-ubiquitin chains were then tested for hydroxylamine sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). TNF stimulation increased formation of linear ubiquitin chains detected by immunoblotting using an antibody specific for linear ubiquitin chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>: PD top panel lane 7). These chains proved sensitive to hydroxylamine treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>: PD top panel lane 8). In contrast, the signals from the overall population of ubiquitin chains are unchanged by either TNF stimulation or hydroxylamine treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>: PD bottom panel lanes 5â8). Together these results suggest that ubiquitin chains containing both linear linkages and hydroxylamine-sensitive ester bonds are produced in cells in response to TNF stimulation.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>M1-linked/linear ubiquitin chains generated in cells and conjugated to NEMO in vitro are sensitive to hydroxylamine treatment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Hydroxylamine treatment of M1 linkage-containing poly-ubiquitin chains assembled in response to TNF in wild-typeÂ (WT) mouse embryonic fibroblastsÂ (MEFs).

However, the majority of the signal from the ubiquitinated NEMO was unperturbed.

Therefore, we examined the possibility that HOIP assembles a linear ubiquitin chain, which is subsequently branched with ester bonds by HOIL-1L. To this end, we purified different LUBAC containing catalytically inactive HOIP (HOIP C885A), HOIL-1L (HOIL-1L C460A), or both HOIP C885A and HOIL-1L C460A. Mutation of these residues did not impair the purification of LUBAC, and all variants of the complex could be isolated at similar yields and to similar degrees of purity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>). In line with our hypothesis, LUBAC containing HOIL-1L C460A generated chains with linear linkages, yet the double band indicative of heterotypic chain assembly was absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>; lane 6 upper red arrow). These observations indicate that HOIL-1L is responsible for the formation of the ester-linked branches. Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Smit et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fuseya et al., 2020</xref>), HOIP assembled longer linear ubiquitin chains in the absence of HOIL-1L catalytic activity and did so more rapidly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>: lanes 2 and 6). Conversely, LUBAC containing HOIP C885A was incapable of polymerizing ubiquitin altogether (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>; lanes 4 and 8) as expected.

To test this possibility, we purified LUBAC containing a mutant in which critical residues for linear ubiquitin chain recognition are mutated (HOIL-1L T203A,R210A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). In agreement with our hypothesis, chain branching activity by LUBAC was partially impaired by the HOIL-1L T203A,R210A mutant when compared to the WT or HOIL-1L C460A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Interestingly, LUBAC with HOIL-1L T203A,R210A assembled ubiquitin chains more efficiently than WT LUBAC but less efficiently than HOIL-1L C460 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).</p><p>These data collectively show that HOIP assembles linear ubiquitin chains, which are subsequently branched by HOIL-1L in a process involving its NZF domain and which requires the catalytic activity of HOIP.</p><p>In summary, we identified that LUBAC assembles heterotypic linear/ester-linked poly-ubiquitin chains in vitro and in cells in response to TNF stimulation.

We cannot determine the exact positions of HOIP, HOIL-1L, and SHARPIN in the map at the current resolution; however, our map is the first structure encompassing the LUBAC holoenzyme. We also made other novel structural observations that LUBAC exists as monomers and dimers of a ternary complex with 1:1:1 stoichiometry between HOIP, HOIL-1L, and SHARPIN. This is in agreement with observations made in recent structural work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fujita et al., 2018</xref>). We also present new data addressing the question of LUBAC oligomerization. Early gel filtration analysis of cell-derived LUBAC suggested formation of a large or oligomeric complex with a molecular mass of over 600 kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kirisako et al., 2006</xref>). However, our MP measurements using recombinant LUBAC show that this is not the case in vitro. This could be due to LUBAC in cells interacting with cellular components such as SPATA2 and CYLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wagner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schlicher et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kupka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Elliott et al., 2016</xref>). This discrepancy would also be accounted for by a particle of non-globular structure, which would elute earlier than expected from a gel filtration column (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Siegel and Monty, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Erickson, 2009</xref>). Accordingly, the 3D map we obtained from negative stain electron micrographs shows a particle of elongated structure.</p><p>We propose a catalytic Cys relay mechanism in LUBAC: HOIP receives ubiquitin from the E2 and uses this ubiquitin to assemble linear chains or transfers it toÂ HOIL-1L, which then branches the chains assisted by its NZF domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). One recent example of such a mechanism is the E3 ligase MYCBP2, which also conjugates the ubiquitin to Thr residues through an ester bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pao et al., 2018</xref>). A relay mechanism would require spatial proximity between the catalytic sites of the two ligases. Our XL-MS data show that this is indeed the case based on cross-linking between the RBR domains of HOIP and HOIL-1L. We also detected proximity between the HOIL-1L NZF and the RBR domains of both HOIP and HOIL-1L, which could contribute to the branching of the linearly linked ubiquitin dimer. Collectively, these observations suggest that LUBAC has a single catalytic centre containing the RBR domains of HOIP and HOIL-1L.</p><p>HOIP and HOIL-1L have distinct catalytic behaviour. HOIP exclusively targets Met1 of a ubiquitin moiety for polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Swatek et al., 2019</xref>); in contrast, HOIL-1L seems to have more flexibility with target sites in forming ester bonds. We identified Thr12 and Thr55 in ubiquitin as target sites by mass spectrometry; yet individual and concomitant mutation of these residues did not abolish heterotypic chain assembly suggesting existence of secondary sites. Indeed, in ubiquitin, Thr12 is structurally located in the vicinity of Thr7, Thr9, and Thr14, whereas Thr55 is located near Thr22, Ser20, and Ser57. A recent study identified Thr12, Ser20, and Thr22, but not Thr55, as target sites by isolated HOIL-1L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kelsall et al., 2019</xref>). These differences may depend on HOIL-1L as an isolated protein, or HOIL-1L as a part of LUBAC where HOIP and SHARPIN contribute to site selection.</p><p>We speculate that HOIP and SHARPIN contribute to the catalytic action of HOIL-1L based on the observed loss of the HOIL-1L auto-ubiquitination signal in cells derived from SHARPIN-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gerlach et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ikeda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tokunaga et al., 2011</xref>) and HOIP knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Peltzer et al., 2014</xref>). This effect is identical in cells derived from HOIL-1L C458S mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kelsall et al., 2019</xref>), as well as HOIL-1L C458A mice from this study. Investigating the precise mechanism how the non-catalytic LUBAC component SHARPIN contributes to the HOIL-1L catalytic activity may shed light on its role in the complex.</p><p>Our analysis of chain branching on substrate-conjugated ubiquitin chains suggests that the oxyester branch points of the chain are located distally from the substrate. Treatment of NEMO in vitro ubiquitination reactions resulted in some change of signal, but the overall levels of ubiquitinated substrate were unperturbed, indicating that linear ubiquitin chains are not conjugated onto NEMO via oxyester bonds. This is consistent with a previous report showing that loss of HOIL-1L catalytic activity impairs but does not prevent conjugation of linear ubiquitin chains to the LUBAC substrates IRAK1, IRAK2, and MyD88 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kelsall et al., 2019</xref>). Our results would also suggest that HOIL-1L is not responsible for priming substrates with a mono-ubiquitin that is then extended into an linear ubiquitin chain by HOIP. However, based on our data, we cannot exclude the possibility that HOIL-1L also has Lys-directed ubiquitinÂ conjugation capabilities as has been suggested by prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Smit et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fuseya et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Our data suggests that linear ubiquitin chains are heavily branched in cells. Hydroxylamine treatment results in a near complete loss of signal from linear ubiquitin chains in cells, which suggests that linear chains are heavily branched. In contrast, our in vitro data suggests that only small populations of linear chains are successfully branched. One explanation could be that there are other factors present in cells that assist HOIL-1L in the process of chain branching and which remain hitherto unidentified.</p><p>DUBs targeting ester linkages remain to be identified. Our data show that a fragment of Cezanne, a DUB specific for Lys11 linkages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bremm et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mevissen et al., 2016</xref>), can cleave the ester-linked branches in vitro. Cezanne is a known negative regulator of NF-ÎºB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Enesa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Evans et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evans et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Luong et al., 2013</xref>). It is therefore tempting to speculate that it has esterase activity and targets the LUBAC-assembled chains during its counteraction of NF-ÎºB activation. However, further work will be necessary to identify potential esterase activity in DUBs including Cezanne.</p><p>Understanding the biological functions of the heterotypic chains is a very important aspect. A recent study using HOIL-1L ÎRBR mice and HOIL-1L knock-in cell of ligase inactive mutant showed that HOIL-1L ligase activity regulates TNF-induced signalling and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fuseya et al., 2020</xref>). In line with their observations, we also observed that HOIL-1L Cys458 mutant as a part of LUBAC increased the linear ubiquitination signal in comparison to the WT control. They also showed that RIPK1, a known substrate of LUBAC, in the TNF complex is linearly ubiquitinated in at increased levels. These data indicate that the HOIL-1L catalytic activity negatively regulates ubiquitination of the substrates in cells, which also supports our observations in vitro. In cells, they could not detect oxyesterÂ linkage on HOIL-1L but on HOIP in WT cells, which is abolished in HOIL-1L catalytic inactive cells. Since they detect remaining HOIL-1L mono-ubiquitination signal even when all the Lys residues in HOIL-1L are mutated to Arg, it is probable that there are heterogeneous population of ubiquitination sites in HOIL-1L. Furthermore, this could be due to that oxyester bond being biochemically less stable and being a minor fraction in cells. Since HOIL-1L inactive mutant is no longer ubiquitinated in vitro, upregulated ubiquitination of HOIL-1L mutant in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fuseya et al., 2020</xref>) may depend on interacting partners existing in cells.</p><p>To further understand the roles of these ester-linked branches in biology, it will be important to dissect biochemical characteristics such as their interaction mode with known linear ubiquitin chain-specific binding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fennell et al., 2018</xref>), existence of DUBs, and other possible ligases that catalyse their formation in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids</title><p>pGEX-6p1-<italic>Hs</italic>OTULIN, pGEX-6p1-<italic>Hs</italic>HOIP, pGEX-6p1-<italic>Hs</italic>HOIL-1L, and pGEX-6p1-<italic>Hs</italic>SHARPIN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fennell et al., 2019</xref>), as well as pGEX-4t1-mNEMO<sub>250-412</sub>Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wagner et al., 2008</xref> have been previously reported. pGEX-6p1-<italic>Hs</italic>UbcH7 was kindly provided by Katrin Rittinger (Francis Crick Institute, UK). pOPIN-K-<italic>Hs</italic>OTUD1<sub>287-481</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mevissen et al., 2013</xref>), pOPIN-K-<italic>Hs</italic>OTUD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mevissen et al., 2013</xref>), pOPIN-K-<italic>Hs</italic>OTUD3<sub>52-209</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mevissen et al., 2013</xref>), pOPIN-K-<italic>Hs</italic>Cezanne<sub>53-446</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wagner et al., 2008</xref>), pOPIN-K-<italic>Hs</italic>TRABID<sub>245-697</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Licchesi et al., 2011</xref>), pOPIN-K-<italic>Hs</italic>OTUB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mevissen et al., 2013</xref>), pOPIN-K-vOTU<sub>1-183</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akutsu et al., 2011</xref>), and pOPIN-S-<italic>Hs</italic>Usp21<sub>196-565</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ye et al., 2011</xref>) were kind gifts from David Komander.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Cynthia Wolberger as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Gabe Lander (Scripps) (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The editors have judged that your manuscript is of significant interest, yet some additional experiments are required before publication, as described. We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript by Carvajal et al. provides novel insights into HOIL-1L's activity within the LUBAC complex in synthesizing heterotypic, branched ubiquitin chains through oxyester-bond formation. The authors successfully produced and isolated recombinant LUBAC, containing full length HOIL-1L, HOIP, and SHARPIN, and although the intrinsic flexibility prevented a higher-resolution 3D-structure determination, negative-stain EM combined with crosslinking mass spec revealed important new information about the architecture of this complex. Based on the observed spatial proximity of HOIL-1L's and HOIP's catalytic RBR domains, the authors propose an intriguing ubiquitin relay mechanism between these E3 ligases in LUBAC.</p><p>The reviewers agreed that this work represents an important contribution to the field, as it corroborates and extends previous findings of HOIL-1L's non-lysine esterification activity. However, the advance and impact could be improved by some additional experiments to further strengthen the mechanistic conclusions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Although the authors present the first 3D reconstruction of LUBAC, the contribution of this low resolution model to this study seems questionable. The 2D analyses demonstrate the substantial flexibility of the complex, and projections generated from the 3D structure only marginally match the selected projections shown in Figure 2. If EM analyses are meant to support the biochemical reconstitution of the active LUBAC complex, then the 2D class averages are more than sufficient. Based on the 2D data and the fact that there are many class averages that are not recapitulated by 2D projections (and vice versa), it is highly unlikely that the purified complex is consistent with a single 3D structure. If the authors were able to use negative stain of complexes, where individual subunits contained identifiable tags (e.g. GFP, MBP), to localize subunits and corroborate the crosslink-MS, perhaps a 3D model would be appropriate, but as it stands, the utility of the 3D density seems moot.</p><p>2) The circus plot in Figure 3B to represent the crosslinking-MS data could be improved by &quot;weighing&quot; the quantity or confidence of observed crosslinks, such that attention is drawn to the most important and obvious linkages, for instance by using different line widths, color shades, or the presentation of multiple plots at distinct cutoff values.</p><p>Furthermore, the pair-wise domain representation in Figure 3C-E gives the impression that a single domain (or even single residue) is found crosslinking to almost every part of the opposing protein (a straight line in the plot which contains many dots) in several instances. This could similarly benefit from thresholding or a more cautious description. Can it truly be inferred that the RBR's and NZF's of HOIP and HOIL-1L are forming a catalytic center, when grey linker-regions are over-represented in the plot?</p><p>The authors should discuss the promiscuous crosslinking of linker regions and whether this may indicate high dynamics that could be related to the difficulties in solving better-resolution structures. Also, it may also be visually more appealing to represent non-domain grey regions by a thinner line than known domains in all representations of Figures 3A-3E and 6D.</p><p>Based on their crosslinking results, the authors emphasize the interaction of the RBR domains of HOIP and HOIL-1L and speculate that LUBAC may have a single catalytic center. However, since multiple contacts between LUBAC domains are detected (Figures 3B-E), the authors need to explain why they focused on this particular one. It will be interesting to analyze the effect of E2 or E2~Ub on crosslinking.</p><p>3) Thr12 and Thr55 were identified as potential ester linkage sites within poly-Ub species, but their mutation did not abolish the formation of hydroxylamine-sensitive bands. The authors should state the observed ubiquitin-sequence coverage in their mass spec experiment and which regions were not covered.</p><p>4) The authors hypothesize that a key function of the HOIL-1 esterification activity is to form heterotypic chains. While this might be the case, the alternative hypothesis of HOIL-1 priming substrates with ester-linked ubiquitins that are then linearly extended by HOIP seems also equally valid, especially because multiple substrates have been reported to be modified with linear chains, but HOIP appears to be tailored to modify only an ubiquitin substrate. The authors should discuss this alternative hypothesis and why both systems might be important.</p><p>In further support of substrates potentially being the most abundant ester-linked species, NEMO-enriched linear chains from TNF treated cells show a much more pronounced collapse compared to the ester-linked Ub-Ub linkages produced in the absence of substrate in vitro. It would greatly strengthen the paper if the authors could add a recombinant substrate (e.g. IRAK1/2 or MyD88) to the in vitro reaction.</p><p>5) In Figure 4B, why could the mixed LUBAC subunits generate a linear chain, but not an oxyester-linked branched Ub4? Do they form a high molecular weight complex that can be detected by gel filtration?</p><p>6) In Figures 4E and 5A, it is interesting that Cezanne and vOTU could cleave ester-linked branched Ub4, although the molecular bases for these reactions remain unclear. Are the LUBAC-generated, hydroxylamine-sensitive His-Ub3 and Ub2 shown in Figure 5B cleavable by Cezanne and vOTU?</p><p>7) To confirm that the residual oligomeric Ub species after OTULIN treatment (Figure 4E) are exclusively ester-linked, a subsequent hydroxylamine treatment step should be performed.</p><p>8) Finally, the suggestion that HOIP-HOIL Ub relay might be at play is exciting and implies that E3-mediated Ub relay might be a prevalent process. In principal it should be possible to test this by impairing E2 binding to the RING1 domain in HOIL in LUBAC. A steric mutation (e.g. X to Arg) would be a more elegant approach than a zinc-coordinating cysteine mutation. If relay is at play, then such mutated LUBAC should still be able to form ester linkages.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60660.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Although the authors present the first 3D reconstruction of LUBAC, the contribution of this low resolution model to this study seems questionable.

The 2D class averages show an asymmetric crescent structure where the mass of the complex is focused at either end with a thinner linker region that is expected to be the source of potential structural flexibility. As such, the 3D model in our first submission may indeed represent an average of a few conformers that differ by the degree of pivoting around the central linker region. However, the 2D class averages are not suggestive of multiple highly variable structural configurations in the complex that would jeopardize the accuracy of the model at the low resolution of negative staining. Nevertheless, to address the reviewersâ concern, we further refined the 3D model of the complex and arrived at a reconstruction that more accurately reflects the 2D class averages (Figure 2B new). Moreover, the projections obtained from the new model match the 2D class averages of the complex much better than those originally presented (Figure 2C new). Therefore, we present a new 3D refined model as a more accurate reconstruction of the LUBAC complex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If the authors were able to use negative stain of complexes, where individual subunits contained identifiable tags (e.g. GFP, MBP), to localize subunits and corroborate the crosslink-MS, perhaps a 3D model would be appropriate, but as it stands, the utility of the 3D density seems moot.</p></disp-quote><p>We certainly agree with the reviewers that identification of the catalytic C-termini of HOIL-1L and HOIP in the structure would corroborate the crosslinking-MS data and increase the usefulness of the structure. We therefore tagged the HOIP or HOIL-1L with an identifiable C-terminal GFP tag to localize their respective C-terminal regions in the structure.

Under the new conditions we could not observe any appreciable change in the crosslinking pattern as exemplified in the pair-wise plot for HOIP-to-HOIL-1L inter-protein crosslinks (Author response image 3).</p><fig id="sa2fig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>XL-MS results with additional purification step prior to crosslinking.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-60660-resp-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Each of the three proteins had one residue that was observed to crosslink indiscriminately to all other domains giving rise to the observed pattern on the pair-wise representations. These residues were HOIL-1L K174, SHARPIN K318, and HOIP K454/458. We argue that these residues are likely found on flexible regions of the proteins thus giving rise to the high levels of crosslinking to all domains in the complex. Indeed, foldindex prediction of HOIL-1L shows that unfolded regions match with these highly crossed-linked regions (Author response image 4). This issue is likely further exacerbated by the dimerization of LUBAC. Therefore, we do not expect all the crosslinks formed by these residues to be structurally relevant. However, as they are a product of the experimental set up they cannot be filtered out during data analysis. Hence, they were left in the figures in order to present an unbiased picture of the data. Nevertheless, the accuracy of the selectively crosslinking regions, including the NZF and RBR domains of HOIL-1L and HOIP, is independent to the background generated by promiscuously crosslinking residues. We are confident in our inference over the catalytic center of LUBAC, as it is supported by our biochemical data. As shown in figure 7, mutation of the catalytic Cys of HOIP inhibits the catalytic activity of HOIL-1L; similarly mutation of the NZF of HOIL-1L abrogates its catalytic activity.</p><fig id="sa2fig4"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Fold-index plot of human HOIL-1L.</title><p>Regions in HOIL-1L observed to cross-link mostly reside within the low fold-index (unfolded) area in the shown plot.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-60660-resp-fig4-v2.tif"/></fig><p>We appreciate that our discussion pertaining to these promiscuous crosslinks may not have been sufficient and have updated the text to reflect the reviewersâ concerns as follows:</p><p>âWe detected some highly crosslinking residues that formed crosslinks indiscriminately to all subunits of all proteins.

It will be interesting to analyze the effect of E2 or E2~Ub on crosslinking.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their observation. We also thank the reviewers for interesting suggestions on E2 and Ub-loaded E2 to include in the XL-MS analysis. Due to high complexity of the cross links as described as above, we decided not to include E2 in the new experiments. To explain why we focused on these crosslinks, we have updated the text as follows:</p><p>âInterestingly, we observed crosslinks between the HOIL-1L RING1 and HOIP RING1/LDD domains, as well as between the HOIL-1L RING2 and the HOIP RING1/IBR/RING2/LDD domains, which could indicate that the two enzymes have spatially connected catalytic activities. Additionally, HOIL-1L intra-protein crosslinks were formed between its NZF domain and its RING1/IBR/RING2 domains, which could implicate the HOIL-1L NZF domain of unknown function in the catalytic action of HOIL-1L.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Thr12 and Thr55 were identified as potential ester linkage sites within poly-Ub species, but their mutation did not abolish the formation of hydroxylamine-sensitive bands. The authors should state the observed ubiquitin-sequence coverage in their mass spec experiment and which regions were not covered.</p></disp-quote><p>We had almost full sequence coverage of ubiquitin in the mass spectrometry samples where Thr 12 and Thr55 were identified as ester-linkage sites. Only the final three amino acids of ubiquitin were not detected in their un-conjugated form, which is expected due to the high sensitivity of the C-terminal LRLRGG peptide to tryptic digest. We have updated the text to reflect the coverage of the ubiquitin sequence as follows:</p><p>âMS/MS spectra of GG-conjugated dipeptides at residues Thr12 and Thr55 of ubiquitin were detected from these samples, in which there was complete coverage of the ubiquitin amino acid sequence of 1-73â.</p><p>Based on this, we figure that the reason why mutations at Thr12 and Thr55 in Ub did not abolish the formation of hydroxyamine-sensitive bands is that there are alternative ubiquitination sites in the Ub Thr12/Thr55 mutant (such as Ser20 shown by Kelsall et al.), which we could not detect in our assays by using wild-type Ub.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors hypothesize that a key function of the HOIL-1 esterification activity is to form heterotypic chains. While this might be the case, the alternative hypothesis of HOIL-1 priming substrates with ester-linked ubiquitins that are then linearly extended by HOIP seems also equally valid, especially because multiple substrates have been reported to be modified with linear chains, but HOIP appears to be tailored to modify only an ubiquitin substrate. The authors should discuss this alternative hypothesis and why both systems might be important.</p><p>In further support of substrates potentially being the most abundant ester-linked species, NEMO-enriched linear chains from TNF treated cells show a much more pronounced collapse compared to the ester-linked Ub-Ub linkages produced in the absence of substrate in vitro. It would greatly strengthen the paper if the authors could add a recombinant substrate (e.g. IRAK1/2 or MyD88) to the in vitro reaction.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers raise an important point concerning the architecture of the heterotypic ubiquitin chains and the LUBAC ligase responsible for substrate ubiquitination. Therefore, we carried out an in vitro ubiquitination reaction including the model LUBAC substrate NEMO and subjected the reactions to hydroxylamine treatment (Figure 6B). Our results show that the majority of the signal from the ubiquitinated substrate is unaffected by hydroxylamine, indicating that substrate-conjugated chains are branched but not attached to the substrate via oxyester bonds. We have discussed the in vivo and in vitro chain branching data as follows:</p><p>âOur analysis of chain branching on substrate-conjugated ubiquitin chains suggests that the oxyester branch points of the chain are located distally from the substrate. [â¦] One explanation could be that there are other factors present in cells that assist HOIL-1L in the process of chain branching and which remain hitherto unidentified.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Figure 4B, why could the mixed LUBAC subunits generate a linear chain, but not an oxyester-linked branched Ub4? Do they form a high molecular weight complex that can be detected by gel filtration?</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewers suggest, we believe that individually purified and mixed HOIP, HOIL-1L, and SHARPIN do not adequately assemble the LUBAC complex. The result being that, while HOIP auto-inhibition is released and linear chains can be assembled, the more catalytically complex action of HOIL-1L in chain branching is not possible. Perhaps this results from improper spatial arrangement of the RBR domains of HOIP and HOIL-1L resulting in interruption of the proposed Cys relay (Figure 8). To support this claim, we carried out mass photometry measurements from the individually purified LUBAC components mixed at an equimolar ratio of the three components, as was done for the comparative in vitro assay (Supplementary Figure 5 new). In line with our hypothesis we, did not observe the 220 kDa peak corresponding to assembled LUBAC nor the 440 kDa peak corresponding to dimerized LUBAC, indicating that mixed LUBAC components cannot adequately assemble the LUBAC complex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In Figures 4E and 5A, it is interesting that Cezanne and vOTU could cleave ester-linked branched Ub4, although the molecular bases for these reactions remain unclear. Are the LUBAC-generated, hydroxylamine-sensitive His-Ub3 and Ub2 shown in Figure 5B cleavable by Cezanne and vOTU?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers ask an interesting question regarding the ability of the DUBs Cezanne and vOTU to cleave small ubiquitin polymers exclusively assembled with oxyester linkages. As suggested, we carried out a UbiCRest experiment of LUBAC-assembled His6-ubiquitin polymers. Our results show that the short oxyester-linked ubiquitin polymers are indeed sensitive to cleavage by both the tested DUBs (Supplementary Figure 6B new).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) To confirm that the residual oligomeric Ub species after OTULIN treatment (Figure 4E) are exclusively ester-linked, a subsequent hydroxylamine treatment step should be performed.</p></disp-quote><p>We carried out OTULIN UbiCRest analysis of LUBAC-assembled poly-ubiquitin chains followed by hydroxylamine treatment, as the reviewers suggested (Supplementary Figure 6A new). Our results were consistent with a ubiquitin polymer containing predominantly M1 bonds connected to short branches via oxyester bonds. The majority of the poly-ubiquitin signal proved to be sensitive to cleavage by OTULIN, while a small residue of di- and tri-ubiquitin was resistant to OTULIN cleavage but degraded by subsequent treatment with hydroxylamine.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Finally, the suggestion that HOIP-HOIL Ub relay might be at play is exciting and implies that E3-mediated Ub relay might be a prevalent process. In principal it should be possible to test this by impairing E2 binding to the RING1 domain in HOIL in LUBAC. A steric mutation (e.g. X to Arg) would be a more elegant approach than a zinc-coordinating cysteine mutation. If relay is at play, then such mutated LUBAC should still be able to form ester linkages.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that finding a way to impair E2 binding to HOIL-1L would be a great way to test the proposed Cys relay. Unfortunately, while we have tried to plan such an experiment, at present there are too many unknown variables to permit such a mutant from being made. The principal issue is with accurately predicting the E2 binding site of HOIL-1L. Some available structures of other RBR ligases such as HHARI and Parkin co-crystalized with an E2 enzyme show a binding loop on the RING1 domain (PDB: 5tte, 5udh, 6djw, 6n13). However, the only available structure of the HOIP RBR with an E2 (PDB: 5edv) shows a second E2-binding site at the RING2 and LDD domains. This raises the issue of whether a simple RING1 mutation in HOIL-1L would indeed prevent E2 binding by HOIL-1L or whether there is an additional E2 binding site at the RING2 domain. Furthermore, we carried out a multiple-sequence alignment of RBR family ligases and noted that a bulky hydrophobic residue is not conserved in HOIL-1L at the putative E2-binding loop. This leads to the possibility that if HOIL-1L binds the E2, it may bind it differently to the other RBR ligases. Therefore, without a high-resolution structure of the HOIL-1L RBR together with an E2 enzyme, a HOIL-1L E2-binding mutant cannot be reliably made. Failure to mutate all the correct residues could result in false positive or false negative results and would fail to address the model properly.</p></body></sub-article></article>
