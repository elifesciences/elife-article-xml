Vascular ulcers are worsened by extracellular release of hemoglobin, so we examined the impact of myoglobin (Mb) iron in murine muscle pressure injuries (mPI). Tests used Mb-knockout or treatment with deferoxamine iron chelator (DFO). Unlike acute injuries from cardiotoxin, mPI regenerated poorly with a lack of viable immune cells, persistence of dead tissue (necro-slough), and abnormal deposition of iron. However, Mb-knockout or DFO-treated mPI displayed a reversal of the pathology: decreased tissue death, decreased iron deposition, decrease in markers of oxidative damage, and higher numbers of intact immune cells. Subsequently, DFO treatment improved myofiber regeneration and morphology. We conclude that myoglobin iron contributes to tissue death in mPI. Remarkably, a large fraction of muscle death in untreated mPI occurred later than, and was preventable by, DFO treatment, even though treatment started 12 hr after pressure was removed. This demonstrates an opportunity for post-pressure prevention to salvage tissue viability.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chronic wound healing</kwd><kwd>ischemic muscle death</kwd><kwd>ferroptosis</kwd><kwd>myogenesis</kwd><kwd>regenerative medicine</kwd><kwd>stem cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001349</institution-id><institution>National Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NMRC/OFIRG/0007/2016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tucker-Kellogg</surname><given-names>Lisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001459</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education - Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOE2019-T2-1-138</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tucker-Kellogg</surname><given-names>Lisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001381</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CAMP IRG</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heemskerk</surname><given-names>Hans</given-names></name><name><surname>Tucker-Kellogg</surname><given-names>Lisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Myoglobin iron contributes to the formation and poor healing of muscle pressure injuries, that is, bedsores, and iron-chelation therapy can be administered after prolonged pressure to increase survival of the damaged tissue.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pressure injuries (also called pressure ulcers, bedsores, decubiti, or pressure sores) are tissue damage caused by sustained pressure. They are extremely painful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Girouard et al., 2008</xref>), costly to prevent and treat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Padula and Delarmente, 2019</xref>), and increase the risk of patient sepsis and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wassel et al., 2020</xref>). Tissue death can be caused by mechanical deformation, ischemia, or both. Ischemia is often studied as ischemia-reperfusion injury, but poor clearance of damage factors may have unappreciated importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gray et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Pressure injuries often heal poorly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mervis and Phillips, 2019</xref>), especially if they involve deeper layers such as muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bouten et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Preston et al., 2017</xref>), but the reasons are for poor quality and quantity of healing are not clear. Some cases can be explained by complications or comorbidities (infection, incontinence, poor circulation, hyperglycemia, chronic reinjury, advanced age), but pressure injuries can affect any immobile person (e.g., young adults with spinal cord injury). In this study, we ask whether some aspect of pressure-induced injury is intrinsically inhospitable to regeneration and in need of intervention.</p><p>Chronic ulcers of veins or arteries (e.g., venous stasis ulcers, sickle cell ulcers) have high levels of extracellular hemoglobin (Hb) released in the wound. For example, many have deposits of hemosiderin. Extracellular Hb and its breakdown products (e.g., hemin, iron) create oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goldman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Reeder and Wilson, 2005</xref>) and other effects that are detrimental to regeneration. For example, Hb decreases nitric oxide for angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kato et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nader et al., 2020</xref>) and signals as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) to increase inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mendonça et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bozza and Jeney, 2020</xref>). Systems exist to detoxify Hb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cherayil, 2011</xref>), but Hb is also an innate immune factor with evolutionarily conserved antimicrobial function. When extracellular Hb is activated by proteolytic cleavage, bacterial binding, or conformational change, it increases production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bogdan, 2007</xref>; this process has been called ‘oxidative burst without phagocytes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bogdan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jiang et al., 2007</xref>). Our earlier work used evolutionary conservation to identify ROS-producing fragments of Hb and crosstalk with tissue factor coagulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bahl et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bahl et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, globin proteins have multiple functions that may be detrimental to chronic wounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tchanque-Fossuo et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Myoglobin release into plasma or urine has been observed after muscle pressure injuries (mPI) in multiple studies including deep tissue injury (DTI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Traa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Makhsous et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Loerakker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Levine, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Traa, 2019</xref>), but was studied as a readout of damage rather than a source of damage. We reason by analogy to hemoglobin that extracellular myoglobin might create a hostile wound environment. An extracellular environment oxidizes globins to a ferric (Fe<sup>3+</sup>) state, which can be further oxidized to ferryl (FeI<sup>V</sup>=O) globin in the presence of endogenous peroxides such as hydrogen peroxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Reeder et al., 2008</xref>). Hydrogen peroxide is ubiquitous in contexts of cell stress, mitochondrial permeabilization, and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Rojkind et al., 2002</xref>). Ferryl-Mb can oxidize macromolecules directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goldman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kapralov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Plotnikov et al., 2009</xref>) and can form heme-to-protein crosslinks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Osawa and Williams, 1996</xref>). Most importantly, ferryl myoglobin can participate in a catalytic cycle of pseudo-peroxidase activity (redox cycling) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boutaud and Roberts, 2011</xref>). In a tissue context, myoglobin can induce ferroptosis, which is a form of non-apoptotic cell death associated with iron and characterized by lipid peroxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>). Dissociation of myoglobin into free heme or iron results in additional forms of toxicity, as described for hemoglobin.</p><p>We hypothesize that mPI will have Mb-dependent pathologies, and that introducing Mb-knockout or iron chelation therapy will partially normalize the mPI pathologies. Deferoxamine (DFO), also known as desferrioxamine or desferoxamine, is an FDA-approved small-molecule iron chelator that improves iron overload syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Velasquez and Wray, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Karnon et al., 2012</xref>). DFO binds free iron and heme at a 1-to-1 ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Velasquez and Wray, 2022</xref>), scavenges free radicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Reeder et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Morel et al., 1992</xref>), reduces ferryl myoglobin to ferric myoglobin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Plotnikov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Vanek and Kozhli, 2022</xref>), inhibits crosslinking of heme to protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Reeder and Wilson, 2005</xref>), and prevents the formation of pro-oxidant globin and heme species. DFO can function as an activator of Hif1α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tchanque-Fossuo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Xiao et al., 2013</xref>), a tool for promoting angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Duscher et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Holden and Nair, 2019</xref>), an antioxidant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Sundin et al., 2000</xref>), or can join an anti-ischemic cocktail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Soloniuk et al., 1992</xref>). DFO appears in hundreds of studies of ischemic or inflammatory pathologies. In our study, subcutaneous DFO is used for testing the hypothesized role of myoglobin iron and as an anti-DAMP therapy for combating local iron overload.</p><p>Assessing the contribution of myoglobin iron to pressure injury pathophysiology provides an opportunity to test several additional hypotheses about pressure injuries. First, our prior work in mathematical modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jagannathan and Tucker-Kellogg, 2016</xref>) predicted that oxidative stress from myoglobin and other DAMPs could create <italic>secondary progression</italic> of pressure ulcers. Secondary progression means that otherwise viable tissue dies later from the environmental consequences of injury, rather than dying directly from the original injury. Pressure injuries are known to have gradual expansion of tissue death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Stadler et al., 2004</xref>), consistent with secondary progression, but blocking secondary progression has not been clinically recognized as a goal for intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, our studies are designed to test whether tissue margins can be saved from dying, if we initiate iron chelation therapy 12 hr after pressure has ended. Second, we hypothesize that iron chelation therapy, by improving the early stages of injury response, will lead to better muscle tissue architecture (better morphogenesis) in long-term regeneration, even after treatment has ended. This hypothesis will be tested by breeding inducible fluorescence into satellite cells (muscle stem cells bearing Pax7); this fluorescence causes newly regenerated muscle fibers light up against the dark background of pre-existing muscle. Third, establishing a pressure injury mouse model provides an opportunity to learn how much of the poor healing is independent of comorbidities and complications. To the best of our knowledge, pressure injuries have never been assessed for poor regeneration under aseptic conditions in young, healthy animals. We hypothesize that even under these ideal circumstances mPI will heal slowly and incompletely. Our fourth and final additional hypothesis is inspired by prior studies of blood-related conditions in which high levels of hemoglobin or heme/hemin could impair the survival, chemotaxis, and phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nader et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ferris and Harding, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sindrilaru et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ballart et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Martins et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Yefimova et al., 2002</xref>) of phagocytic cells. Given that pressure ulcers often have slough or eschar, we hypothesize that necrotic tissue will persist in the mPI wound bed, and that sterile mPI will have slough, despite the absence of bacterial biofilm. If correct, this would imply that slough by itself is not sufficient to indicate infection (or bacterial colonization) of a wound.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Magnet-induced pressure injury causes delayed healing and failure of muscle regeneration</title><p>To compare wound healing between acute and chronic wounds, we injured the dorsal skinfold of mice using either cardiotoxin (CTX) or pressure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>) in healthy young adult mice under specific pathogen-free conditions. Both groups of mice received sham treatment (injected with 0.9% saline subcutaneously for 16 d or until mouse sacrifice, whichever was sooner). The normal uninjured mouse skinfold contains the following parallel layers: a thin epithelium (epidermis), a thicker layer of dermis, dermal white adipose tissue (dWAT), a muscle layer called the panniculus carnosus (PC), and a wavy layer of loose areolar tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Despite comparable diameters of dead muscle between CTX and mPI at day 3, the wound diameters were vastly different at day 10 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>; p=0.578 at day 3 and p&lt;0.0001 at day 10). In the CTX injury at day 3, many blood vessels were intact and carrying red blood cells, but in mPI at day 3, intact vasculature was not observed in the compressed region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Prior work showed that pressure affects blood and lymphatic vessels in many ways including potentially loss of flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gray et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kimura et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Karahan et al., 2018</xref>). After CTX killed the panniculus muscle, substantial muscle regeneration occurred by 10 d, in which immature muscle fibers displayed central nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). At 40 d after acute injury, muscle was completely regenerated and mature (evidenced by peripherally located nuclei, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, the pressure-injured wound bed remained filled with dead tissue at day 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and E–F</xref>; p&lt;0.0001). Our pressure injuries showed no signs of infection and no epibole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The dead epidermis, dermis, dWAT, and panniculus layers were pushed upward at day 7 ± 2 as slough (necroslough, per the nomenclature of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nasser, 2019</xref>) and remained at the surface, eventually becoming a dry eschar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). When the eschar dropped off (by day 15), the size of the epithelial opening was smaller than the eschar, meaning that re-epithelialization had occurred underneath the eschar. Re-epithelialization completed at day 21 ± 2. Despite successful closure of the epithelial layer, pressure injuries at 40 d had only partial regeneration of the panniculus carnosus layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and G</xref>; p&lt;0.0001). At 90 d after pressure injury, the dermis and epidermis had regenerated, but a hole remained in the panniculus muscle layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), indicating a failure to regenerate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nasir et al., 2022</xref>). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref> summarizes the timelines.

ETs are formed when phagocytes citrullinate their histones and eject nuclear and/or mitochondrial DNA (and associated factors), which can trap and kill pathogens during infection. The process, ETosis, often kills the host cell. ETs have been observed in sickle cell ulcers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). In day 3 wounds, levels of citH3 were tenfold higher in mPI than in CTX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–G</xref>; p=0.0280). Highest levels occurred near the muscle layer, such as the interface between the panniculus layer and the dWAT or dermis. This is consistent with the possibility that immune cells may have been present in the muscle layer of mPI before day 3 and then died of ETosis. Oxidative stress is a well-studied trigger of ETosis, and other stimuli include hemin and heme-activated platelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Okubo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ohbuchi et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Free iron remains in wound tissues after pressure injury</title><p>Iron deposition was very high in mPI, as measured by Perls’ Prussian blue stain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), but iron was undetectable at the same time point after CTX injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H–J</xref>; p=0.0332).

With blood vessels collapsed or disrupted, the mPI had dead tissue persisting in the wound bed for more than a week, and regeneration was impaired. The debris field also contained high accumulations of iron, which motivated us to study myoglobin-knockout mice and iron chelation therapy. These experiments showed that the iron was myoglobin-dependent, and the myoglobin iron caused oxidative damage. The damage was consistent with lipid peroxidation, ETs, and ferroptosis. Finally, we showed that administering DFO after pressure caused decreased oxidative stress, decreased death of tissue margins, and improved muscle regeneration. The numbers of intact immune cells in mPI were positively correlated with regeneration and negatively correlated with oxidative damage, suggesting that excessive inflammation was not the primary pathology causing poor healing in these wounds.</p><p>Induction of mPI used a standard magnet method in mice, but instead of studying longitudinal re-epithelialization, we used tissue section timepoints to study the thin muscle layer of panniculus carnosus, also called the cutaneous muscle or the panniculus layer. This muscle regenerated slowly and incompletely from the magnet injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), even under ideal conditions of youth, health, and lack of microbial pathogens. A hole remained in the panniculus layer at 40 d (in seven out of seven mice) and 90 d (in five out of five mice). For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, note that the adipose layer is immediately adjacent to loose areolar tissue at the wound center, indicating that the panniculus layer is absent. Thus, we obtained a normoglycemic noninfected animal model of impaired healing.</p><p>Mb knockout tested the hypothesis that myoglobin iron contributes to the pathologies of mPI. This hypothesis is based on analogy to poor-healing wounds that have hemolysis and poor drainage of hemoglobin (e.g., venous stasis), and also inspired by papers showing myoglobin is detectable in distal fluids after pressure ulcers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Traa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Levine, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Traa, 2019</xref>). As expected, the iron deposits seen after wildtype mPI injury were absent from <italic>Mb</italic><bold><sup>−/−</sup></bold>. Similarly, <italic>Mb</italic><bold><sup>−/−</sup></bold> had far less oxidative damage. Because Mb normally serves to supply oxygen in muscle tissue, one might expect <italic>Mb</italic><bold><sup>−/−</sup></bold> mice to experience increased tissue death due to the hypoxia of ischemia, but prior work showed <italic>Mb</italic><bold><sup>−/−</sup></bold> mice are ‘surprisingly well adapted’ to hypoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schlieper et al., 2004</xref>), capable of withstanding adrenergic stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Meeson et al., 2001</xref>), exercise, and oxygen flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gödecke et al., 1999</xref>). In the mPI context, carrying wildtype Mb caused roughly twice as much tissue death as <italic>Mb</italic><bold><sup>−/−</sup></bold>. Some of that difference might be explained by developmental compensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gödecke et al., 1999</xref>) (e.g., 17% increase in capillary density), but we interpret that a large fraction of tissue death from mPI was downstream of Mb. Multiple other DAMPs including hemoglobin might have contributed to the iron accumulation and oxidative damage seen in the <italic>Mb</italic><sup>+/+</sup> case, but removing Mb was sufficient to alleviate the overload.</p><p>The region of myoglobin-related damage extended beyond muscle. Given the potential toxicity of myoglobin during ischemia-reperfusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Garry et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gödecke et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Meeson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hazarika et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Meisner et al., 2013</xref>), we were not surprised that Mb knockout caused greater survival of muscle. However, we were surprised that most other layers of the wound improved too. Some types of ROS created by iron are highly reactive (e.g., hydroxyl radical from the Fenton reaction), so they act locally where they are created. Long-distance damage might arise from transport of the globin iron, or from milder ROS species, or both. Given the large effect sizes seen in the <italic>Mb</italic><bold><sup>−/−</sup></bold> and DFO experiments, and given the small amount of muscle in mPI, we suspect that unappreciated mechanisms of amplification or vulnerability might be downstream of myoglobin iron in the mPI context.</p><p>Clearance of myoglobin iron can be seen in CTX injuries, which had destruction of muscle but no accumulation of iron, according to Perls’ stain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). CTX and naniproin are snake venoms that cause myolysis (cytolysis) of myofibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Guardiola et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harvey et al., 1982</xref>), and have been reported to spare nerve and vessel viability at the concentrations used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Averin and Utkin, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). One presumes that myolysis would cause myoglobin release, but continued function of the circulatory system may have allowed the myoglobin iron to be transported, diluted, and/or detoxified below the detection limit of Perls’ stain. In contrast, levels of iron in mPI were greater than the detection limit for Perls’ stain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), and many dysfunctions ensued. Pressure has been reported to cause disruption to arterial supply, venous clearance, and lymphatic drainage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gray et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kimura et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Karahan et al., 2018</xref>), although not always (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Stekelenburg et al., 2006</xref>). Lymph vessels are occluded at very low pressure, and impaired lymphatic flow can persist after pressure is removed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Worsley et al., 2020</xref>). Impaired circulation and/or impaired drainage could cause waste factors such as myoglobin or iron to accumulate in the mPI, and could impair the influx of iron detoxification factors. Poor drainage also occurs in chronic ulcers of venous insufficiency, lymphedema, and other vascular diseases. Toxicity from globin iron might be a shared pathology among these wounds. mPI research might also benefit from analogy to known globin overload syndromes such as compartment syndrome, rhabdomyolysis, and hemoglobinopathies.</p><p>Pressure injury prevention usually refers to pre-injury prevention, which is to intervene with cushioning or turning before prolonged pressure occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Sundin et al., 2000</xref>). What we studied is post-pressure prevention because we asked whether tissue could be saved from dying by interventions beginning 12 hr after pressure had finished. In healthy young mice, magnets were placed and removed in 12 hr cycles as part of a 2-d process of creating a pressure ulcer. (See the detailed timeline in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>.) Drug injections began on the third day after pressure began, which we refer to as day 1 post-injury. The remarkable observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) is that the amount of death on day 3 post-injury was not constant across the tissue sections, even though the induction of the pressure ulcers was identical. mPI that received post-pressure DFO showed significantly smaller diameters of muscle death than saline-treated comparisons. Our quantification used cross-sectional tissue slides, but a 35% decreased diameter of death equates to a 58% smaller circle area of death. We conclude that there is window of opportunity to intervene and save viability of tissue, after the established mechanisms of injury have occurred (such as mechanical, hypoxic, reoxygenation, and nutrient stress), but before the full extent of secondary progression and DAMP-induced stress have propagated. In this mouse model, the opportunity occurred between 12 hr and 72 hr after off-loading.</p><p>Secondary progression of wounds is well documented in thermal burns, where post-burn treatment can lessen the progression of partial-thickness burns toward full-thickness. However, secondary progression has not, to the best of our knowledge, been previously targeted for medical intervention in pressure ulcers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel et al., 2019</xref>). Mechanisms of secondary progression may include oxidative stress and ferroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li et al., 2021</xref>), and we cannot rule out reperfusion injury, platelet activation, ETs, and DAMP-induced apoptosis/necroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jagannathan and Tucker-Kellogg, 2016</xref>).</p><p>CitH3, a marker of ETs, was elevated in the high-iron conditions (young and elderly mPI) and low in the three conditions that lacked concentrated deposits of iron (CTX, knockout, DFO-treated). This is consistent with the ability of heme, oxidative stress, or heme-activated platelets to trigger ETs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Okubo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ohbuchi et al., 2017</xref>). ETs can aid in antimicrobial defense, but they are detrimental to regeneration and contribute to many disorders of sterile inflammation. Our induction of CitH3 was likely sterile as well: the mouse environment was negative for 39 categories of pathogen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1h</xref>, including common dermal microbiota <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>), and no bacteria could be detected in or near the wound by Gram staining.</p><p>The persistence of dead tissue was particularly striking in our noninfected mPI wound. Viable immune cells were essentially absent from the pressure-injured muscles of young healthy mice at day 3. The wounds exhibited a normal spike in immune cell infiltration outside the wound margins, moving toward the wound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), but intact infiltrate was not seen inside the compressed region, almost as if infiltration had been halted at the boundary. Initially we questioned whether the compressed architecture of the tissue might have occluded chemotaxis, but closer inspection revealed dead fragments and markers such as CitH3 in the compressed region. Our interpretation is that immune cells (tissue-resident and/or infiltrated) may have been present but then died. We do not know whether this death was necrotic or programmed. Possible explanations for the persistence of dead tissue, in addition to poor cell survival, are decreased migration and decreased efferocytosis/phagocytosis. Diseases characterized by the presence of plaque (atherosclerosis) and ectopic tissue (endometriosis) have impaired function of phagocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Schrijvers et al., 2005</xref>). Other syndromes with iron overload have poor function, migration, and/or survival of phagocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Van Asbeck et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Porto and De Sousa, 2007</xref>). For example, in patients with thalassemia major, neutrophils and macrophages exhibit poor chemotaxis, defective lysis, and impaired phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ballart et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Martins et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cantinieaux et al., 1987</xref>).</p><p>Intact immune cells were present at days 7 and 10 of mPI. DFO increased their abundance, especially in the loose areolar tissue, but also in muscle, fat, and skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7L and M</xref>). One theory of nonhealing wounds is that excessive inflammation causes oxidative damage and blocks progress of granulation. Our mPI observations are not well aligned with that theory because DFO caused an increase in the immune infiltrate and iNOS staining, but it <italic>decreased</italic> the oxidative damage and the size of the hole. Another theory is that nonhealing wounds lack pro-regenerative M2 macrophages. Nothing observed about mPI in this first study would contradict that theory. Our work is also consistent with prior work that found iron-scavenging macrophages from an iron-loaded tissue displayed both inflammatory (iNOS, IFNγ) and alternately-activated (Arg1, IL10) markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ali et al., 2020</xref>). Prior studies also found that environmental iron can cause M2 macrophages to decrease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Handa et al., 2019</xref>) or increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agoro et al., 2018</xref>), depending on dose/context. Future studies can use our mPI timeline to design an immunobiology study that isolates mPI immune cells for detailed analysis.</p><p>Surface visibility of dead tissue was delayed until competent inflammation and granulation pushed it upward. This delay might give a false impression that slough was created by infection or inflammation. The slough detached spontaneously by day 15, but as it was pushed up, the slough remained attached to the healthy margins and bent the margins upward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Since healthy margins organize the geometry of regeneration, distorting the margins might impair regeneration. Nonhealing wounds are sometimes believed to have excess proteolysis, but mPI raises the question of whether increased proteolytic activity might help prevent the extrusion process from distorting the healthy margins.</p><p>The toxicity of slough is a topic of clinical debate. In our mPI, re-epithelialization proceeded beneath the necro-slough and proliferative granulation tissue was adjacent to its center, so we conclude it was not cytotoxic. This is consistent with clinical practice to avoid debridement of an intact eschar unless there are signs of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Manna et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, our slough arose from a mass that was probably toxic when it formed. Toxicity at early timepoints is inferred from the oxidative damage at day 3 and indirectly from the phenomenon of secondary progression. It is possible that toxicity could disappear spontaneously if ROS are driven by an energy source that gets depleted (e.g., hydrogen peroxide, ATP, mitochondrial membrane potentials).</p><p>Muscle regeneration improved with DFO treatment, evidenced by smaller holes in the muscle layer at multiple timepoints, and improved muscle morphology at the endpoint. The limited muscle regeneration that did occur in mPI without DFO displayed frequent myofiber defects such as branching and nonparallel alignment. Split fibers are considered defective regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eriksson et al., 2006</xref>) and are especially vulnerable to reinjury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pichavant et al., 2016</xref>). Loss of the panniculus muscle layer causes the skin and adipose to experience harsher stress and strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nasir et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Soh et al., 2020</xref>), even though the panniculus is a thin component of the tissue. Previous studies of muscle pressure injury considered larger muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmed et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Siu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wassermann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Salcido et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Salcido et al., 2007</xref>), and the impact of DFO should be retesting in other geometries. The panniculus layer is highly relevant to human pressure injuries because humans have a panniculus layer at the heel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nasir et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cichowitz et al., 2009</xref>), and the heel is one of the most common locations for high-stage pressure injuries.</p><p>Skin regeneration was not significantly affected by subcutaneous DFO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Previous work found DFO administered via a transdermal patch accelerated skin closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Duscher et al., 2015</xref>), but these studies used topical delivery, as well as using a different mouse background. Other work studied the antioxidant and angiogenic benefits of DFO in preclinical models of ischemia-reperfusion injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">González-Montero et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Morris et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Peeters-Scholte et al., 2003</xref>) and related conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Qayumi et al., 1994</xref>). We observe similar effects in muscle.</p><p>Caveats to this work include the following. Mouse wounds differ from human in several obvious ways, such as having denser hair follicle coverage, faster kinetics of DFO, different timing and ratio of phagocytic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zomer and Trentin, 2018</xref>), and higher propensity for wound contraction. Although mice can heal skin wounds by contraction, our multilayer mPI exhibited minimal contraction, as seen from prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nasir et al., 2022</xref>) and from the hole in the panniculus muscle layer at day 90. To decrease the impact of hair follicles on results, we placed magnets on regions of skin that were in the resting phase of the hair cycle. Another limitation of our study is the limited number of myoglobin knockout mice (n = 3) compared with n = 7 for key timepoints of <italic>Mb</italic><bold><sup>+/+</sup></bold> analysis. This was necessary because <italic>Mb</italic> germline knockout had high rates of embryonic lethality. Despite the smaller sample size, several readouts were statistically significant.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Myoglobin iron contributed to the size, severity, oxidative damage, and poor healing of mPI. DFO injections prevented death of tissue at the margins of the wound, when administered starting 12 hr after pressure was removed. Intervention to block secondary progression is a dramatic new opportunity for pressure injuries, like burns or strokes, to be stabilized shortly after injury, to decrease further loss of salvageable tissue. Iron chelation therapy has side effects when used systemically, so muscle wounds might be safer than vascular wounds for future research on human biodistribution (in conjunction with dressings and polymer scaffolds). Also, DFO led to higher quality of muscle, with straighter and more parallel muscle fibers, which should improve muscle viability. Healthy muscle is a crucial defense against wound recurrence, when a patient eventually puts weight on the same location again.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Animal experiments were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC SHS/2016/1257) of SingHealth, Singapore. To conditionally label Pax7+ muscle satellite stem cells in C57BL6 mice, the Pax7-Cre-ER<sup>T2</sup> mouse (JAX stock #012476, Jackson Laboratory, ME) was crossed with the Brainbow2.1 (confetti; JAX stock #017492, Jackson Laboratory) mouse. Pax7-Cre-ERT2 provides the Cre-ERT2 transgene downstream of the Pax7 stop codon, thereby limiting the Cre-ERT2 expression to Pax7+ cells. The Cre-ER<sup>T2</sup> system provides tamoxifen-dependent induction of Cre recombinase, so that affected cells carry heritable rather than transient modification. Upon tamoxifen treatment, the Cre induction causes recombination of the confetti construct at its loxP loci, leading to gene expression of one of the four fluorescent proteins in the construct. The fluorescent proteins are mCerulean (CFP<sup>mem</sup>), hrGFP II (GFP<sup>nuc</sup>), mYFP (YFP<sup>cyt</sup>), and tdimer2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mendonça et al., 2016</xref>) (RFP<sup>cyt</sup>). CFP<sup>mem</sup> contains a localization sequence enabling its transport to the myofiber membrane (sarcolemma) while GFP<sup>nuc</sup> contains a nuclear localization sequence. YFP<sup>cyt</sup> and RFP<sup>cyt</sup> have no localization sequences and are expected to localize to the cytoplasm. Experimental mice include 5-month-old adult mice and 20-month-old elderly mice.</p><p>Myoglobin knockout mice (homozygous in the germline) were created by Cyagen (CA) using CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease-mediated genome editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Qin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Qin et al., 2016</xref>). 20-month-old mice (n = 3) were used in the knockout experiments. The myoglobin knockout mice were not injected with tamoxifen.</p><p>Mice were euthanized via CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation, followed by cervical dislocation, at timepoints of 3, 7, 10, 40, and 90 d following completion of the injury protocol (pressure or toxin). Pressure injury via magnetic compression created two wounds (right and left) on the dorsum of each mouse. Similarly, two CTX injections were performed on each mouse at the right and left dorsal skinfold. Tissue samples were isolated, and one wound tissue (from either pressure or toxin) was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C for 8 hr, and then embedded in paraffin. The remaining wound tissue was snap-frozen with isopentane in a liquid nitrogen bath.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Murine pressure injury model</title><p>Mice were shaved and remaining hair was removed by hair removal cream (Veet, Reckitt, Slough, England) prior to injury. Muscle pressure ulcers were created in 4–5-month-old transgenic mice by applying a pair of ceramic magnets (Magnetic Source, Castle Rock, CO, part number: CD14C, grade 8) to the dorsal skinfold. The magnets were 5 mm thick and 12 mm in diameter, with an average weight of 2.7 g and pulling force of 640 g. One of the elderly mice lacked sufficient skinfold for 12 mm magnets, so in that mouse and in its age- and sex-matched control, we used 5 mm magnets (neodymium magnets with a 1 mm spacer on one side; Liftontech Supreme Pte Ltd, Singapore). Because hair follicle (HF) stem cells contribute to wound healing, we attempted to minimize the HF differences by synchronizing the hair growth cycle and applying injury only to skin with HFs in telogen phase (non-pigmented skin). In the case where pigmented skin could not be avoided during magnet placement, that is, one of the two wounds fell on skin with active hair cycle, that half was excluded from further analysis. Pressure ulcer induction was performed in two cycles. Each cycle was made up of a 12 hr period of magnet placement followed by a 12 hr period without magnets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This procedure induces two pressure wounds on the back of the mouse, on the left and right side of the dorsal skinfold. The dorsal skinfold includes skin, adipose tissue, panniculus carnosus muscle, and loose areolar tissue. The mice were given an analgesic (buprenorphine at 0.1 mg/kg; Bupredyne, Jurox Animal Health, New Zealand) prior to magnet placement and again prior to magnet removal. Timepoints post-injury are measured from the end of last magnet cycle. No dressings were used, and no debridements were performed.</p><p>To treat the pressure injuries, mice were subcutaneously injected with DFO while control mice were injected with 0.9% saline (n = 7 each for day 3, 10, and 40 timepoints, n = 4 for day 7, and n = 5 for day 90; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1e</xref>). The study was initially conducted using 3, 10, and 40 d. When the day 7 and 90 timepoints were added to the study, we already knew that DFO treatment would give a large effect size. The updated effect size caused our power calculation to give a smaller sample size for days 7 and 90. The day 7 timepoint was added later because of the dramatic changes observed between days 3 and 10, and the day 90 timepoint was added later because day 40 mPI showed signs of ongoing regeneration (myoblastic cells and immature myofibers), indicating that steady state had not yet been reached at day 40.</p><p>DFO was administered twice per day at 30 mg/kg body weight (or 0.9% saline for control animals) for 16 d or until mouse sacrifice, whichever was sooner. Under anesthesia, the dorsal skinfold (cranial to the wound) was pulled away from the spine to make a ‘tent,’ and the needle was inserted into the tent (over the spine, near the left and right wounds). The first DFO treatment was given 12 hr after completion of the second and final cycle of pressure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The dosing rationale was as follows: the recommended dose of DFO for iron overload in human patients is 20–60 mg/kg per day (maximum 80 mg/kg; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barata et al., 1996</xref>). Mice metabolize DFO faster than humans, so we took the 60 mg/kg per day human dosing and divided it into two half-doses per day.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Murine cardiotoxin injury model</title><p>To induce an acute injury in the panniculus carnosus muscle in the skinfold, mice were shaved and fur removed by hair removal cream (Veet, Reckitt, Slough, England) prior to injury. The mice were anesthetized and 30 μl of toxin at 10 μM concentration was injected intramuscularly into the panniculus carnosus of the dorsal skinfold of each wound (left and right). Because commercial distribution of CTX from <italic>Naja mossambica</italic> was discontinued, some mice were injected with naniproin instead, while the term ‘cardiotoxin’ has been used for the entire cohort. Naniproin is a <italic>Naja nigricollis</italic> homolog of CTX with 95% sequence identity. Naniproin induces myolysis comparable to CTX. All toxin-injected mice were given an analgesic (buprenorphine at 0.1 mg/kg; Bupredyne, Jurox Animal Health) prior to injection. To control for the post-injury injections given to mPI mice, the toxin-injured mice were injected subcutaneously with 0.9% saline (n = 7) twice daily for 16 d or until mouse sacrifice, whichever was sooner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The scoring for tissue death was defined as follows: 0, healthy tissue with zero or minimal death (&lt;10% tissue area dead); 1, mild death (11–33%); 2, moderate death (34–67%); and 3, extensive tissue death (&gt;67%). Death was identified by karyolysis, karyorrhexis, and acidification (eosinification). Scoring for tissue regeneration was defined as follows: 0 (minimal, i.e., &lt;10% regenerated), 1 (mild, i.e., 11–33% regenerated), 2 (moderate, i.e., 34–67% regenerated) to 3 (extensive, i.e.,&gt;67% regenerated). Scoring for granulation was defined as follows: 0, normal tissue with neither granulation nor neo-angiogenesis; 1, minimal granulation (less than 10% of tissue area); 2, mild granulation (10–25% of tissue area); 3, moderate granulation (26–50% of tissue area); 4, high granulation (51–75% of tissue area); and 5, extensive granulation (more than 75% of tissue area consisting of granulation tissue). Likewise, the scores for immune infiltration were defined as follows: 0, normal tissue without immune infiltration; 1, minimal immune infiltration (in less than 10% of tissue); 2, mild immune infiltration (in 10–25% of tissue); 3, moderate immune infiltration (in 26–50% of tissue); 4, high immune infiltration (51–75% of tissue area); and 5, extensive immune infiltration (more than 75% of tissue infiltrated by immune cells). Therefore, on the scales for tissue death, regeneration, granulation, and immune infiltration, an uninjured tissue would receive scores of 0, 3, 0, and 0, respectively.

Sample preparation followed the manufacturer’s protocol, and analytes were read using the MAGPIX Platform (Luminex Corporation, TX).</p><p>For blotting, 30  μg samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc, CA) and transferred to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc). The PVDF membranes were blocked with 5% blotting grade blocker (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc) at room temperature (RT) for 1  hr and then incubated with the primary antibodies (anti-myoglobin antibody, 25919S, Cell Signaling Technology) overnight at 4°C. Then, the membranes were washed with TBST at RT and incubated with the secondary antibody for 1  hr.

RAW264.7 monocytes were pre-incubated for 24 hr with 10 ng/ml recombinant murine IFNγ (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada) with 100 ng/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS; Sigma-Aldrich) to resemble pro-inflammatory or M1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cao et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>To dose the myoglobin treatment, we first used a mouse myoglobin ELISA kit (Abcam, ab157722) to obtain the myoglobin concentrations in the calf (67.4 µg/ml) and bicep (40.8 µg/ml) muscles of our mice. From this, we chose 15, 50, and 150 µg/ml to be the treatment concentrations of myoglobin (M0630 from horse muscle, Sigma-Aldrich) for the RAW264.7 cells (24 hr after pro-inflammatory treatment). Negative and positive controls were provided by untreated (0 µg/ml myoglobin) and menadione-treated macrophages.

The cells were measured for oxidative stress using the ROS-Glo H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions (G8820, Promega). Luminescence was measured using a Tecan Spark M10 microplate reader (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland). The cells were also measured using an efferocytosis assay kit (Cayman Chemical, MI) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, apoptotic bodies were created from staurosporine-treated C2C12 myoblasts (CRL-1772, ATCC) and labeled with CFSE fluorescence. Apoptotic bodies (or cell-free media control [CFM]) were added to wells for 16 hr prior to aspiration of the unengulfed apoptotic bodies, washing, and measurement. Absolute fluorescence was measured as integrated intensity for each well using a microplate reader (Tecan Spark M10, Männedorf, Switzerland) with excitation at 490 nm and emission at 525 nm.</p><p>RAW264.7 monocyte and C2C12 myoblast cell lines were authenticated using a commercial STR profiling service (Mouse Cell Authentication Service, ATCC 137‐XV) and tested negative for mycoplasma using the MycoAlert PLUS mycoplasma detection kit (LT07-705; Lonza, Basel, Switzerland).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Sample sizes for the mouse studies were determined using a power analysis for comparing two means (two-sample, two-sided equality).</p><p>In the analysis of DFO treatment in adult 5-month-old mice at multiple timepoints, treated mice were paired with age- and-sex-matched controls.

The in vitro experiments with macrophages could be further supported by in vivo experiments, where types of injury (mPI vs. CTX) and mouse genotypes (Mb-/- vs. WT) could be evaluated for the ability of macrophages to perform efferocytosis: coupling apoptotic cell detection (Tunel staining) to macrophage immunostaining.

Beyond these points, the authors can then re-assess whether or not to include the role of myoglobin on monocyte/macrophage infiltration on the site of injury and the phagocytic activity of these recruited macrophages as part of this manuscript.”</p></disp-quote><p>We did not intend to make a claim about efferocytosis or phagocytosis of monocytes/macrophages. We have amended the title and text to omit “phagocyte dysfunction”, as mentioned in Issue A.</p><p>That being said, both reviewers requested additional study of macrophages, and provided various options for how to address the underlying question of what macrophages in mPI are doing. Reviewer #2 recommended functional assays of phagocytic capacity in vitro, so we assessed the impact of myoglobin on M1-differentiated RAW264.7 macrophages using an efferocytosis assay. Results showed that Mb treatment caused decreased efferocytosis in vitro, which is now reported in Figure 4—figure supplement 2A. Note that we maximised cell viability during this Mb treatment assay by using an M1 polarisation protocol [1] with a lower dose of IFNγ (10 ng/ml instead of 20 ng/ml) and shorter duration (see Supplementary Methods). We have placed this data in the Supplement (and do not mention it in the Discussion) because we believe impaired efferocytosis could be a side-effect of cell stress, and not necessarily a specific effect of Mb. Mb treatment induced ROS in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4—figure supplement 2B).</p><p>In tissue sections ex vivo, TUNEL staining (for apoptotic debris) was far higher in saline-treated mPI than in CTX or DFO-treated mPI (Figure 5—figure supplement 1), but we were unable to find co-localization of F4/80 and TUNEL staining in our samples, so we could not measure increased or decreased co-localization (as a readout of macrophage engulfment of debris). The increased TUNEL staining might have arisen from increased production (e.g., secondary progression of the wound) or from decreased uptake (e.g., impaired efferocytosis).</p><p>Manuscript revisions:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Removed the poor wording that suggested a claim about macrophage phagocytosis</p></list-item><list-item><p>New data in Figure 4—figure supplement 2</p></list-item><list-item><p>New data in Figure 5—figure supplement 1</p></list-item></list><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Issue D. Vasculature</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>“Another aspect is how cells reach the injured area. In the Discussion section, there is reference to a SupplFig6, which seems to be not the good one in the document. In the FigS6 described in the text, it is mentioned that cells are kind of &quot;stopped&quot; at the boundaries of the damage. This is very interesting. If the vessels are physically flattened or squashed by the injury, extravasation can not occur properly, in comparison with cardiotoxin. Then the role of myoglobin in extravasation, or in the &quot;reshaping&quot; of the vessels after the removal of the magnet would be interesting to investigate. Of note, in the myoglobin deficient mice, the vascular network is increased, favoring immune cell infiltration.</p><p>Given that the study is already quite huge with numerous experiments, the reviewer is reluctant to ask for additional experiments… Also the points mentioned above, about the role of myoglobin in immune cell infiltration and the role of myoglobin in the vessel properties should be at least discussed, if they are not experimentally addressed.</p><p>– Discussion end of page 10. Unfortunately, suplFig6 is missing (and is not called in the result section).”</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for the omission of SupplFig6 from the journal version. The previous version of Suppl. Figure 6 (in bioRxiv) showed side-by-side comparisons of young and old saline-treated mPI, and it has been included in the current submission (renumbered as Figure 3—figure supplement 2). We also provide additional data (Figure 2—figure supplement 1) showing cells reaching, or failing to reach, the injured area at day 3 post-injury. Specifically, it shows that the uncompressed periphery of mPI wounds have intact immune cells, while the compressed region lacks viable immune infiltrate (Figure 2—figure supplement 1).</p><p>In addition, we provide new data showing damaged blood vessels in Mb-wildtype mPI compared to intact vasculature in CTX at day 3 post-injury (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). Damaged vasculature has a number of important implications, which are now elaborated in the Discussion at lines 371-377, as follows: “Pressure has been reported to cause disruption to arterial supply, venous clearance, and lymphatic drainage (4, 51, 52), although not always (79). Lymph vessels are occluded at very low pressure, and impaired lymphatic flow can persist after pressure is removed (80). Impaired circulation and/or impaired drainage could cause waste factors such as myoglobin or iron to accumulate in the mPI, and could impair the influx of iron detoxification factors. Poor drainage also occurs in chronic ulcers of venous insufficiency, lymphedema, and other vascular diseases. Toxicity from globin iron might be a shared pathology among these wounds.”</p><p>Manuscript revisions:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>New data in Figure 1—figure supplement 2</p></list-item><list-item><p>New data in Figure 2—figure supplement 1</p></list-item><list-item><p>Next text about damaged vasculature (Results section, lines 120-123, Discussion section, lines 371-377)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Figure 3—figure supplement 2 (previously Suppl.

Comparing mPI and CTX wounds</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>“The authors hypothesis regarding the role of Mb in the pathophysiology of ulcerative pressure injuries is interesting. However, the work here seems quite preliminary with major points remaining to be clarified before considering reaching the author's conclusion. I find the direct comparison made between the two types of injury, CTX and mPI, difficult to interpret. From my perspective, a more rigorous and systematic comparison between the two models of injury would be key to convincingly convey the findings of this work, especially regarding key features impacting repair.

We agree this might be interesting, provided we also bear in mind the destruction of vessels in mPI (described in Figure 1—figure supplement 2 and Issue D above). Damaged vasculature could explain why iron-containing waste accumulates in mPI, while the same waste gets removed in CTX. To assess levels of globin proteins in the wound, we performed IF for myoglobin and hemoglobin in mPI at day 3 post-injury. Results showed higher levels of myoglobin and hemoglobin in mPI than in CTX (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A-H and Figure 2—figure supplement 2Q-R, for <italic>n</italic> = 3, with all wounds saline-treated).</p><p>To assess iron detoxification factors in the wound, we performed IF for haptoglobin and hemopexin (Figure 2—figure supplement 2I-P and Figure 2—figure supplement 2S-T), which were very low, relative to our positive controls (liver and spleen, not shown). We found no significant difference between mPI and CTX at day 3 post-injury. Possible interpretations of this finding are that day 3 might be too late to see the peak of iron detoxification for the CTX injury, and the damaged vasculature of mPI might decrease the influx of iron detoxification factors into high-iron mPI wounds.</p><p>Manuscript revisions:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>New data in Figure 2—figure supplement 2A-H and Figure 2—figure supplement 2Q-R</p></list-item><list-item><p>New data in Figure 2—figure supplement 2I-P and Figure 2—figure supplement 2S-T</p></list-item><list-item><p>Next text about damaged vasculature (Results section, lines 120-123, Discussion section, lines 371-377)</p></list-item></list><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Issue H.

On the same token, characterizing macrophage infiltrates (number per surface area of injured tissue) and phenotype would potentially provide valuable information to link observed differences between types of injuries to Mb. Ideally, assessment of leukocyte and macrophages infiltration and populations would be analyzed by flow cytometry after injured (vs. uninjured) tissue dissociation (enzymatic or mechanical). Otherwise, although less quantitative, this can also be done by cell infiltration using specific immunostaining and quantification (cell number/injured tissue surface area).</p></disp-quote><p>To assess leukocytes in mPI wounds, we performed immunostaining for CD38 and myeloperoxidase at day 7 post-injury. CD38 is a marker of CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup>, B and Natural Killer cells, and myeloperoxidase is a marker of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs/NETosis). Immunostaining (Figure 6—figure supplement 3A-G) showed that myeloperoxidase staining was high in mPI+Saline, and lower in DFO-treated. The lower level of myeloperoxidase staining in DFO-treated (day 7) resembled the level in CTX injury at day 3 (<italic>n</italic> = 3 replicates each). Immunostaining for CD38 (Figure 6—figure supplement 3H-N) showed similar expression levels between mPI+Saline at day 7 and CTX+Saline (CTX) at day 3, and increased expression in mPI+DFO at day 7, compared to CTX (<italic>n</italic> = 3 replicates each). These findings are now mentioned in the Results section alongside CitH3 and MerTK immuno-staining, but are not mentioned in the discussion. As some of our staining may not localize to cells but to cell debris and extracellular molecules, we chose not to quantify fluorescence based on cell number per tissue area. Instead, we provide quantification using fluorescence thresholding [2] of images of injured sections, and report the average of the injured frames for each wound/mouse.</p><p>We also performed immuno-staining with additional antibodies that failed quality-control checks; these were for Ly6G, a marker of neutrophils, and CD86, a marker of dendritic cells, macrophages, B cells and other antigen-presenting cells.</p><p>For the broader goal of characterising immune response in mPIs, we did already measure many cytokines and general immune-related factors at different timepoints. Surprisingly few of the analytes had any significance change upon Mb knock-out or DFO treatment (Supplementary Files 1d, 1f and 1g), despite the large fold-changes seen in damage-related epitopes of oxidative stress. We wish to avoid making any claims about the immune system in mPI, other than the absence of intact immune cells in untreated day-3 mPI wounds, and the DFO-induced increase in the presence/influx of immune cells at days 7 &amp; 10. These serendipitous findings about immune cells are not required for any of the five hypotheses listed in our introduction.</p><p>Manuscript revisions:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>New data in Figure 6—figure supplement 3</p></list-item></list><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Issue J.

Significance</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Significance):</p><p>“This study is of interest because it provides insights on muscle regeneration after an injury that may occur in daily life just as contusion, or crush, to the contrary of the whole muscle necrosis induced by cardiotoxin (the main model used in the field). In that aspect, it is more physiological and of interest for the readers in the fields of in muscle regeneration and tissue trauma. The study is descriptive, but is very well conducted and well discussed. Additional experiments investigating the impact of myoglobin on vessel properties/extravasation of immune cells would raise the impact of the study but the study is publishable as it is (with editing as suggest above). The field of expertise of the reviewer is muscle regeneration and inflammation.”</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Significance):</p><p>“The field of tissue repair and regeneration is an exciting field and improving our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in muscle tissue injury has clear and impactful clinical applications. The pathophysiological mechanism involving Mb that the author address in this work has the potential to interest both basic science and clinical researchers and can potentially benefit not only the field of skeletal muscle regeneration but also the field of cardiac remodeling.”</p></disp-quote><p>We are very grateful to the reviewers for their insightful and highly constructive feedback.</p><p>Issue L.
