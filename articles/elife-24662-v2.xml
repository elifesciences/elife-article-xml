We examined the impact of ageing on the ultrastructure and function of mitochondria in mouse and fruit flies (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>) by electron cryo-tomography and respirometry. We discovered distinct age-related changes in both model organisms. Mitochondrial function and ultrastructure are maintained in mouse heart, whereas subpopulations of mitochondria from mouse liver show age-related changes in membrane morphology. Subpopulations of mitochondria from young and old mouse kidney resemble those described for apoptosis. In aged flies, respiratory activity is compromised and the production of peroxide radicals is increased. In about 50% of mitochondria from old flies, the inner membrane organization breaks down. This establishes a clear link between inner membrane architecture and functional decline. Mitochondria were affected by ageing to very different extents, depending on the organism and possibly on the degree to which tissues within the same organism are protected against mitochondrial damage.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24662.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24662.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>ageing</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial inner membrane</kwd><kwd>membrane structure</kwd><kwd>cryo-tomography</kwd><kwd>respiratory activity</kwd><kwd>peroxide radicals</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kühlbrandt</surname><given-names>Werner</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kühlbrandt</surname><given-names>Werner</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Respiratory activity and inner membrane organisation of mitochondria from <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> break down during ageing, but mouse heart mitochondria appear to be protected against age-related damage.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitochondria produce most of the ATP in non-photosynthetic eukaryotes, providing the energy to drive a multitude of cellular processes. Mitochondria have an inner membrane, which surrounds the matrix, and an outer membrane, which surrounds the inner membrane and separates the mitochondrial compartments from the cytoplasm. In addition to a multitude of soluble enzymes and ribosomes, the matrix houses the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA), which in humans and flies encodes 13 hydrophobic subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation system. Thus nearly all mitochondrial proteins are nuclear-encoded and imported into the different mitochondrial compartments by a set of protein translocases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pfanner et al., 2014</xref>). The oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system consists of the respiratory chain complexes I to IV and the mitochondrial F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub>-ATP synthase, sometimes referred to as complex V. Complexes I to IV transfer electrons from soluble electron donors to molecular oxygen. In this process, complexes I, III and IV generate an electrochemical proton potential across the mitochondrial inner membrane that is used by the ATP synthase to produce ATP by rotary catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leslie et al., 1999</xref>). Oxidative phosphorylation occurs mostly, if not entirely, in the deeply invaginated cristae of the inner mitochondrial membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gilkerson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vogel et al., 2006</xref>). The ATP synthase forms long rows of dimers at the tightly curved cristae ridges, while the respiratory chain complexes are confined to the remaining membrane regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davies et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Paumard et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Ageing has long been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction. In mammals, the age-related weakening of physiological functions frequently goes along with a decline in health. While there has been considerable progress in the study of age-associated diseases, the biological mechanisms of ageing remain elusive. Ageing is attributed to either ‘programmed’ or ‘damage-based’ processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Magalhaes, 2011</xref>). More than 50 years ago, Harman postulated that ageing results from the accumulation of molecular damage caused by oxygen radicals, often called reactive oxygen species (ROS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harman, 1956</xref>). Oxygen radicals are side products of electron transfer reactions in respiratory chain complexes I and III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dröse and Brandt, 2012</xref>). Later refinements of Harman’s free radical theory of ageing postulated that an impairment of respiratory chain function increases ROS production, resulting in greater mtDNA damage, which in turn would compromise the turnover of damaged respiratory chain complexes, resulting in a vicious circle of damage and decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harman, 1972</xref>). The mitochondrial DNA mutator mouse model has provided experimental evidence of a causative link between mtDNA mutations and an ageing phenotype in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Trifunovic et al., 2004</xref>), although mitochondrial defects in this model were found not to be associated with an increase in ROS production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Trifunovic et al., 2005</xref>). Several other key predictions of the free-radical theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stuart et al., 2014</xref>) have also not been substantiated. For example, in some model organisms, such as the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, moderately elevated levels of ROS, induced either chemically or through genetically engineered defects in the respiratory chain, actually increase lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heidler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yang and Hekimi, 2010</xref>). In the same organism, removal of the ROS-scavenging superoxide dismutase (SOD) does not increase oxidative damage to mtDNA and has no apparent effect on lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doonan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gruber et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Van Raamsdonk and Hekimi, 2009</xref>). In the fly, SOD knockouts do have a decreased lifespan, but they do not accumulate mtDNA mutations more quickly than wildtype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Itsara et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In addition to energy conversion and ATP production, the oxidative phosphorylation system also has a key role in shaping the inner membrane cristae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davies et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Paumard et al., 2002</xref>). Accumulating oxidative damage and OXPHOS dysfunction might, therefore, be expected to affect mitochondrial ultrastructure, which should be visible by electron microscopy. Recent analyses of yeast and mouse mitochondria show that a defect in the supra-molecular organisation of the ATP synthase results in aberrant cristae morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davies et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mourier et al., 2014</xref>). In aged cultures of the short-lived filamentous fungus <italic>Podospora anserina</italic>, the inner membrane strikingly vesiculates and ATP synthase dimers break down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brust et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Daum et al., 2013</xref>). However, little is known about the impact of ageing on mitochondrial morphology and membrane structure in metazoans. Previous studies of the ultrastructure of mitochondria in mouse liver by electron microscopy of thin plastic sections revealed anomalous cristae in a subpopulation of the organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wilson and Franks, 1975</xref>). A study of mouse skeletal muscle mitochondria found that mitochondria from animals that had exercised in an electrically-driven treadmill occasionally lost their cristae, whereas no differences were observed in non-trained animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ludatscher et al., 1983</xref>). Mitochondria from aged <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> flight muscle were found to have cristae ‘swirls’ that were attributed to oxidative damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Walker and Benzer, 2004</xref>), and mitochondria in aged <italic>Drosophila repleta</italic> heart muscle were enlarged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sohal, 1970</xref>).</p><p>We chose <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (average lifespan &gt;50 days depending on environmental conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Linford et al., 2013</xref>]) and mouse (average life span 107 weeks for females and 114 weeks for males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Turturro et al., 2002</xref>]) as two well-established metazoan ageing models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cho et al., 2011</xref>) for a systematic study of mitochondrial ultrastructure, respiration and ROS production in young and old animals. Our results reveal clear tissue- and organism-related age-specific differences, establishing an apparent link between mitochondrial ultrastructure and function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Effects of ageing on the function and ultrastructure of mouse mitochondria</title><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Mitochondrial OXPHOS activity and ROS homeostasis</title><p>To find out how ageing impacts mitochondrial function and ultrastructure, mitochondria from heart, liver and kidney of young (20 weeks) and old (80–96 weeks) mice were isolated for electron cryo-tomography (cryoET) and high-resolution respirometry. Isolated mitochondria were incubated with respiratory substrates that deliver electrons at the level of complex I (pyruvate, glutamate and malate) or complex II (succinate and rotenone). The mitochondrial oxygen consumption was recorded under phosphorylating (addition of ADP and P<sub>i</sub>; state 3), non-phosphorylating (addition of oligomycin to inhibit ATP synthase; state 4) and uncoupled conditions (addition of CCCP). Mitochondrial respiratory rates normalised to protein content were found to be highest in heart mitochondria, ~2–3 fold lower in kidney and ~5 fold lower in liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In line with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mulligan et al., 2014</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">; Weindruch et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wilson et al., 1975</xref>), our investigation showed no significant differences in respiratory rates between mitochondria isolated from 20-week-old and 80-week-old heart tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), and no age-related change in the rate of ATP production was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Moreover, maximal activities of key mitochondrial enzymes remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These results prompted us to investigate how ageing impacts mitochondrial ROS homeostasis. We first assessed the peroxide yield, defined as the hydrogen production rate normalized to the mitochondrial respiration assessed under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Votyakova and Reynolds, 2001</xref>). Surprisingly, no age-dependent increase in hydrogen peroxide release relative to the amount of oxygen consumed was observed in mitoch﻿ondria isolated from heart, liver or kidney (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To investigate ROS homeostasis further, we analysed the steady-state levels and activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD1, SOD2) and catalase in mitochondria from young and old heart, liver or kidney by quantitative western blot electrophoresis and gel densitometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This revealed a tendency towards lower levels of antioxidant enzymes in aged mice. Catalase activity was reduced by 30% in old mouse liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) and SOD activity was almost halved in old mouse kidney (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24662.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Bioenergetic and functional analysis of mitochondria from heart, liver and kidney from young (20 weeks old; white bars) and old (80–96 weeks old; black bars) mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Oxygen consumption rate of mitochondria isolated from young (n = 7–8) or old (n = 8) animals.

Mitochondria isolated from young mouse heart showed morphologies typical of tissues with a high energy demand. Stacks of parallel, thin and flat lamellar cristae were embedded in a dense matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, left, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). Cristae frequently appeared discontinuous in 2D slices, but 3D volumes indicated that this was due to fenestration of the lamellar disks rather than to disconnected cristae vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Crista junctions were circular (70%, average diameter 15 ± 2 nm) or slightly elongated (30%, 16 ± 1 × 29 ± 2 nm, dimensions ± standard deviations measured in the typical tomogram of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, top row, second from left). Most cristae were branched and connected to the inter-membrane space by more than one junction. They were also highly interconnected through narrow apertures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In 20% of the mitochondria examined, membranes of two or more neighbouring cristae were so closely appressed that there was almost no matrix between them. These regions often showed membrane ‘swirls’ of high and variable membrane curvature, involving several neighbouring crista lamellae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). There was no apparent difference between the structures of isolated sub-sarcolemmal and interfibrillar mitochondria. Comparing mitochondria from young and old mouse hearts indicated similar morphologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, right), except that about 24% of mitochondria from aged heart tissue had some exceptionally wide cristae (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>).<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-24662-media1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24662.004</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Tomographic volume and 3D segmentation of the mitochondrion from young mouse heart shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, upper left, right hand panel.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24662.004">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24662.004</ext-link></p></caption></media><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24662.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Cryo-ET of heart mitochondria from young (left, 20 weeks old) and old (right, 80–96 weeks old) mice.</title><p>Upper panel: slices through tomographic volumes (scale bars, 250 nm).

To estimate their volumes, voids and mitochondria were approximated as simple geometrical shapes (spheres or cylinders for voids, cylinders for mitochondria). In the three segmented organelles, the voids occupied on average 6% of the total mitochondrial volume. The voids were not internal vesicles, but were connected to the inter-membrane space via apertures of varying size. In some cases two such connections were observed on opposite ends of the voids, resulting in a toroid or doughnut-shaped matrix. In other cases, the outer membrane appeared to protrude into the inner membrane voids. The cristae extending from the boundary membrane into the matrix looked normal, but none protruded into the matrix from the membrane defining the voids.

In the remaining 25% of old fly mitochondria, the inner membrane assumed a variety of non-standard shapes. Several organelles that were identified as mitochondria by their characteristic double membrane and dense matrix appeared to lack cristae entirely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, top right) or the cristae were minimally developed (10%).

As far as possible, mitochondria from different organisms and tissues were treated in the same way. The fact that there are clear differences between mitochondria from young and old mouse liver, for example, and that these mitichondria look different from heart and kidney mitochondria allows us to conclude that the isolation process itself does not affect mitochondrial membrane structure significantly. We conclude further that the different appearance of the young mouse liver mitochondria is not an artefact of isolation, but a genuine feature.</p><p>We found a clear correlation between OXPHOS capacity and the number of inner membrane cristae per unit volume. Mitochondrial respiration was highest in mouse heart and young fly mitochondria, which were entirely filled with closely stacked, parallel cristae. This arrangement, which is characteristic for tissues with high respiratory activity, maximises the membrane area available for oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davies et al., 2011</xref>). In mouse heart and young fly mitochondria, we frequently observed cristae fenestration, which is a morphological characteristic of tissues with high energy demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Slautterback, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Smith, 1963</xref>). Fenestration increases the total length of cristae ridges that harbour the ATP synthase, and hence the potential for ATP production. By comparison, mouse liver mitochondria had fewer cristae and the matrix was both denser and more voluminous, in line with the lower respiratory rate and higher metabolic activity of liver cells. Mouse kidney mitochondria were structurally more diverse. Remarkably, a significant proportion of kidney mitochondria from both young and old mice had a morphology typical of apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Scorrano et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sun et al., 2007</xref>). This correlates well with the recently reported continuous turnover and short lifespan of kidney cells of about 30–60 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rinkevich et al., 2014</xref>), compared to the 200–400 day lifespan of rat hepatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Macdonald, 1961</xref>) and the very low turnover rates for cardiomyocytes of 1.3–4% per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Malliaras et al., 2013</xref>). The peroxide yield correlated inversely with respiratory activity and was highest in mouse liver and lowest in mouse heart, suggesting that liver mitochondria may be affected by oxidative damage more severely than mitochondria from cardiac tissue.</p><p>Unexpectedly, levels of mitochondrial respiration, respiratory chain activity, hydrogen peroxide production or steady-state levels of antioxidant enzymes did not vary greatly with age, indicating moderate changes at most in respiratory rates and hydrogen peroxide yield in ageing mice. This contravenes the free-radical theory of ageing, which postulates a major age-related increase in ROS production and respiratory defects. In line with our results on mitochondrial function, the morphology of mouse heart mitochondria did not change much with age. By contrast, one out of four mitochondria from old mouse livers had a striking, age-specific phenotype characterized by a central matrix void. We found the same feature in mitochondria of mtDNA mutator mouse livers, where it was considerably more prevalent. Although we do not yet know what causes the voids and how they affect mitochondrial function, they evidently reflect a specific reorganisation rather than a random breakdown of the inner membrane. The lack of sharp cristae ridges and crista junctions in the void membranes suggests that these mebranes do not contain ATP synthase dimers and hence do not contribute to oxidative phosphorylation. The fact that mitochondria with these central voids have otherwise normal cristae may explain why no age-related reduction in overall respiratory activity was evident. If the majority of mitochondria are normal, they can apparently compensate for a loss of inner membrane area available for oxidative phosphorylation in 25% of the total population. Similar ring- or cup-shaped mitochondria with central cavities have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ghadially, 1988</xref>) and ascribed to the effects of drugs, toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">David and Kettler, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stephens and Bils, 1965</xref>) or oxidative damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ding et al., 2012</xref>). Although the cavities found in these earlier studies were lined by both the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes, the central voids described here may likewise result from such damage, as damage to mtDNA is known to accumulate in liver tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barazzoni et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yen et al., 1991</xref>). If denatured respiratory chain complexes are cleared from the membrane, the lipids left behind would be expected to form such featureless membrane regions expanding into the matrix interior. The matrix granules that we found in old liver and kidney mitochondria may consist at least in part of denatured respiratory chain complexes, consistent with their absence from old heart mitochondria, in which we did not observe matrix granules. Indeed, it has been shown that these granules contain complex IV subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hertsens et al., 1986</xref>) in addition to lipids, glycoproteins and calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ghadially, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jacob et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, changes in the membrane structure of mouse mitochondria were organ-dependent, in a way that suggests different degrees of resilience against ageing. Mouse cardiac mitochondria showed the highest respiratory rates but appeared to be protected most effectively from oxidative damage, as indicated by their low and unchanged peroxide yield. Again, these findings contradict the classical free-radical theory, which would predict that cardiomyocytes with their high density of highly active mitochondria produce more ROS and thus age faster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stuart et al., 2014</xref>). An analysis of DNA methylation has shown that heart tissue ages more slowly than would be predicted chronologically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Horvath, 2013</xref>). This observation is in line with our findings, which thus imply that mitochondria in vital organs with slow regeneration, such as the heart, are protected from damage more effectively than mitochondria in other organs. The effect may be genetically controlled through the expression levels of superoxide dismutase or catalase. Overexpression of catalase targeted to mitochondria has been shown to attenuate ageing effects in the murine heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dai et al., 2009</xref>). However, ROS signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lenaz, 2012</xref>) requires a fine equilibrium of ROS production and sequestration that is probably tissue-dependent.</p><p>The most striking differences in our study, both with respect to morphology and activity, were found between mitochondria from young and old <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. About half of the mitochondria from old flies had lost the standard organization of the inner membrane into boundary membranes with well-developed cristae and crista junctions. Many had round or concentric cristae that lacked sharp ridges. In extreme cases, cristae or crista junctions were completely absent. Measurements of respiratory activity in old fly mitochondria indicated that oxygen uptake was decreased by a factor of almost two and peroxide yield was increased by more than 50%, in line with increased mitochondrial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in live ageing <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cochemé et al., 2011</xref>). These results suggest strongly that about 50% of the old fly mitochondria are inactive, consistent with the observation that about 25% of the mitochondria in old flies lack normal cristae or crista junctions and that an additional 18% deviate from the standard morphology. Such a drastic breakdown of mitochondrial structure and function would result in the death of the organism within a short period.</p><p>It is interesting to compare our results on mouse and fruit fly mitochondria to similar studies on the filamentous fungus <italic>P. anserina</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brust et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Daum et al., 2013</xref>), another well-characterized ageing model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Scheckhuber and Osiewacz, 2008</xref>). <italic>P. anserina</italic> has an average lifespan of only 18 days, three times shorter than <italic>D. melanogaster,</italic> and almost 50 times shorter than mouse. Morphological changes in <italic>P. anserina</italic> mitochondria were both more homogenous and more extreme than those in fruit flies, affecting about 80% of organelles from senescent populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brust et al., 2010</xref>). Cryo-ET of aged <italic>P. anserina</italic> mitochondria or inner membrane vesicles indicated that the cristae had receded into the inner boundary membrane and that ATP synthase dimers dissociated into monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Daum et al., 2013</xref>). In terms of inner membrane morphology, old <italic>P. anserina</italic> mitochondria resembled the quasi-apoptotic subpopulation in mouse kidney, the tissue with the highest turnover rate in our study, suggesting similar mechanisms of programmed ageing. On the one hand, the higher proportion of functional mitochondria in old flies indicates that the decline is less complete and slower than that in <italic>P. anserina</italic>. On the other hand, it is much more rapid in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> than in mouse, suggesting a link between the complexity of an organism and the rate of ageing.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The increasing complexity of organisms goes along with an increasingly complex ageing process. For the primitive multicellular eukaryote <italic>P. anserina,</italic> a straightforward correspondence between age, mitochondrial ultrastructure and organization of the mitochondrial ATP synthase has been shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brust et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Daum et al., 2013</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we now establish a link between inner membrane morphology and functionality, which correlates closely with age and agility. In mouse, the relationship between inner membrane ultrastructure, function and age is less clear-cut and evidently tissue-dependent. While mouse heart mitochondria show little if any change with age, a quarter of liver mitochondria display a severe, age-related phenotype that does not seem to result in an overall reduction of oxidative phosphorylation. A relatively high proportion of kidney mitochondria in young and old mice resemble those observed during apoptosis, consistent with the high turnover of kidney cells. Our data thus indicate major differences in how ageing relates to mitochondrial morphology and function in metazoans. In mouse, we find no evidence of age-related progressive impairment of the oxidative phosphorylation system or increase of mitochondrial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production, whereas both effects are evident in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse breeding</title><p>All mice mutations in this study were on an inbred C57Bl/6N nuclear background.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Sriram Subramaniam as Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Luigi Ferrucci and Terrence Frey.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Brandt et al., present a thorough study of the effects of aging in two model systems, mice (including mtDNA mutator mice) and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> that combines careful measurements of critical mitochondrial function, enzyme content, and the production of damaging reactive oxygen species (in the form of hydrogen peroxide) on purified mitochondria with state of the art cryo-electron tomorgraphy to elucidate changes in inner membrane topography. The goal is to investigate the hypothesis that aging is manifest in cellular mitochondria and mediated by increased production of reactive oxygen species. The study includes comparison of aging on the structures of mitochondria in three critical mouse tissues; heart, liver and kidney. <italic>Drosophila</italic> mitochondria were isolated from whole organisms. Except for the aged <italic>Drosophila</italic> mitochondria, the physiological measurements and enzyme contents do not change dramatically (or in many cases even significantly) with aging, but there are dramatic ultrastructural changes. Overall, the study combines careful measurements of critical mitochondrial function, enzyme content, and the production of damaging reactive oxygen species (in the form of hydrogen peroxide) on purified mitochondria with state of the art cryo-electron tomorgraphy to elucidate changes in inner membrane topography.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Some additional references to include: Sun et al., 2007 who studied inner membrane remodeling extensively in a HeLa cell culture model of apoptosis that is relevant to the changes observed in this paper. These changes were also observed by Merkwirth et al., 2008 who manipulated the protein OPA1 that regulates crista junction structure.</p><p>2) One of the reviewers appeared surprised that the authors did not detect a reticular structure of mitochondria network in the heart data, since this type of structure has been identified in other studies, or substantial differences between the sub-sarcolemmal and inter-myofibrillar mitochondria, since clear morphological differences have been identified with much less sophisticated imaging. The authors should comment on whether such structures may have been present but missed, given the isolation techniques used.</p><p>3) The analysis of the tomographic data is largely descriptive, with percentages given for the number of mitochondria falling into each category. In the majority of places there is no indication of the number of mitochondria considered, nor the number of animals from which they came. This makes the percentages hard to assess. The authors should provide a table detailing the number of animals and the number of mitochondria analyzed for each condition. Extracting as many quantitative parameters as possible to describe the morphological phenotypes would also be a good idea. Adjectives such as &quot;several&quot;, &quot;some&quot;, etc. should be replaced by numbers wherever possible. Additionally, the authors should clarify what fraction of inner membrane is lost to the &quot;voids&quot;. Circular or slightly elongated crista junctions are mentioned but without sizes specified. Please provide measurements of crista junction sizes of a representative sample.</p><p>4) Since purified mitochondria are being analyzed, discussion of possible changes in structure during purification should be included. Also, in most of the tomograms, the cristae look fine, but in the young mouse liver, the cristae seem enlarged (bloated) and the matrix dense as if the mitochondrion is in a condensed state.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24662.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) Some additional references to include: Sun et al., 2007 who studied inner membrane remodeling extensively in a HeLa cell culture model of apoptosis that is relevant to the changes observed in this paper.

We would like to point out that cryo-tomography of isolated mitochondria cannot visualize intact mitochondrial networks, because they are necessarily disrupted during isolation. The isolated mitochondria from both cell types would look very similar, even if the networks may look different in plastic sections.</p><p> <italic>3) The analysis of the tomographic data is largely descriptive, with percentages given for the number of mitochondria falling into each category.

The fact that there are clear differences e.g. between young and old mouse liver, and that these look different from heart and kidney mitochondria allows us to conclude that the isolation process itself does not affect mitochondrial membrane structure significantly. We can further conclude that the different appearance of the young mouse liver mitochondria is not an artefact of isolation, but a genuine feature. These points are now discussed in the first paragraph in the Discussion of the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
