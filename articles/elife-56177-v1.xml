Here, we demonstrate using gonadectomy that the sex-specific impact of reduced hepatic mTORC2 is not reversed by depletion of sex hormones. Intriguingly, we find that ovariectomy uncouples lifespan from metabolic health, with ovariectomized females having improved survival despite paradoxically having increased adiposity and decreased control of blood glucose levels. Further, ovariectomy unexpectedly promotes midlife survival of female mice lacking hepatic mTORC2, significantly increasing the survival of those mice that do not develop cancer. In addition to identifying a sex hormone-dependent role for hepatic mTORC2 in female longevity, our results demonstrate that metabolic health is not inextricably linked to lifespan in mammals, and highlight the importance of evaluating healthspan in mammalian longevity studies.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The high frequency and co-morbidity of age-related disease in the aged limits the benefits that can be achieved by targeting them individually. An alternative approach, which could simultaneously treat or prevent many age-related diseases, is to target the aging process itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kennedy et al., 2014</xref>). However, extending lifespan without also extending healthspan is generally considered undesirable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kaeberlein, 2018</xref>), and not all geroprotective interventions may necessarily improve healthspan. Indeed, a recent study in <italic>C. elegans</italic> found that lifespan and healthspan can be uncoupled in this organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bansal et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, there is a clear need to assess healthspan in mammalian longevity studies.</p><p>The mechanistic Target Of Rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that serves as a central regulator of metabolism and aging and is found in two distinct protein complexes, mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kennedy and Lamming, 2016</xref>). mTORC1 is acutely sensitive to the action of the FDA-approved pharmaceutical rapamycin, and inhibition of mTORC1, either genetically or by rapamycin, extends lifespan and healthspan in model organisms ranging from yeast to mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arriola Apelo et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bitto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harrison et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaeberlein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kapahi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Medvedik et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Powers et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vellai et al., 2003</xref>). Pharmaceutical or genetic inhibition of mTOR signaling tends to extend female lifespan to a greater extent than that of males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lamming, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Miller et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>However, chronic treatment of mice with rapamycin induces a variety of metabolic side effects. We and others have shown that many of these effects are mediated by ‘off-target’ inhibition of mTORC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arriola Apelo et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dumas and Lamming, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kleinert et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kleinert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lamming et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sarbassov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schreiber et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schreiber et al., 2015</xref>). These studies highlighted an important gap in our knowledge – namely, the contribution of decreased mTORC2 signaling to the effect of rapamycin on lifespan. Studies in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> have not convincingly addressed this question, as reduced mTORC2 signaling can be beneficial or detrimental in <italic>C. elegans </italic>depending on the tissue and diet, while overexpression of <italic>Rictor</italic>, which encodes an essential protein component of mTORC2, extends the lifespan of flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mizunuma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Robida-Stubbs et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Soukas et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Deletion of <italic>Rictor</italic> in several distinct tissues or inducibly in the whole body of adult mice negatively impacts survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chellappa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lamming et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yu et al., 2019</xref>). Intriguingly, loss of hepatic mTORC2 specifically reduces male lifespan, with no effect of liver-specific deletion of <italic>Rictor</italic> on the lifespan of female mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lamming et al., 2014b</xref>). This difference between males and females was not due to sex-based differences in the efficiency of <italic>Rictor</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lamming et al., 2014b</xref>). This sex-specific effect of hepatic mTORC2 inhibition may help to explain why rapamycin has a stronger effect on female lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lamming, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Miller et al., 2014</xref>). Many sexually dimorphic responses, including to geroprotective interventions, are mediated in part by gonadal sex hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garratt et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garratt et al., 2018</xref>). We hypothesized that gonadectomy would either protect male mice from the loss of hepatic <italic>Rictor,</italic> or sensitize female mice to the loss of hepatic <italic>Rictor</italic>.</p><p>We therefore examined how mice lacking hepatic <italic>Rictor</italic> responded to gonadectomy. We find that the male-specific negative impact of <italic>Rictor</italic> loss on overall survival persists following gonadectomy. While pre-pubertal gonadectomy negatively impacted the metabolic health of both liver <italic>Rictor</italic> knockout (L-RKO) mice and their wild-type littermates, it did not negatively impact survival, with ovariectomized mice in particular surviving longer than sham-surgery controls. Intriguingly, while as we expected based on our prior results, the overall survival of sham-surgery L-RKO female mice was not statistically different from that of female wild type controls, there was an apparent reduction in the survival of L-RKO Sham females between 400–800 days of age that was not observed in ovariectomized L-RKO mice. An in-depth analysis suggests that pre-pubertal ovariectomy promotes the midlife survival of female mice lacking hepatic <italic>Rictor</italic>, through protection from a non-cancer related cause of death. We conclude that there is a sex-specific role for hepatic mTORC2 in survival that is dependent upon sex hormones, and that ovariectomy uncouples metabolic health and longevity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Depletion of hepatic <italic>Rictor</italic> reduces the overall lifespan of male mice independently of sex hormones</title><p>We castrated male L-RKO mice and their wild-type littermates, and ovariectomized female L-RKO mice and their wild-type littermates, between 3 and 4 weeks of age; sham surgeries were performed on mice of both sexes and genotypes to control for any effects of the surgical procedures. We examined the longevity of all 8 groups of animals, separately analyzing females and males due to the expected sexually dimorphic effects. While cause of death analysis is difficult in mice, we performed gross necropsy on as many animals as possible, noting the presence or absence of observable cancers. As we expected for C57BL/6J mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brayton et al., 2012</xref>), we observed cancer in approximately half of the necropsied animals. There was no statistically significant difference in the frequency of observed cancer at necropsy between groups of male mice (chi-square test, p=0.06), although cancer was identified much more frequently in L-RKO CAST mice than in any other group of male mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We initially stratified our analysis of mice by the presence or absence of observable cancers at necropsy. We performed a Cox regression analysis to identify the overall effects of genotype and surgery, and then calculated the corrected two-sided log-rank sum p-value comparing individual curves for those effects identified as significant in the regression analysis. Intriguingly, there was no effect of hepatic <italic>Rictor</italic> deletion on the overall longevity of male mice that died with observed cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast, there was a dramatic effect of <italic>Rictor</italic> loss on the survival of male mice (HR = 4.84, p=0.0014) in which cancer was not observed during our gross necropsy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

To our surprise, we observed neither effect; instead, castration failed to protect male L-RKO mice, while ovariectomy had a statistically significant beneficial effect on the midlife survival of female L-RKO mice, and may have had a mild positive effect on wild-type mice as well, increasing the median lifespan.</p><p>In contrast to our 2014 study, which found an effect of hepatic <italic>Rictor</italic> deletion only on male lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lamming et al., 2014b</xref>), here we also observed decreased midlife survival of female L-RKO mice. It is well appreciated that the lifespan of a mouse strain can vary substantially between laboratories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nadon et al., 2008</xref>), and the relatively short lifespan of the wild-type control mice in our 2014 study, which was conducted in a different animal facility, may have obscured this difference. The reason for the decreased overall survival of male L-RKO mice and the decreased survival of female L-RKO mice during midlife is unknown; while our study suggests that this cause of death is not related to cancer, as we performed only a gross necropsy, we cannot at this time rule out the possibility that unobserved neoplasms contribute to these deaths. The mechanism by which ovariectomy protects L-RKO female mice during midlife is also unknown. Future carefully designed studies to assess the organismal health of L-RKO mice, with detailed pathology between 400 and 800 days of age, will be needed to fully address these issues.</p><p>The role of sex hormones in the regulation of lifespan has been an active area of investigation for many years. Several studies have shown that early life ablation of the germline extends the lifespan of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, while ovariectomy extends the lifespan of <italic>R. microptera</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arantes-Oliveira et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berman and Kenyon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hatle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Iwasa et al., 2018</xref>). Although some older studies suggest that ovariectomy decrease the lifespan of rats; at least one of these studies suffers from the lack of a sham surgery control group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asdell et al., 1967</xref>); a more recent study found a small positive effect of ovariectomy on rat lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Iwasa et al., 2018</xref>). A recent mouse study found that post-pubertal ovariectomy may shorten mouse lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benedusi et al., 2015</xref>); in contrast, mice in our study were ovariectomized prior to puberty.</p><p>Here, we find that pre-pubertal ovariectomy protects the midlife survival of L-RKO mice. Whereas Benedusi and colleagues report a reduction in female lifespan following ovariectomy, we found no statistically significant effect of pre-pubertal ovariectomy on the overall survival of wild-type mice, and in fact observed a small numerical increase (7.4%) in median lifespan. Our findings align with the results of model organism studies which suggest that early life ablation of the female germline promotes survival, and suggest that the control of aging by the female germline is conserved from nematodes and insects to mammals. Critically, the overall positive effects of ovariectomy on longevity do not promote metabolic health, with ovariectomized mice suffering from adiposity and disrupted blood glucose homeostasis, and showing reduced spontaneous activity and energy expenditure. The disruption of metabolic health we observed is in agreement many previous studies showing that ovarian hormones play a critical role in the control of glucose homeostasis in humans and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bailey and Ahmed-Sorour, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pirimoglu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stubbins et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yuan et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, we observed no effect of pre-pubertal castration on mouse lifespan.

Conversely, hormone replacement promotes the survival of men with late onset hypogonadism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Comhaire, 2016</xref>). Our results do not support a model in which ablation of the male germline is beneficial for healthspan or longevity.

Despite this, it is clear that as in the case of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, where lifespan and healthspan can be uncoupled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bansal et al., 2015</xref>), pre-pubertal ovariectomy uncouples metabolic health and survival. Scientists around the world are now beginning to focus on geroprotective interventions as a way to prevent or treat age-related diseases. An open question surrounding such interventions has been the effect on health, as while there is a broad consensus in favor of extending healthspan, there is less support for extending lifespan without extending healthspan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kaeberlein, 2018</xref>). Our research here highlights the need to comprehensively assess the effects of geroprotectors on healthspan, as at least some aspects of healthspan are not inextricably coupled to longevity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">C57BL/6J; <italic>Rictor<sup>loxP/loxP</sup></italic></td><td valign="top">David Sabatini Lab (Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research)</td><td valign="top">N/A</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">B6.Cg-<italic>Speer6-</italic> <break/><italic>ps1<sup>Tg(Alb-cre)21Mgn</sup></italic>/J</td><td valign="top">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">Stock number: 003574; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:003574">IMSR_JAX:003574</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">C57BL/6J; <italic>Albumin-Cre; Rictor<sup>loxP</sup></italic><sup>/loxP</sup></td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">See ‘Animal use and care’; Dudley Lamming Lab (UW-Madison)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Drug</td><td valign="top">Human Insulin</td><td valign="top">Eli Lilly</td><td valign="top">NDC 0002-8215-17 (Humulin R U-100)</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">Ultra-sensitive mouse insulin ELISA</td><td valign="top">Crystal Chem</td><td valign="top">Cat# 90080; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2783626">AB_2783626</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Prism 8</td><td valign="top">GraphPad Software</td><td valign="top">N/A</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">R (v. 3.6.0) survival package (v. 2.44)</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Therneau, 2015</xref></td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survival/index.html">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survival/index.html</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">HOMA2 Calculator</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Levy et al., 1998</xref></td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.dtu.ox.ac.uk/homacalculator/">https://www.dtu.ox.ac.uk/homacalculator/</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Normal Chow</td><td valign="top">Purina</td><td valign="top">Cat# 5001</td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal use and care</title><p>All animal procedures conducted at the William S.

Plasma insulin was quantified according to the manufacturer’s protocol using an ultrasensitive mouse insulin ELISA kit (90080) from Crystal Chem. Fasting glucose and insulin levels were then used to calculate HOMA2-IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Levy et al., 1998</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Surgery</title><p>Mice were gonadectomized or subject to sham surgery during the third week of age. Following anesthesia with isoflurane, mice were shaved and the skin surface was sterilized with betadine and alcohol. For castration (or sham control surgery), a 1.5 cm ventral midline incision was made ending 0.5 cm cranial to the prepuce. In castrated animals, the vas deferens, located along the abdominal fat body on each side, was retrieved using a forceps or hemostat, and the testicle exteriorized. The spermatic artery was then clamped and ligated with 5–0 absorbable suture, and the testis removed. In both castrated and sham control mice, the body wall was closed with 5–0 monofilament absorbable suture, and staples used to close the skin incision. For ovariectomy (or sham control surgery), two 0.5 cm incisions were made through the skin, one on each side (1 cm ventral) to the paralumbar fossa area with its cranial terminus 1.5 cm caudal to the 13th rib, and any fascia trimmed away. Approximately 1 cm ventral to the dorsal spinous processes of the third lumbar vertebra, and immediately caudal to the last rib, the body wall was bluntly dissected through with a mosquito hemostat. For ovariectomy, each ovary was removed as follows; pressure on the abdomen was applied, causing the ovary to be extruded through one of the incisions (if the ovary did not exteriorize, a forceps was inserted to retrieve the ovary) just caudal to the kidney on that side. The ovary was then clamped for 30 s to the level of the fallopian tube, the ovary was removed, and the uterine horn was returned to the body cavity. In both ovariectomized and sham control mice, the muscles on both sides were then sutured with 5–0 absorbable suture, and the skin incisions closed with staples. For pain management, 0.1 mg/kg buprenex was administered IP to the mouse peri-operatively, and every 8–12 hr thereafter (at time of monitoring) as needed. Mice were allowed to recover on a heated pad for up to 1 hr following surgery, and then returned to the home cage. Post-surgery, female mice were provided with moistened breeder chow, and up to 1 mL per day of subcutaneous sterile saline if dehydrated. Staples were removed once healing was complete.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Lifespan and necropsy</title><p>Following surgery, mice that successfully recovered were enrolled in the lifespan study at two months of age. A total of 115 female and 105 male mice were included in the lifespan study, with 23 female and 22 male mice removed for cross sectional analysis. Mice were co-housed (grouped by sex and surgical intervention) in specific pathogen-free housing. Mice were euthanized for humane reasons if moribund, if the mice developed other specified problems (e.g. excessive tumor burden), or upon the recommendation of the facility veterinarian. Mice found dead were noted at each daily inspection and saved in a refrigerator for gross necropsy, during which the abdominal and thoracic cavities were examined for the presence of solid tumors, metastases, splenomegaly, and infection; on the basis of this inspection the presence or absence of observable cancer was recorded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data are expressed as mean ± s.e.m. Statistical analysis was conducted using Prism 8 (GraphPad Software), except for survival analyses were conducted in R (version 3.5.0) using the ‘survival’ package (version 2.38) (T, 2015). Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed separately for each sex using genotype and surgical treatment as covariates. Mice which were removed from the study for cross-sectional analysis, and mice for which no record of age of death was available, were censored as of the last day for which a record was available.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Abigail Radcliff for advice on animal surgery and the University of Wisconsin-Madison Biotechnology Center Transgenic Animal Facility for rederivation services.

In this manuscript Dr Lamming's group continues to expand on their previous work and undertake a careful dissection of the role and interplay of hepatic mTORC2 using a genetic model of hepatic deletion in combination with gonadectomy. Apelo et al. examine in more detail the role of hepatic deletion of Rictor on lifespan and healthspan.</p><p>The premise of the study was that males, but not females, of this genotype were short-lived, leading to the current project involving the effects of gonadectomy. The authors build on previous reports from the lab showing that deletion of mTORC2 reduces lifespan in male mice, but not female mice. Further, the authors try to tie this to the known difference in lifespan extension with rapamycin with females benefiting more than males. In this study, authors find that castration of males does not affect the male shortened lifespan of mTORC deletion mice, but surprisingly ovarectomy shortens the lifespan of mTORC deletion female mice (but not WT females) in mice that die of non-cancer reasons (but not overall). They also show sex effects of gonadectomy on metabolic function.</p><p>While the studies performed are a needed undertake, the quality of the work presented in this manuscript is high, and measuring healthspan across the lifespan in mammalian studies is of high relevance, some major concerns remain:</p><p>1) A major complicating factor to this study is that both females and males lacking Rictor in the liver are short-lived.</p><p>2) The determination of cancer or no cancer in these mice is unclear. Background strain of C57BL/6 has been reported previously 50-75% mice at death with lymphoma which could be challenging to determine by gross necropsy. Are the &quot;cancer&quot; animals those that present with solid tumors? From a pathological standpoint this is very different than &quot;cancer&quot; vs. &quot;no cancer&quot;. I.e., it would be unlikely so many mice of this strain are dying of &quot;no cancer&quot;.</p><p>3) The beneficial effects of ovariectomy on lifespan in females is surprising based on previous studies (including some from the 1960s) suggesting ovariectomy shortens rodent lifespan. How do authors reconcile these findings based on previous studies?</p><p>4) Similarly, previous studies suggest castration improves glucose metabolism (unlike shown here) and ovariectomy impairs (but here no effect). The effects or lack of effect on L-RKO are interesting, but in light of differences in results in WT animals it's hard to determine interpretation.</p><p>5) Statistical analysis – authors provide rationale for determining sample sizes, though oddly provide a range (20-30) rather than a specific number per group as a result of power analysis. Regardless, those group sizes decrease when segregating between &quot;cancer&quot; and &quot;non-cancer&quot;. Is there then sufficient power to determine, for example, that ovariectomy of L-RKO actually alters death in a subset of &quot;non-cancer&quot;?</p><p>6) It is not until the Discussion that the survival differences between females in this study and the prior one are explained. This makes it hard for the reader. It should be addressed much earlier in the manuscript for clarity.</p><p>7) The authors equate healthspan to metabolic parameters, which seems to be a narrow interpretation. They should either include other component measures of healthspan or switch to metabolic health (or some other term that more closely describes what is being measured). With the limited number of metrics analyzed, it is hard to substantiate the notion that ovariectomy improves survival but negatively impacts healthspan.</p><p>8) It would be important to show the degree of deletion that is achieved by this genetic cross, does it produce the same level of change in males and females? If not available, did the authors measured any activity changes down from MTORC2? How does the female control lifespan compare to other studies published on B6 females? Any changes in litter weights, sizes or ratios males/females in the genetic crosses?</p><p>9) It would be important to report, if you have it, food consumption. Are some of the differences in body weight linked in any way to food intake?</p><p>10) Besides cancer, any other predominant disease that the animals are dying off/with?</p><p>11) For all the reports on metabolic parameters it would be great if the authors could set the Y axes to the same max values, it would make easier to compare the age and sex related changes in Figure 3A-D and Figure 4A and B, E and F.</p><p>12) It is not clear how to do this but the manuscript is difficult to read through because of the different cohorts of mice and sexes. The authors should consider ways to improve this. One possibility would be to discuss males and females separately in the Results and then bring the differences out in the Discussion. Not sure if this would improve clarity, but it might be worth a try.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56177.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] While the studies performed are a needed undertake, the quality of the work presented in this manuscript is high, and measuring healthspan across the lifespan in mammalian studies is of high relevance, some major concerns remain:</p><p>1) A major complicating factor to this study is that both females and males lacking Rictor in the liver are short-lived.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion, but actually, this is not quite correct from a statistical standpoint – there is only an effect of liver Rictor loss on the overall survival of male mice. As we state, “when we looked at the total population of female mice in our study, the negative effect of <italic>Rictor</italic> loss on Sham-treated female mice was masked, and there was no overall negative effect of <italic>Rictor</italic> loss on survival” (Cox regression analysis: HR Rictor knockout = 1.02, p = 0.92), Figure 2C).</p><p>Loss of liver Rictor does impact the survival of a subset of female mice (Figure 2B), which is a major finding of our manuscript. However, while this decrease in midlife survival leads to a trend towards reduced survival of all L-RKO Sham females between 400-800 days in Figure 2C, this does not reach statistical significance as the curves converge again after 800 days. To emphasize this, we have edited the text to state more clearly that “There was also no difference between the overall survival of WT Sham and WT L-RKO female mice (p = 0.153, Wilcoxon rank sum)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The determination of cancer or no cancer in these mice is unclear.

I.e., it would be unlikely so many mice of this strain are dying of &quot;no cancer&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We thanks the reviewers for highlighting this issue, which we agree is quite important – in fact we label our figure panels “deaths with cancer” and “cancer not observed at necropsy” rather than “deaths from cancer” or “deaths with no cancer” for this very reason. We have edited the figure legends to make this distinction as well; and we have edited our methodology to better describe our gross necropsy.</p><p>Approximately half of the mice had observable cancer during our gross necropsy, which is consistent (but on the lower end) of the range of cancer rates reported for C57BL/6J mice in the literature. We have now edited the Results and Discussion to more clearly note that there could be unobserved cancers as well. We now highlight that an effect of ovariectomy on unobserved neoplasma could contribute to the protective effect of OVX on L-RKO female lifespan, and we now state that “Future carefully designed studies to assess the organismal health of L-RKO mice, with detailed pathology between 400 and 800 days of age, will be needed to fully address these issues.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The beneficial effects of ovariectomy on lifespan in females is surprising based on previous studies (including some from the 1960s) suggesting ovariectomy shortens rodent lifespan. How do authors reconcile these findings based on previous studies?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question – we have revised and expanded our Discussion section to address this. In brief, at least some older studies in rats suffered from the lack of sham surgery control group; a 1967 study suffering from this flaw also observed no difference between the lifespan of OVX mice and OVX mice dosed with estrogen, suggesting the difference in lifespan of wild-type and OVX mice could have resulted from the stress of surgery rather than removal of estrogens. A recent 2018 rat study which we now site reports OVX extends the lifespan of mice.</p><p>A 2015 mouse study showed that ovariectomy at 5 months of age shortens lifespan, in contrast, we performed ovariectomy at 3 weeks of age, prior to puberty, and studies in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and grasshoppers support the idea that early life removal of germ cells/ovaries extends lifespan. Thus, timing of ovariectomy may be important as well. We thank the reviewers for urging us to address these important points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Similarly, previous studies suggest castration improves glucose metabolism (unlike shown here) and ovariectomy impairs (but here no effect). The effects or lack of effect on L-RKO are interesting, but in light of differences in results in WT animals it's hard to determine interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this question, but it is based on an incorrect premise and a misunderstanding of our results. We have expanded our discussion of glucose homeostasis substantially to ensure the reviewer and reader can better understand our results, citing additional recent findings.</p><p>First – we do observe impaired glucose metabolism in OVX mice as expected and now state in the Discussion “these overall positive effects of ovariectomy on longevity do not promote healthspan, with ovariectomized mice suffering from adiposity and disrupted blood glucose homeostasis.” You can see this specifically in panels Figure 5C and D – the blue curve for WT OVX mice is significantly higher than the curve for WT Sham mice, and the AUC is significantly higher. There is similarly an effect of OVX on fasting insulin and calculated HOMA2-IR (Figure 5F).</p><p>Second, we see no effect of castration on glucose tolerance or insulin sensitivity, but we did not expect to see a positive effect – if anything, we expected an impairment as we expected body composition to worsen. Our results, showing no effect of castration on glucose homeostasis in young or aged mice, are in agreement with recent reports showing no effect of castration on glucose homeostasis in mice eating a control diet (Garratt et al., 2017; Harada et al., 2016). This latter paper reports an impairment of glucose homeostasis in castrated mice (unlike what the reviewer mentions) upon high-fat diet, but we did not examine high fed diet fed mice here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Statistical analysis – authors provide rationale for determining sample sizes, though oddly provide a range (20-30) rather than a specific number per group as a result of power analysis. Regardless, those group sizes decrease when segregating between &quot;cancer&quot; and &quot;non-cancer&quot;. Is there then sufficient power to determine, for example, that ovariectomy of L-RKO actually alters death in a subset of &quot;non-cancer&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>As now better discussed in the transparent reporting guidelines we targeted a group size of 20-30 mice per group in order to provide 84-95% power to detect a 15% change in lifespan. We selected a target range as mouse breeding of genetically engineered mice is never precisely mendelian and we then needed to perform surgery on the mice. We achieved this target range for all groups.</p><p>To address the second concern we performed a power calculation using the actual mean and standard deviations observed here for the L-RKO Sham and L-RKO OVX lifespans. We find that we had 85% power to detect the effect size we observed (α = 0.05).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) It is not until the Discussion that the survival differences between females in this study and the prior one are explained. This makes it hard for the reader. It should be addressed much earlier in the manuscript for clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment, and we have edited the manuscript to highlight this result in the Introduction and Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors equate healthspan to metabolic parameters, which seems to be a narrow interpretation. They should either include other component measures of healthspan or switch to metabolic health (or some other term that more closely describes what is being measured). With the limited number of metrics analyzed, it is hard to substantiate the notion that ovariectomy improves survival but negatively impacts healthspan.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree that this is a limitation, and as suggested by the reviewers we now use the term “metabolic health” in the Abstract and Discussion, and state that “A limitation of this study is that we did not perform a comprehensive assessment of healthspan, focusing on metabolic parameters.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) It would be important to show the degree of deletion that is achieved by this genetic cross, does it produce the same level of change in males and females? If not available, did the authors measured any activity changes down from MTORC2? How does the female control lifespan compare to other studies published on B6 females? Any changes in litter weights, sizes or ratios males/females in the genetic crosses?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this important question. As we have shown previously, and we now include in the Introduction, the genetic cross achieves equivalent deletion of liver mTORC2 in both males and females, reducing overall expression of liver RICTOR protein by approximately 80% through the essentially complete deletion of <italic>Rictor</italic> in hepatocytes and reducing phosphorylation of mTORC2 substrates by a similar percentage (Lamming et al., 2014; and Lamming et al., 2014).</p><p>The control lifespan of our female WT Sham mice are equivalent to C57BL/6J female mice from The Jackson Laboratory (Our female WT Sham median lifespan: 853; Jackson: 866) and are consistent with the lifespans of two other B6 mouse lifespan studies not involving surgery recently published by our lab (Yu et al., 2019; Chellappa et al., 2019).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) It would be important to report, if you have it, food consumption. Are some of the differences in body weight linked in any way to food intake?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this important question. We have included a new figure, showing that ovariectomy leads to alterations in energy balance and fuel source utilization. At least in 12 month old animals, ovariectomy seems to promote obesity as a combination of reduced physical activity and reduced energy expenditure, and promote utilization on lipids as an energy source.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Besides cancer, any other predominant disease that the animals are dying off/with?</p></disp-quote><p>While a spectrum of other age-related diseases is undoubtedly present in C57BL/6J mice, there was no other predominant cause of death that we were able to identify during our gross necropsies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) For all the reports on metabolic parameters it would be great if the authors could set the Y axes to the same max values, it would make easier to compare the age and sex related changes in Figure 3A-D and Figure 4A and B, E and F.</p></disp-quote><p>This was a great suggestion, and we have now made all Y axes that represent the same measurements have the same range and min/max values in Figures 3, 4, and 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) It is not clear how to do this but the manuscript is difficult to read through because of the different cohorts of mice and sexes. The authors should consider ways to improve this. One possibility would be to discuss males and females separately in the Results and then bring the differences out in the Discussion. Not sure if this would improve clarity, but it might be worth a try.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion – we actually started writing the manuscript this way and also tried a few other constructions, but ultimately settled on the present order as the clearest. We hope the other clarifications and edits we have made have helped to improve flow and readability of our description of this admittedly complex study.</p></body></sub-article></article>
