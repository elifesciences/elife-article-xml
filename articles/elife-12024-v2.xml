measurements have only been performed during anesthesia, which affects two major parameters modulating tissue oxygenation: neuronal activity and blood flow. Using measurements of capillary erythrocyte-associated transients, fluctuations of oxygen partial pressure (Po<sub>2</sub>) associated with individual erythrocytes, to infer Po<sub>2</sub> in the nearby neuropil, we report the first non-invasive micron-scale mapping of cerebral Po<sub>2</sub> in awake, resting mice. Interstitial Po<sub>2</sub> has similar values in the olfactory bulb glomerular layer and the somatosensory cortex, whereas there are large capillary hematocrit and erythrocyte flux differences. Awake tissue Po<sub>2</sub> is about half that under isoflurane anesthesia, and within the cortex, vascular and interstitial Po<sub>2</sub> values display layer-specific differences which dramatically contrast with those recorded under anesthesia. Our findings emphasize the importance of measuring energy parameters non-invasively in physiological conditions to precisely quantify and model brain metabolism.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12024.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12024.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12024.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Brain cells need a constant supply of oxygen to fuel their activities. This oxygen is delivered by the flow of blood through the vessels in the brain. If the blood flow to brain tissue is cut off as happens in stroke, or if an individual stops breathing, the brain becomes deprived of oxygen and brain cells will be damaged and die. To better understand how the brain works in health and disease, scientists need to learn how much oxygen the blood must deliver to the brain tissue to adequately support the activities of brain cells.</p><p>Many studies have measured oxygen levels in the brain. However, these studies have looked only roughly and taken measurements from large areas of the brain, or they have involved animals receiving anesthesia, which can alter blood flow and oxygen use in the brain. Recently, scientists discovered that they could measure oxygen concentration at high detail in the brain of anesthetized rodents with a specialized microscope, by using molecules that emit light at a rate that depends on the local oxygen concentration.</p><p>Now, Lyons et al. have shown that this same technique can be used in mice that are awake. First, a piece of the skull was replaced with glass to create a small transparent window. Then, the animals were allowed to recover for a few weeks, and were trained to get them used to how they would be handled during the experiments. After this period, the oxygen concentrations and blood flow in different parts of the mouse brains were measured in fine detail using the microscope while the animals were awake and relaxed.</p><p>The experiments showed that oxygen levels in awake resting mice are actually lower than in anesthetized mice, and that oxygen levels differ between different parts of the mouse brain. This first detailed look at oxygen levels in the brain of awake animals will likely lead to more studies. For example, future studies may look at how quickly the brain uses oxygen under normal conditions and what happens in the brain during disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12024.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12024.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>two-photon microscopy</kwd><kwd>oxygen</kwd><kwd>phosphorescence</kwd><kwd>olfactory bulb</kwd><kwd>cortex</kwd><kwd>blood flow</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001677</institution-id><institution>Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Charpak</surname><given-names>Serge</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001674</institution-id><institution>Fondation Leducq</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Charpak</surname><given-names>Serge</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-2013-AD6 (339513)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Charpak</surname><given-names>Serge</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ecole de Neuroscience, Paris Ile-de-France</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Charpak</surname><given-names>Serge</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Equipe FRM</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Charpak</surname><given-names>Serge</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ecole de Neuroscience, Paris Ile-de-France</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Doctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lyons</surname><given-names>Declan G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FDT20130928252</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lyons</surname><given-names>Declan G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR 12 BSU4-0017-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Charpak</surname><given-names>Serge</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Two-photon phosphorescence lifetime microscopy reveals the physiological values of oxygen concentration and blood flow parameters in the brains of awake mice.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>To understand the relationship between brain oxygenation and diseases associated with hypoxia or ischemia, it is important to first determine what fixes the resting value of tissue Po<sub>2</sub>, that is, the concentration of oxygen in the interstitium that bridges oxygen delivery from erythrocytes to oxygen consumption by mitochondria. Numerous methods have been used to monitor brain oxygenation, and the most spatially resolved approaches have long relied on fine Clark-type electrodes (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ndubuizu and LaManna, 2007</xref>), which have been used to report resting-state Po<sub>2</sub> and local oxygen consumption in various brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lecoq et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Masamoto et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Offenhauser et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Thompson et al., 2003</xref>) during neuronal activation. However, these electrodes are invasive, do not faithfully report Po<sub>2</sub> in vessels and cannot easily be used to determine Po<sub>2</sub> in physiological conditions, that is, in awake, unstressed animals, avoiding the use of anesthetics. As anesthetics affect resting and evoked neuronal and astrocyte activity, arterial blood pressure and cerebral blood flow, the physiological values of cerebral interstitial Po<sub>2 </sub>and their relationship to blood flow parameters in capillaries remain unknown.</p><p>Recently, a two-photon phosphorescent probe PtP-C343 has been generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Finikova et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2008</xref>) and two-photon phosphorescence lifetime microscopy (2PLM) has been used to obtain depth-resolved, micron-scale measurements of Po<sub>2</sub> in the anesthetized rodent brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Devor et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lecoq et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Parpaleix et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sakadzić et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sakadžić et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, by detecting single red blood cells (RBCs) during Po<sub>2</sub> measurement, we demonstrated the possibility of simultaneously monitoring blood flow and Po<sub>2</sub> in capillaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lecoq et al., 2011</xref>) and of detecting erythrocyte-associated transients (EATs), Po<sub>2</sub> fluctuations associated with each individual erythrocyte flowing in capillaries, which were first reported in mesentery capillaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Golub and Pittman, 2005</xref>). We showed that in olfactory bulb glomeruli of anesthetized mice, one parameter of EATs, the Po<sub>2</sub> in between two red blood cells (Po<sub>2</sub>InterRBC), is at equilibrium with, and thus reports, the Po<sub>2</sub> in the nearby neuropil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Parpaleix et al., 2013</xref>). This result implied that measurements of Po<sub>2</sub>InterRBC could provide a powerful tool to non-invasively map local interstitial oxygen concentration in the brain of awake animals.</p><p>Here, we report that in both the olfactory bulb glomerular layer and the somatosensory cortex of unstressed, awake, resting mice, the interstitial Po<sub>2</sub> (equivalent to Po<sub>2</sub>InterRBC) has the same mean value of ~23 mm Hg, spanning over a range of about 40 mm Hg. This contrasts with the large differences of capillary hematocrit and RBC flow values observed between the two brain regions. In addition, we find that in the cortex capillary and interstitial Po<sub>2</sub> values display layer-specific differences, being lower in layer I than in layer II/III or layer IV. We also find that hemoglobin in brain capillaries is highly saturated with oxygen. Finally, we show that in both brain regions, the interstitial Po<sub>2</sub> is much lower during wakefulness than under isoflurane anesthesia.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Habituation of mice to head-restraint</title><p>To ensure that we measured Po<sub>2</sub> in real physiological conditions, that is, in awake, unstressed animals, each animal was habituated to all the conditions present during 2PLM Po<sub>2</sub> measurements for several weeks prior to the experiments (see methods for detailed training procedures). In brief, over the course of 2–3 days, each mouse was habituated to handling, and trained to run on a treadmill placed in its cage. A titanium bar was then surgically attached to the cranium and then a cranial window implanted over the region of interest, either the olfactory bulb or the somatosensory cortex. Then, over 2–4 weeks, the mouse was progressively habituated to being head-fixed, via the attached bar, in the dark, below the objective of the two-photon microscope, and with the limbs and body free to move on the treadmill. Habituation was achieved when the animal remained calm for periods &gt;1 hr in the set-up with short bouts of running (~30 s). On the day of recording, the animal was briefly anesthetized (2% isoflurane, &lt;5 min) and the oxygen sensor PtP-C343 was injected intravenously. The animal was returned to its home cage, and after a delay of 90–120 min, Po<sub>2</sub> recordings sessions of 1–3 hr commenced. Each animal underwent 1–3 recording sessions per day over the course of 2–7 days, with breaks of at least several hours between each session. Note that similar Po<sub>2</sub> values were obtained from one day to the next and between sessions occurring the same day (without reinjection of PtP-C343).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Characterization of EAT properties (Po<sub>2</sub> values) in the olfactory bulb of awake resting mice</title><p>Using our previous approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lecoq et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Parpaleix et al., 2013</xref>), we characterized EATs in 38 capillaries (n = 5 animals) from the glomerular layer of awake resting mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Po<sub>2</sub> measured at the RBC border (Po<sub>2</sub>RBC) was significantly larger than at mid-distance between two RBCs (Po<sub>2</sub>InterRBC). Po<sub>2</sub>Mean, which was intermediate between these two values, is the average Po<sub>2</sub> measured in a capillary without taking into account the existence of EATs, and is the only capillary Po<sub>2</sub> value that has commonly been reported in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sakadzić et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Vovenko, 1999</xref>). Several measurements were made in each capillary but the average values of Po<sub>2</sub>RBC, Po<sub>2</sub>InterRBC and Po<sub>2</sub>Mean were similar whether calculated on all measurements or on all capillaries (262 measurements: Po<sub>2</sub>RBC = 60.5 ± 0.9 mm Hg; Po<sub>2</sub>InterRBC = 23.4 ± 0.5 mm Hg; Po<sub>2</sub>Mean = 32.8 ± 0.7 mm Hg. 38 capillaries: Po<sub>2</sub>RBC = 60.6 ± 2.3 mm Hg; Po<sub>2</sub>InterRBC = 23 ± 1.5 mm Hg; Po<sub>2</sub>Mean = 32.7 ± 1.9 mm Hg) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The standard deviation of measurements (SD) made in a given capillary, during single or multiple recording sessions were modest for Po<sub>2</sub>InterRBC (mean SD = 2.6 ± 0.3 mm Hg) and slightly larger for Po<sub>2</sub>RBC (mean SD = 5.4 ± 0.5 mm Hg). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> illustrates that average Po<sub>2</sub> values masked the large span of all values measured. This was particularly true for Po<sub>2</sub>RBC, for which values frequently exceeded 70 mm Hg. Overall, these data show that in the glomerular layer of the awake resting mouse, interstitial Po<sub>2</sub> ranges from 15 to 35 mm Hg in about 82% of our measurements. We then investigated whether the range and fluctuations of Po<sub>2</sub>values depend on two vascular parameters, RBC blood flow and hematocrit, in the same capillaries.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12024.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Erythrocyte-associated transients (EATs) in the olfactory bulb glomerular layer of the awake mouse.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left panel, schematic diagram of the organisation of the olfactory bulb.

Although reduced neuronal activity (and hence O<sub>2</sub> consumption) in the isoflurane anesthetized state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aksenov et al., 2015</xref>) is likely to play a role, it appears that this elevation of Po<sub>2</sub> largely resulted from an increase in RBC flow, as the increase in Po<sub>2</sub> values observed is in accordance with that which would be predicted from the observed increase in RBC flow based on the relationship presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>. This increase in capillary RBC flow rate is related to isoflurane’s vasodilatory effects on large vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Koenig et al., 1994</xref>). Consequently, cellular processes, including neuronal activity in response to odor, occur at a much higher oxygen concentration during isoflurane anesthesia than in the awake, resting state, and this difference is likely to be exacerbated when isoflurane is delivered in gas mixtures where [O<sub>2</sub>] is greater than 21% (as in many other studies). Since the olfactory bulb glomerular layer has a specific neuronal and vascular organisation that could be a main determinant of Po<sub>2</sub> values, we extended our investigation of tissue oxygenation to the cerebral cortex, due to its importance to higher cognitive functions and its use as an ischemic model.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12024.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Isoflurane changes the brain oxygenation state.</title><p>Po<sub>2</sub> and RBC flow were compared in the same sets of olfactory bulb glomerular layer capillaries when the animal was awake, and when the animal was anesthetized with isoflurane (0.75%, delivered in air, no oxygen added).

Nonetheless, based on our previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Parpaleix et al., 2013</xref>) in olfactory bulb glomeruli and on theoretical predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lücker et al., 2014</xref>), we expect that Po<sub>2</sub>InterRBC reports steady-state tissue Po<sub>2</sub> up to a radius of approximately 10 µm from a capillary. Furthermore, recent work, that models hematocrit distribution in large microcirculatory networks and accurately replicates physiological RBC distribution, predicts that the distribution of oxygen in tissue volumes supplied by these networks is largely homogeneous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gould and Linninger, 2015</xref>). We thus consider that our measured values of Po<sub>2</sub>InterRBC represent a significant proportion of the range of Po<sub>2</sub> values present in the cortical interstitium. Our Po<sub>2</sub> measurements revealed that the averages and ranges of Po<sub>2</sub> values in cortical capillaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>) were similar to those measured in the olfactory bulb glomerular layer (Po<sub>2</sub>RBC = 66.3 ± 1.6 mm Hg, Po<sub>2</sub>InterRBC = 23.3 ± 1.1 mm Hg, and Po<sub>2</sub>Mean = 36.3 ± 1.3 mm Hg), indicating that at rest in the awake state, these two brain areas have similar levels of both RBC, capillary and pericapillary oxygenation. In contrast, the average RBC flow and hematocrit values (41.9 ± 1.8 cells/s and 47.3 ± 0.9%, respectively) were significantly higher than those found in the olfactory bulb glomerular layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) with the hematocrit values being higher than previously reported levels in the cerebral cortex of anesthetized animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hudetz, 1997</xref>).

As anesthetics could differently modulate synaptic activity and blood flow in layers I to IV, it is difficult to predict the extent to which Po<sub>2</sub> depth variations occur in the awake animal. We thus first measured Po<sub>2</sub> in descending and ascending large vessels and then compared Po<sub>2</sub>and blood flow parameters of capillaries from layers I to IV (from the surface to 410 µm in depth). Capillaries less than 60 μm below the surface were considered to be in layer I, those from 90 to 260 μm below the surface were classified as layer II/III capillaries and those deeper than 340 μm were considered layer IV capillaries (capillaries from 260 to 340 µm were not considered due the ambiguity of their location). Penetrating vessels (arterioles and venules) were traced from their point of descent below the surface down along their main trunk until they ramified into smaller vessels (or descended below 410 µm, which was the maximum depth at which we made measurements).

In the awake rodent, brain oxygenation has previously only been investigated with lower resolution approaches. Liu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 1995</xref>) used electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) oximetry with a lithium phthalocyanine crystal being implanted in the cerebral cortex of rats 24 hr prior to the measurements. They reported that restrained and untrained rats have a cerebral Po<sub>2</sub> of about 34 mm Hg, which, surprisingly, was reduced by isoflurane anesthesia (1% in 21% O<sub>2</sub>) to about 24 mm Hg. This resting value (34 mm Hg) is significantly higher than our average interstitial Po<sub>2</sub> value, most probably due to the effects of the stress resulting from restraint in the absence of habituation. The effect of isoflurane, which decreased Po<sub>2</sub> is intriguing, and indicates that the main effect of isoflurane in this case was to abolish the Po<sub>2</sub> augmenting effects of stress. Interestingly, increasing the delay from crystal implantation to 7 days and introducing some habituation to restraint reduced cerebral Po<sub>2</sub> to 27 mm Hg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dunn et al., 2000</xref>). The best demonstration of physiological measurements of Po<sub>2</sub> has been performed in unrestrained rats, in which brain Po<sub>2</sub>was measured with an implanted fiber optic probe measuring quenching of an oxygen sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ortiz-Prado et al., 2010</xref>). Although the probe was very invasive, it reported an average bulk tissue Po<sub>2</sub> value of 25 mm Hg, a value very similar to ours. We are thus confident that Po<sub>2</sub>InterRBC is an excellent reporter of the interstitial Po<sub>2</sub>, that our extensive habituation procedures are efficient, and that this study gives the first non-invasive and physiological values of Po<sub>2</sub>, hematocrit and capillary blood flow in the rodent brain.</p><p>Our results show a number of differences from those previously reported with high-resolution measurement techniques in anesthetized animals. Tissue Po<sub>2</sub> values have previously been reported to be in the range of ~5–100 mm Hg, with the higher values occurring in regions close to pial arterioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Devor et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sakadzić et al., 2010</xref>). Our values of tissue Po<sub>2</sub> (Po<sub>2</sub>InterRBC) lie in the lower end of this wide range, do not include measurements from the capillary-free peri-arteriolar regions, and so are likely to be reflective of the Po<sub>2</sub> levels that exist in the majority of the tissue, away from large arterioles. Considering intravascular Po<sub>2</sub>, our measurements of capillary Po<sub>2</sub>Mean (average ≈36 mm Hg in the cortex) seem to be broadly in agreement with those reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sakadzić et al., 2010</xref> (~25–35 mm Hg), but our recorded values of capillary RBC Po<sub>2</sub> (Po<sub>2</sub>RBC, average ≈66 mm Hg in the cortex), are dramatically higher than those published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sakadzić et al., 2014</xref>, where the most frequent values were ~25–35 mm Hg. A prominent discrepancy between the results of previous studies and our findings in awake, resting animals relates to changes in cortical oxygenation with depth. Many previous studies report drops in interstitial Po<sub>2</sub> with increasing depth in the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cross and Silver, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Devor et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Masamoto et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nair et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ndubuizu and LaManna, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Whalen et al., 1970</xref>), with Po<sub>2</sub> in layer I being higher than in underlying layers. In contrast, our measures of Po<sub>2</sub>InterRBC suggest that interstitial Po<sub>2</sub> is lower in layer I than in either layer II/III or IV. These conflicting patterns of laminar variations of Po<sub>2</sub> also exist in comparisons of the mean vascular Po<sub>2</sub> values (Po<sub>2</sub>Mean), where previous 2PLM studies have reported decreases in mean vascular Po<sub>2</sub> in concert with decreases in penetrating arteriole and venule Po<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Devor et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sakadzić et al., 2010</xref>) with increasing depth in the cortex. In the present study, we see an increase in capillary Po<sub>2</sub>Mean from layer I to deeper layers, and no gradient in penetrating vessel Po<sub>2</sub> with depth. It is possible that the deviation from normal physiological conditions inherent in anesthesia and acute surgical preparation, which we avoid with our approach, leads to the emergence of these disagreements.</p><p>Although average Po<sub>2</sub>InterRBC values in both the cortex and glomerular layer were ~23 mm Hg, in both structures a number of capillaries were found to have Po<sub>2</sub>InterRBC values &lt;15 mm Hg, indicating the existence of regions in both structures where the interstitial Po<sub>2</sub> is close to reported values of Po<sub>2</sub> below which cellular respiratory rate is strongly dependent on Po<sub>2</sub> (~10 mm Hg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kasischke et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, examples were found in both brain regions where the Po<sub>2</sub>InterRBC was below the value of ~3.4 mm Hg that has previously been reported as the critical Po<sub>2</sub> in brain tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kasischke et al., 2011</xref>).

However, the presence of such low values in our awake preparations indicates that, surprisingly, at least some small regions of the brain can subsist at very low Po<sub>2</sub> values.</p><p>Our finding of high Po<sub>2</sub>RBC and corresponding capillary So<sub>2</sub> (estimated using the parameters used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sakadžić et al., 2014</xref>) values in both the olfactory bulb and the somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) differs from recently published findings in the anesthetized, ventilated mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sakadžić et al., 2014</xref>). We find that capillary So<sub>2</sub> in both structures is generally high, indicating that the majority of hemoglobin in these vessels exists as oxyhemoglobin, and thus that capillaries are capable of supplying very significant quantities of oxygen to support neural function.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study establishes, for the first time, accurate and precise values of physiological Po<sub>2</sub> in the vasculature and interstitium of mouse cerebral grey matter. As it is known that O<sub>2</sub> concentration is a critical parameter in determining the properties of neuronal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Huchzermeyer et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ivanov and Zilberter, 2011</xref>), and neurovascular interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gordon et al., 2008</xref>), these values provide a standard on which future research can rely to provide relevant, physiologically accurate conditions of oxygenation in which to investigate such processes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Animal preparation and surgery</title><p>All animal care and experimentation was performed in accordance with the INSERM Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. Adult C57BL/6 mice (3–6 months old, 25-–35 g, both males and female, housed in 12-hr light-dark cycle) were used in this study (n = 5 mice for olfactory bulb capillaries, n = 3 mice for cortex capillaries). Chronic glass cranial windows were implanted over the area of interest, either the olfactory bulb or the somatosensory cortex, with great care taken to not disturb the dura mater. The animals received anti-inflammatory and analgesic treatment (Carprofen, one daily 0.15 mg subcutaneous injection, administered pre-surgically and for the three days post-surgery), antibiotics (Ceftrioxone, one daily 0.25 mg subcutaneous injection, administered pre-surgically and for the three days post-surgery) and dexamethasone to reduce cerebral edema (one daily 60 µg subcutaneous injection on the day before surgery, directly before the surgery and the first post-surgical day). Surgical anesthesia was induced with ketamine-xylazine (100 mg and 8 mg per kg body mass, respectively). During surgery, the mice breathed a mixture of air and supplementary oxygen (the final inhaled proportion of oxygen was ~30%) and the body temperature monitored by a rectal probe and maintained at ~36.5°C by a feedback-controlled heating pad. A craniotomy was performed with great care taken not to apply great pressure to the bone and the area was regularly flushed with cool aqueous buffer solution to avoid damage or heating of the underlying tissue. Cover glass (~150 µm thick) was used for the window and sealed in place with photopolymerizable dental cement (Tetric EvoFlow, Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Principality of Liechtenstein), which was also used to form a head-cap in which a titanium head-bar was also embedded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-2"><title>Habituation of mice to head restraint</title><p>In the weeks preceding surgery, the animals were supplied with a treadmill (Fast-Trac, Bio-Serv, Flemington, New Jersey) in their cages that was similar to that which forms part of the restraint apparatus used during 2PLM recording (see below). In the days that preceded the surgery, the mice were gently habituated to handling, and provided with treats (sugar pellets, Bio-Serv). 2–3 days after the surgery restraint habituation began. The frame used for head restraint during the habituation and imaging consists of a metal frame in which the mouse’s head-bar is secured, and a treadmill wheel (similar to that in the animal’s home cage). This configuration allows the animal limbs and body to move freely while the head is stably fixed. All restraint-habituation sessions were carried out in the set-up that was used for imaging, with the animal kept in the near-dark at all times. Habituation sessions were performed multiple times per day over the course of 2–4 weeks, with the duration increasing from 5 min to &gt;1 hr. Animals were considered ready for use in experiments when they could be easily fixed in the recording apparatus while awake, and their behavior during the sessions consisted of short bouts of locomotion (~30 s) separated by longer periods of stillness (5–15 min) during which measurements were performed.</p><p>On the days on which recordings were taken, the animals were briefly anesthetized with isoflurane (2%, in air. Total duration of anesthesia &lt;5 min), and PtP-C343 solution (Mw≈65 kDa, 2.5 mM in 0.9% saline) was introduced intravenously via retro-orbital injection. Fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (Mw = 150 kDa) was often co-administered with PtP-C343 to enhance imaging contrast. The final PtP-C343 concentration in the plasma is estimated to be ~100 µM. After the injection, the mice were returned to their home cages for ~90 min, before being brought back to the experimental room, for ~30 min before the start of the recording session. We implemented this delay of ~2 hr between the injection and the following recording session to avoid potential confounding effects of the brief exposure to isoflurane or the effects of the injection itself. We found that the concentration of PtP-C343 in the blood typically remained sufficient for Po<sub>2</sub> measurements to be made over 1–3 days after an injection, allowing for multiple recording sessions to be made before reinjection was necessary. Each recording session lasted from 1–3 hr, depending on the type of measurements performed and the behavior of the animal, and each animal underwent 1–3 recording sessions per day over the course of 2–7 days, with breaks of at least 1–3 hr between each session. The data derived from each of the recording sessions across the 1–2 days post-injection was similar, indicating that no lingering effects of the injection procedure or brief isoflurane anesthesia had affected the measurements in the first recording session post-injection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-3"><title>2PLM setup and procedure</title><p>The 2PLM setup is as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lecoq et al. (2011)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Parpaleix et al. (2013)</xref>. Briefly, the output from a Ti:sapphire laser (Mira, Coherent, Santa Clara, California; λ = 850 nm, 120 fs pulse width, 76 mHz) is gated by an acousto-optic modulator (AOM, AA Optoelectronic, Orsay, France; MT110-B50-A1.5-IR-Hk). This allows for repetitive cycles of alternating 'on' and 'off' periods to be generated, that correspond to periods of excitation and recording from the PtP-C343 probe in the sample. The excitation period was 24 µs and the recording period was 225 µs, for a total cycle period of 250 µs and a repetition rate of 4 kHz. The scanning of the excitation light by the galvanometric mirrors (Cambridge Technology, Bedford, Massachusetts) is synchronized with the gating of the laser output by the AOM, using custom-built electronics and LabVIEW software (National Instruments, Austin, Texas). The excitation light was focused with a water-immersion objective lens (either x63 Leica [Wetzlar, Germany] or x40 Olympus lens [Olympus, Tokyo, Japan]).</p><p>Emitted photons were divided by a dichroic mirror (cut off wavelength = 560 nm). The green channel was bandpass filtered (HQ 520/40 m, Chroma Technology Corp, Bellows Falls, Vermont). The red channel had two shortpass filters (FF01-750/sp-25, Semrock, Rochester, New York), and one bandpass filter (HQ 680/60 m-2P, Chroma Technologies Corp), and a red-sensitive photomultiplier tube (PMT, R10699, Hamamatsu, Hamamatsu City, Japan). PMT signals were amplified with custom-build electronics and sampled at 1.25 MHz by an acquisition card. Photons detected in the green channel during the on phase of the recording cycle were used to detect the borders of RBCs and extract RBC flow rates and hematocrit values (see below). Phosphorescence decays detected during the 'off' period were averaged over a number of cycles (~5000–50,000 decays) and the lifetime of the phosphorescence determined by fitting a single exponential curve to the data. The first 6–7 bins (~5 µs) after the end of the on-phase were discarded. This lifetime measurement is then converted to a value of Po<sub>2</sub> using a calibration curve. We used the nonlinear least-squares method and the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm to obtain the decay lifetimes and associated standard errors. We used a Stern-Volmer–like calibration curve to convert the phosphorescence lifetimes into the corresponding Po<sub>2</sub> values. This analysis was performed using custom build software (see below) developed using LabView (National Instruments).</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-4"><title>Capillary blood flow analysis and EAT properties extraction</title><p>Initially, fast 3D image acquisition was performed to identify and target vessels of interest. Po<sub>2</sub> measurements were then made by focusing the excitation point in blood vessels of interest, and recording the fluorescence and phosphorescence emitted from 10,000–40,000 cycles of excitation and detection of phosphorescence decays (2.5–10 s of measurement) at each point. Typically 4–8 measurements were performed in each capillary, with the total number of decays recorded for each capillary being around 60,000–100,000.</p><p>Details of the methods of determining EAT properties, RBC flow rates and hematocrit can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Parpaleix et al. (2013)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lecoq et al. (2011)</xref>, see especially <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> therein). In brief, the fluorescence recorded during the excitation period of the cycle was analyzed and the passage of RBCs through the excitation point detected based on the associated dips in fluorescence intensity. These transient reductions in fluorescence intensity were detected and quantified using a binary threshold method, with the borders of the RBC corresponding to the full width at half maximum of the fluorescence dip. This allowed for the measurement of both capillary RBC flow rate (the number of RBCs detected per unit time) and hematocrit (the number of decay cycles originating from within RBCs as a percentage of the total number of decay cycles). The borders of the detected RBCs were used as time-stamps, and the phosphorescence decays recorded were binned according to their distance in time from the borders of the nearest RBC. The Po<sub>2</sub>RBC value was calculated from the average lifetime of decays recorded in the 1–4 ms around the border of the RBC, whereas the Po<sub>2</sub>InterRBC was determined from average value of decays at mid-distance between RBCs (averaged over a window of at least 5 ms).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by David Kleinfeld as the Reviewing Editor and Timothy Behrens as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. All reviewers are enthusiastic about this work. Each raised a number of questions. I ask you address each question by clarifying the manuscript. No new data is required. I have summarized the key questions:</p><p>1) The hematocrit is reported to be significantly higher in cortex than in olfactory bulb (subsection “Capillary flow and Po<sub>2</sub> values in the somatosensory cortex of the awake resting mouse”). This needs to be discussed – how is this difference produced? Is it somehow produced by plasma skimming at a series of junctions of the vessels supplying the olfactory bulb? As this is an acute preparation, one needs to be certain that this is not due to some small amount of tissue damage when making the imaging window.</p><p>2) Please show a raw trace of the Po<sub>2</sub> profile between RBCs, or state explicitly that the line in the inset to panel A IS raw data (and not a schematic); why is that line continuous to the left and dotted on the right hand side?</p><p>3) The authors repeatedly stress that previous measurements using two-photon phosphorescence only report Mean Po<sub>2</sub>. Could the authors please include a comparison of their Mean Po<sub>2</sub> values against those made by other groups also using two-photon phosphorescence probe?</p><p>4) Please explain the bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> far better. State completely clearly that Po<sub>2</sub> is the mean (over vessels) of a single time averaged value obtained from each vessel, while SD is mean (over vessels) of the standard deviation of the Po<sub>2</sub> in each vessel over time (if that is what it is!).</p><p>5) The Po<sub>2</sub> seems (subsection “Laminar organisation of capillary blood flow and Po<sub>2</sub> values in the superficial layers of the somatosensory cortex”) to be determined by the local capillary density. Does this imply that local O<sub>2</sub> consumption is independent of laminar position (one might have expected vessel density to be proportional to local O<sub>2</sub> usage)? Is it possible to derive, from the laminar distribution of [O<sub>2</sub>] and the blood flow reaching each lamina, how much O<sub>2</sub> is consumed by each cell layer?</p><p>6) A more thorough clarification of the argument of how isoflurane increases interstitial oxygen concentration would strengthen the manuscript. The current explanation links increased bloodstream oxygenation to the vasodilatory effect of isoflurane (subsection “Brain oxygenation is greatly enhanced by isoflurane anesthesia”). However, the increase in RBC flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) resulting from vasodilation would lead to a decrease in oxygen unloading from RBCs, as evidenced by the increase in RBC Po<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). If less oxygen is unloaded from the red blood cells, then less oxygen diffuses through the vessel wall, leading to a decrease in tissue oxygenation. This is contradicted by the statement that cellular processes occur at a higher oxygen concentration during isoflurane anaesthesia. This matter is further confused by the delivery of isoflurane in a 21% oxygen gas mixture.</p><p>7) Theoretical models are cited as evidence that InterRBC Po<sub>2</sub> is in equilibrium with the surrounding tissue (subsection “Capillary flow and Po<sub>2</sub> values in the somatosensory cortex of the awake resting mouse”). The theoretical models rely on accurate hematocrit prediction to determine the distribution of oxygen to the surrounding tissue. The relationship between radial oxygen gradients around capillaries, hematocrit and RBC velocities have been discussed in (I. Gould, A. Linninger, &quot;Hematocrit Distribution and Tissue Oxygenation in Large Microcirculatory Networks&quot;, Microcirculation, 22, p1-18, 2015). The authors may consider inclusion of this reference to support the argument.</p><p>8) The authors mention that they anaesthetise all mice before initiating even awake imaging experiments. Is it possible to head fix the mice without using anaesthesia? Is the anaesthesia necessary to do the retro-orbital injection of the fluorescein dextran and oxygen probe? It seems awake mice could be tail/vein injected. This might also affect the results since there could residual effects of anaesthesia. At the very least this confound should be acknowledged.</p><p>The reviewers have also identified some technical and typographic errors that you should attend to. See the full reviews attached below. We look forward to a revised submission together with a tally of brief answers to each of the seven points above. This is beautiful work and we hope to see it published soon.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript provides important data (obtained using a relatively non-invasive technique) characterising the O<sub>2</sub> level at different parts of the vasculature in awake non-anesthetized animals. Although mainly descriptive, the data will be of great interest to all those working on the control of cerebral blood flow, energy supply to the brain, brain metabolism and BOLD fMRI signals, because all of these subjects depend critically on the local O<sub>2</sub> concentration, which is poorly defined in vivo. Previous work has only provided similar data on anesthetized animals (or with more invasive techniques in freely moving animals), and it turns out, importantly, that the values are very different in the unanesthetized animal. This paper is therefore a significant step forward, and I support its publication.</p><p>There are some areas where the discussion should be improved, as follows.</p><p>1) The hematocrit is reported to be significantly higher in cortex than in olfactory bulb (subsection “Capillary flow and Po<sub>2</sub> values in the somatosensory cortex of the awake resting mouse”). This needs to be discussed – how is this difference produced? Is it somehow produced by plasma skimming at a series of junctions of the vessels supplying the olfactory bulb? Why might that occur more for the supply to the olfactory bulb than for that to the cortex?</p><p>2) The Po<sub>2</sub> seems (subsection “Laminar organisation of capillary blood flow and Po<sub>2</sub> values in the superficial layers of the somatosensory cortex”) to be determined by the local capillary density. Does this imply that local O<sub>2</sub> consumption is independent of laminar position (one might have expected vessel density to be proportional to local O<sub>2</sub> usage)? Is it possible to derive, from the laminar distribution of [O<sub>2</sub>] and the blood flow reaching each lamina, how much O<sub>2</sub> is consumed by each cell layer?</p><p>3) It is surprising that this study finds a lower Po<sub>2</sub> in the surface layers of the cortex, whereas Devor and Sakadzic found a decrease in [O<sub>2</sub>] with depth. Is there any methodological difference that could account for this, e.g. O<sub>2</sub> penetration into the brain from the cortical window in the earlier studies)? Was the laminar profile of O2 affected by isoflurane?</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. Please show a raw trace of the Po<sub>2</sub> profile between RBCs, or state explicitly that the line in the inset to panel A IS raw data (and not a schematic); why is that line continuous to the left and dotted on the right hand side?</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. Please explain the bars far better. State completely clearly that Po<sub>2</sub> is the mean (over vessels) of a single time averaged value obtained from each vessel, while SD is mean (over vessels) of the standard deviation of the Po<sub>2</sub> in each vessel over time (if that is what it is!).

Additionally, these measurements are replicated in both the primary somatosensory cortex (n=3) as well as the olfactory bulb (n=5). Measurements of erythrocyte-associated transients were measured in individual capillaries, and oxygen tension was reported in RBCs (RBC Po<sub>2</sub>), in between two red blood cells (InterRBC Po<sub>2</sub>) and the mean between these two values (Mean Po<sub>2</sub>). These measurements are report for each layer of the cortex.</p><p>This manuscript provides an impressively thorough analysis of the correlation between hematocrit, RBC flux and the three oxygen concentration measurements in the bloodstream. Additionally, the comparison between awake and anaesthetized mice clearly demonstrates the increased oxygen concentration in the bloodstream. Additionally, inclusion of a comparative study with previous measurements of bloodstream oxygen concentration in both the awake and anaesthetized mice would strengthen the argument that isoflurane increases interstitial Po<sub>2</sub>. The explanation of how isoflurane increases interstitial Po<sub>2</sub> is left somewhat unclear.</p><p>The reviewers recommend that this manuscript be published with minor revisions.</p><p>Technical Comments:</p><p>1) A more thorough clarification of the argument of how isoflurane increases interstitial oxygen concentration would strengthen the manuscript. The current explanation links increased bloodstream oxygenation to the vasodilatory effect of isoflurane (subsection “Brain oxygenation is greatly enhanced by isoflurane anesthesia”). However, the increase in RBC flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) resulting from vasodilation would lead to a decrease in oxygen unloading from RBCs, as evidenced by the increase in RBC Po<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). If less oxygen is unloaded from the red blood cells, then less oxygen diffuses through the vessel wall, leading to a decrease in tissue oxygenation. This is contradicted by the statement that cellular processes occur at a higher oxygen concentration during isoflurane anaesthesia. This matter is further confused by the delivery of isoflurane in a 21% oxygen gas mixture.</p><p>2) The authors repeatedly stress the importance of differentiating between RBC Po<sub>2</sub>, InterRBC Po<sub>2</sub>, and Mean Po<sub>2</sub> – stating that previous measurements using two-photon phosphorescence only report Mean Po<sub>2</sub>. Could the authors please include a comparison of their Mean Po<sub>2</sub> values against those made by other groups also using two-photon phosphorescence probe?</p><p>3) Similarly, the authors cite previous low-resolution studies on the effects of isoflurane on brain tissue oxygenation, but the manuscript is lacking a side by side comparison with previous studies. An inclusion of the previous measurements would strengthen the conclusion made in this paper.</p><p>4) Theoretical models are cited as evidence that InterRBC Po<sub>2</sub> is in equilibrium with the surrounding tissue (subsection “Capillary flow and Po<sub>2</sub> values in the somatosensory cortex of the awake resting mouse”). The theoretical models rely on accurate hematocrit prediction to determine the distribution of oxygen to the surrounding tissue. The relationship between radial oxygen gradients around capillaries, hematocrit and RBC velocities have been discussed in (I. Gould, A. Linninger, &quot;Hematocrit Distribution and Tissue Oxygenation in Large Microcirculatory Networks&quot;, Microcirculation, 22, p1-18, 2015). The authors may consider inclusion of this reference to support the argument.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The authors describe methods and results using 2-photon phosphorescence lifetime mediated measurements of tissue oxygenation in vivo. The authors extend their exciting work demonstrating that local O<sub>2</sub> tension changes over the time course of each RBC passing (up to 100 pass per second, with each making a local O<sub>2</sub> transient). This work extends a proven strategy of using compounds with a phosphorescence lifetime that is oxygen sensitive. The approach enables probe-specific calibration of oxygen levels using the phosphorescence lifetime. The methods (O<sub>2</sub> probe) although not developed by Charpak`s lab, is applied quite effectively here. The authors extend previous work by David Boas and make measurements of oxygenation from awake animals. The work examines different cortical layers and contrasts with olfactory bulb. The analysis and presentation of the data is strong. Novel data includes capillary specific measurements and relationships between local oxygenation and red blood cell flux. The work also is significant for examining potentially confounding effects of well-used anaesthesia such as isoflurane. In this way the current work strikes an important cautionary tone with respect to anesthesia.</p><p>1) The authors’ analysis is impressive and I don`t have any real concerns with it, since I am familiar with this literature. However, for those which have seen these phosphorescence measurements for the first time, I think it would be important to show supplementary data illustrating how the measurements are obtained. This could be the calibration curve or some raw data showing how Po<sub>2</sub> and velocity/flux are calculated in a single experiment.</p><p>2) I would also like to see the authors give some measurements for arteriole and vein diameters with isoflurane anaesthesia vs. the control awake state, the example images point towards a robust finding.</p><p>3) The authors mention that they anaesthetise all mice before initiating even awake imaging experiments. Is it possible to head fix the mice without using anaesthesia? Is the anaesthesia necessary to do the retro-orbital injection of the fluorescein dextran and oxygen probe? It seems awake mice could be tail/vein injected. This might also affect the results since there could residual effects of anaesthesia. At the very least this confound should be acknowledged.</p><p>4) The authors should comment on how their results relate to recent work from David Boas lab which propose that significant exchange of oxygen with tissues can occur through veins.</p><p>5) The authors should also comment on whether there are changes on efficacy of O<sub>2</sub> signal overtime. From the protocol it sounds as though this probe must have an extremely long half-life. Why this probe would not be cleared by the liver is uncertain, its pharmacokinetics should be further investigated or at least if there is information this should be discussed so others can have a better feel for how long after injection can quantification of O<sub>2</sub> be done.</p><p>6) I thought the idea that some regions of cortex could have very low flow and oxygenation to be interesting, however this is also an acute preparation and one needs to be certain that this is not due to some small amount of tissue damage when making the imaging window.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12024.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. All reviewers are enthusiastic about this work. Each raised a number of questions. I ask you address each question by clarifying the manuscript. No new data is required. I have summarized the key questions:</italic></p><p> <italic>1) The hematocrit is reported to be significantly higher in cortex than in olfactory bulb (subsection “Capillary flow and Po<sub>2</sub> values in the somatosensory cortex of the awake resting mouse”). This needs to be discussed</italic> –</p><p><italic>how is this difference produced? Is it somehow produced by plasma skimming at a series of junctions of the vessels supplying the olfactory bulb? As this is an acute preparation, one needs to be certain that this is not due to some small amount of tissue damage when making the imaging window.</italic> </p><p>The fact that cortical capillary hematocrit is higher than that measured in the olfactory bulb glomerular layer is indeed an interesting finding. However, the mechanisms that underlie this difference are not easy to determine. We agree that differential hemoconcentration or hemodilution in vessels supplying the recorded capillaries could account for some of this difference. A modelling approach, such as that developed by Gould and Linninger (2015), could provide insight into this issue, however a definitive answer to this question remains elusive, as the details of the blood supply to the olfactory bulb are unknown. This is a weakness of the model, and we are just beginning a collaboration to investigate the anatomical organisation of the bulb vasculature. We hope to be able to answer this question in the future. We have added a short note on this point in the first paragraph of the subsection “Capillary flow and Po2 values in the somatosensory cortex of the awake resting mouse“.</p><p>Concerning the second point:</p><p>Conscious of the fact that a chronic cranial window preparation might affect our Po<sub>2</sub> measurements, when starting this project, we initially employed a chronic thinned-skull window preparation (Drew et al. 2010), which avoided opening the cranium. However, after a number of months using this technique, we determined that the phosphorescence decays detected and the data recorded in this preparation were not compatible with high quality recordings, so we switched to using implanted glass cranial windows. Nonetheless, the facts that: 1. Our approach of placing the cover glass into the craniotomy and directly on to the dura mater surface seems to avoid the commonly described degradation (due to inflammation) and subsequent recovery of cranial window quality over the course of 2-3 weeks (Holtmaat et al. 2009), and 2. Our measurements were made many days after the chronic cranial window surgery suggest that we largely avoided damage to the tissue that would cause our results to deviate significantly from normal physiology.</p><p><italic>2) Please show a raw trace of the Po<sub>2</sub></italic></p><p> <italic>profile between RBCs, or state explicitly that the line in the inset to panel A IS raw data (and not a schematic); why is that line continuous to the left and dotted on the right hand side?</italic> </p><p>The solid black trace in the lower right panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> was indeed data, drawn from recordings in anaesthetised mice as reported in Parpaleix et al. (2013). It has now however been replaced by a trace representing data from one capillary recorded in the awake mouse for this study. The continuous line represents the data trace, showing the profile of Po<sub>2</sub> relative to the border of an RBC. The dotted portion of the trace is a mirror image of the data trace, and is used in the schematic solely for the purposes of illustration. The figure legend has been amended accordingly.</p><p><italic>3) The authors repeatedly stress that previous measurements using two-photon phosphorescence only report Mean Po<sub>2</sub>. Could the authors please include a comparison of their Mean Po<sub>2</sub> values against those made by other groups also using two-photon phosphorescence probe?</italic> </p><p>A paragraph has been added to the Discussion (second paragraph) to compare our recorded values of Po<sub>2</sub> to those previously made with 2PLM by other groups.</p><p><italic>4) Please explain the bars in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> far better.

Our lab is beginning to investigate the respective importance of cellular activity and delivery of oxygen in regulating tissue Po<sub>2</sub> per layer. We plan to examine the effects of blocking pre/post-synaptic activity and firing on local tissue Po<sub>2</sub>. This research will help to clarify the factors that determine laminar and regional Po<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>We have amended the text of the manuscript to remove the implication of a causal relationship between laminar Po<sub>2</sub> and capillary density (subsection “Laminar organisation of capillary blood flow and Po<sub>2</sub> values in the superficial layers of the somatosensory cortex”, second paragraph).</p><p><italic>6) A more thorough clarification of the argument of how isoflurane increases interstitial oxygen concentration would strengthen the manuscript. The current explanation links increased bloodstream oxygenation to the vasodilatory effect of isoflurane (subsection “Brain oxygenation is greatly enhanced by isoflurane asesthesia”).

This matter is further confused by the delivery of isoflurane in a 21% oxygen gas mixture.</italic> </p><p>It is true that increased RBC velocity (mm s<sup>-1</sup>) will lead to a decrease in oxygen unloading from each RBC. However, the overall increase in the RBC flux (cells s<sup>-1</sup>) that we measured will mean that although less oxygen is unloaded from each individual RBC, the total quantity of oxygen diffusing through the vessel wall could increase, leading to an increase in tissue oxygenation. This can be thought of as being somewhat similar to the increase in both RBC hemoglobin saturation and tissue oxygenation that is observed in a glomerulus during functional hyperaemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, Parpaleix et al. 2013).</p><p>Although isoflurane is commonly delivered by others in either 100% oxygen or an air-oxygen mixture (where [O<sub>2</sub>]&gt;21%), in our study we delivered it in air without additional oxygen ([O<sub>2</sub>]≈21%, (Line 142-143 of the track-changes version of manuscript). Our statement that “this difference is likely to be exacerbated when isoflurane is delivered in gas mixtures where [O<sub>2</sub>] is greater than 21%” was not made in reference to our study, but rather to the delivery of isoflurane in an air-oxygen mix by other researchers. This is now better clarified in the text.</p><p> <italic>7) Theoretical models are cited as evidence that InterRBC Po<sub>2</sub> is in equilibrium with the surrounding tissue (subsection “Capillary flow and Po<sub>2</sub> </italic></p><p><italic>values in the somatosensory cortex of the awake resting mouse”).
