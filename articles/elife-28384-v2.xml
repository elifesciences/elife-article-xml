Both complexes contain the Tra1 subunit, a highly conserved 3744-residue protein from the Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase-related kinase (PIKK) family and a direct target for multiple sequence-specific activators. We present the Cryo-EM structure of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevsisae</italic> Tra1 to 3.7 Å resolution, revealing an extensive network of alpha-helical solenoids organized into a diamond ring conformation and is strikingly reminiscent of DNA-PKcs, suggesting a direct role for Tra1 in DNA repair. The structure was fitted into an existing SAGA EM reconstruction and reveals limited contact surfaces to Tra1, hence it does not act as a molecular scaffold within SAGA. Mutations that affect activator targeting are distributed across the Tra1 structure, but also cluster within the N-terminal Finger region, indicating the presence of an activator interaction site. The structure of Tra1 is a key milestone in deciphering the mechanism of multiple coactivator complexes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28384.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Inside our cells, histone proteins package and condense DNA so that it can fit into the cell nucleus. However, this also switches off the genes, since the machines that read and interpret them can no longer access the underlying DNA. Turning genes on requires specific enzymes that chemically modify the histone proteins to regain access to the DNA. This must be carefully controlled, otherwise the ‘wrong’ genes can be activated, causing undesired effects and endangering the cell.</p><p>Histone modifying enzymes often reside in large protein complexes. Two well-known examples are the SAGA and NuA4 complexes. Both have different roles during gene activation, but share a protein called Tra1. This protein enables SAGA and NuA4 to act on specific genes by binding to ‘activator proteins’ that are found on the DNA. Tra1 is one of the biggest proteins in the cell, but its size makes it difficult to study and until now, its structure was unknown.</p><p>To determine the structure of Tra1, Díaz-Santín et al. extracted the protein from baker’s yeast, and examined it using electron microscopy. The structure of Tra1 resembled a diamond ring with multiple protein domains that correspond to a band, setting and a centre stone. The structure was detailed enough so that Díaz-Santín et al. could locate various mutations that affect the role of Tra1. These locations are likely to be direct interfaces to the ‘activator proteins’. Moreover, the study showed that Tra1 was similar to another protein that repairs damaged DNA.</p><p>These results suggest that Tra1 not only works as an activator target, but may also have a role in repairing damaged DNA, and might even connect these two processes. Yeast Tra1 is also very similar to its human counterpart, which has been shown to stimulate cells to become cancerous. Further studies based on these results may help us understand how cancer begins.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>transcription activation</kwd><kwd>coactivator</kwd><kwd>PIKK</kwd><kwd>SAGA</kwd><kwd>NuA4</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>102535/Z/13/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheung</surname><given-names>Alan CM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RG140138</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheung</surname><given-names>Alan CM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000765</institution-id><institution>University College London</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Excellence Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheung</surname><given-names>Alan CM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An atomic model of the 3744-residue Tra1 protein reveals multiple transcription activator binding sites, its integration within the SAGA chromatin coactivator complex, and a striking similarity to DNA-repair factor DNA-PKcs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cells execute precise programmes of transcription in response to environmental or developmental signals. These programmes are regulated by activator proteins which bind to specific DNA sequences and recruit coactivators that activate transcription by stimulating assembly of the basal transcriptional machinery and/or catalysing chromatin modifications at target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hahn and Young, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Weake and Workman, 2010</xref>). Coactivators often interact with multiple activators and are also targeted by signaling pathways, making them integrative hubs that interpret multiple inputs to modulate transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Malik and Roeder, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rosenfeld et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The yeast SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5-Acetyltransferase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Grant et al., 1997</xref>) and NuA4 (Nucleosome-Acetyltransferase-of-histone-H4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allard et al., 1999</xref>) coactivators are conserved in all eukaryotes but are evolutionarily and mechanistically unrelated to each other; SAGA is a 19–20 subunit, 1.8 MDa complex that stimulates preinitiation complex formation by interaction with TBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dudley et al., 1999</xref>), and contains H3 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and H2B deubiquitinase enzymatic activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Daniel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Henry et al., 2003</xref>), whereas NuA4 is a 13-subunit, 1.3 MDa complex that acetylates H4 and H2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allard et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Grant et al., 1997</xref>). SAGA and NuA4 also have functions outside of transcription, with diverse but important roles in mRNA export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rodríguez-Navarro et al., 2004</xref>), DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bird et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Downs et al., 2004</xref>) and telomere maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Atanassov et al., 2009</xref>). Despite their differences, both complexes have integrated the large Tra1 (Transcription-Associated protein 1) subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allard et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Grant et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McMahon et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Saleh et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vassilev et al., 1998</xref>), an essential and highly conserved 433 KDa protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) that belongs to the <underline>P</underline>hospho<underline>i</underline>nositide 3-<underline>K</underline>inase-related <underline>k</underline>inase (PIKK) family of cellular regulators, which includes mTOR, DNA-PKcs, ATM/Tel1, ATR/Mec1 and SMG-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Baretić and Williams, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lempiäinen et al., 2009</xref>). PIKKs are protein kinases that have diverse regulatory functions in transcriptional regulation, DNA repair, cell growth, metabolic control and mRNA surveillance but Tra1 is the only member that is catalytically inactive, due to loss of the DFG motif within the kinase active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Saleh et al., 1998</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Although lacking catalytic activity, Tra1 is critical for coactivator function as it is a direct target for multiple activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brown et al., 2001</xref>) and enables the activities of SAGA and NuA4 to be directed at specific genes in order to stimulate their expression.</p><p>Activators contain transactivation domains (TADs) which directly target coactivators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Näär et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ptashne, 1988</xref>). Understanding the molecular mechanisms of TAD-coactivator interactions is a major challenge as TADs are poorly conserved, are often promiscuous and exhibit a strong compositional bias toward acidic, proline, glutamine or serine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mitchell and Tjian, 1989</xref>), resulting in an intrinsically disordered protein region unless bound to a coactivator target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dyson and Wright, 2005</xref>). In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, activators such as VP16, Gal4, Gcn4 and Hap4 directly target Tra1 in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brown et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fishburn et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Herbig et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Knutson and Hahn, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Reeves and Hahn, 2005</xref>) and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bhaumik and Green, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bhaumik et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Larschan and Winston, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lin et al., 2012</xref>), and the human homolog TRRAP interacts with the transcription factors c-Myc, E2F and E1A and is required for their stimulation of oncogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ard et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bouchard et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Deleu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kulesza et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McMahon et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">2000</xref>), making Tra1/TRRAP a conserved activator target in all eukaryotes.</p><p>Mutations of Tra1 have been described that affect HAT activity without affecting coactivator complex integrity, indicating roles beyond activator targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Knutson and Hahn, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mutiu et al., 2007</xref>). Tra1 is also present in other chromatin-related complexes, including the SAGA-related complex SILK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pray-Grant et al., 2002</xref>) and the ASTRA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shevchenko et al., 2008</xref>) from yeast. Similarly, TRRAP is present in four different human coactivator complexes STAGA, TFTC, PCAF and Tip60 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Murr et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, Schizosaccharomyces pombe contains two Tra1 paralogs which separately associate with SAGA and NuA4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Helmlinger et al., 2011</xref>). Both Tra1 and TRRAP are essential proteins; Tra1 is the only essential subunit of the SAGA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Saleh et al., 1998</xref>) and TRRAP disruption leads to early embryonic lethality in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Herceg et al., 2001</xref>). The high level of conservation of Tra1 sequence and function from yeast to human, its requirement for cellular viability and its presence in multiple coactivator complexes highlights its pivotal role in regulating gene expression. However, the molecular mechanisms behind Tra1 function are poorly understood, and the reason for its common integration within multiple complexes is unclear. To elucidate these aspects of its function, we determined an atomic structure of the Tra1 protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cryo-EM structure of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Tra1</title><p>We over-expressed and purified <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Tra1 from its native host and determined its structure by single-particle cryo-EM to a resolution of 3.7 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Two-thirds of this insertion was resolved in the reconstruction and is an unusual feature, as the N-terminal helix of H9 extends across the Ring to contact the opposite side at H42-H43 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This interaction is corroborated by BS3-crosslinking experiments on the complete SAGA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Han et al., 2014</xref>), but the function of the H9 insertion is unclear, given that it is poorly conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and is not essential for viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Knutson and Hahn, 2011</xref>).</p><p>After H16, the Finger solenoid is terminated by a 38-residue loop (residues 960–996) containing a two-stranded beta sheet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>) and a second solenoid is formed by repeats H17-H49. This is the largest continuous solenoid in Tra1 and dominates the appearance of Tra1, forming a large closed ring approximately 125 Å in diameter. This solenoid starts with the N-clasp (H17-H18), continues with the Ring region (H19-H46) and ends with the C-clasp (H47-H49) which abuts the N-Clasp to close the ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The Clasp contains a significant proportion of insertions between its repeats, as predicted by sequence analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Knutson and Hahn, 2011</xref>), which form a set of interlocking loops that fix the Ring closed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

The FAT domain contains 15 TPR repeats (T1-T15) and together with the FRB domain, surround the Kinase and FATC domains. The kinase domain has a fold typical for PIKK and PI3K catalytic domains, superposing onto the mTOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yang et al., 2013</xref>) and DNA-PKcs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sibanda et al., 2017</xref>) kinase domains with RMSDs (Cα) of 2.7 Å and 2.9 Å respectively. However, although the relative positions of the catalytic, activation and phosphate-binding loops of mTOR/DNA-PKcs are preserved in Tra1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), the critical residues required for ATP/Mg binding and catalysis are not conserved, and the Tra1 activation loop contains an 18-residue insertion compared to its counterparts in the catalytic PIKKs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The relative juxtaposition of FRB and kinase domains also differ as the DNA-PKcs and mTOR FRB domains are positioned away from the active site cleft, whereas the Tra1 FRB domain occludes it, contacting the LBE (mLST8-Binding-Element) on the opposite site of the cleft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Although the FATC domain is hypothesized to be critical for regulating catalytic activity of PIKKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yang et al., 2013</xref>), its sensitivity to mutagenesis within the kinase-inactive Tra1 and its protection of the hydrophobic cavity from solvent suggests it also has a key role in maintaining structural integrity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Tra1 occupies a peripheral position within the SAGA complex</title><p>Given the common presence of Tra1 in SAGA and NuA4, a key question is how Tra1 is incorporated into each coactivator, and whether complex integration results in functional or mechanistic differences. To examine its interactions with the SAGA complex, Tra1 was fitted into a recent 30 Å negative stain EM reconstruction of wild-type <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> SAGA (EMD-2693) which exhibits a bilobal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Durand et al., 2014</xref>). A unambiguous fit was found within ‘Lobe A’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>) and indicate that no gross conformational changes are required to fit Tra1 into this SAGA reconstruction. The remaining SAGA density is contained within the crescent shaped ‘Lobe B’ which accounts for the remaining SAGA subunits, hence the contact between lobes A and B represents a major interface between Tra1 and SAGA. However, the interface is small (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>), demonstrating that Tra1 occupies a peripheral position within SAGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Setiaputra et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Han et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wu et al., 2004</xref>) and is not required for its structural integrity as a scaffolding platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Helmlinger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wu and Winston, 2002</xref>). The interface is localized to one side of of Tra1, primarily around the FAT domain at TPR repeats T1-T7 (residues 2572–2830) but also at the C-terminal half of the Ring at repeats H41-H44 (residues 2150–2350) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), which clearly represent sites of intermolecular contact between Tra1 and the remaining SAGA subunits. This is supported by BS3-crosslinking experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Setiaputra et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Han et al., 2014</xref>), which detected five Tra1 residues (K2351, K2713, K2781, K2808 and K2815) that lie adjacent to this interface, making intermolecular crosslinks to subunits Taf12, Spt20, Ada1 and Sgf73 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Given that Taf12 is the most frequently identified crosslinking partner of Tra1 (accounting for 6/13 intermolecular crosslinks), we suggest that it lies within or close to the observed interface, which is consistent with an earlier proposed model of the SAGA complex determined by negative stain EM, albeit at lower resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wu et al., 2004</xref>). Similarly, as Ada1 can form a heterodimer with Taf12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Selleck et al., 2001</xref>), and its deletion causes the release of Tra1 from SAGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wu and Winston, 2002</xref>), it is also likely to lie close to this interface. The BS3-crosslinking experiments also detected three additional residues that make intermolecular crosslinks to Spt3, Sgf73 and Taf12, but are located distal from the observed interface, being located on the Finger (K476) or on the opposite side of the FAT domain (K3161 and K3175) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Although the identification of crosslinked amino acids can suffer from false positives, the position of these residues away from the main interface are not necessarily inconsistent with forming intermolecular contacts, as elements of SAGA that are less globular in structure and are poorly resolved by negative stain EM may project away from Lobe B to make contacts with Tra1, such as extended loops or helices.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28384.012</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Tra1 occupies a peripheral position within SAGA.</title><p>A negative stain reconstruction of S. cerevisiae SAGA was retrieved from the EMDB (EMD-2693) and Tra1 was fitted into the map using Chimera.

Despite only having having 18% sequence identity, both Tra1 and DNA-PKcs have similar ‘diamond ring’ topologies, and regions analogous to Finger, Clasp, Ring and Head can be defined for DNA-PKcs, resulting in the same relative positioning as Tra1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The largest difference in conformation is between the Tra1 Finger, which is equivalent to the ‘N-terminal Unit’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sibanda et al., 2017</xref>) or ‘Arm/Bridge’ region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sharif et al., 2017</xref>) defined for DNA-PKcs.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms behind coactivator function is essential for elucidating how complex programmes of gene expression are established. Although SAGA and NuA4 are well characterized in terms of their enzymatic activities and genome localization, their interactions with activators are poorly understood. Tra1 has been identified as a key activator target, but the molecular details of its interaction with activators and its parent complexes are yet to be determined. To provide insight into this aspect of coactivator function, we determined the structure of Tra1 by cryo-EM, and built an atomic model of the complete protein, allowing activator-disrupting mutations to be mapped to the structure and highlighting potential TAD binding sites. The model also fitted unambiguously into an existing reconstruction of SAGA to reveal its binding interface and integration within the complex.</p><p>The integration of Tra1 within SAGA leaves Tra1 relatively unimpeded for activator binding, as its interaction occludes very little of its solvent accessible surface. Similarly, as its conformation within SAGA appears unchanged from apo-Tra1 (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>), this suggests that activators cannot discriminate SAGA from NuA4 via Tra1 targeting alone, and other subunits specific to SAGA may act as additional activator targets and provide specificity e.g. numerous activators can directly target the SAGA subunits Gcn5, Ada1, Taf6 and Taf12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Klein et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Reeves and Hahn, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). It is possible that the presentation of Tra1 by NuA4 could restrict or alter its binding to activators in comparison to SAGA, but this remains to be determined; visual comparisons of our Tra1 2D class averages with those from a previously determined cryo-EM reconstruction of NuA4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chittuluru et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) shows that the entirety of NuA4 closely matches Tra1 in appearance, indicating that the remaining NuA4 subunits are highly dynamic and/or have dissociated in the reconstruction. As endogenous purifications of NuA4 do not co-purify subunits of SAGA (and vice versa), Tra1 is unlikely to connect the two coactivators into a single complex and its presence in separate coactivators may result from overlapping contact sites with both SAGA and NuA4, precluding their assembly around the same molecule of Tra1. Hence the SAGA contact sites identified in Tra1 may also be exploited for NuA4 interactions which is supported by deletion mutations within Tra1 that simultaneously cause defects in SAGA and NuA4 assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Knutson and Hahn, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Mutations that disrupt the interaction of Tra1 with Gal4, Gcn4, Rap1 and VP16 are spread across Tra1, located within the Finger, Ring and Head regions, and are predominantly distal from the interface with SAGA. However, the precise mechanism of disruption remains unknown; as well as specifically abrogating a Tra1-activator interface, these mutations may also cause an allosteric change, affect protein stability or some combination thereof. Nevertheless, 4/5 of the amino acid substitutions that disrupt interaction with Gal4 are located in the Finger at solvent exposed sites, and three are spatially proximal to each other (D397N/H400Y/S404F), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), strongly suggesting the presence of a direct Gal4 interface. Additionally, of the three deletion mutants that affect Gcn4 and Rap1, two are also located in the Finger adjacent to the Gal4 interface on its N-terminal side (H3 and H6-H7), hence we suggest that the Finger may function as a platform for interacting with multiple activators. The Finger is unlikely to be the only activator interaction site, given the location of the third deletion mutant in the Ring (proximal to the Head at H25-H26), the clustering of mutations that affect the interaction with VP16 within the Head, and an in vitro interaction between a C-terminal fragment of Tra1 and VP16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brown et al., 2001</xref>). A critical feature of these mutations is the ability to disrupt specific activators whilst leaving others unaffected i.e. mutations that disrupt the interaction of Gal4 with Tra1 do not affect Gcn4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lin et al., 2012</xref>) and vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Knutson and Hahn, 2011</xref>). Conversely, the mutations that affect Gcn4 also effect Rap1, indicating that these activators target Tra1 in a similar manner. Although allosteric effects cannot be excluded, the simplest mechanism is that Tra1 harbors multiple interfaces for activators that can be specific for single activators (Gal4) or bind multiple activators (Gcn4 and Rap1). The presence of multiple interfaces would therefore provide a mechanism for Tra1 to integrate signals from activators, allowing multiple activators to co-operate in stimulating transcription. Individual binding sites are also likely to vary in their affinity and kinetics of interaction, further tuning the strength of transcriptional activation. More intricate mechanisms can also be hypothesized, such as competition between different activators for the same binding site, or by allosteric changes upon activator binding that alter its interaction with other activators and/or coactivator components. Although Tra1 required no conformational changes to fit into SAGA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), HEAT repeat proteins are highly flexible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kappel et al., 2010</xref>) and Tra1 may undergo conformational changes upon interacting with other factors such as activators. In that regard, the N-terminal part of the Finger is the most structurally dynamic part of Tra1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>) and makes extensive contacts with the Ring, so activator binding in this location may induce conformational changes and stimulate allosteric changes within Tra1 that may exert effects on its parent histone-modification complex.</p><p>The remarkable and unexpected structural homology to the DNA repair factor DNA-PKcs suggests that Tra1 has roles beyond transcriptional activation. Yeast lack a homolog for DNA-PKcs and the Tra1 parent complex NuA4 is required for double strand break (DSB) repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bird et al., 2002</xref>), so it is tempting to speculate that Tra1 may have functional similarities with DNA-PKcs and a direct role in DNA repair. DNA-PKcs mediates ligation of double strand breaks (DSBs) by forming a synaptic complex with Ku70-Ku80 and aligning the broken DNA ends, whereupon its kinase becomes active and coordinates further assembly of the repair machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dobbs et al., 2010</xref>). Although Tra1 lacks the kinase activity that is crucial for DNA-PKcs function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cui et al., 2005</xref>), the structural homology between Tra1 and DNA-PKcs suggests that Tra1 might retain the non-catalytic features of DNA-PKcs in binding nucleic acids and/or recruiting additional repair factors. Recruitment of active kinases may then substitute for lack of Tra1 catalytic activity, such as ATM which interacts with Tip60 (the human homolog of NuA4) in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sun et al., 2005</xref>). Although a direct role in DNA repair remains speculative, connections between Tra1 and DNA damage are already well established, as depletion of TRRAP compromises DSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Murr et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Robert et al., 2006</xref>) and its parent complex Tip60 is recruited to DSBs in a TRRAP-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Murr et al., 2006</xref>), resulting in H4 acetylation that facilitates repair. TRRAP also forms a complex with the MRE11, RAD50, and NBS1 (MRN) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Robert et al., 2006</xref>), a key sensor of DSBs that also recruits PIKK family member ATM to sites of DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Falck et al., 2005</xref>). In this manner, MRN could function analogously to Ku70-Ku80, which recruits DNA-PKcs to sites of DSBs. Additionally, NuA4 can recognize DSBs directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bird et al., 2002</xref>) and SAGA and NuA4 preferentially acetylate the ends of a linear chromatin template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vignali et al., 2000</xref>), hence Tra1 may provide this recognition capability, given its homology to DNA-PKcs which has affinity for DNA ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gottlieb and Jackson, 1993</xref>).</p><p>As a direct target of multiple activators, and as common component of SAGA and NuA4, Tra1 is central to transcriptional regulation. However, its size and presence in additional chromatin-related complexes, and its homology to DNA-PKcs points to a role beyond activator targeting. The structure presented here is an important step toward discovering those roles, and further structural and biochemical studies of Tra1 bound to activators and/or its parent complexes will elucidate new mechanisms of its functions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>The <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Tra1 coding sequence (YHR099W) from genomic DNA was PCR amplified and cloned into a galactose-inducible pRS424-based expression vector (courtesy of K.

MotionCor2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>) was used for patch-based motion correction of movie frames followed by CTFFIND4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015</xref>) to estimate the contrast transfer function (CTF) parameters of the corrected micrographs. An initial subset of the data was processed with Gautomatch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Urnavicius et al., 2015</xref>), using an automatically generated Gaussian reference. After initial particle extraction and reference-free 2D classification, selected 2D classes were used as a template for further iterations of particle picking with Gautomatch, yielding 418,339 particles from 1733 micrographs. These were subjected to reference-free 2D classification, and particles contributing to the best 2D classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref>) were selected for 3D refinement. A previously published 13 Å resolution cryo-EM density map of DNA-PKcs (EMD-1102) was low-pass filtered to 40 Å and used as initial reference for 3D refinement, and the resulting consensus model was used as a reference map for 3D classification. The best 3D class containing 182,285 particles (44% of total) was used to perform a 3D refinement run, resulting in a 3.9 Å map. Substitution of the particles contributing to this map by particles from dose-weighted images calculated by MotionCor2 provided a final reconstruction at 3.7 Å resolution after a last run of 3D refinement. Reported resolutions are based on gold-standard Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) curves between independently refined half-maps, using the 0.143 criterion. The resulting maps from refinement were post-processed by RELION and sharpened by a negative B-factor using an automated procedure. The final map was highly detailed with clear density for strands, helices and loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Sidechains were resolved throughout the reconstruction, allowing de novo building of 3474/3744 residues. Model building was performed with Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Emsley et al., 2010</xref>) and assisted by secondary structure predictions from PSIPRED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jones, 1999</xref>), JPRED3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cole et al., 2008</xref>), and also reported within (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Knutson and Hahn, 2011</xref>). The abundance of helices amongst the solenoid repeats greatly assisted building and assignment of sequence register. Maps were B-factor sharpened with phenix.auto_sharpen (1.11.1–2575) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>) or filtered to 5 Å to provide extra guidance during model building. Local resolution variations were estimated within RELION. The model was refined with phenix.real_space_refine using secondary structure restraints. For cross-validation of the model, atomic positions were randomly perturbed by up to 0.5 Å to remove model bias from prior refinement against all the data, and subsequently refined against a single (unmasked) half-map using secondary structure restraints. The refined model was used for FSC calculations against the same half-map (FSC<sub>work</sub>), the withheld half-map (FSC<sub>free</sub>), and the combined map (FSC<sub>total</sub>) to monitor for overfitting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Refinement half-maps correspond to the same half-maps used during gold-standard FSC resolution estimation. Refinement/validation statistics are shown in table S1. The fit of the Tra1 structure into a SAGA reconstruction (EMD-2693) was performed with fitting tools implemented in Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>), and assessed by correlation score and visual appearance.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor.

This is unique among the PIKKs in that it is a pseudokinase rather than a kinase. This is an excellent and straightforward report of the first TRRAP structure at a resolution sufficient to interpret the path of the polypeptide. As would be expected from sequence similarity, the kinase domain is similar to other PIKKs, whose structures have been reported, mTOR, TOR, DNA-PKcs and ATM. An emerging picture is that the PIKKs have a variety of conformations for the vast regions outside the FAT and kinase domains. As these structures have been reported, a variety of names have been given to structural regions (domains). There is in general little sequence similarity in the regions, so this lack of structural similarity is not surprising. The physical features shown here that render the Tra1 kinase inactive are new and interesting, as is the proposed role for the FATC element in Tra1. What is also surprising in the current report is the striking structural similarity of Tra1 to DNA-PKcs. The authors propose that this may imply related functions in DNA double-strand break repair. This is an intriguing proposition, and the Tra1 structure will provide an excellent framework designing mutations that could test this hypothesis, however, this is beyond the scope of the current manuscript. Overall, the results showing the structure of the target of this transcriptional activator will be very valuable to the transcription and DNA repair fields. Pending the resolution of a few issues (detailed below), the work is appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Major issues:</p><p>The structure determination appears to be of high quality, and technical aspects are generally adequately described. There is no detailed description of model building or refinement. It might be helpful to expand on this. Are side chains visible throughout the polypeptide? From the local resolution plot, this may not be the case. Are the authors confident of the assignment of the sequence register throughout the structure? Are there breaks in the density? If so, where are these breaks? Hopefully the authors have deposited a model with PDB that includes a residue assignment throughout, since they have made to indication of uncertainty.</p><p>Along these lines, the FSC plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> shows unusual features.

Sidechains were visible for the majority of the polypeptide, and the map was highly detailed, allowing the structure to be built with confidence and has been submitted to the PDB along with maps to the EMDB, and codes have now been added to the manuscript. The structure is mostly composed of α helical repeats which greatly assisted building, especially when combined with secondary structure predictions, providing confidence in our register assignment. Additionally, helices from the solenoid repeats were often amphipathic, burying their hydrophobic sidechains into the solenoid core. This was a useful aid in building into regions of the reconstruction that were of lower quality. 270/3744 residues were not visible, spread over 15 chain breaks and we have added this information to the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Along these lines, the FSC plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> shows unusual features.

Please address/comment on both issues.</italic> </p><p>The FSC plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> was intended to represent the FSC of both masked (orange) and unmasked (green) reconstructions. However, the data was misplotted from our data file. We apologise for the mistake and have replaced both traces with masked and unmasked FSC with the correct values, resulting in a more canonical appearance. The resolution limit (defined by the cutoff at 0.143) is unchanged at 3.7 Å. From our experience with crystal structure determination at low resolution (e.g. PDB codes 4A3M, 4A3I, 4A3J, 3HOX, 3HOZ (3.7-3.9 Å)), we believe the features in the map are representative for this resolution estimate. We fear that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref> may not have fully conveyed the quality of the reconstruction, as we deliberately used β strand containing regions that are typically the most challenging to resolve. We have enlarged the existing panels and included two extra panels of electron density that further highlight the quality of the reconstruction.</p><p><italic>Concerning the statement, &quot;The model also fitted unambiguously into an existing reconstruction of SAGA to reveal its binding interface and integration within the complex&quot;. The work as written hints at this interface, but doesn't really make concrete, testable predictions. Based on the crosslinking data depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, which parts of Tra1 and the rest of SAGA are touching?</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for alerting us to this flaw. We have expanded our description of the Tra1-SAGA interface, by listing the precise residues within Tra1 that were crosslinked to SAGA and the subunits they pertain to, and integrating this data into <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The crosslinked residues that are closest to the observed Tra1-SAGA interface frequently target Taf12, hence we have suggested that Taf12 forms the SAGA side of this interface. We have also slightly enlarged the regions of Tra1 that are visibly in contact with SAGA, to repeats H41-H44 (residues 2150-2350) and T1-T7 (residues 2572-2830) as our original descriptions were overly specific given the resolution of the negative stain reconstruction by Durand et al. Hence we have updated the text with the proposal that Tra1 repeats T1-T7 and H41-H44 make contact to SAGA subunit Taf12, and also likely to Ada1 based on findings from the literature.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>.

Do any mutations cross-disrupt targeting between different activators? Can the likely effects of the mutations be categorized?</italic> </p><p>We have elaborated on the distribution of the activator-disrupting mutations both in the Results and Discussion, suggesting that Tra1 contains multiple activator binding sites, and that these mutations abrogate these sites. We have also discussed the utility of multiple sites for transcriptional regulation. Crucial to this argument is the fact that these mutations only effect specific activators and are also spatially separated. To our knowledge, the only mutations that cross-disrupt multiple activators are those described by Knutson et al. (2011) which affect both Gcn4 and Rap1, but do not disrupt Gal4 (Lin et al. (2012)), hence we believe some activators may target overlapping/common Tra1 sites, whereas others target specific sites.</p><p>Nevertheless, our theory that these mutations abrogate distinct binding sites remains speculative, and we have acknowledged that they may instead have allosteric or stability effects, and that these mechanisms are not necessarily mutually exclusive. We favour that they mostly abrogate activator binding sites, since we posit that allosteric or stability effects would likely influence Tra1 function for all activators, rather than the selective effects that are observed for the mutations that target Gal4 vs. Gcn4/Rap1.</p></body></sub-article></article>
