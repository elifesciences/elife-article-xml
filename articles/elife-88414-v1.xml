effective at controlling progressive forms of the disease. Meningeal inflammation is a recognized risk factor for cortical gray matter pathology which can result in disabling symptoms such as cognitive impairment and depression, but the mechanisms linking meningeal inflammation and gray matter pathology remain unclear. Here, we performed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided spatial transcriptomics in a mouse model of autoimmune meningeal inflammation to characterize the transcriptional signature in areas of meningeal inflammation and the underlying brain parenchyma. We found broadly increased activity of inflammatory signaling pathways at sites of meningeal inflammation, but only a subset of these pathways active in the adjacent brain parenchyma. Subclustering of regions adjacent to meningeal inflammation revealed the subset of immune programs induced in brain parenchyma, notably complement signaling and antigen processing/presentation. Trajectory gene and gene set modeling analysis confirmed variable penetration of immune signatures originating from meningeal inflammation into the adjacent brain tissue. This work contributes a valuable data resource to the field, provides the first detailed spatial transcriptomic characterization in a model of meningeal inflammation, and highlights several candidate pathways in the pathogenesis of gray matter pathology.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>multiple sclerosis</kwd><kwd>meningeal inflammation</kwd><kwd>spatial transcriptomics</kwd><kwd>experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis</kwd><kwd>gray matter degeneration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000890</institution-id><institution>National Multiple Sclerosis Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FAN-2106-37832</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gadani</surname><given-names>Sachin P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000890</institution-id><institution>National Multiple Sclerosis Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JF-2007-36755</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bhargava</surname><given-names>Pavan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004755</institution-id><institution>EMD Serono</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bhargava</surname><given-names>Pavan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Leptomeningeal inflammation in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis triggers deeply penetrating gene changes in underlying brain tissue, described using spatial transcriptomics.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by a relapsing remitting and/or progressive course of demyelination, axonal injury, and neurologic dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reich et al., 2018</xref>). Highly efficacious disease modifying therapies have revolutionized the prevention and treatment of MS relapses, but are less effective at stopping hallmarks of MS progression such as brain atrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Faissner et al., 2019</xref>). Accumulating evidence points to a pivotal role for leptomeningeal inflammation (LMI) in contributing to this pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Howell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Absinta et al., 2015</xref>). LMI is found in all subtypes of MS, ranging histologically from disorganized collections of leukocytes to highly organized ectopic lymphoid follicles, and correlates with the presence of cortical gray matter demyelination, neurite loss, and decreased volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wicken et al., 2018</xref>). Gray matter pathology (GMP) has been linked to debilitating symptoms such as cognitive impairment and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Geurts and Barkhof, 2008</xref>), and tends to occur in spatial relation to areas of LMI. Indeed, the most common gray matter lesion location is directly sub-pial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bø et al., 2003a</xref>), and there is a gradient of increased pathology toward the surface of the brain in MS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Magliozzi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mainero et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, GMP occurs without local blood-brain barrier disruption or robust infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the brain parenchyma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">van Horssen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bø et al., 2003b</xref>). LMI is therefore speculated to be a source of pro-inflammatory molecules that contribute to GMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pikor et al., 2015</xref>), but the pathway(s) involved remain(s) unknown.</p><p>Several putative mechanisms linking LMI to GMP have been proposed. Magliozzi and colleagues identified increased expression of numerous cytokines and chemokines, including interferon gamma (IFNγ), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-2, IL-22, CXCL13, and CXCL10, in the meninges and CSF of post-mortem MS cases with high levels of meningeal inflammation and GM demyelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Magliozzi et al., 2018</xref>). Microarray analysis of cortical lesions from MS cases with LMI revealed a shift in TNF signaling from TNFR1/TNFR2 and I-mediated anti-apoptotic pathways toward TNFR1- and RIPK3-mediated pro-apoptotic/pro-necroptotic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Magliozzi et al., 2019</xref>). In marmoset and rat models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), sub-pial cortical lesions were found with prominent microglial activation and immunoglobulin deposition on myelin sheaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Storch et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Merkler et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, complement deposition, one possible mechanism of immunoglobulin-related cellular injury, is not found in purely cortical gray matter lesions, in contrast to white or gray/white matter lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brink et al., 2005</xref>). Numerous other mediators of injury, including reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, metabolic stress, and excitotoxicity have been proposed to drive neurodegeneration in MS and may be at play in GMP.</p><p>Previous attempts to characterize the relation between LMI and GMP have been limited by the absence of spatially resolved data, which therefore lacks critical information about the anatomic relationship between LMI and the underlying brain parenchyma. Here, we present a spatial transcriptomic dataset and analysis in a mouse model of relapsing/remitting CNS autoimmunity and meningeal inflammation, Swiss Jim Lambert (SJL) mouse EAE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Magliozzi et al., 2004</xref>). Our prior work in SJL EAE demonstrated meningeal areas of gadolinium contrast enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that correspond histologically to collections of B cells, T cells, and myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhargava et al., 2021</xref>). In the parenchyma adjacent to areas of meningeal inflammation we identified astrocytosis, activated microglia, demyelination, and evidence of axonal stress and damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhargava et al., 2021</xref>). This work characterizes the spatially resolved transcriptome of LMI in the SJL EAE model system, revealing the subset of genes and gene sets active in the LMI that extend into the adjacent parenchyma and providing insights into immune pathways that could underlie sub-pial neurodegeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We tracked the development of LMI during SJL EAE using contrast-enhanced serial MRI imaging.

Grouping the dimensional reduction UMAP plot by EAE and naïve revealed that cluster eleven (C11) was restricted to EAE samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). C11 makes up 1–5% of the total spots in those samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), or about 20–120 total spots, and was significantly enriched in EAE relative to naïve samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Visualizing the clusters using spatial feature plots confirmed that most clusters map consistently to specific anatomic regions and were similar between naïve and EAE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). C11 overlapped with previously noted areas of meningeal MRI enhancement, suggesting that C11 represents areas of meningeal inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B—D</xref>). We compared the gene expression in C11 to other clusters and found 132 upregulated genes and 70 downregulated genes (p&lt;0.05; log 2 fold change &gt;1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).

The distance between the average location in each subcluster to the nearest point of C11 was calculated. In the subclusters of cluster 1, we found no difference in proximity to C11 between EAE-specific subclusters vs. subclusters present in EAE and naïve. However, in subclusters of cluster 2, the EAE-specific subcluster was significantly closer to C11 on average compared to other subclusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). To explore which pathways were activated in these subclusters, we performed gene set enrichment analysis using the GO database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). All subclusters displayed enrichment of GO gene sets related to inflammation, antigen processing and presentation, and humoral immunity. Interestingly, pathways related to neuron death, cellular stress, and negative regulation of cellular processes were also enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Interestingly, other pathways related to cell death, including positive regulation of apoptotic process or programmed cell death, were upregulated in subcluster 1_3 but downregulated in subcluster 1_4, suggesting spatially variable survival signals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). Overall, 31 upregulated pathways were conserved between cluster 11 and subclusters 1_3, 1_4, 2_6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). We found prominent conserved upregulation of pathways related to adaptive/B-cell-mediated immunity, antigen processing and presentation, cell killing, and others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>).</p><p>Our pathway analysis of meningeal inflammation and areas of inflamed adjacent brain parenchyma suggested that inflammatory signals increased in meningeal inflammation could have variable ‘penetration’ into the adjacent brain. We sought to test this using spatial trajectory gene/gene set expression modeling available within the SPATA2 software package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kueckelhaus et al., 2020</xref>). Trajectories were drawn in EAE samples from the largest region of meningeal inflammation to the central thalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Gene and gene set expression levels were then evaluated along the length of these trajectories and compared to ideal patterns of expression, as demonstrated for representative genes <italic>B2m</italic> and <italic>C3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–E</xref>). The difference between gene or gene set expression and the ideal patterns, here ‘logarithmic descending’ or ‘gradient descending’, is represented by the residual line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and E</xref>). The area under the residual curve (residual AUC) is therefore inversely proportional to fit for the given gene or gene set and ideal pattern. <italic>C3</italic> expression declines rapidly along the trajectory and the logarithmic descending residual AUC is lower than gradient descending residual AUC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), while <italic>B2m</italic> follows a less steep decline and fits the two patterns similarly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Trajectory analysis of gene sets enriched in meningeal inflammation and adjacent brain parenchyma was performed in this way, and the average residual AUC was calculated for gradient descending/ascending and logarithmic descending/ascending patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Fi</xref>). As expected, all gene sets fit descending patterns better than ascending ones. There was variability in fit to the gradient descending pattern of expression, representing a more gradual decline in pathway enrichment along the trajectory, with gene sets related to antigen processing and presentation, cell killing, IL-6 production, and IFNγ response having the best fit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Fi</xref>).

Here, we present spatial transcriptomics analysis in a mouse model of LMI, finding a broad swath of inflammatory pathways upregulated at foci of LMI and a subset of them upregulated in the nearby brain parenchyma. Notably, genes related to B-cell-mediated responses and antigen processing and presentation were upregulated in inflammatory parenchymal subclusters. Variable penetrance of inflammatory pathway activity was evident when analyzing the expression pattern of gene sets along a linear trajectory from LMI into the CNS parenchyma, where antigen processing and presentation, IL-6 production, and the IFNγ response pathway activity followed a more gradual decline as compared to other pathways.</p><p>An important limitation of the spatial transcriptomics method used in this study is the spatial resolution of each spot. Since each spot is ~55 µm in diameter it is likely that multiple cells are captured in each one. The simultaneous addition of single-cell analysis would facilitate deconvolution of cell types within each spot. Furthermore, some spots of the borders of anatomic structures are likely to include both regions. This is exemplified by the spots within cluster 11, which in this study mainly represent meningeal inflammation, also being enriched in glial genes such as <italic>Gfap</italic>. Other methods of spatial RNA analysis exist that allow single-cell resolution, but to date are probe-based and therefore limited by the number of genes assessed.</p><p>Prior work supports roles for pathways identified in our dataset, including B cell and IFNγ-mediated responses, in contributing to neurodegeneration in MS. LMI in MS is rich in B cells, and the critical role of B cells in MS has been underscored by the success of B cell depletion in relapsing and progressive MS. Recent studies have proposed numerous mechanisms whereby B cells could contribute to cortical pathology, including indirectly through activation and inflammatory polarization of T cells, myeloid cells, and astrocytes or directly through production of neurotoxic cytokines or antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhargava et al., 2022</xref>). B cell culture supernatants from MS patients, but not healthy controls, are toxic to rat and human neurons and oligodendrocytes with this effect being mediated by the extracellular vesicle fraction of the supernatants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lisak et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benjamins et al., 2019</xref>). B cells are also sources for inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and GM-CSF, and antibodies, which are speculated to contribute to GMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhargava et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The role of IFNγ in the pathogenesis of MS and EAE is complex, and likely has stage-specific protective and pathologic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arellano et al., 2015</xref>). Its prominent upregulation in EAE was initially considered evidence of its pathogenic nature, but subsequent experiments showed that it was pathogenic during the initiation phase but protective later in the course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arellano et al., 2015</xref>). IFNγ signaling and subsequent upregulation of antigen processing and presentation on glia has been identified as a mechanism that could lead to remyelination failure and subsequent neuronal loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kirby et al., 2019</xref>). Oligodendrocyte precursor cells upregulate antigen presentation and cross-presentation pathways in response to IFNγ, promoting inflammation and making them susceptible to CD8+ T cell killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kirby et al., 2019</xref>). Upregulation of genes for self-antigen presentation has also been noted in neurons and oligodendrocyte lineage (OL) cells in post-mortem MS single nucleus RNAseq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schirmer et al., 2019</xref>) and OL cells in EAE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Falcão et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jäkel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Langseth et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kukanja et al., 2024</xref>). Recent work also assessed subcortical white matter lesions from post-mortem MS cases via spatial transcriptomics, finding prominent elevation of TNF signaling, in agreement with presented results in the SJL EAE model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lerma-Martin et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Another important consideration in these experiments is our choice of naïve, rather than CFA only, controls. While often used as the control in EAE studies focused on mechanisms of autoimmunity, CFA only can independently induce systemic inflammation. Since this study seeks to describe transcriptomic changes in neuroinflammation more broadly, we chose to use a healthy comparison group to maximize our ability to find genes enriched in neuroinflammation. Ultimately, however, the choice of naïve or CFA only controls is unlikely to have affected our conclusions. SJL-EAE, unlike the more common C57Bl6-EAE, does not require pertussis toxin during the induction. The only difference between naïve and CFA only controls is the subcutaneous CFA delivered at time of immunization (11 weeks prior to experiment endpoint). Indeed, when we compared CFA only and healthy animals at 11 weeks there was no difference in glial reactivity by GFAP, IBA1, or CD68 mean fluorescence intensity (MFI). There was also no evidence of neurologic symptoms or LMI development in CFA only controls.</p><p>While SJL EAE models many features of LMI in MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Magliozzi et al., 2004</xref>), there are important differences that limit the direct translation of these results to MS. The majority of LMI identified in mice with SJL EAE in our experiments occurred in subarachnoid cisterns, and as a result prominently affected areas of deep gray matter including thalamus and hypothalamus as opposed to cortical lesions also seen in MS. Notably, neuronal loss in the thalamus and other deep gray nuclei does occur in MS with a similar ‘surface-in’ gradient of neuronal injury, thought to also be related to toxic CSF-derived factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Azevedo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Magliozzi et al., 2022</xref>). Demyelination, microglia and astrocyte activation, and neuronal loss are evident in the parenchyma adjacent to LMI in SJL EAE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhargava et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gupta et al., 2023</xref>). We also noted some variability in the extent and location of LMI, which is unavoidable in EAE. While other animal models of LMI, such as directly injecting inflammatory cytokines into the meninges/cortex, produce more predictable regions of LMI, they involve traumatic injury to the brain and typically lack follicle-like structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Silva et al., 2021</xref>). Notably, novel rodent models of cytokine-mediated LMI have recently been developed, including virus-mediated meningeal overexpression of TNF and IFNγ or sub-arachnoid injection of recombinant lymphotoxin-α, were recently developed, and exhibit lymphoid-like structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">James Bates et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">James et al., 2020</xref>). Spatially resolved analyses of these models could provide additional insights into sub-pial pathology during neuroinflammation.</p><p>This work is the first to characterize a mouse model of LMI and gray matter injury using spatial transcriptomics, and in addition to the analysis presented here contributes a publicly available dataset for future research. We highlight the importance of antigen processing and presentation and complement signaling, which are prominently upregulated in sub-pial gray matter, in our model. Future studies should focus on spatial transcriptomics in post-mortem or biopsied human tissue. While access to appropriate samples remains a significant barrier, recent advances in RNA extraction from formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Newton et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gracia Villacampa et al., 2021</xref>) will allow for the use of large banks of historically collected and preserved samples and could dramatically improve availability.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>SJL/J mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories for all experiments.

Feature barcoded expression matrices were used as input for downstream spatial transcriptomics analysis using Seurat (v.4.3.0) and SPATA2 (v.0.1.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kueckelhaus et al., 2020</xref>). Data was loaded and analyzed using the Seurat, and all spots that were determined to not be over tissue were discarded using the filter.matrix option in Seurat’s Load10XSpatial function. Spots with less than 250 measured genes and less than 500 unique molecular identifiers were filtered out. Data normalization and stabilization of sequence depth variance was performed on each sample using SCTransform with default parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hafemeister and Satija, 2019</xref>). Sample data was then annotated and combined into a merged object for downstream quality control and analysis. Dimensionality reduction was performed using principal component analysis, followed by computation of shared nearest neighbors of the first 10 principal components and cluster identification (resolution 0.3). To visualize all spots in a two-dimensional plot, a UMAP was created with Seurat’s RunUMAP function using the first 10 principal components. Cluster and subcluster enriched genes were identified with Wilcoxon tests as implemented in the FindMarkers function within Seurat. Differential gene expression between groups was attained using DESeq2 (v.1.38.2) on samples pseudobulked by biological replicate. Gene set enrichment analysis and visualization was performed using the GO database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carbon et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashburner et al., 2000</xref>) and the clusterProfiler package (v.4.6.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). Estimated signaling pathway activities were calculated for each spot with the top 500 genes of each pathway on SCTransformed data using the PROGENy package (v.1.20.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schubert et al., 2018</xref>). For subclustering analysis, select clusters were subsetted before undergoing dimensionality reduction, neighbor calculation, cluster identification, marker identification, and gene set enrichment as described above. Trajectory gene and gene set modeling analysis was performed with the SPATA2 package. Spatial trajectories were drawn in EAE slices from the center of cluster 11 to the centro-medial nucleus of thalamus. Gene and gene sets were analyzed along these trajectories using the assessTrajectoryTrends function within SPATA2.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>RNAscope</title><p>Brain tissue was collected from N=3 naïve or EAE (11 weeks’ post-immunization) SJL mice after transcardial perfusion with 4% PFA. Brains were post-fixed for 48 hr and then dehydrated via sucrose gradient over 48 hr before freezing in OCT. Fourteen-µm-thick tissue sections were collected directly onto Superfrost+ slides (Fisherbrand, Cat. No. 22-037-246). The RNAscope assay was then carried out using the Multiplex Fluorescent Reagent Kit v.2 (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Cat. No. 323100) per the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, tissue sections underwent dehydration in an ethanol gradient, peroxide blocking, and antigen retrieval steps. Antigen retrieval was performed using a steamer at 100°C and the epitope retrieval solution provided by the manufacturer. The mRNA in the tissue was hybridized to RNAscope probes (Advanced Cell Diagnostics) against: <italic>C3</italic> (Cat. No. 417841-C3), <italic>Fcgr3</italic> (Cat. No. 587241), <italic>B2m</italic> (Cat. No. 415191-C2), <italic>Cd74</italic> (Cat. No. 437501-C3), and <italic>Gfap</italic> (Cat. No. 313211) for 2 hr at 40°C and stored overnight in 5× saline sodium citrate. Next, amplification steps were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Fluorescent labeling was performed with TSA Vivid Fluorophore 520, TSA Vivid Fluorophore 570, and TSA Vivid Fluorophore 650 (all at 1:2000 dilution). Slides were washed and mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant (Thermo Fisher, Cat. No. P36830). Slides were imaged via confocal microscopy (Ziess LSM900).</p><p>Positive cells were manually labeled in ImageJ (NIH). The x-y coordinate of each cell was used to determine the shortest distance to areas of LMI in R. Distances were batched at intervals of 50 μM. Non-linear regression of the batched data was computed using the stats::nls function and the formula <italic>percentage ~a * distance ^ b</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>RNAseq statistics and data visualization</title><p>Plots were generated and statistics calculated using R (v.4.2.2) and Rstudio (v.2022.07.2). Bar plots, box plots, MA plots, Venn diagram, and dot plots were produced with ggplot2 (v.3.4.0); heatmaps were produced with pHeatmap (v.1.0.12) and enrichplot (v.1.18.4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guangchuang, 2023</xref>); spatial feature plots and dimensionality reduction plots were produced with Seurat; tree plots were produced with enrichplot, and trajectory heatmaps were produced with SPATA2.</p><p>All reported p-values adjusted for multiple comparisons were corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>) unless otherwise specified. The number of samples in the EAE and naïve groups was chosen based on expected levels of variability in prior experiments.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Validation, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All animal studies followed national and institutional guidelines for humane animal treatment in compliance with the Johns Hopkins ACUC (protocol #

MS is characterized by the presence of inﬂammatory immune cells in several brain regions as well as the brain barriers (meninges). This study aims to understand the local immune hallmarks in regions of the brain parenchyma that are adjacent to the leptomeninges in a mouse model of MS.

However, the fact that the control mice were not injected with CFA and pertussis toxin is somewhat concerning, because it will be hard to interpret the cause of the transcriptomic readouts described in this study. Some of the described eAects might be due to CFA or pertussis (which was used in the EAE but not the &quot;naive&quot; group), and not necessarily to the relapsing-remitting EAE immune features recapitulated in this mouse model. Moreover, this caveat associated with the &quot;naive&quot; control group is not being clearly stated throughout the manuscript and might go unnoticed to readers.</p><p>The authors should clearly state, in the methods section (in the section &quot;Induction of SJL EAE&quot;), that the naive control group was not injected with CFA or pertussis toxin.</p><p>Additionally, this potential confounder, of not using a control group injected with the same CFA and pertussis toxin regimen of the EAE group, should be mentioned in paragraph two of the discussion alongside the other limitations of the study already highlighted by the authors (or in another section of the discussion).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this point. Our choice of healthy/naïve, rather than CFA only, controls was intentional, given our desire to sensitively measure genes changing during neuroinflammation. Ultimately, however, we believe the choice of control group had little effect on our conclusions. We would like to note that SJL-EAE does not require pertussis toxin, so the only difference between naïve and CFA only groups is a single injection of CFA 11 weeks prior to experiment endpoint. We have performed additional IHC imaging of naïve and CFA only groups, finding no difference in glial reactivity by MFI measurement of GFAP, IBA1, or CD68 (updated Supplementary Figure 1C–E).</p><p>We have also added sections to the Results and Discussion section to clearly address this point. In the Results: “Since naïve animals were used as controls, we confirmed that CFA alone does not produce lasting glial reactivity or LMI formation. Groups of animals were given CFA only or left naïve. Neither group developed neurologic signs, and after 11 weeks the brains were processed for IHC analysis. There was no evidence of LMI development, and no difference in glial reactivity as measured by GFAP, IBA1, or CD68 intensity (Supplemental Figure 1C–E).” In the Discussion: “Another important consideration in these experiments is our choice of naïve, rather than CFA only, controls. While often used as the control in EAE studies focused on mechanisms of autoimmunity, CFA only can independently induce systemic inflammation. Since this study seeks to describe transcriptomic changes in neuroinflammation more broadly, we chose to use a healthy comparison group to maximize our ability to find genes enriched in neuroinflammation. Ultimately, however, the choice of naïve or CFA only controls is unlikely to have affected our conclusions. SJL-EAE, unlike the more common C57Bl6-EAE, does not require pertussis toxin during the induction. The only difference between naïve and CFA only controls is the subcutaneous CFA delivered at time of immunization (11 weeks prior to experiment endpoint). Indeed, when we compared CFA only and healthy animals at 11 weeks there was no difference in glial reactivity by GFAP, IBA1, or CD68 MFI. There was also no evidence of neurologic symptoms or LMI development in CFA only controls.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Accumulating data suggests that the presence of immune cell inﬁltrates in the meninges of the multiple sclerosis brain contributes to the tissue damage in the underlying cortical grey matter by the release of inﬂammatory and cytotoxic factors that diAuse into the brain parenchyma.

Immunization of rodents with complete freunds adjuvant and pertussis alone gives rise to widespread microglial activation, some immune cell inﬁltration and also structural changes to axons, particularly at nodes of Ranvier (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1097/NEN.0b013e3181f3a5b1">https://doi.org/10.1097/NEN.0b013e3181f3a5b1</ext-link>). This will inevitably make it diAicult to interpret the transcriptomics results, depending on whether these changes are reversible or not and the time frame of the reversal. In the C57Bl6 EAE models adjuvant induced microglial activation becomes chronic, whereas the axonal changes do reverse by 10 weeks. Whether this is the same in SJL EAE model is not clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up this concern regarding control group, which we discussed above in point 1.1. To speciﬁcally address reviewer 2’s point regarding microglial activation, we performed IHC analysis comparing naïve and CFA only groups of SJL animals. We found no substantial diAerence in astrocyte or microglial activation in these animals after 11 weeks, as measured by GFAP, IBA1, and CD68. This new data appears in updated Supplementary Figure 1C–D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p>Both reviewers agree that the revised version has improved and some of their major concerns were adequately addressed. However, both reviewers also agree that critical experimental controls are missing, including the FCA and pertussis toxin injected mice which likely show some degree of inﬂammation in their brain and are needed to compare your experimental MS group and interpret the transcriptomics data.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate both reviewers’ important comments on the control group used in this study. In this revised manuscript we have described our rationale for choosing naïve controls, rather than CFA only, and believe they are the most appropriate comparison group. Additionally, we believe that both CFA only and naïve will have similar degrees of baseline neuroinflammation at the 11- week time point. We apologize for not clarifying before, but pertussis toxin is not used in the SJL-EAE, and therefore the “CFA only” control is much milder in SJL-EAE compared to C57Bl6-EAE. Given that many signs of inflammation resolve by 10 weeks in CFA only with pertussis controls (https://academic.oup.com/jnen/article/69/10/1017/2917071; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10902151/), CFA only without pertussis controls are unlikely to have any substantial remaining neuroinflammation at 11 weeks. To test this, we performed an additional experiment directly comparing naïve and CFA only without pertussis.</p><p>These groups showed similar degrees of glial reactivity.</p><p>Given the costs of repeating a spatial transcriptomic experiment and inevitable batch effects should we add a group at this point, we have chosen to not as a CFA only control condition to our transcriptomics analysis. However, we believe our added text clarifying the rationale behind control choice and added immunofluorescence data gives readers the appropriate context to accurately interpret our results.</p></body></sub-article></article>
