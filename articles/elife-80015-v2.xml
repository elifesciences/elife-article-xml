However, sudden peripheral deafferentation in adulthood can trigger an excessive, non-homeostatic cortical compensatory response that may underlie perceptual disorders including sensory hypersensitivity, phantom limb pain, and tinnitus. Here, we show that mice with noise-induced damage of the high-frequency cochlear base were behaviorally hypersensitive to spared mid-frequency tones and to direct optogenetic stimulation of auditory thalamocortical neurons. Chronic two-photon calcium imaging from ACtx pyramidal neurons (PyrNs) revealed an initial stage of spatially diffuse hyperactivity, hyper-correlation, and auditory hyperresponsivity that consolidated around deafferented map regions three or more days after acoustic trauma. Deafferented PyrN ensembles also displayed hypersensitive decoding of spared mid-frequency tones that mirrored behavioral hypersensitivity, suggesting that non-homeostatic regulation of cortical sound intensity coding following sensorineural loss may be an underlying source of auditory hypersensitivity. Excess cortical response gain after acoustic trauma was expressed heterogeneously among individual PyrNs, yet 40% of this variability could be accounted for by each cell’s baseline response properties prior to acoustic trauma. PyrNs with initially high spontaneous activity and gradual monotonic intensity growth functions were more likely to exhibit non-homeostatic excess gain after acoustic trauma. This suggests that while cortical gain changes are triggered by reduced bottom-up afferent input, their subsequent stabilization is also shaped by their local circuit milieu, where indicators of reduced inhibition can presage pathological hyperactivity following sensorineural hearing loss.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>compensatory plasticity</kwd><kwd>excess central gain</kwd><kwd>hearing loss</kwd><kwd>hyperacusis</kwd><kwd>two-photon calcium imaging</kwd><kwd>homeostatic plasticity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC018974-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McGill</surname><given-names>Matthew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC014871</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hight</surname><given-names>Ariel E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007429</institution-id><institution>Nancy Lurie Marks Family Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Takesian</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names></name><name><surname>Polley</surname><given-names>Daniel B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC009836</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Polley</surname><given-names>Daniel B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC015857</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kujawa</surname><given-names>Sharon G</given-names></name><name><surname>Polley</surname><given-names>Daniel B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC018353</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Takesian</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Chronic two-photon calcium imaging, optogenetics, and operant behavioral approaches were leveraged to show that hyperactivity, hyperresponsivity, and hypersynchronization in auditory cortex neural ensembles can account for auditory hypersensitivity following acoustic trauma.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sensory disorder research typically focuses on the mechanisms underlying inherited or acquired forms of sensory loss. But some of the most common and debilitating sensory disorder phenotypes reflect just the opposite problem; not what cannot be perceived, but what cannot <italic>stop</italic> being perceived. Sensory overload typically presents as three inter-related features: (1) an irrepressible perception of phantom stimuli that have no physical environmental source, (2) a selective inability to perceptually suppress distracting sensory features, and (3) the perception that moderate stimuli are uncomfortably intense, distressing, or even painful. One or more of these phenotypes are commonly observed in heterogeneous neurological and psychiatric disorders including autism spectrum disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Klintwall et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Robertson and Baron-Cohen, 2017</xref>), post-traumatic stress disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ehlers and Clark, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Garfinkel and Liberzon, 2009</xref>), fibromyalgia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nielsen and Henriksson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Yunus, 2007</xref>), schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">González-Rodríguez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Luck and Gold, 2008</xref>), traumatic brain injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nampiaparampil, 2008</xref>), sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Auerbach et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hébert et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Pienkowski et al., 2014a</xref>), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ghanizadeh, 2011</xref>), migraine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Goadsby et al., 2017</xref>), and also as a consequence of normal aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Herrmann and Butler, 2021a</xref>).</p><p>Although overload phenotypes are reported across many sensory modalities, they are most common and debilitating in hearing, where an estimated 14% of adult population continuously perceives a phantom ringing or buzzing sound (i.e., tinnitus) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Shargorodsky et al., 2010</xref>), 9% of adults report hypersensitivity, distress, or even pain in response to ordinary environmental sounds (i.e., hyperacusis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Pienkowski et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Pienkowski et al., 2014b</xref>), and 9% of adults seek health care for poor hearing in complex listening environments but do not have hearing loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Parthasarathy et al., 2020a</xref>). While each facet of auditory overload can occur without evidence of peripheral dysfunction, they are common in persons with SNHL arising from age- or noise-induced degeneration of cochlear hair cells and cochlear afferent nerve terminals (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Auerbach and Gritton, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Herrmann and Butler, 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Noreña, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Zeng, 2013</xref>).</p><p>In developing sensory systems, deprivation of peripheral input is registered by central sensory neurons via decreased cytosolic calcium levels, which triggers a cascade of genetic, epigenetic, post-transcriptional, and post-translational processes that collectively adjust the electrical excitability of neurons to restore activity back to the baseline set point range (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Harris and Rubel, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Turrigiano, 2012</xref>). Compensatory changes in the central auditory pathway can be grouped into three categories: (1) synaptic sensitization via upregulation of receptors for excitatory neurotransmitters (e.g., AMPA receptor scaling) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balaram et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kotak et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Sturm et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Teichert et al., 2017</xref>); (2) synaptic disinhibition via removal of inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balaram et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Richardson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Sanes and Kotak, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Sarro et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Sturm et al., 2017</xref>); (3) increased intrinsic excitability via changes in the amount and subunit composition of voltage-gated ion channels that set the resting membrane potential, membrane resistance, and spike ‘burstiness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Pilati et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Wu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). Activity changes arising from these compensatory processes are often described as homeostatic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Herrmann and Butler, 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Schaette and Kempter, 2006</xref>), but in the context of adult cortical plasticity after hearing loss they typically culminate in a failure to maintain neural excitability at a stable set point. Whereas homeostatic changes – by definition – restore neural activity to a baseline activity rate following a perturbation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Turrigiano, 2012</xref>), neural gain adjustments following adult-onset hearing loss often over-shoot the mark, producing catastrophic downstream consequences at the level of network excitability and sound perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eggermont, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nahmani and Turrigiano, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Noreña, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Pinpointing the perceptual consequences of excess central auditory gain requires translating molecular and synaptic changes into measurements that can be made in intact, and even behaving animals. With conventional microelectrode recordings, the synaptic and intrinsic compensatory processes described above manifest as increased spontaneous activity rates, increased spike synchrony, steeper slopes of sound intensity growth functions, and poor adaptation to background noise sources (for recent review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Auerbach and Gritton, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Herrmann and Butler, 2021b</xref>). The connection between these extracellular signatures of excess neural gain and auditory perceptual disorders has remained obscure, in part due to a frequent reliance on involuntary behaviors with a relationship to sound perception (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boyen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brozoski and Bauer, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Campolo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hayes et al., 2014</xref>). Further, in vivo measurements have generally taken the form of acute recordings of local field potentials or unidentified excitatory and inhibitory unit types, often in anesthetized animals, and often without detailed measurements of the peripheral insult or the topographic correspondence between neural recording sites and deafferented map regions.</p><p>Here, we developed an approach to make more direct operant behavioral measurements of auditory hypersensitivity in mice with detailed characterizations of cochlear lesions. These behavioral measurements were combined with an optical approach to visualize spontaneous and sound-evoked calcium transients in awake mice from hundreds of individual excitatory neurons spanning the entire topographic map of the primary auditory cortex (A1). By performing these measurements before and after noise-induced SNHL, we were able to return to the same neurons over a 3- to 4-week period to identify baseline response features that could predict whether a given neuron would subsequently exhibit stable, homeostatic activity regulation or non-homeostatic excess gain following acoustic trauma.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Perceptual hypersensitivity following noise-induced high-frequency SNHL</title><p>In humans, a steeply sloping high-frequency hearing loss is a telltale signature of SNHL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen and Eddins, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hannula et al., 2011</xref>).

Expanding this analysis to additional example neurons over post-exposure time further suggests that PyrNs that would go on to express non-homeostatic auditory growth functions tended to feature higher spontaneous activity levels at baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>).</p><p>We used a multiple linear regression model to better capture how baseline properties can explain heterogenous changes in neural response gain.

Quantifying neural gain as fold change in the normalized 8 kHz growth function area recapitulated the same topographic and temporal dependence described above with intensity growth slope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To avoid overfitting the regression model, we selected a single time point – 3–5 days after noise exposure – that corresponded to the stable phase of reorganization after acoustic trauma, while maximizing our sample size of chronically tracked PyrNs. As predictor variables, we selected various spontaneous and sound-evoked response baseline features along with features related to the physical position of the PyrN within the A1 tonotopic map (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> legend).</p><p>We found that regressing the post-exposure change in neural gain on baseline PyrN’s response features could account for approximately 40% of the variance in central gain changes after acoustic trauma but just 13% in sham-exposed controls, where neural gain changes were small overall and far less systematic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). This is noteworthy because the model excluded features related to the degree of cochlear damage or reduced bottom-up sensory afferent drive, which are traditionally interpreted as the primary determinants of cortical central gain changes.

We observed that excess non-homeostatic gain regulation following acoustic trauma occurred with the highest probability in PyrNs exhibiting weak, monotonically increasing 8 kHz growth functions and higher spontaneous activity levels at baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>). Further, PyrNs located in the high-frequency (deafferented) region but with a lower frequency BF further increased the likelihood of expressing excess neural gain after trauma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>).

Seminal work demonstrated that animals became behaviorally hypersensitive to electrical microstimulation of central auditory neurons following cochlear damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gerken, 1979</xref>). Here, we expanded on this observation by demonstrating that noise-exposed mice are behaviorally hypersensitive to direct activation of thalamocortical projection neurons, which further underscores the association between excess cortical gain and auditory hypersensitivity. Hypersensitivity to direct stimulation of the thalamocortical pathway may be underpinned by changes in ACtx gene expression that result in elevated mRNA levels for glutamate receptor subunits and reduced mRNA transcripts and membrane-bound protein expression for GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balaram et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Sarro et al., 2008</xref>). These adjustments in ligand-gated receptors have been associated with commensurate elevations in spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents and reduced inhibitory postsynaptic currents in PyrNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kotak et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Yang et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, disinhibition and hypersensitization are conceptualized as synergistic compensatory responses that are triggered by a sudden decline in peripheral neural input, rendering cortical PyrNs less sensitive to feedforward inhibition from local inhibitory neurons – from parvalbumin-expressing (PV) fast-spiking interneurons in particular – and hyperresponsive to sound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Masri et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Resnik and Polley, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Resnik and Polley, 2017</xref>).</p><p>One challenge to this purely bottom-up model for compensatory plasticity underlying excess central gain is that it cannot readily account for why neighboring neurons exhibit heterogenous changes in sound-evoked hyperresponsivity after peripheral damage. Here, we found that approximately 40% of the variability in excess central gain among individual PyrNs could be accounted for by their response properties measured in the days just prior to acoustic trauma. In particular, PyrNs with low spontaneous activity rates and non-monotonic encoding of sound intensity – features associated with stronger intracortical inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Tan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Wu et al., 2006</xref>) – showed more stable gain control after trauma. Conversely, initially high spontaneous activity, hyper-correlation, and gradual monotonic intensity growth functions could be reflective of weaker intracortical inhibitory tone and were features that predicted non-homeostatic excess gain after acoustic trauma.</p><p>Several recent findings support the idea that variations in the strength of intracortical inhibition can function as a watershed for subsequent functional outcomes. In an earlier study, we applied ouabain to the cochlear round window to produce bilateral lesions of approximately 95% of cochlear afferent neurons. Near-complete elimination of cochlear afferent input was associated with functional deafness at the level of the ACtx in approximately half the animals but a remarkable recovery of sound responsiveness in the other half. Single unit recordings from the cohort of mice that recovered sound processing weeks after cochlear neural loss all featured a rapid decline in PV-mediated feedforward inhibition onto PyrNs during the first hours and days following the peripheral injury, while the mice that showed no functional recovery expressed a far slower decay in PV-mediated inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Resnik and Polley, 2017</xref>). Another piece of evidence comes from ACtx single unit recordings in marmosets outfitted with unilateral cochlear implants. Single units with narrowly tuned non-monotonic acoustic frequency-response areas – presumably reflecting stronger local inhibition – were suppressed by spatially diffuse electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve. Conversely, units with broad, V-shaped acoustic selectivity encoded cochlear implant stimulation with high fidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Johnson et al., 2016</xref>). Collectively, these findings underscore that the effects of peripheral afferent perturbations on central circuits are not exclusively determined by bottom-up drive but instead are also brokered by variations in the balance of excitation and inhibition within the local circuit or by gene expression differences between individual cells. At a global level, these mitigating influences are shaped by developmental stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dorrn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harris et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Sun et al., 2010</xref>) and circadian programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Basinou et al., 2017</xref>), but – at the level of individual neurons – may reflect latent differences in genetic subtypes of L2/3 PyrNs or purely stochastic variations in inhibitory tone between different microcircuit milieus.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Behavioral hypersensitivity: interpretations and technical limitations</title><p>We found evidence of behavioral hypersensitivity to sound following acoustic trauma as measured by a steeper relationship between increasing tone intensity and detection ability in a Go/NoGo task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Although previous indicators of behavioral hypersensitivity in animals have relied on more reflexive measures, such as the acoustic startle response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hickox and Liberman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Rybalko et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Rybalko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Sun et al., 2012</xref>), more recent work has utilized operant detection tasks including reaction times as an approximation of sound hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Auerbach et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we used an adaptive tracking approach to characterize the perceptual salience of liminal sound intensities spanning an approximate 30 dB range around threshold. To control for changes in global behavioral state due to acoustic trauma, our slope measurements are taken from functions using a sensitivity index (<italic>d</italic>′), which normalizes lick probability according to the false alarm rate determined from the delivery of catch (silent) trials. Thus, overall changes in stress, arousal, or other global behavioral states following acoustic trauma that impacted overall responsivity in catch and stimulus trials would be controlled for by the <italic>d</italic>′ measurement. However, as with reaction time, the <italic>d</italic>′ growth function is not a direct measure of loudness, per se, but instead is probably best likened to the change in stimulus salience for tones of varying intensity. Further, while the perceptual salience (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and neural decoding of spared, 8 kHz tones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) were both enhanced after high-frequency SNHL, these measurements were not performed in the same animals (and therefore not at the same time). Definitive proof that increased cortical gain is the neural substrate for auditory hypersensitivity after hearing loss would require concurrent monitoring and manipulations of cortical activity, which would be an important goal for future experiments.</p><p>While the findings presented here support an association between sensorineural peripheral injury, excess cortical gain, and behavioral hypersensitivity, they should not be interpreted as providing strong evidence for these factors in clinical conditions such as tinnitus or hyperacusis. Our data have nothing to say about tinnitus one way or the other, simply because we never studied a behavior that would indicate phantom sound perception. If anything, one might expect that mice experiencing a chronic phantom sound corresponding in frequency to the region of steeply sloping hearing loss would instead exhibit an increase in false alarms on high-frequency detection blocks after acoustic trauma, but this was not something we observed. Hyperacusis describes a spectrum of aversive auditory qualities including increased perceived loudness of moderate intensity sounds, a decrease in loudness tolerance, discomfort, pain, and even fear of sounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Pienkowski et al., 2014a</xref>). The affective components of hyperacusis are more challenging to index in animals, particularly using head-fixed behaviors, though progress is being made with active avoidance paradigms in freely moving animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Manohar et al., 2017</xref>). Our noise-induced high-frequency SNHL and Go-NoGo operant detection behavior were not designed to model hyperacusis. Hearing loss is not strongly associated with hyperacusis, where many individuals have normal hearing or have a pattern of mild hearing loss that does not correspond to the frequency dependence of their auditory sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Sheldrake et al., 2015</xref>). While the excess central gain and behavioral hypersensitivity we describe here may be related to the sensory component of hyperacusis, this connection is tentative because it was elicited by acoustic trauma and because the detection behavior provides a measure of stimulus salience, but not the perceptual quality of loudness, per se.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Cortical hyperreactivity: interpretations and technical limitations</title><p>Two-photon calcium imaging offers several key advantages for cortical plasticity studies including the ability to track single neurons over weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and genetic access to multiple cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Resnik and Polley, 2021</xref>). On the other hand, it can provide less insight into the mechanisms underlying destabilized excitatory-inhibitory balance than electrophysiological approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Resnik and Polley, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Yang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). Further, calcium indicators provide only an approximation of neural activity and can be limited in their kinetics and reliability to report precise cellular events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grienberger and Konnerth, 2012</xref>), although correct deconvolution and post hoc analysis techniques can help to minimize issues introduced from calcium imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sabatini, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Homeostatic Plasticity describes a negative feedback process that stabilizes neural activity levels following input perturbations. Homeostatic Plasticity mechanisms modify excitatory and inhibitory synapses over a period of hours or days to offset input perturbations and gradually restore spiking activity back to baseline levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Turrigiano, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Turrigiano, 2008</xref>). Importantly, cytosolic calcium is itself an upstream barometer of activity that regulates the molecular signaling cascades underlying AMPA receptor scaling or GABA receptor removal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Harris and Rubel, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Turrigiano, 2012</xref>). This underscores a key advantage to using calcium imaging in experiments that monitor network activity following perturbations of peripheral input levels: that although GCaMP is a closely related but indirect measure of spiking, it arguably provides more direct insight into a key upstream signal driving Homeostatic Plasticity signaling cascades.</p><p>Although we did not measure Homeostatic Plasticity per se, via direct demonstrations of intrinsic or heterosynaptic electrophysiological changes, our measurements of spontaneous and sound-evoked calcium transients clearly demonstrate a failure of homeostatic regulation following acoustic trauma. Spontaneous and sound-evoked calcium levels both remained elevated above pre-exposure baseline levels or levels observed in sham-exposed control mice. Hyperactive and hyper-correlated activity in regions of the cortical topographic map corresponding to peripheral sensorineural damage is widely understood to be the underlying neural basis of phantom sound perception in tinnitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Auerbach et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Herrmann and Butler, 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Noreña, 2011</xref>). Here, we show that these changes are also a likely underlying neural substrate for auditory hypersensitivity, a core component of hyperacusis that often accompanies tinnitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cederroth et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Schecklmann et al., 2014</xref>).

Animal Care and Use Committee and followed the guidelines established by the National Institutes of Health for the care and use of laboratory animals. Imaging and tone Go/NoGo behavior were performed on Thy1-GCaMP6s × CBA mice. Combined acoustic and optogenetic Go/NoGo behavioral studies were performed in C57BL/6J mice. Mice of both sexes were used for this study. Noise exposure occurred at 9 weeks postnatal and was timed to occur in the morning, when the temporary component of the threshold shift is less extreme and variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Meltser et al., 2014</xref>). Mice were maintained on a 12 hr light/12 hr dark cycle. Mice were provided with ad libitum access to food and water unless they were on-study for behavioral testing, in which case they had restricted access to water in the home cage.</p><p>Data were collected from 44 mice. A total of 22 mice contributed data to behavioral tasks: 13 (<italic>N</italic> = 7/6, trauma/sham) to the tone Go/NoGo behavior and 9 (<italic>N</italic> = 6/3, trauma/sham) to the combined acoustic and optogenetic Go/NoGo behavior.

Twelve mice were only used for regular ABR testing after acoustic trauma to determine the progression of threshold shift. Cochlear histology was performed on 11 of the mice used for Go/NoGo behavioral testing (<italic>N</italic> = 7/4, trauma/sham).

A homeothermic blanket system was used to maintain body temperature at 36.6 (FHC). Lidocaine hydrochloride was administered subcutaneously to numb the scalp. The dorsal surface of the scalp was retracted and the periosteum was removed. The skull surface was prepped with etchant and 70% ethanol before affixing a titanium headplate to the dorsal surface with dental cement. At the conclusion of the headplate attachment and any additional procedures listed below, Buprenex (0.05 mg/kg) and meloxicam (0.1 mg/kg) were administered, and the animal was transferred to a warmed recovery chamber.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>High-frequency noise exposure</title><p>To induce acoustic trauma, octave-band noise at 16–32 kHz was presented at 103 dB SPL for 2 hr. Exposure stimulus was delivered via a tweeter fixated inside a custom-made exposure chamber (51 × 51 × 51 cm). The interior walls of the acoustic enclosure joined at irregular, non-right angles to minimize standing waves. Additionally, to further diffuse the high-frequency sound field, irregular surface depths were achieved on three of the interior walls by attaching stackable ABS plastic blocks (LEGO). Prior to exposure, mice were placed, unrestrained, in an independent wire-mesh chamber (15 × 15 × 10 cm). This chamber was placed at the center of a continuously rotating plate, ensuring mice were exposed to a relatively uniform sound field. Sham-exposed mice underwent the same procedure except that the exposure noise was presented at an innocuous level (40 dB SPL). All sham and noise exposures were performed at the same time of day.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>Go/NoGo tone detection task</title><p>Three days after headplate surgery, animals were weighed and placed on a water restriction schedule (1 ml/day). During behavioral training, animals were weighed daily to ensure they remained between 80% and 85% of their initial weight and regularly examined for signs of excess dehydration. Mice were given supplemental water if they received less than 1 ml during a training session or appeared excessively dehydrated. During testing, mice were head-fixed in a dimly lit, single-walled sound attenuating booth (ETS-Lindgren), with their bodies resting in an electrically conductive cradle. Tongue contact on the lickspout closed an electrical circuit that was digitized (at 40 Hz) and encoded to calculate lick timing. Digital and analog signals controlling sound delivery and water reward were controlled by a PXI system with custom software programmed in LabVIEW. Free-field stimuli were delivered via an inverted dome tweeter positioned 10 cm from the left ear and calibrated with a wide-band ultrasonic acoustic sensor (Knowles Acoustics).</p><p>Most mice required 2 weeks of behavioral shaping before they could perform the complete tone detection task with psychophysical staircasing. After mice were habituated to head-fixation, they were conditioned to lick the spout within 2 s following the onset of an 8 or 32 kHz 70 dB SPL tone (0.25 s duration, with 5 ms raised cosine onset–offset ramps) to receive a small quantity of water (4 μl). Trials had a variable intertrial interval (4–10 s) randomly selected from a truncated exponential distribution. Once reaction times were consistently &lt;1 s, mice were trained to detect 8 and 32 kHz tones in a 2-down, 1-up adaptive staircasing paradigm, where two correct detections were required to decrease the range of sound intensities by 5 dB SPL and one miss was required to increase the range of sound intensities by 5 dB SPL. At each iteration of the adaptive staircasing procedure, three trials were presented: a catch (silent) trial and tones at ±5 dB SPL relative to the last intensity tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). A single frequency was presented until 1 reversal was reached, and then the other tone was presented; a run was completed once six reversals had been reached for both frequencies. The first frequency presented on each daily session was randomized.</p><p>Hits were defined as post-target licks that occurred &gt;0.1 and &lt;1.5 s following the onset of the target tone. False alarms (Go responses on a catch trial) triggered a 5-s time out. Entire runs were excluded from analysis if the false alarm rate was greater than 30%. This exclusion criterion resulted in the elimination of &lt;5% of test runs across all conditions (before, after, noise- or sham-exposure), underscoring that mice were under stimulus control even if their hearing thresholds were elevated. Psychometric functions were fit using binary logistic regression. Threshold was defined as the average intensity at reversals across an entire session.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-4"><title>Go/NoGo optogenetic detection task</title><p>Headplate attachment, anesthesia and analgesia followed the procedure described above. Three burr holes were made in the skull over auditory cortex (1.75–2.25 mm rostral to the lambdoid suture). We first expressed Cre-recombinase in neurons that project to the ACtx by injecting 150 nl of AAVrg-pgk-Cre 0.5 mm below the pial surface at three locations within the ACtx with a precision injection system (Nanoject III) coupled to a stereotaxic positioner (Kopf). A fourth injection was then performed to selectively express channelrhodopsin in auditory thalamocortical projection neurons by injecting 100 nl of AAV5-Ef1a-DIO hChR2(E123T/T159C)-EYFP in the MGBv (−2.95 mm caudal to bregma, 2.16 mm lateral to midline, 3.05 mm below the pial surface). An optic fiber (flat tip, 0.2 mm diameter, Thorlabs) was inserted at the MGB injection coordinates to a depth of 2.9 mm below the pial surface. The fiber assembly was cemented in place and painted with black nail polish to prevent light leakage. Animals recovered for at least 3 days before water restriction and behavioral testing began.</p><p>After mice were habituated to head-fixation, they were conditioned to lick the spout within 2 s following the onset of 70 dB SPL high-frequency bandpass noise (centered at 32 kHz, width 1 octave). Once consistent, mice were trained to detect optogenetic activation of thalamocortical neurons. The laser was pulsed at 10 Hz, 10 ms pulse width for 500 ms, and the bandpass noise was pulsed at 10 Hz, 20 ms pulse width (5 ms raised cosine onset–offset ramps) for 500 ms. For testing, randomized interleaved blocks of either noise or laser stimulation were presented at a fixed range of levels. The range of sound levels and laser powers was individually tailored prior to noise/sham exposure to ensure equivalent sampling of sound and laser perceptual growth functions, and then these fixed values were used for all post-exposure testing sessions. Tailoring was accomplished by first identifying the lowest laser power and 32 kHz sound level that produced at least 95% hit rates (operationally defined as ‘max’). These sound levels and laser powers were then presented alongside four attenuated levels relative to the maximum as well as no-stimulus catch trials in each mouse on every session. Psychometric functions were fit using binary logistic regression, and threshold was defined as the point where detection crossed 71% correct, which is the closest approximation to the threshold point identified with the 2-up, 1-down staircasing procedure described above. Runs were rejected for further analysis if the false alarm rate of the mouse was above 30%, and again this resulted in the exclusion of &lt;5% of sessions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-5"><title>Widefield and two-photon calcium imaging</title><p>Three round glass coverslips (two 3 mm and one 4 mm diameter, #1 thickness, Warner Instruments) were etched with piranha solution and bonded into a vertical stack using transparent, UV-cured adhesive (Norland Products, Warner Instruments). Headplate attachment, anesthesia and analgesia follow the procedure listed above. A circular craniotomy (3 mm diameter) was made over the right ACtx using a scalpel and the coverslip stack was cemented into the craniotomy. Animals recovered for at least 5 days before beginning imaging recordings. All imaging was performed in awake, passively listening animals.</p><p>A series of pilot widefield imaging experiments were performed to visualize changes in all fields of the ACtx over a longer, 30- to 60-day post-exposure time period (<italic>N</italic> = 8 noise-exposed and 7 sham-exposed mice). The data collection procedure for these pilot experiments followed the methods described in detail in our previous publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Romero et al., 2019</xref>). Briefly, widefield epifluorescence images were acquired with a tandem-lens microscope (THT-microscope, SciMedia) configured with low-magnification, high-numerical aperture lenses (PLAN APO, Leica, ×2 and ×1 for the objective and condensing lenses, respectively). Blue illumination was provided by a light-emitting diode (465 nm, LEX2-LZ4, SciMedia). Green fluorescence passed through a filter cube and was captured at 20 Hz with a sCMOS camera (Zyla 4.2, Andor Technology).</p><p>Cellular imaging was performed with a two-photon imaging system in a light-tight sound-attenuating enclosure mounted on a floating table (Bergamo II Galvo-Resonant 8 kHz scanning microscope, Thorlabs). An initial lower resolution epifluorescence widefield imaging session was performed with a CCD camera to visualize the tonotopic gradients of the ACtx and identify the position of A1 (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Two-photon excitation was provided by a Mai-Tai eHP DS Ti:Sapphire-pulsed laser tuned to 940 nm (Spectra-Physics). Imaging was performed with a ×16/0.8 NA water-immersion objective (Nikon) from a 512 × 512 pixel field of view at 30 Hz with a Bergamo II Galvo-Resonant 8 kHz scanning microscope (Thorlabs). Scanning software (Thorlabs) was synchronized to the stimulus generation hardware (National Instruments) with digital pulse trains. The microscope was rotated by 50–60 degrees off the vertical axis to obtain images from the lateral aspect of the mouse cortex while the animal was maintained in an upright head position. Animals were monitored throughout the experiment to confirm all imaging was performed in the awake condition using modified cameras (PlayStation Eye, Sony) coupled to infrared light sources. Imaging was performed in layers L2/3, 175–225 mm below the pial surface. Fluorescence images were captured at ×1 digital zoom, providing an imaging field of 0.84 × 0.84 mm.</p><p>Raw calcium movies were processed using Suite2P, a publicly available two-photon calcium imaging analysis pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pachitariu et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, movies are registered to account for brain motion. Regions of interest are established by clustering neighboring pixels with similar time courses. Manual curation is then performed to eliminate low quality or non-somatic regions of interest. Spike deconvolution was also performed in Suite2P, using the default method based on the OASIS algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Friedrich et al., 2017</xref>). For chronic tracking of individual cells across imaging sessions, cross-day image registration was performed using a method outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Sheintuch et al., 2017</xref>. Briefly, fields-of-view are aligned to a reference imaging session using a non-rigid transformation, and a probabilistic modeling approach is used to estimate whether neighboring cells from separate sessions are the same or different cells. To estimate the false positive rate with this approach, we also performed a control in which cross-day registration was performed with daily imaging fields randomly selected from different mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). For all analysis of tracked neurons, only cells with a confidence score of at least 0.8 (max of 1) and that were tracked for at least 8 of the 15 imaging sessions were used for the analysis. In analyses identifying cells that were either ‘lost’ or ‘appeared’ after noise/sham exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), ‘appeared’ cells were defined as not being found in any baseline imaging sessions and also found in at least eight imaging sessions after noise exposure. Cells ‘lost’ at day X relative to noise exposure were consecutively tracked in all baseline sessions and days 0 through X, and not found in any session after day X. The same confidence threshold of 0.8 was also applied to analyses of ‘lost’ and ‘appeared’ cells.</p><p>During widefield imaging sessions, 20–70 dB SPL tones (in 10 dB steps) were presented from 4 to 64 kHz in 0.5 octave steps. On the first and last two-photon imaging sessions and on the day of noise exposure, 20–80 dB SPL tones (15 dB steps) were presented from 4 to 45.3 kHz (0.5 octave steps). For all other two-photon imaging sessions, 20–80 dB SPL tones (in 10 dB steps) were presented at 5.7, 8, 11.3, and 32 kHz. Each day, all stimuli were repeated 20 times. One block consisted of all frequency–intensity combinations, and stimuli were randomized within blocks. Tones were 50 ms with 5 ms raised cosine onset–offset ramps with 3 s inter-trial intervals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-6"><title>Cochlear function tests</title><p>Animals were anesthetized with ketamine (120 mg/kg) and xylazine (12 mg/kg), were placed on a homeothermic heating blanket during testing, with half the initial ketamine dose given as a booster when required. Acoustic stimuli were presented via in-ear acoustic assemblies consisting of two miniature dynamic earphones (CUI CDMG15008-03A) and an electret condenser microphone (Knowles FG-23339-PO7) coupled to a probe tube. To highlight the peripheral neural contribution to the ABR, subdermal electrodes were positioned in a horizontal (pinna-to-pinna) montage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Galbraith et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Melcher et al., 1996</xref>). Stimuli were calibrated in the ear canal in each mouse before recording. ABR stimuli were 5 ms tone pips at 8, 12, 16, or 32 kHz with a 0.5 ms rise-fall time delivered at 30 Hz. Intensity was incremented in 5 dB steps, from 20 to 100 dB SPL. ABR threshold was defined as the lowest stimulus level at which a repeatable waveform could be identified. DPOAEs were measured in the ear canal using primary tones with a frequency ratio of 1.2, with the level of the f2 primary set to be 10 dB less than f1 level, incremented together in 5 dB steps. The 2f1–f2 DPOAE amplitude and surrounding noise floor were extracted. DPOAE threshold was defined as the lowest of at least two continuous f2 levels, for which the DPOAE amplitude was at least two standard deviations greater than the noise floor. DPOAE and ABR testing was performed 1 week before noise- or sham-exposure, and again immediately following the conclusion of behavioral testing or imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-7"><title>Cochlear histology</title><p>To visualize cochlear afferent synapses and IHCs and OHCs, cochleae were dissected and perfused through the round window and oval window with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), then post-fixed in the same solution for 1 hr. Cochleae were then decalcified in 0.12 M ethylenediaminetetracetic acid (EDTA) for 2 days and dissected into half-turns for whole-mount processing. Immunostaining began with a blocking buffer (PBS with 5% normal goat or donkey serum and 0.2–1% Triton X-100) for 1 hr at room temperature. Whole mounts were then immunostained by incubating with a combination of the following primary antibodies: (1) rabbit anti-CtBP2 at 1:100, (2) rabbit anti-myosin VIIa at 1:200, and (3) mouse anti-GluR2 at 1:2000 and secondary antibodies coupled to the red, blue, and green channels. Immunostained cochlear pieces were measured, and a cochlear frequency map was computed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Müller et al., 2005</xref>) to associate structures to relevant frequency regions using a plug-in to ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Parthasarathy and Kujawa, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Images were collected at 2400 × 900 raster using a using a high-resolution, oil immersion objective (×63, numerical aperture 1.3), and ×1.25 zoom and assessed for signs of damage. Confocal z-stacks at identical frequencies were collected using a Leica TCS SP5 microscope to visualize hair cells and synaptic structures. Two adjacent stacks were obtained (78 µm cochlear length per stack) at each target frequency spanning the cuticular plate to the synaptic pole of ~10 hair cells (in 0.25 µm z-steps). Images were collected in a 1024 × 512 raster using a high-resolution, oil immersion objective (×63, numerical aperture 1.3), and digital zoom (×3.17). Images were loaded into an image-processing software platform (Amira; VISAGE Imaging), where IHCs were quantified based on their Myosin VIIa-stained cell bodies and CtBP2-stained nuclei. Presynaptic ribbons and postsynaptic glutamate receptor patches were counted using 3D representations of each confocal z-stack. Juxtaposed ribbons and receptor puncta constitute a synapse, and these synaptic associations were determined by calculating and displaying the <italic>x</italic>–<italic>y</italic> projection of the voxel space within 1 µm of each ribbon’s center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Liberman et al., 2011</xref>). OHCs were counted based on the myosin VIIa staining of their cell bodies. The mean number of cells per row of OHCs was used as a measure of OHC counts.</p><p>For visualizing OHC stereocilia damage, following similar whole-mount dissection and blocking procedures, the other ear was immunostained with a combination of the following primary antibodies (1) rabbit anti-CtBP2 at 1:100, (2) mouse anti-GluR2 at 1:2000, and (3) rabbit anti-Espin at 1:100, followed by secondary antibodies in the red, green, and gray channels. Confocal z-stacks of the stereocilia were collected at 5.6, 11.3, 22, 32, 45, and 64 kHz cochlear frequencies with a Leica TCS SP8 microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-8"><title>Brain histology</title><p>For mice performing the Go/NoGo optogenetic detection task, mice were deeply anesthetized and prepared for transcardial perfusion with a 4% formalin solution in 0.1 M phosphate buffer 21 days after noise exposure. The brains were extracted and post-fixed at room temperature for an additional 12 hr before transfer to 30% sucrose solution. Coronal sections (50 µm) were mounted onto glass slides using Vectashield with DAPI, and then coverslipped. Regions of interest were then imaged at ×10 using a Leica DM5500B fluorescent microscope.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Clinical database analysis</title><p>First-visit patient records from the Massachusetts Eye and Ear audiology database over a 24-year period from 1993 to 2016 were analyzed. Our analysis selected for adult patients aged 18 and 80, whose primary language was English, and who underwent pure tone audiogram tests in the left and right ears with octave spaced frequencies between 250 Hz and 8 kHz using headphones or inserts. To eliminate patients with conductive components in their hearing loss, the MEE dataset was further curated to remove all audiograms where the air-bone gap was ≥20  dB at any one frequency or ≥15  dB at two consecutive frequencies. Audiograms with thresholds ≥85  dB HL at frequencies ≤2000 Hz were also removed to maintain a conservative inclusion criterion, as the difference in limits of the air and bone conducting transducers limit our ability to determine the presence of conductive components in that threshold range. After this exclusionary step, we were left with 132,504 audiograms in the dataset for analysis. Of these audiograms, HFHL was defined as audiograms with thresholds lower than 20 dB HL for frequencies &lt;1 kHz, between 10 and 80 dB HL for 2 kHz, between 20 and 120 dB HL for 4 kHz, and between 40 and 120 dB HL for 8 kHz, following the same criteria used to identify a steeply sloping high-frequency hearing loss in prior clinical database studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dubno et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Parthasarathy et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Vaden et al., 2017</xref>). HFHL audiometric phenotypes consisted of 23% of the audiograms assessed based on these criteria. These patients were 65% male and had a median age of 65 years. The study was approved by the human subjects Institutional Review Board at Mass General Brigham and Massachusetts Eye and Ear. Data analysis was performed on deidentified data, in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>Behavioral analysis</title><p>To estimate perceptual gain in the Go/NoGo tone detection task, hit rates were taken at intensities ranging from the lowest intensity with sufficient trials (&gt;5 trials) to the first intensity at which the hit rate was above 90% to account for saturation of the detection function. The perceptual gain was calculated as the average first derivative of the <italic>d</italic>′ function evaluated over the specified intensity range. The gain calculation was performed for each animal based on aggregated daily test sessions for a given post-exposure epoch (e.g., baseline, 0–2 days post-exposure).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>Two-photon image analysis</title><p>All analysis was performed on the deconvolved calcium activity traces. For analysis of tone-evoked responses, averaged deconvolved calcium traces were expressed as <italic>Z</italic>-score units relative to activity levels measured during the pre-stimulus period (833 ms). PyrNs were operationally defined as being responsive to a particular tone frequency/level combination with a <italic>Z</italic> &gt; 2. For the three imaging sessions that calculated the full frequency-response area, the minimum response threshold was defined for each PyrN as the lowest level at which there were responses to two adjacent frequencies (frequencies 0.5 octaves apart). Best frequency (BF) was defined as the frequency for which the overall response was maximal over the intensity range of threshold + 30 dB. Analysis of BF changes was limited to PyrNs with pure tone receptive fields (neural <italic>d</italic>′ &gt; 1, as defined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Romero et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To delineate the intact and deafferented regions of the imaging field, an SVM was calculated for each mouse using BF’s determined from the first day of imaging prior to noise exposure. The SVM deafferentation boundary categorized physical space (intact: BF &lt;16 kHz, deafferented: BF ≥16 kHz) and its physical location was then imposed on all successive imaging sessions after alignment of fields-of-view from all imaging sessions. To categorize the position of a neuron, the adjusted centroid locations were used based on the best registration from the previously mentioned method. The distance of a neuron to the SVM deafferentation boundary was calculated as the shortest Euclidean distance.</p><p>Gain was defined as the relationship between sound level (input) and activity rate (output). The gain was calculated as the average rate of change over a range of sound levels. The particular set of sound levels selected for gain analysis was determined according to whether the best level occurred at low, mid, or high sound levels as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>. For a neuron to be considered for an analysis of gain, it was required to have a significant response (<italic>Z</italic> &gt; 2) to at least three consecutive intensities.</p><p>Spontaneous activity was calculated from the 833 ms periods preceding tone onset. To quantify the correlated activity between cells, we cross-correlated the <italic>Z</italic>-scored activity in the pre-stimulus periods. To control for the effects of overall changes in activity rates over sessions or between cells, shuffled cross-correlograms were generated for each pair by shuffling trial labels. Only cross-correlograms for which at least three consecutive lags had values significantly greater than the shuffled cross-correlogram (bootstrapped p &lt; 0.05, Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons) were used for analysis. The degree of correlated activity between each pair was defined as the size of the positive area under the peak of the shuffle-subtracted cross-correlogram (xcorr area).</p><p>To determine how ensemble activity decoded tone presence, we used an SVM classifier with a linear kernel (following the approach of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Resnik and Polley, 2021</xref>). The SVM was run on the principal components of a data matrix consisting of the <italic>Z</italic>-scored responses to single tone presentations or silent periods. PCA was used to reduce the influence of any inequities in sample sizes across mice or conditions. We ran the SVM on the minimum number of principal components required to explain 90% of the variance. Leave-one-out cross-validation was then used to train the classifier and compute the decoder accuracy. We repeated this process independently for each frequency intensity at 8 and 32 kHz for each imaging session. The models were fit using the ‘fitcsvm’ function in MATLAB.</p><p>To model how pre-exposure properties can predict the change in a neuron’s responsiveness, the outcome variable was the post/pre-exposure ratio of the areas under the intensity-response growth function, where post was drawn from days 3 to 5 after exposure. All predictor variables were computed as average values from the pre-exposure period. The best linear model was fit using stepwise multiple linear regression and using the Akaike information criterion. For the purposes of comparison, the predictor variables from the trauma model were applied to the sham model. The stepwise regression was fit using ‘stepwiselm’ and subsequent model fits used ‘fitlm’ in MATLAB.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed in MATLAB 2017b (Mathworks).

is an important and methodologically compelling paper that provides novel views on the functional plasticity of cortical networks following noise trauma. The combination of cortical recordings, optogenetics, and behavior provides valuable mechanistic insights into the processes that may underlie auditory hypersensitivity after cochlear damage. The extensive and well-illustrated manuscript provides an excellent example of a study in which modern neurophysiology techniques advance comprehension of pathologies related to maladaptive changes in the brain.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80015.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Bathellier</surname><given-names>Brice</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02feahw73</institution-id><institution>CNRS</institution></institution-wrap><country>France</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Bathellier</surname><given-names>Brice</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02feahw73</institution-id><institution>CNRS</institution></institution-wrap><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Norena</surname><given-names>Arnaud</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02feahw73</institution-id><institution>CNRS</institution></institution-wrap><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Bajo Lorenzana</surname><given-names>Victoria M</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/052gg0110</institution-id><institution>University of Oxford</institution></institution-wrap><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.05.24.493204">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.24.493204v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Brice Bathellier as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Barbara Shinn-Cunningham as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Arnaud Norena (Reviewer #2); Victoria M Bajo Lorenzana (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please either address the concerns of reviewers 2 and 3 about the behavioral readout of hyperacusis or tone down the conclusions to preclude over-interpreting indirect measurements of perception. In particular, not all animals experiencing noise trauma will experience hyperacusis. One possible way to improve the description of the hyperacusis condition would be to show a correlation between behavioral results and physiological measurement at the single animal level.</p><p>2) The referees have requested a large number of clarifications.

Whereas homeostatic changes – by definition – restore neural activity to a baseline activity rate following a perturbation (Turrigiano, 2012), neural gain adjustments following adult-onset hearing loss often over-shoot the mark, producing catastrophic downstream consequences at the level of network excitability and sound perception (Eggermont, 2017; Noreña, 2011).&quot;</p><p>See my point in the Public Review. I am not sure we know whether the averaged central activity is really enhanced after hearing loss. What is enhanced is the spontaneous activity and the stimulus-evoked activity for supra-threshold signals, but overall the averaged activity should not be increased. The enhanced neural activity post-hearing loss just compensates for the reduction of stimulus-evoked activity due to hearing loss.</p><p>&quot;A closer inspection of the mouse psychometric detection functions for the spared low-frequency tone suggested something akin to the clinical phenomenon of loudness recruitment.&quot; I am sorry it is not clear to me.</p><p>&quot;Following acoustic trauma, the behavioral sensitivity index (d-prime, or d') for 8 kHz tones grew more steeply for sound intensities near thresholds compared both to pre-exposure baseline detection functions or sham exposure controls (Figure 2A-B).&quot;</p><p>The authors should be more explicit since I don't know where to look at them.

In Figure 5A left example, I see an absolute response of 10 (15-10) over 40 dB, 10/40=0.4? But the value that is indicated is 0.23.

Enhanced neural detection of 8 kHz tones was largely driven by PyrNs in deafferented map regions, whereas the loss of cortical sensitivity to high-frequency tones was observed in both topographic zones (Figure 5F).&quot;</p><p>I don't understand the point here, and more precisely the link between this result and the putative loudness hyperacusis. According to human data, loudness hyperacusis should be found at 8kHz and 32 kHz for supra-threshold acoustic simulation.</p><p>Also, it seems that neural activity is unchanged after noise trauma in the &quot;intact region&quot; when neural activity is assessed by calcium imaging, while the activity has been found to be largely enhanced in that region when neural activity is assessed with electrophysiology (MUA and LFP).

Is there any correlation between calcium responses (the max) and MUA response and LF amplitude?</p><p>Could the authors explain how they assess spontaneous activity from calcium imaging? What is the shape of the signal that is recorded? Is this signal similar to spontaneous LFP? Spiking activity? This is important when authors assess the synchrony between cells, and then understand what is synchronized. If the activity is globally increased we expect a &quot;mechanic&quot; increase in synchrony that is difficult to correct. With spiking activity, it is different (it is easier to correct, except for onset and offset responses) since the time duration of a spike is very short compared to the inter-spike interval.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>I suggest being much more cautious in the interpretation of homeostatic plasticity and behavioral data.</p><p>&quot;Furthermore, to control for any changes in licking behavior due to acoustic trauma, our slope measurements are taken from functions using a sensitivity index (d'), which normalizes lick probability according to the false alarm rate determined from the delivery of catch (silent) trials. Thus, a steeper relationship between increasing tone intensity and perceptual sensitivity strongly suggests a hypersensitivity to sound following acoustic trauma (Figure 2).&quot;</p><p>I am not convinced by this conclusion. At the threshold, enhanced arousal (due to stress after noise trauma) may increase d'. I am not saying stress is necessarily enhanced in exposed animals but it is just to mention that the link between psychometric function for thresholds and loudness is not as straightforward as the authors seem to believe it is.</p><p>The discussion should come back a bit more to the literature and emphasize in more detail what is consistent with the literature, what is not, what is new, etc.</p><p>I suggest publishing the behavioral data elsewhere, and to focus here on the neural responses before and after the noise trauma, emphasizing clearly what is new, etc.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Specific concerns:</p><p>Introduction</p><p>The communalities between tinnitus, hyperacusis and speech in noise impairment are unknown, and the association between those and hearing loss are known but not what happens exactly at neural level.

The underlying mechanisms and common use of the term “homeostatic plasticity” describes a negative feedback process to stabilize the firing rates of individual neurons at a set point. It is true that excess activity in the cortex may (or may not) be offset by equivalent depression of neural activity in the periphery and brainstem but this would be the product – not the driver – of homeostatic processes that work differently in different brain areas. Again, “should” is the operative word here because measurements of the averaged activity across millions of neurons distributed across dozen auditory brain regions in both hemispheres of the brain have never been made. Even among studies that have made simultaneous recordings from cortical and subcortical stations (e.g., Chambers..Polley et al., Neuron 2016) there was no demonstration that the averaged activity was maintained. But, as discussed in the response to the public reviews, the main point of disagreement with the reviewer is that we are describing activity regulation for individual cortical neurons – because the homeostatic mechanisms work at the level of individual cortical neurons – and really make no statement about the overall activity levels of the entire auditory pathway.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;A closer inspection of the mouse psychometric detection functions for the spared low-frequency tone suggested something akin to the clinical phenomenon of loudness recruitment.&quot; I am sorry it is not clear to me.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct; that wording was unclear.

To determine whether mice may be showing evidence of auditory hypersensitivity, we performed a closer inspection of the mouse psychometric detection functions for the spared 8 kHz tone. This analysis confirmed that, following acoustic trauma, the behavioral sensitivity index (d-prime, or d’) grew more steeply for sound intensities near threshold compared both to pre-exposure baseline detection functions and sham exposed controls (Figure 2A-B).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;Following acoustic trauma, the behavioral sensitivity index (d-prime, or d') for 8 kHz tones grew more steeply for sound intensities near thresholds compared both to pre-exposure baseline detection functions or sham exposure controls (Figure 2A-B).&quot;</p><p>The authors should be more explicit since I don't know where to look at them. I don't understand how the sensation level (dB SL) can be negative. Does negative dB SL mean below the threshold? What are the results for high frequencies?</p></disp-quote><p>The detection sensitivity (d’) is plotted as a function of sensation level for example mice in 2A, which illustrates the steeper growth in the acoustic trauma mouse. The increase in sensitivity with sound intensity is taken as the slope of the function. Panel 2B shows that the slopes became steeper after acoustic trauma but not after a sham exposure. We added a new panel to figure 2B to also show the slope increase for all individual mice.</p><p>The detection threshold was defined with a standard procedure as the average intensity at the reversal of the 2-down 1-up adaptive staircasing, which corresponds to an intensity that will be detected on approximately 71% of trials. So, yes, that means we are presenting sound intensities below the level that will be defined as the threshold/0 dB SL. As such, we can plot the d’ for intensities below 0 dB SL. The reviewer can see in Figure 2A that the d’ values from -10 to 0 dB SPL are above zero because mice occasionally detect tones at intensities below the average of the reversals. This is explained on Pg. 18 Lns 581-589.</p><p>“Once reaction times were consistently &lt; 1 s, mice were trained to detect 8 kHz and 32 kHz tones in a 2-down, 1-up adaptive staircasing paradigm, where two correct detections were required to decrease the range of sound intensities by 5 dB SPL and one miss was required to increase the range of sound intensities by 5 dB SPL. At each iteration of the adaptive staircasing procedure, three trials were presented: a catch (silent) trial and tones at +/- 5 dB SPL relative to the last intensity tested (Figure 1I). A single frequency was presented until 1 reversal was reached, and then the other tone was presented; a run was completed once 6 reversals had been reached for both frequencies. The first frequency presented on each daily session was randomized.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;That intensity-detection slopes were increased for the low-frequency tone at near-threshold sound levels argues against a peripheral origin for this change and instead suggests increased gain in the central auditory pathway.&quot; Why? Please provide complete argumentation for this.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the text on Pg. 6 Lns 148-154 to provide a more explicit rationale for this conclusion.</p><p>&quot;Persons with sensorineural hearing loss commonly report loudness recruitment, a disproportionately steep growth of loudness with increasing sound level, that has been accounted for by altered basilar membrane mechanics after OHC damage (Oxenham and Bacon, 2003). However, loudness recruitment is most pronounced for frequencies within the range of hearing loss and at intensities well above sensation level (Buus and Florentine, 2002; Moore, 2004). Here, we observed steeper growth of auditory sensitivity for a spared frequency and at intensities close to sensation level, neither of which would be expected of a purely peripheral origin.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;Importantly, testing in interleaved trials revealed behaviorally hypersensitivity to direct stimulation of auditory thalamocortical neurons after acoustic trauma (Figure 2E), demonstrating significantly increased d' across optogenetic stimulation intensities compared to sham controls (Figure 2F)&quot;.

In this revised Figure 2E, we can see that detection of thalamocortical stimulation remained unchanged for the sham-exposed mouse and was increased (indicated by an increase in the d’) for the noise-exposed mouse following acoustic trauma. In Figure 2F, we look at the mean change in the detection function evaluated across laser intensities, and we see that after noise exposure but not sham exposure there is an increase in d’, the sensitivity to thalamocortical stimulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;A marked increase in PyrNs tuned to lesion edge frequencies could contribute to the enhanced perceptual sensitivity to 8 kHz tones identified in behavioral experiments (Figure 2).&quot; Where does this hypothesis come from?

As addressed in the response to the public reviews, we have removed statements that our experiments model hyperacusis, per se. Further, we removed all claims that our behavioral evidence provides direct insight into the perception of loudness. Rather than “hyperacusis” and “loudness”, the revised manuscript interprets the findings in light of auditory hypersensitivity, which seems appropriate. To the reviewer’s question, we are making the point that if the 8 kHz tone is recruiting activity from a larger number of excitatory neurons, and the response magnitude from individual neurons have also increased, that these changes would plausibly related to behavioral hypersensitivity to the stimulus. In other words, the neural SNR for the stimulus would be higher, which could amount to greater perceptual salience. This seems like a reasonable and non-controversial possibility to raise.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Could you explain how the gain is calculated?

This was not a major point we tried to emphasize in the original manuscript but the Reviewer is right to point out that there were a few instances where we drew parallels between our findings and hyperacusis. Those comparisons have been removed and, as discussed above, we only draw parallels between our findings and the more general phenomena of auditory hypersensitivity.</p><p>We think that addresses the reviewer’s confusion. The point we are trying to make is to show that after high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss, low-frequency tones recruit stronger activity in the deafferented high-frequency zone of the tonotopic map. Recruiting more neurons into processing low-frequency tones would theoretically enhance neural population sensitivity to that stimulus, in line with the behavioral changes that we report. The point of Figure 5 is that a decoding analysis of cortical ensemble activity on single trials of tone presentation indeed shows enhanced cortical detection of 8kHz tone presentations, similar to what we observed behaviorally. Across the same range of sound intensities, neural classification of high-frequency tones is reduced on account of the threshold shift. The main point is that a neural classifier trained only on a small number of cortical neurons shows a clear parallel to the behavioral finding of auditory hypersensitivity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, it seems that neural activity is unchanged after noise trauma in the &quot;intact region&quot; when neural activity is assessed by calcium imaging, while the activity has been found to be largely enhanced in that region when neural activity is assessed with electrophysiology (MUA and LFP).

We reported significant changes in the low-frequency “intact” map region as well. Figure 5C shows increased neural gain shortly after noise exposure in this region.

In an earlier paper, we compared MUA, single unit, and LFP activity to a simulation of 2-photon calcium imaging data (see Figure 9 of Guo et al., J.

With spiking activity, it is different (it is easier to correct, except for onset and offset responses) since the time duration of a spike is very short compared to the inter-spike interval.</p></disp-quote><p>Figures 3D and 7A illustrate averaged evoked and single trial spontaneous calcium transients, respectively. Imaging data were processed with Suite2p, a publicly available software package that provides a complete pipeline for processing calcium-dependent fluorescence signals collected with two-photon microscopes (Pachitariu et al., 2016; Stringer and Pachitariu 2019) that is widely used by neuroscience laboratories.

Fitting of this model to data involves repeatedly iterating stages of ROI detection, activity extraction, and subsequent pixel re-assignment.</p><p>3) Signal Extraction and Spike Deconvolution: Suite2p then extracts a single fluorescence signal for each ROI by modelling the uncorrected fluorescence as the sum of three terms: 1) a somatic signal due to an underlying spike train, 2) a neuropil trace scaled by an ROI-specific coefficient, and 3) Gaussian noise (Stringer and Pachitariu 2019). The uncorrected fluorescence is first extracted by averaging all signals within each ROI. The neuropil trace is then computed as the average signal within an annular ring surrounding each ROI. The neuropil component is different from those identified during ROI detection, which implicitly uses pixels inside ROIs, and are not scaled by a contamination factor. Neuropil scaling coefficients and somatic fluorescence are then simultaneously estimated using an unconstrained non-negative deconvolution, using exponential kernels.</p><p>4) Cellular Identification: With a fluorescence trace assigned to each identified ROI, the final stage in the Suite2p pipeline involves identifying the subset of ROIs that correspond to neural somata. Suite2p utilizes a semi-automated approach by first labelling ROIs as cells or noncells based on various activity-dependent statistics, before a final manual curation step.</p><p>The reviewer’s question is really focused on the last part of Step 3, in which the relatively sluggish time-course of the calcium signal is deconvolved to produce sharper transients that are closely linked to spiking events. The kernel used for deconvolution in Suite 2P is derived from experiments that performed simultaneous cell-attached recordings and GCaMP6s imaging. In essence, the deconvolution kernel is a Rosetta Stone that analytically corrects for the intrinsic sluggishness of the calcium indicator to provide something akin to a ground truth assessment of spike timing. To be fair, even these ultrasensitive indicators can be less reliable for single spike events, especially with larger imaging areas (i.e., fewer pixels per somata) but this would be a constant across groups (acoustic trauma vs sham), imaging time, and cortical location so it is not a confounding influence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion</p><p>I suggest being much more cautious in the interpretation of homeostatic plasticity and behavioral data.</p><p>&quot;Furthermore, to control for any changes in licking behavior due to acoustic trauma, our slope measurements are taken from functions using a sensitivity index (d'), which normalizes lick probability according to the false alarm rate determined from the delivery of catch (silent) trials.

However, as with reaction time, the d’ growth function is not a direct measure of loudness, per se, but instead is probably best likened to the change in stimulus salience for tones of varying intensity.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The discussion should come back a bit more to the literature and emphasize in more detail what is consistent with the literature, what is not, what is new, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We refocused the Discussion along these lines.

Overall, the reviewer’s main concern was whether this behavior was related to the loudness hyperacusis phenotype observed in clinical populations and – more specifically – whether this behavior supported strong conclusions about loudness hypersensitivity at all. As noted in the revisions above, we think these are both fair critiques and we have revised the paper to explicitly state that our study should not be interpreted as a model of hyperacusis, nor that we are directly measuring loudness.</p><p>Removing the behavioral data seemed too extreme to us. The reviewer noted that s/he “loved” the behavioral experiment that showed hypersensitivity to direct thalamocortical stimulation. Further, the analysis of the 2-photon data in Figures4-6 is predicated in no small part by the auditory hypersensitivity behavioral finding. We feel that the impact of the manuscript would be greatly reduced by the removal of the behavioral experiments but agree that a more accurate description of the behavior and a more cautious, even-handed interpretation of what the findings mean help to underscore what is new and significant in our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Specific concerns:</p><p>Introduction</p><p>The communalities between tinnitus, hyperacusis and speech in noise impairment are unknown, and the association between those and hearing loss are known but not what happens exactly at neural level.

This is the same point we are making and what our animal model of hearing loss most closely approximates. We are not attempting to model or study tinnitus and make no claims to this effect.

However, loudness recruitment is most pronounced for frequencies within the range of hearing loss and at intensities well above sensation level (Buus and Florentine, 2002; Moore, 2004). Here, we observed steeper growth of auditory sensitivity for a spared frequency and at intensities close to sensation level, neither of which would be expected of a purely peripheral origin.”</p><p>For hyperacusis and behavioral measures of loudness, we made text changes throughout the manuscript as well as revising the following paragraph, Pg. 14, Lns 448-466.</p><p>“While the findings presented here support an association between sensorineural peripheral injury, excess cortical gain, and behavioral hypersensitivity, they should not be interpreted as providing strong evidence for these factors in clinical conditions such as tinnitus or hyperacusis. Our data have nothing to say about tinnitus one way or the other, simply because we never studied a behavior that would indicate phantom sound perception. If anything, one might expect that mice experiencing a chronic phantom sound corresponding in frequency to the region of steeply sloping hearing loss would instead exhibit an increase in false alarms on high-frequency detection blocks after acoustic trauma, but this was not something we observed. Hyperacusis describes a spectrum of aversive auditory qualities including increased perceived loudness of moderate intensity sounds, a decrease in loudness tolerance, discomfort, pain, and even fear of sounds (Pienkowski et al., 2014a). The affective components of hyperacusis are more challenging to index in animals, particularly using head-fixed behaviors, though progress is being made with active avoidance paradigms in freely moving animals (Manohar et al., 2017). Our noise-induced high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss and Go-NoGo operant detection behavior were not designed to model hyperacusis. Hearing loss is not strongly associated with hyperacusis, where many individuals have normal hearing or have a pattern of mild hearing loss that does not correspond to the frequency dependence of their auditory sensitivity (Sheldrake et al., 2015). While the excess central gain and behavioral hypersensitivity we describe here may be related to the sensory component of hyperacusis, this connection is tentative because it was elicited by acoustic trauma and because the detection behavior provides a measure of stimulus salience, but not the perceptual quality of loudness, per se.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Explain why only wave 1 was used to explore the auditory thresholds in ABRs when wave 5, for example, would be easy to identify.</p></disp-quote><p>A vertical electrode montage (pinna-vertex) is more sensitive the electrical dipole generated by central auditory structures downstream of the cochlear nucleus that are the primary contributors to waves 3-5. Instead, we use a horizontal (pinna-pinna) electrode montage due to the surgical procedure preventing electrode placement on top of the head, which is sensitive to the dipole generated by synchronized activity of the spiral ganglion neurons (wave 1) and cochlear nucleus (wave 2) but waves 3-5 are not easily discernable. This has been explained in many of our previous publications (e.g., Chambers et al., Neuron 2016) and also in seminal reports (Galbraith et al., J Neurosci Methods 2006). Perhaps most importantly, later ABR waves can reflect central gain changes, while the main point of Figure 1 is to provide a comprehensive characterization of the peripheral sensorineural damage at the level of stereocilia damage, hair cell death, primary afferent synapse degeneration, otoacoustic emissions, and peripheral neural response.

Behavioral thresholds (Figure 1J-K) exhibited lasting elevation at 32kHz but not 8 kHz. That is easily explainable by observation of OHC and synaptic degeneration at the 32 kHz region of the cochlea but not the 8 kHz region. ABR and DPOAE threshold elevation is &lt;10dB up to 16 kHz but then increases to 30-40dB above 16 kHz. ABR and DPOAE thresholds are less sensitive to afferent lesions (IHC or synaptopathy) and are mostly reflective of OHC damage. OHC elimination was observed at the extreme base (Figure 1E), which can account for some of ABR and DPOAE threshold elevation, but the changes in the 22-45 kHz range arises from more subtle damage to OHCs. Some OHC stereocilia damage at lower regions of the cochlear frequency map can be observed at the light microscopic level (Figure 1G) but resolving the physical substrate of the ABR and DPOAE threshold elevation at lower frequencies requires techniques that can go below the diffraction limit (e.g., electron microscopy).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please clarify why in the combined optogenetic (ChR2) and auditory stimulation, only a high frequency centred at 32 KHz.

We selected a more representative trauma mouse for Figure 2E and revised Figure 2F to indicate which lines correspond to the trauma and sham exemplars shown at left. For the example mice, it was important to show the changes within a mouse that occur (or fail to occur) after noise exposure relative to baseline testing. The quantification of the optogenetic behavior is also based on changes within an animal in the post-exposure period relative to baseline because the particular growth functions vary from mouse to mouse based on fiber placement, transduced neurons, and the optical interface between the fiber and the transduced neurons. For this reason, we determined the most informative contrast was to include data from different behavioral sessions within a mouse rather than a single session for different mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Chronic imaging in A1 reveals tonotopic remapping and dynamic spatiotemporal adjustments in neural response gain after acoustic trauma</p><p>The authors mentioned that tonotopic remapping was limited to the deafferented zone where the proportion of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons preferentially tuned to lesion edge frequencies is more than doubled following acoustic trauma without any systematic change in response.

For example, in panel D it is impossible to distinguish the two different types if sound or silence. Only panel F is clear and easy to follow.</p></disp-quote><p>One of the main contributions in this study is that it provides the means to study many key variables related to cortical plasticity after hearing loss that have traditionally only been studied in isolation. For example, 1) the cell’s tonotopic map location relative to zone of cochlear damage is known to be an important determinate of plasticity, 2) as is the length of time separating the measurement and the cochlear injury, as well as 3) the frequency of the stimulus used to elicit a sensory response relative to the region of cochlear damage. Of course, each of these features depend on 4) whether the noise exposure caused sensorineural cochlear damage or was innocuous.</p><p>Here, we measure each of the dimensions in single neurons and document a 4-way interaction; in other words, the degree of central gain depends on all four factors. For example, gain changes relative to sham controls are weak with low-frequency tone in the low-frequency portion of the map more than a few days after acoustic trauma. Conversely, excess gain relative to sham controls is greatest for lesion edge frequencies (11.3k) in the deafferented region of the tonotopic map several days after acoustic trauma. Dropping any of these three dimensions diminishes the message of the project, hence all must be shown. As such, a certain degree of complexity is unavoidable in these figures as there are four independent variables. We can think of no more convincing and simple way of plotting the gain changes across these four variables than the line plots in Figure 5A-C. However, we tried to address the reviewer’s comment by making text changes that seek to simplify an inherently complex result (Pg. 8, Lns 220-226):</p><p>“This analysis identified several clear results: i) a strong initial uptick in neural gain measured in both topographic regions following trauma; ii) persistent (lasting greater than 1 week) increases in neural gain were observed only for spared mid-frequency tones in deafferented cortical regions; iii) no significant changes in neural gain were observed in sham-exposed mice (Figure 5C). Thus, excess central gain reflected the interaction of four factors: 1) whether the initial sound exposure induced SNHL, 2) where within the cortical frequency map the cell is located, 3) when relative to exposure the measurement is made, and 4) the proximity of the stimulus test frequency to the cochlear lesion.”</p><p>For Figure 5D-F, we relate neural response gain to the behavioral result. This was accomplished by constructing a linear SVM decoder where the input is the population activity in auditory cortex and the decoder is trained to distinguish between trials of sound and silence. Before applying the SVM decoder, we first reduce the dimensionality of the cortical ensemble response using PCA. Figure 5D provides a visualization of the SVM decoding by showing the first 2 principal components for single trials of silence and sound. The reviewer commented that it is impossible to distinguish the sound and silence trials in some conditions (e.g., the first few columns) and this is exactly the point. The cortical decoding model struggles to detect low-intensity tones and the overlap in the data is intended to convey that point. Conversely, at high intensities, particularly after acoustic trauma the blue and gray data points are well separated. The reviewer mentions that panel F is difficult to follow, though s/he did not mention why. It simply shows the change in cortical detection for low and high frequency tones before and after acoustic trauma. Detection accuracy improves for low-frequency tones and becomes worse for high frequency tones, paralleling the behavioral results. We tried to address the reviewer’s critique but determined that the current organization of Figure 5A-C is optimal to convey the 4-way interaction between exposure type, map location, stimulus frequency and post-exposure day. Further Figure 5D-F is the optimal way to visualize and convey the findings from the single trial cortical ensemble decoding analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Tracking changes in activity and local synchrony in individual PyrNs over several weeks.</p><p>Explain the differences across neurons in the probability to be tracked just for one day or for 15 session. Please explore the possibility that the baseline properties of the neurons impact their tractability in chronic imaging</p></disp-quote><p>Like extracellular recordings, 2-photon calcium imaging is biased towards excluding inactive or very sparsely active neurons from the analysis. Cells are “lost” from the chronic tracking for two reasons: 1) they become virtually quiescent and therefore are “invisible” to the regions of interest (ROI) identification process; 2) the geometry of the cell (i.e., the somatic ROI shape) or the geometric separation from other cells change to a degree that we cannot be confident it is the same cell.</p><p>We implemented a relatively rigorous process for establishing ROI tracking confidence that is described in Figure 6 —figure supplement 1 and related text. We observed a constant turnover of ROIs (new ROIs gained, prior ROIs lost) that likely reflects the inherent difficulty of returning to exactly the same XYZ coordinates over time. In addition, we noted a large turnover in lost/added ROIs only after acoustic trauma, only during the 48 hours after exposure, and only near the deafferentation boundary in the cortical map. The two most likely explanations for the large uptick in cell turnover is 1) some active neurons become virtually quiescent and vice versa, and/or 2) the topology of the cortex changes in newly deafferented areas, disrupting our ability to track ROIs based on their appearance and relation to other ROIs. To this latter point, prior studies have documented a degradation of the extracellular matrix proteins (e.g., doi: 10.1016/j.heares.2017.04.015) and uptick in neurite motility (doi: 10.1016/j.neuron.2011.12.038) that accompany suden hearing loss. In theory, this could destabilize the physical geometry of pyramidal neuron ensembles near the deafferentation boundary in the first few days after acoustic trauma.</p><p>We revised Pg. 9, Lns 257-267 to convey these points with greater clarity,</p><p>“Interestingly, we noted that new active PyrNs appeared immediately following noise exposure, while PyrNs tracked throughout the baseline imaging sessions disappeared (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1C). Because the degree of turnover was far less after sham exposure, because the appearance or disappearance of PyrNs after acoustic trauma was concentrated near the deafferentation boundary (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1D), and because approximately 75% of PyrN disappearance occurred within the 48 hours after acoustic trauma (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1E), we concluded that increased PyrN turnover in the imaging field must be related to cortical changes arising indirectly from the cochlear SNHL. Possibilities include large and heterogenous state shifts in activity (from virtually quiescent to active or vice versa) as well as changes in the physical topology of the cortex due to degradation of extracellular matrix proteins and increased neurite motility after sudden hearing loss (Nguyen et al., 2017; Tschida and Mooney, 2012).”</p><p>To the reviewer’s comment about baseline properties, we would refer them to the multivariate model described in Figure 8. Here, we use the diversity of baseline properties to account for diverse functional outcomes after hearing loss. This analysis ensures that our imaging approach includes cells with wide-ranging response properties at baseline and can return to them several days later. So, apart from near-complete quiescence, we cannot identify a scenario in which the baseline properties of the neuron impact its tractability for chronic imaging, though they certainly influence the response to hearing loss, as detailed in Figure 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors mention that following noise overexposure active pyramidal neurons disappeared from the deafferented area, with a permanent increase in response to 8 kHz tome in the deafferented area but not in the low-frequency area. This increase was first for all intensity levels and later only above 50 dB SPL. When this changes happen? After 3 days? When is the beginning of the 2nd stage? Could the authors distinguish between an acute and a chronic phase?</p></disp-quote><p>Taking the reviewer’s questions one at a time, changes in the response to an 8 kHz tone over post-exposure day is provided in Figure 6D. The short-term gain increase in low-frequency map areas is strongest hours after the trauma (D0) and is gone by day 3. Likewise, as in shown now in Figure 6 – Supplement 1E, about 70% of the cells that were ‘lost’ disappeared within the first 48 hours after trauma. By contrast, among the relatively small number of PyrNs that were lost in the sham exposure group, only about 20% were lost within the first 48 hours after the innocuous noise exposure.</p><p>Taken together, yes, the reviewer is correct in observing a period of acute changes in tone-responsiveness following noise exposure that are followed by stable, sustained hyperresponsivity, as shown in Figures 4-6. These results highlight Days 0-2 as acute and highly dynamic, while Days 3+ show far more stable changes in auditory cortex activity. This timescale is also reflected in both the appearance and disappearance of active pyramidal neurons, where on days 0-2 following noise exposure these changes are the most prominent.</p><p>We revised the text on Pg. 10, Lns 304-309 to make this clearer to the reader:</p><p>“Taken together, these observations also suggest that plasticity following acoustic trauma is organized into two phases: a dynamic phase during the first 48-72 hours after noise exposure involving topographically widespread hyper-correlation, hyper-responsivity to mid-frequency sounds in the intact map regions, and large-scale turnover in PyrN stability around the deafferentation map boundary, followed by a stable phase beginning 3 days after exposure where gain is increased for spared tone frequencies in deafferented map regions.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Predicting the degree of excess central gain after trauma in individual PyrNs based on their pre-exposure response features</p><p>Please expand your explanation about potential heterogeneity.

In our linear model, most predictor variables are continuous, which is explained in the Figure 8 legend and the Methods, and so we expect that there is a continuous relationship over which each of these variables relates to the post-exposure gain. Given the results of the linear model, and to offer a reasonable and readable interpretation, in Figure 8G we provide a graphical summary of the model results. Here, we highlight two ‘classes’ of neurons (those with stable gain and those with increased gain), but we also include graphics indicating a gradient of influence for each predictor variable, as this is how linear models work for continuous variables.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Again here the temporal limit is different and they use 3.5 days. Please explain the rationale of that and use always the same time points with justification.</p><p>I am curious to know what will be the result of those functions about central gain if other frequencies were used.</p></disp-quote><p>We used 3-5 days post-exposure because the initial phase of acute reorganization and rapid neural dropout has ended and the expression of plasticity is equivalent to what is observed at longer post-exposure observation periods. Thus, by 3-5 days after trauma, the reorganization has stabilized while affording us the greatest number of chronically tracked PyrNs to include in our model (which helps to avoid overfitting).</p><p>Multivariate linear regression is limited when it comes to including separate imaging sessions in the model. There are more complex modeling approaches that can account for multiple timescales (e.g., tensor decomposition) but we were not in a position to attempt those modeling approaches, so we determined that selecting a single post-exposure period of 3-5 days was the most logical and informative way to go. The reviewer makes a good point that the rationale for this decision was not made clear and we have revised the text on Pgs. 10-11 Lns 327-329 to address this point:</p><p>“To avoid overfitting the regression model, we selected a single timepoint – 3-5 days after noise exposure – that corresponded to the stable phase of reorganization after acoustic trauma, while maximizing our sample size of chronically tracked PyrNs.”</p><p>As for modeling the changes in the same neurons at other stimulus frequencies, our sample size limited how many terms we could add into the model without overfitting and without running into problems with multiple comparisons from the same sample. For these reasons, we limited our model to a single frequency and determined that 8kHz was the best choice as it was the frequency used for behavioral testing (Figure 2) as well as the neural classifier (Figure 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion</p><p>Please state the differences between the hearing loss in the animal model by acute sound overexposure from the majority of ageing sensorineural hearing loss (presbyacusis) where the changes are more gradual.</p><p>Excess central gain is the hypothesized neural substrate for loudness recruitment and generalised hyperacusis, but can the authors think about other potential causes?</p></disp-quote><p>Both presbycusis and noise-induced hearing loss feature afferent synapse loss, high-frequency threshold elevation, and high-frequency outer hair cell stereocilia pathology.

Can neuromodulators such as ACh play a role too?</p></disp-quote><p>The design of our study limits our insight into questions related to “why and what for”. However, the Discussion speculates on this point that L2/3 pyramidal neurons embedded into microcircuits that impose stronger constitutive inhibition would be associated with more non-monotonic intensity growth functions and lower spontaneous firing rates. Conversely, microcircuit milieus that impose weaker feedforward inhibition onto pyramidal neurons might be reflected in higher spontaneous rates and more linear intensity response growth functions.</p><p>This point is made on Pgs. 12-13, Lns 400-405.</p><p>“In particular, PyrNs with low spontaneous activity rates and non-monotonic encoding of sound intensity – features associated with stronger intracortical inhibition (Tan et al., 2007; Wu et al., 2006) – showed more stable gain control after trauma.

Again, what happens when the animals only have hearing loss without tinnitus or hyperacusis? Should be possible that the accumulation of one or more than one symptom after hearing loss depends on the proportion of active cells on the baseline?</p></disp-quote><p>These are all interesting questions that cannot be directly addressed by our experiments. We speculated that baseline response features associated with non-homeostatic excess gain (high spontaneous firing rate and gradual monotonic growth of response to 8 kHz tones) might be reflective of weak local inhibitory tone, which in turn would be predictive of poorly regulated gain after acoustic trauma. To the reviewers, question, other than the certainty of knowing that they are L2/3 excitatory pyramidal neurons, we don’t have any evidence one way or the other to say how the pyramidal neurons that show excess gain versus stable gain are intrinsically different (i.e., different morphology, biophysics, genetics, etc.). We have a lot of evidence to say that we can account for 40% of the variance in how they response to acoustic trauma based on where the neurons are located in the tonotopic map and other functional characteristics that are presumably regulated by local and random (i.e., stochastic) variations in local circuit motifs.</p><p>The reviewer’s questions about types of inhibitory interneurons, a possible role of neuromodulators, and differences in animals with hearing loss that either do (or do not) have behavioral evidence of tinnitus and hyperacusis are interesting ideas for casual discussion but are not directly related to the experiments that we performed, so we opted not to address these points through text revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors mention the startle reflex as an indicator of hypersensitivity but usually, animals show a high degree of adaptation to it.

Given this observation and the consistent trend within groups, we do not see evidence of habituation or sensitization from our measurements. This consistency may come from the difficulty of our tasks. In both procedures, we use stimulus intensities where the mice are operating near their perceptual threshold, which allows for the mice to stay engaged in the task for long periods of time. This point is illustrated by the example adaptive track show in Figure 1I, the consistent behavioral thresholds over days shown in Figure 1K, and the stable gain elevation observed after acoustic trauma in Figures2B and 2F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 439, again many spaces in the sentence.</p></disp-quote><p>Fixed</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 448.

The peripheral and central auditory system is mature by 9 weeks. That is why we chose 9 weeks. Noise-induced cochlear injury is regulated by the circadian clock. Our main intent was to make the exposure time consistent across mice. But we noted prior work showing that the temporary component of the threshold shift was less extreme and less variable for noise exposures occurring during the day, which suggested that morning was a good choice for the exposure time (see Meltser et al., Current Biology 2014, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2014.01.047).</p><p>To address the reviewer’s comment we have revised Ln. 526-528 of the Methods to read,</p><p>“Noise exposure occurred at 9 weeks postnatal and was timed to occur in the morning, when the temporary component of the threshold shift is less extreme and variable (Meltser et al., 2014).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is difficult to follow the different animals in the experimental design.

For the combined optogenetic and acoustic task, we wanted to show changes in performance for a fixed set of stimuli before and after acoustic trauma or sham exposure (i.e., Method of Constant Stimuli). Subtle differences in the amount of opsin expression, the position of the fiber relative to the transduced cells, and the optical properties of the fiber-tissue interface required that we find the range of laser powers and 32 kHz SPLs that spanned the dynamic range of the mouse – from undetectable to detectable with near certainty. Once we had found this range for each mouse, we then proceeded to use these same 5 laser levels and sound levels for all subsequent testing sessions after sound exposure.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out that these details were missing from the Methods. We have revised the text on Pgs. 18-19, Lns. 614-625 to read:</p><p>“For testing, randomized interleaved blocks of either noise or laser stimulation were presented at a fixed range of levels. The range of sound levels and laser powers were individually tailored prior to noise/sham exposure to ensure equivalent sampling of sound and laser perceptual growth functions, and then these fixed values were used for all post-exposure testing sessions. Tailoring was accomplished by first identifying the lowest laser power and 32kHz sound level that produced at least 95% hit rates (operationally defined as “max”). These sound levels and laser powers were then presented alongside four attenuated levels relative to the maximum as well as no-stimulus catch trials in each mouse on every session. Psychometric functions were fit using binary logistic regression, and threshold was defined as the point where detection crossed 71% correct, which is the closest approximation to the threshold point identified with the 2-up, 1-down staircasing procedure described above. Runs were rejected for further analysis if the false alarm rate of the mouse was above 30%, and again this resulted in the exclusion of &lt;5% of sessions.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 584-585.
