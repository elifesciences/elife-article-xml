Our aim was to elucidate mechanisms behind this increased expression. Most transposons are found within genes and introns, with a large minority being close to genes. This raises the possibility that transcriptional readthrough and intron retention are responsible for age-related changes in transposon expression rather than expression of autonomous transposons. To test this, we compiled public RNA-seq datasets from aged human fibroblasts, replicative and drug-induced senescence in human cells, and RNA-seq from aging mice and senescent mouse cells. Indeed, our reanalysis revealed a correlation between transposons expression, intron retention, and transcriptional readthrough across samples and within samples. Both intron retention and readthrough increased with aging or cellular senescence and these transcriptional defects were more pronounced in human samples as compared to those of mice. In support of a causal connection between readthrough and transposon expression, analysis of models showing induced transcriptional readthrough confirmed that they also show elevated transposon expression. Taken together, our data suggest that elevated transposon reads during aging seen in various RNA-seq dataset are concomitant with multiple transcriptional defects. Intron retention and transcriptional readthrough are the most likely explanation for the expression of transposable elements that lack a functional promoter.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>transposon expression</kwd><kwd>senescense</kwd><kwd>intron retention</kwd><kwd>transcriptional readthrough</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001352</institution-id><institution>National University of Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NUHSRO/2020/114</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kennedy</surname><given-names>Brian K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A majority of transcribed transposons during aging are derived from transcriptional defects, most notably intron retention and transcriptional readthrough.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Repetitive DNA makes up at least 50% of the human genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Koning et al., 2011</xref>) and has been linked to genomic instability, cancer and â somewhat less consistently â species longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pabis, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Khristich and Mirkin, 2020</xref>). Transposons are one particularly abundant class of repetitive sequences found in the nuclear genome of eukaryotes and are strongly associated with cancer-causing structural variants like DNA deletions, insertions, or inversions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rodriguez-Martin et al., 2020</xref>). Although transposons are often considered parasitic, harmful or, at best, neutral recent evidence suggests they may contribute to genomic diversification on evolutionary timescales and to the cellular stress-response by providing transcription factor-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Villanueva-CaÃ±as et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The major transposon families in the human genome are long interspersed nuclear element (LINE), short interspersed nuclear element (SINE), long terminal repeat (LTR) transposons, and DNA transposons comprising 21%, 11%, 8%, and 3% of the human genome, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kazazian and Moran, 2017</xref>).</p><p>In recent years, transposon expression, particularly of elements belonging to the LINE-1 family, has been hypothesized to be a near universal marker of aging. Several lines of evidence support a link between transposon reactivation and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gorbunova et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Using RNA-seq, for example, to quantify reads mapping to transposable elements it was shown that expression of these was higher in 10- vs 1-day-old nematodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">LaRocca et al., 2020</xref>), 40- vs 10-day-old flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wood et al., 2016</xref>) and in muscle and liver of aged mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Cecco et al., 2019</xref>). Transposon expression also increases during in vitro senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Colombo et al., 2018</xref>) and in fibroblasts isolated from people between the ages of 1 and 96 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">LaRocca et al., 2020</xref>), whereas lifespan extending mutations and interventions in mice reduce transposon expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wahl et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>However, not all studies report such consistent age-related increases across all transposon classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ghanam et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, it would be a mistake to conflate changes in RNA-seq-, RNA-, DNA-, and protein-based measurements of transposon expression as evidence for one and the same phenomenon.</p><p>Quantification of transposon expression using RNA-seq or PCR techniques remains challenging given their repetitive nature and the fact that 98â99% of all transposons are co-expressed with neighboring transcriptional units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deininger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stow et al., 2021</xref>). In fact, only a small fraction of LINE-1 and SINE elements, the latter relying on co-transposition by LINEs, are expressed from a functional promoter. It is believed that such âhotâ LINE-1 loci drive most transposition events and genomic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deininger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rodriguez-Martin et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The large number of co-expressed transposons would likely mask any signal from autonomous elements in standard RNA-seq experiments. Therefore, alternative explanations are needed for increased transposon expression in such datasets and these could include age-related changes in transposon adjacent genes for example intron retention and transcriptional readthrough.</p><p>Most eukaryotic genes contain introns which need to be removed during a complex co-transcriptional process called splicing. Defects in splicing are the cause of many, often neurologic, hereditary conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Scotti and Swanson, 2016</xref>). One such type of splicing defect is intron retention. Although basal levels of intron retention may be benign or even physiologic, high levels are considered harmful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zheng et al., 2020</xref>). Aging is accompanied by many changes to splicing patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2018</xref>), including intron retention, which is increased during cellular senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yao et al., 2020</xref>) and in aging <italic>Drosophila</italic>, mouse hippocampus and human prefrontal cortex. In addition, levels in human AD brain tissues are elevated even further than in the aged brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adusumalli et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Transcription is terminated by the cleavage and polyadenylation machinery when the polymerase transcribes through the polyadenylation signal leading to pre-mRNA cleavage, polymerase pausing, conformational change, and eventually polymerase detachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rosa-Mercado et al., 2021</xref>). However, this termination may fail leading to so-called readthrough transcription which increases during stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rosa-Mercado and Steitz, 2022</xref>) and during cellular senescence, at least for a subset of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Muniz et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Emerging evidence suggests that intron retention, readthrough, and transposon expression are linked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rosa-Mercado et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hadar et al., 2022</xref>), but this has not been studied in the context of aging. In this manuscript, we show that intron retention and readthrough taken together can explain most of the apparent increase in transposon expression seen in RNA-seq datasets of aging.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genomic location of transposons implicates them as a marker of multiple transcriptional defects</title><p>During aging and senescence the expression of all four major transposon families (LTR, DNA, LINE, and SINE) increases.

Indeed, we found that samples with high intron retention also show high transposon expression. This is true both in the aging dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and in the cellular senescence dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), where intronic reads accounted for most of the observed variability in transposon expression (or vice versa). Looking at individual genomic loci, we also found a strong correlation between the log-fold change of a transposon and the log-fold change of the intron it is located in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1âfigure supplement 6</xref>).</p><p>As a more direct test of this hypothesis, we determined the correlation between the counts of retained introns and the counts of intronic transposons for each sample individually. Non-intronic transposons and randomized transposons served as a negative control. Consistent with the log-fold change data, we found a specific correlation between intronic transposon and intron counts in both datasets, with stronger correlations in the senescence dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1âfigure supplement 7</xref>).</p><p>Although causality is hard to establish from our datasets, we also tested whether transposon expression could affect intron retention. If transposon expression was causally linked to intron retention, the most likely mechanism would be via an impairment of the splice junction. In this case, we would expect more transposons near the splice junctions of retained (differentially expressed) introns. However, we observed a depletion of transposons at the splice junctions of all introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1âfigure supplement 8A</xref>) and of differentially expressed introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1âfigure supplement 8B, E</xref>). Transposon densities were also comparable between these two classes of introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1âfigure supplement 8C, F</xref>). Moreover, introns with and without expressed transposons showed similar levels of age-related upregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1âfigure supplement 9</xref>). Based on our data, we propose a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) where intron retention contributes to age-related upregulation of transposons, rather than transposons contributing to intron retention.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>A schematic model of transposon expression.</title><p>In our model, represented in this schematic, transcription (<bold>A</bold>) can give rise to mRNAs and pre-mRNAs that contain retained introns when co-transcriptional splicing is impaired.

One explanation for this discrepancy is the mapping approach used. Since their analysis did not use an expectationâmaximization algorithm to map back transposons onto the genome, it may underestimate the number of intragenic and gene-adjacent transposons in contrast to our analysis using TELocal.</p><p>Given that inactive LINE-1 loci greatly outnumber active loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deininger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stow et al., 2021</xref>), and we saw only limited evidence for active LINE-1 transcription in fibroblasts isolated from donors of varying ages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), our data appear to question the role of transposons in organismal aging. An intriguing explanation is provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Cecco et al., 2019</xref>, who found that LINE-1 ORF1 protein-positive cells colocalize with a small subset of senescent cells.

Instead, a concerted increase in transposon expression, intron retention, and transcriptional readthrough points to a global increase in transcriptional dysfunction during aging and senescence, at least in human cells. Nevertheless, there are several other techniques such as immunoblotting for ORF1 protein, rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), or genomic PCR that may provide evidence in favor of age-related reactivation of potentially autonomous transposons, specifically LINE-1 elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Cecco et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, since most of our analysis focused on cellular models of aging and senescence, we cannot exclude that RNA-seq data performed on tissues samples would more faithfully and specifically capture the expression of autonomous transposable elements.</p><p>Although we have shown increased transcriptional dysfunction with aging and cellular senescence, so far we lack a model to explain these findings.

The current manuscript claims that the increased intron retention and readthrough could completely explain the findings of elevated transposon expression seen in these conditions. To that end, they analyze multiple RNA-seq expression datasets of human aging, human senescence, and mouse aging, and establish a series of correlations between the overall expression of these three entities in all datasets.</p><p>While the findings are useful, the strength of the evidence is incomplete, as the individual analyses unfortunately do not support the claims. Specifically, to establish this claim there is a burden of proof on the authors to analyze both intron-by-intron and gene-by-gene, using internal matched regions, and, in addition, thoroughly quantify the extent of transcription of completely intergenic transposons and show that they do not contribute to the increase in aging/senescence. Furthermore, the authors chose to analyze the datasets as unstranded, even though strand information is crucial to their claim, as both introns and readthrough are stranded, and if there is causality, than opposite strand transposons should show no preferential increase in aging/senescence. Finally, there are some unclear figures that do not seem to show what the authors claim. Overall, the study is not convincing.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1. Why were all datasets treated as unstanded? Strand information seems critical, and should not be discarded. Specifically, stranded information is crucial to increase the confidence in the causality claimed by the authors, since readthrough and intron retention are both strand specific, and therefore should influence only the same strand transposons and not the opposite-strand ones.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent suggestion. Since only one of our datasets was stranded, we did not run stranded analyses for the sake of consistency. We would like to provide two analyses here that consider strandedness:</p><p>First, we find that within the set of all expressed transposons (passing minimal read filtering), 86% of intronic transposons match the strand of the intron (3147 out of 3613). In contrast, the number is 51% after permutation of the strands. Similarly, when we randomly select 1000 intronic transposons 45% match the strandedness of the intron (here we select from the set of all transposons). This is consistent with the idea that most transposons are only detectable because they are co-expressed on the sense strand of other features that are highly expressed.</p><p>As for the readthrough data, 287 out of 360 transposons (79%) within readthrough regions matched the strand of the gene and its readthrough.</p><p>Second, in the model we postulate, the majority of transposon transcription occurs as a co-transcriptional artifact. This applies equally to genic transposons (gene expression), intronic (intron retention) and gene proximal (readthrough or readin) transposons. Therefore, we performed the following analysis for the set of all transposons in the Fleischer et al. fibroblast dataset.</p><p>When we invert the strand annotation for transposons, before counting and differential expression, we would expect the counts and log fold changes to be lower compared to using the âcorrectâ annotation file.</p><p>Indeed, we show that out of 6623 significantly changed transposons with age only 226 show any expression in the âinverted runâ (-96%). (Any expression is defined as passing basic read filtering.)</p><p>Out of the 226 transposons that can be detected in both runs most show lower counts (A) and age-related differential expression converging towards zero (B) in the inverted run (Fig. L1).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Transposons with inverted strandedness (âreverseâ) show lower expression levels (log counts; A) and no differential expression with age (B) when compared to matched differentially expressed transposons (âactualâ).</title><p>For this analysis we selected all transposons showing significant differential expression with age in the actual dataset that also showed at least minimal expression in the strand-inverted analysis (n=226). Data from Fleischer et al. (2018). (A) The log (counts) are clipped because we only used transposons that passed minimal read filtering in this analysis. (B) The distribution of expression values in the actual dataset is bimodal and positive since some transposons are significantly up- or downregulated. This bimodal distribution is lost in the strand-inverted analysis.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87811-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. &quot;Altogether this data suggests that intron retention contributes to the age-related increase in the expression of transposons&quot; - this analysis doesn't demonstrate the claim. In order to prove this they need to show that transposons that are independent of introns are either negligible, or non-changing with age.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to emphasize that we never claimed that intron retention and readthrough can explain all of the age-related increases in transposon expression. In fact, our data is compatible with a multifactorial origin of transposons expression. Age- and senescence-related transposon expression can occur due to: 1/ intron retention, 2/ readthrough, 3/ loss of intergenic heterochromatin. Specifically, we do not try to refute 3.</p><p>However, since most transposons are found in introns or downstream of genes, this suggests that intron retention and readthrough will be major, albeit non-exclusive, drivers of age-related changes in transposons expression. Even if the fold-change for intergenic transposons with aging or senescence were higher this would not account for the broadscale expression patterns seen in RNAseq data.</p><p>To further illustrate this, we analyzed transposons located in introns, genes, downstream (ds) or upstream (us) of genes (distance to gene &lt; 25 kb) or in intergenic regions (distance to gene &gt; 25 kb). Indeed, we find that although intergenic transposons show similar log-fold changes to other transposon classes (Fig. L2A), their total contribution to read counts is negligible (Fig. L2B, Fig. Fig. S15). We have also now added a more nuanced explanation of this issue to the discussion.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>We analyzed transposons located in introns, genes, downstream (ds) or upstream (us) of genes (distance to gene &lt; 25 kb) or in intergenic regions (distance to gene &gt; 25 kb).</title><p>Independent of their location, transposons show similar differential expression with aging or cellular senescence (A).

Additionally, the correct control regions should be intronic regions other than the transposon, which overall contributed to the read counts of the intron.</p><p>1. Furthermore, analysis of read spanning intron and partly transposons should more directly show this contribution.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. To rephrase this, if we understand correctly, the concern is that an increase in transposon expression could bias the analysis of intron retention since transposons often make up a substantial portion of an intron. We would like to address this concern with the following three points:</p><p>First, if the concern is the correlation between log fold-change of transposons vs log fold-change of their containing introns, we do not think that this kind of data is biased. While transposons make up much of the intron, a single transposon on average only accounts for less than 10% of an intron.</p><p>Second, to address this more directly, we show here that even introns that do not contain expressed transposons are increased in aging fibroblasts and after induction of cellular senescence (Fig. S8). This shows that intron retention is universal and most likely not heavily biased by the presence or absence of expressed transposons.</p><fig id="sa2fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>We split the set of introns that significantly change with cellular aging (A) or cell senescence (B) into introns that contain at least one transposon (has_t) and those that do not contain any transposons (has_no_t).</title><p>Intron retention is increased in both groups. In this analysis we included all transposons that passed minimal read filtering (n=63782 in A and n=124173 in B). Median log-fold change indicated with a dashed red line for the group of introns without transposons.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87811-sa2-fig4-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Third, we provide an argument based on the distribution of transposons within introns (Fig. L3).</p><p><bold>Author response image 5.</bold></p><p>The 5â and 3â splice sites show the highest sequence conservation between introns, whereas the majority of the intronic sequence does not. This is because these sites contain binding sites for splicing factors such as U1, U2 and SF1 (A). Transposons could affect splicing and we present a biologically plausible mechanism and two ancillary hypotheses here (B). If transposons affect the splicing (retention) of introns the most likely mechanism would be via impairment of splice site recognition because a transposon close to the site forms a secondary structure, binds an effector protein or provides inadequate sequences for pairing. Hypothesis 1: Transposons impair splicing because they are close to the splice site. Hypothesis 2: Transposons do not impair splicing because they are located away from the splice junction. Retained introns should show a similar depletion of transposons around the junction.</p><p>Image adapted from: Ren, Pingping, et al. &quot;Alternative splicing: a new cause and potential therapeutic target in autoimmune disease.&quot; Frontiers in Immunology 12 (2021): 713540.</p><p>Consistent with hypothesis 2 (âtransposons do not impair splicingâ), we show that the distribution of transposons within introns is similar for the set of all transposons and all significant transposons within significantly overexpressed introns (Fig. S7. A and B is similar in the case of aged fibroblasts; D and E is similar in the case of cellular senescence). If transposon expression was causally linked to changes in intron retention, the most likely mechanism would be via an impairment of splicing. We would expect transposons to be located close to the splice junction, which is not what we observed. Instead, the data is more consistent with intron retention as a driver of transposon expression.</p><fig id="sa2fig5" position="float"><label>Author response image 6.</label><caption><title>Transposons are evenly distributed within introns except for the region close to splice junctions (<bold>A-E</bold>).</title><p>Transposons appear to be excluded from the splice junction-adjacent region both in all introns (<bold>A, D</bold>) and in significantly retained introns (<bold>B, E</bold>).

Since readthrough transcription decays as a function of distance from TSEs, the expression of transposons should show the same trends if indeed simply caused by readthrough.

It is assumed that most transposable elements have lost the regulatory elements necessary for transcription activation. Using available RNA-seq datasets, the authors showed that an increase in intron retention and readthrough transcription during aging contributes to an increase in the number of transcripts containing transposable elements.</p><p>Previously, it was assumed that the activation of transposable elements during aging is a consequence of a gradual imbalance of transcriptional repression and a decrease in the functionality of heterochromatin (de repression of transcription in heterochromatin). Therefore, this is an interesting study with important novel conclusion. However, there are many questions about bioinformatics analysis and the results obtained.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1. In Introduction the authors indicated that only small fraction of LINE-1 and SINE elements are expressed from functional promoters and most of LINE-1 are co-expressed with neighboring transcriptional units. What about other classes of mobile elements (LTR mobile element and transposons)?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. Historically, most repetitive elements, e.g. DNA elements and retrotransposon-like elements, have been considered inactive, having accrued mutations which prevent them from transposition. On the other hand, based on recent data it is indeed very possible that certain LTR elements become active with aging as suggested in several manuscripts (Liu et al. 2023, Autio et al. 2020). However, these elements are not well annotated and our final analysis (Fig. 6) relies on a well-defined distinction between active and inactive elements. (See also question 2 for further discussion.)</p><p>Finally, we would like to point out some of the difficulties with defining expression and re-activation of LTR/ERV elements based on RNAseq data that have been highlighted for the Liu manuscript and are concordant with several of our results:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/364E785636ADF94732A977604E0256">https://pubpeer.com/publications/364E785636ADF94732A977604E0256</ext-link></p><p>Liu, Xiaoqian, et al. &quot;Resurrection of endogenous retroviruses during aging reinforces senescence.&quot; Cell 186.2 (2023): 287-304.</p><p>Autio A, Nevalainen T, Mishra BH, JylhÃ¤ M, Flinck H, Hurme M.

Results: Why authors considered all classes of mobile elements together? It is likely that most of the LTR containing mobile elements and transposons contain active promoters that are repressed in heterochromatin or by KRAB-C2H2 proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not consider LTR containing elements because there is uncertainty regarding their overall expression levels and their expression with aging (Nevalainen et al. 2018). Furthermore, we believe that substantial activity of LTR elements in human genomes should have been detectable through patterns of insertional mutagenesis. Yet studies generally show low to negligible levels of LTR (ERV) mutagenesis. Here, for example, at a 200-fold lower rate than for LINEs (Lee et al. 2012).</p><p>Importantly, our analysis in Fig. 6 relies on well-annotated elements like LINEs, which is why we do not include LTR or SINE elements that could be potentially expressed.

The study analyzed the levels of RNA from cell cultures of human fibroblasts of different ages. The annotation to the dataset indicated that the cells were cultured and maintained. The cells were cultured in high-glucose (4.5mg/ml) DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 15% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 1X glutamax (Gibco), 1X non-essential amino acids (Gibco) and 1% (vol/vol) penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco). How correct that gene expression levels in cell cultures are the same as in body cells? In cell cultures, transcription is optimized for efficient division and is very different from that of cells in the body. In order to correlate a result on cells with an organism, there must be rigorous evidence that the transcriptomes match.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have updated the discussion to reflect this shortcoming.

Analysis of transcripts passing through repeating regions is a complex matter. There is always a high probability of incorrect mapping of multi-reads to the genome. Things worsen if unpaired short reads are used, as in the study (L=51). Therefore, the authors used the Expectation maximization algorithm to quantify transposon reads. Such an option is possible. But it is necessary to indicate how statistically reliable the calculated levels are. It would be nice to make a similar comparison of TE levels using only unique reads. The density of reads would drop, but in this case it would be possible to avoid the artifacts of the EM algorithm.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion.
