While revisiting our original TLC blots, we realized that in Figure 5C the labelling of our experimental TLC lanes were unintentionally swapped. Additionally, TLC data shown in Figure 5B, C, D and E were assembled by splicing out irrelevant lanes from the plates from which each of those figures were prepared, however, the junctions were not demarcated. The corrections do not affect or change the corresponding quantifications for the TLC lanes in Figure 5. Neither do they change or affect any of the conclusions of the manuscript.</p><p>The corrected text in the figure legend of Figure 5 (change is underlined):</p><p>Figure 5: Muscle to oenocyte Pvf1 signaling suppresses lipid synthesis.</p><p>(A) Starvation resistance of adult male flies on 1% sucrose and 0.8% agar food.
