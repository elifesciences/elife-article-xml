counterparts, the contributions of activity-dependent cytoskeletal signaling to presynaptic plasticity remain controversial and poorly understood. To identify and evaluate these signaling pathways, we conducted a proteomic analysis of the presynaptic cytomatrix using in vivo biotin identification (iBioID). The resultant proteome was heavily enriched for actin cytoskeleton regulators, including Rac1, a Rho GTPase that activates the Arp2/3 complex to nucleate branched actin filaments. Strikingly, we find Rac1 and Arp2/3 are closely associated with synaptic vesicle membranes in adult mice. Using three independent approaches to alter presynaptic Rac1 activity (genetic knockout, spatially restricted inhibition, and temporal optogenetic manipulation), we discover that this pathway negatively regulates synaptic vesicle replenishment at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, bidirectionally sculpting short-term synaptic depression. Finally, we use two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging to show that presynaptic Rac1 activation is coupled to action potentials by voltage-gated calcium influx. Thus, this study uncovers a previously unrecognized mechanism of actin-regulated short-term presynaptic plasticity that is conserved across excitatory and inhibitory terminals. It also provides a new proteomic framework for better understanding presynaptic physiology, along with a blueprint of experimental strategies to isolate the presynaptic effects of ubiquitously expressed proteins.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>short-term plasticity</kwd><kwd>presynapse</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>Rac1</kwd><kwd>2pFLIM</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE-1644868</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>O'Neil</surname><given-names>Shataakshi Dube</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS102456</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Soderling</surname><given-names>Scott H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH111684</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Soderling</surname><given-names>Scott H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35NS116804</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yasuda</surname><given-names>Ryohei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH080047</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yasuda</surname><given-names>Ryohei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004895</institution-id><institution>European Social Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EFOP-3.6.2-16-2017-0008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rácz</surname><given-names>Bence</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hungary National Research, Development and Innovation Office</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KKP126998</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rácz</surname><given-names>Bence</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1MH126954</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Soderling</surname><given-names>Scott H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Proteomic and genetic analysis discovers a new cytoskeletal mechanism of presynaptic short-term plasticity common across neuronal cell types.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dynamic tuning of neurotransmitter release in response to patterns of activity is a fundamental process that ultimately governs how experience modulates neural networks. During bursts of high-frequency firing, the complex interplay between presynaptic calcium levels and vesicle availability can result in a transient enhancement or reduction of synaptic strength, a process known as short-term synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Regehr, 2012</xref>). Recent work has clarified some of the calcium sensors important for short-term enhancement, such as Synaptotagmin-7 during facilitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Jackman and Regehr, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Jackman et al., 2016</xref>) and Doc2 during augmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib158">Xue et al., 2018</xref>), yet the signaling molecules that sense action potentials to translate other forms of short-term plasticity are still poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">de Jong and Fioravante, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Wang et al., 2016a</xref>). For example, reduction of release during short-term depression (STD) is generally thought to reflect the depletion of the readily releasable pool (RRP) of synaptic vesicles. This depletion is counterbalanced by a calcium-dependent acceleration of RRP refilling that depends on the Munc13 family of calcium sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Junge et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Lipstein et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Lipstein et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Rosenmund et al., 2002</xref>). However, at many synapses, vesicle depletion cannot fully account for the extent of depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bellingham and Walmsley, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Byrne, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gabriel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Garcia-Perez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Guo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Hsu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Kraushaar and Jonas, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Stevens and Wesseling, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Sullivan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Thomson and Bannister, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Waldeck et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib167">Zucker and Bruner, 1977</xref>), suggesting the presence of additional unknown activity-dependent signaling mechanisms that actively drive, rather than counteract, STD.</p><p>The actin cytoskeleton has long been implicated in many stages of the synaptic vesicle cycle that could modulate short-term plasticity, including exocytosis, endocytosis, vesicle trafficking, and reserve pool clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cingolani and Goda, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Rust and Maritzen, 2015</xref>). Yet, these potential roles have been controversial, as actin depolymerizing agents have enhanced, reduced, or had no effect on each of these processes depending on the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cole et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Darcy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gaffield et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Gramlich and Klyachko, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Morales et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Sakaba and Neher, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Sankaranarayanan et al., 2003</xref>). These pharmacological manipulations, while powerful, may not be the ideal method to reveal the diverse functions and regulation of presynaptic actin, because they influence the entire actin cytoskeleton. They do not specifically probe the unique actin pools that exist within different subcellular compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Papandréou and Leterrier, 2018</xref>). Indeed, many aspects of postsynaptic physiology have been clarified by genetic analyses of actin signaling cascades within dendritic spines. These studies have revealed that distinct pools of actin sculpt dendritic spine morphology, modulate adhesion, and regulate plasticity mechanisms such as the anchoring and trafficking of glutamate receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Spence and Soderling, 2015</xref>). These different pools are tightly regulated by the Rho-family GTPases (including RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42), which act on effector proteins to control actin filament assembly and disassembly during both baseline transmission and synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Hedrick and Yasuda, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Murakoshi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Tolias et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, these signaling pathways are heavily implicated in neurological diseases such as intellectual disability, autism, and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Spence and Soderling, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib159">Yan et al., 2016</xref>), highlighting the importance of synaptic actin for proper neural function. Given the clear links between actin turnover and postsynaptic plasticity, it is therefore surprising that there is little evidence supporting a role for the presynaptic actin cytoskeleton or its signaling molecules in mechanisms of short-term presynaptic plasticity. Some studies have even suggested that presynaptic actin remodeling is only important during synapse maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Shen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib160">Yao et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Here, we uncover a new, conserved role for Rho-family GTPase signaling in driving STD at both glutamatergic and GABAergic presynaptic terminals. First, in order to enable genetic analysis of the presynaptic cytoskeleton, we defined the actin signaling pathways present in presynaptic terminals. These proteins have not been systematically identified because the presynaptic cytomatrix cannot be biochemically purified, limiting previous studies of the presynaptic proteome to synaptic vesicles and the active zone. To capture a larger fraction of the presynaptic cytomatrix, we used in vivo Biotin Identification (iBioID) and localized the promiscuous biotin ligase BioID2 to presynaptic terminals by fusing it to Synapsin, a presynaptic actin-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Doussau and Augustine, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Greengard et al., 1994</xref>). Similar to our previous work isolating the proteomes of inhibitory postsynapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Uezu et al., 2016</xref>), dendritic filopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Spence et al., 2019</xref>), and perisynaptic astrocytic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Takano et al., 2020</xref>), this approach led to the mass spectrometry-based identification of 200 proteins within mature presynaptic terminals of the hippocampus and cortex. This network of presynaptic proteins was highly enriched for regulators of the actin cytoskeleton and converged on a Rac1-Arp2/3 signaling pathway that leads to the de novo nucleation of branched actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Higgs and Pollard, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Mullins et al., 1998</xref>). While Rac1 and Arp2/3 have established roles at the postsynapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Hedrick and Yasuda, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Spence et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Tolias et al., 2011</xref>), here we discovered that Rac1 and Arp2/3 are also closely associated with presynaptic vesicle membranes in vivo. We developed genetic, optogenetic, and electrophysiological strategies to specifically isolate presynaptic effects and demonstrated that Rac1-Arp2/3 signaling negatively regulates synaptic vesicle replenishment and can bidirectionally alter STD. By imaging a Rac1 activity sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Hedrick et al., 2016</xref>) in presynaptic terminals, we also found that Rac1 activation is coupled to action potential trains via voltage-gated calcium influx. Thus, Rac1 and branched actin have an important, previously uncharacterized presynaptic role in sculpting short-term synaptic plasticity. These results define a new activity-dependent signaling mechanism that contributes to STD and is conserved across cell types. This also challenges the prevailing view that the Rac1-Arp2/3 pathway functions largely at excitatory postsynapses, prompting re-evaluation of its mechanism in neurodevelopmental disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of the proteomic composition of the presynaptic cytomatrix in vivo</title><p>Current knowledge about presynaptic actin regulation at mature synapses is limited to the discovery of both pre- and post-synaptic effects in a few genetic knockout studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Connert et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib152">Wolf et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib156">Xiao et al., 2016</xref>). A larger inventory of presynaptic actin regulators is still lacking due to the inability of traditional biochemical methods to isolate the presynaptic cytomatrix, where actin signaling likely occurs. Proteomic studies from isolated synaptic vesicles and active zone fractions, although powerful, have identified few actin signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abul-Husn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boyken et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Burré et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Coughenour et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Morciano et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Morciano et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Takamori et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib149">Weingarten et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Wilhelm et al., 2014</xref>), despite actin being the most abundant cytoskeletal element in presynaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Wilhelm et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We turned to a proximity-based proteomics approach, in vivo Biotin Identification (iBioID), in which the promiscuous biotin ligase BioID2 is fused to a protein in a compartment of interest, and nearby biotinylated proteins are identified by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Spence et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Uezu et al., 2016</xref>). To direct BioID2’s activity toward the presynaptic cytomatrix, we created a Synapsin1a fusion protein with a flexible 4x[GGGGS] linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Synapsin is a synaptic vesicle protein that is also known to bind actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Doussau and Augustine, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Greengard et al., 1994</xref>), making it the ideal bait for discovering presynaptic actin signaling pathways. Importantly, Synapsin has been tagged previously with GFP without disrupting its presynaptic targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Gitler et al., 2004b</xref>). To validate this approach, we expressed BioID2-Synapsin, untargeted BioID2, and GFP in cultured hippocampal neurons and incubated them with exogenous biotin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). BioID2-Synapsin was enriched in presynaptic boutons similarly to Bassoon, an active zone marker, while the localization of BioID2 was indistinguishable from GFP, confirming it acts as a soluble fill (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The biotinylation activity of BioID2-Synapsin was also significantly enhanced in presynaptic terminals in comparison to BioID2 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Identification of the proteomic composition of the presynaptic cytomatrix using in vivo BioID.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the iBioID approach in presynaptic terminals.

Next, to assess quantal release parameters, EPSCs were evoked in the presence of Sr<sup>2+</sup> (in place of Ca<sup>2+</sup>), which induces asynchronous quantal events after an initial synchronous release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bekkers and Clements, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Goda and Stevens, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib157">Xu-Friedman and Regehr, 2000</xref>). We could not use the more traditional method of recording miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), due to the need to measure quantal events from only the defined presynaptic WT or KO neurons. Although strontium-evoked quantal events are not equivalent to mEPSCs, they have been commonly used in other contexts to estimate quantal parameters from specific cell types and circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beeson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ding et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gil et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Hull et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Wan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib162">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Here, presynaptic <italic>Rac1</italic> deletion did not affect the amplitude or frequency of strontium-induced quantal events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). We do note the possibility that some of the measured events might be background spontaneous activity from other WT neurons, rather than all being from presynaptic mutant neurons.</p><p>Finally, a high-frequency stimulation (HFS) train was used to probe synaptic vesicle recycling. This method assumes that the HFS train fully depletes the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles (RRP); electrical stimulation for 1–2 s at 20 Hz has previously been shown to be sufficient to deplete the RRP at cultured hippocampal synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Murthy and Stevens, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Otsu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Rosenmund and Stevens, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Schikorski and Stevens, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Stevens and Williams, 2007</xref>). We also confirmed this in our system by recording 20 Hz light-evoked responses in standard (2 mM) and elevated (4 mM) extracellular calcium. If the stimulus did not fully deplete the RRP, then we would expect elevated calcium to result in greater cumulative release during the train. Instead, in 4 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> a higher initial release probability was balanced by slightly smaller responses at the end of the train, resulting in the same total cumulative release during the train (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A–B</xref>). This was also true at inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Furthermore, we also placed an extracellular bipolar electrode and electrically stimulated the same cultures in the same conditions; measurements taken with optical and electrical stimulation were very similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3D–E</xref>). Thus, in this system, 20 Hz light stimulation for 2 s in 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> is sufficient to exhaust the RRP and estimate its size.</p><p>Surprisingly, presynaptic <italic>Rac1</italic> deletion reduced short-term synaptic depression in response to HFS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). There was no effect on asynchronous release during the train, as measured by the steady-state basal current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C,F</xref>). Quantification of the cumulative EPSC curve showed that presynaptic <italic>Rac1</italic> deletion increased the synaptic vesicle replenishment rate, without altering release probability or RRP size. Presynaptic <italic>Rac1</italic> deletion from inhibitory neurons caused similar effects as in excitatory neurons; there were no effects on single evoked IPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2G</xref>), PPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), quantal events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), or asynchronous release during HFS trains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D,H</xref>). However, there was a reduction in the short-term depression of IPSCs due to an increase in the synaptic vesicle replenishment rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Together, these data show that Rac1 negatively regulates synaptic vesicle replenishment at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, suggesting that this is a common function of Rac1 across different kinds of presynaptic terminals.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Presynaptic Arp2/3 negatively regulates release probability and vesicle replenishment</title><p>We next tested whether Arp2/3 has similar functions in regulating neurotransmitter release, since we found components of the WAVE complex that are known to activate Arp2/3 downstream of Rac1 in the presynaptic cytomatrix proteome.

Thus, while our iBioID approach identified components of the synaptic vesicles and the active zone, it also allowed for a more holistic view of presynaptic terminal space, including the presynaptic cytomatrix. Indeed, our analysis revealed a large number of proteins (92/200) that were not previously known to localize to presynapses, and these were mainly involved in actin cytoskeleton regulation, cell-cell adhesion, or other signaling pathways. We also validated the presynaptic localization of 14 of these proteins using an endogenous genomic tagging approach and an additional protein, Rac1, using electron microscopy. These results provide a new proteomic framework from which to view the cellular biology of presynaptic physiology. We also anticipate that the experimental approaches we developed here to isolate presynaptic effects – presynaptic genetic knockout with ChR2, spatially restricted inhibition, and temporal optogenetic manipulation with paired control of both activity and signaling – will serve as a useful roadmap for future studies on this proteome. Many of these proteins are found in multiple subcellular compartments, so these strategies will enable new insights into their presynaptic function. Indeed, they led us to uncover a new actin-based mechanism of short-term plasticity that acts through Rac1 and Arp2/3.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Actin remodeling as a new mechanism of short-term synaptic depression</title><p>Although there is evidence suggesting the existence of active signaling mechanisms to cause STD, the identity of these processes remains unresolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bellingham and Walmsley, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Byrne, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gabriel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Garcia-Perez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Guo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Hsu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Kraushaar and Jonas, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Stevens and Wesseling, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Sullivan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Thomson and Bannister, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Waldeck et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib167">Zucker and Bruner, 1977</xref>). Here, we discover such a process that depends on presynaptic Rac1. Why do neurons have this seemingly paradoxical method to reduce synaptic vesicle replenishment during bursts of action potentials? Our experiments using PA-Rac1 reveal that elevating or dampening levels of presynaptic Rac1 activity inversely alters synaptic vesicle replenishment rates, bidirectionally modulating the degree of STD. Thus, regulation of Rac1 activity, upstream of Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization, appears to play a central role in connecting activity to the fine-tuning of short-term plasticity. This pathway acts similarly at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, suggesting it is a fundamental aspect of presynaptic function.</p><p>The Arp2/3 complex is comprised of seven subunits, which include two actin-related proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Pollard and Beltzner, 2002</xref>). When activated by upstream signals such as Rac1, it binds to the sides of existing actin filaments and nucleates the formation of new actin filaments at a 70° angle. The structures of the complex and the individual subunits are distinctly adapted to bind and nucleate actin filaments, and this is highly conserved evolutionarily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Espinoza-Sanchez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">Welch et al., 1997</xref>). Despite intense research on the Arp2/3 complex since its discovery three decades ago, no other function, besides directing the assembly of branched actin networks, has been found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Rotty et al., 2013</xref>). Since presynaptic Rac1 likely requires Arp2/3 to alter synaptic vesicle replenishment rate, the data from our work and the collective literature indicates this effect may depend on presynaptic actin remodeling. To bolster this hypothesis, it would be informative to perturb Rac1 and probe presynaptic actin filaments at short, fixed intervals following HFS using flash-and-freeze electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Watanabe et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Watanabe et al., 2013b</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism by which this occurs likely does not depend on actin-synapsin interactions since synapsin function differs across cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Gitler et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Patzke et al., 2019</xref>). It is possible that branched actin filaments in presynaptic terminals may act as a barrier to diffusion to restrict synaptic vesicle mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Rothman et al., 2016</xref>). This would also make the active zone proteins Bassoon and Piccolo less available for accelerating vesicle replenishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Butola et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Hallermann et al., 2010</xref>). Alternatively, the Rac1-Arp2/3 pathway could negatively regulate release site clearance or synaptic vesicle endocytosis, although this would be surprising since Arp2/3 is required for endocytosis in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Moreau et al., 1997</xref>) and actin itself is required for most, if not all forms of synaptic vesicle endocytosis in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Soykan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Watanabe et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). This could also potentially explain why previous studies using actin depolymerizing agents did not detect an increase in synaptic vesicle replenishment. These pharmacological agents would have impaired the actin required for endocytosis (and thus synaptic vesicle replenishment), thereby masking forms of negative regulation by other pools of actin such as those we report here. Finally, Rac1 and Arp2/3 could also affect replenishment rates by altering presynaptic calcium dynamics. Similar short-term plasticity changes would be observed if our manipulations increased calcium influx, density of voltage-gated calcium channels, or coupling distances between synaptic vesicles and calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Eggermann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Wadel et al., 2007</xref>).

However, our finding that Rac1 and Arp2/3 are closely associated with vesicle membranes within the synaptic vesicle cluster suggests this may need to be re-examined.

Loss of Arp2/3 also led to a change in intrinsic membrane properties, because action potential width was increased by both ChR2 stimulation and current injection. Recently, it was shown that Arp2/3-dependent actin slows the inactivation rate of Kv3.3, a voltage-gated potassium channel that is important for action potential repolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib163">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, it is plausible that loss of Arp2/3 could increase action potential width via impaired repolarization. Increased width of the action potential would also likely lead to an increase in calcium influx during repetitive stimulation, explaining the increase in release probability we observed.</p><p>Nonetheless, our results highlight that there may be different pools of branched actin in presynaptic terminals. If Rac1 really does require Arp2/3 to alter synaptic vesicle replenishment rate, then there is an actin pool in the synaptic vesicle cluster that regulates vesicle replenishment and synaptic depression. There is clearly also an Arp2/3-dependent pool that regulates release probability independently of Rac1. As discussed earlier, there may also be a third pool of actin involved in synaptic vesicle endocytosis that is not dependent on Rac1 or Arp2/3. Multiple pools of actin assemblies existing in subdomains of presynaptic terminals is consistent with the diversity of actin regulators identified within the Synapsin iBioID proteome. Based on the identity of these proteins, it is now possible to use similar genetic analyses to delineate the presynaptic functions of actin severing proteins, bundling proteins, crosslinking proteins, and others during both baseline synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity. It is particularly intriguing that presynaptic boutons enlarge after long-term potentiation in a form of structural plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chéreau et al., 2017</xref>). We propose this new form of structural plasticity will be informed by the highly diverse nature of actin regulatory proteins enriched in presynaptic terminals, like that of the postsynapse. In support of this idea, actin remodeling was recently shown to be involved in a form of long-term depression at GABAergic terminals that is mediated by retrograde cannabinoid signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Monday et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Rac1 signaling in presynaptic terminals and implications for neurological diseases</title><p>Postsynaptic Rho GTPase signaling is clearly important for dendritic spine development, maintenance, and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Hedrick and Yasuda, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Tolias et al., 2011</xref>), but here we show that Rac1 is also abundant in presynaptic terminals, where it is involved in the essential processes of synaptic vesicle replenishment and short-term synaptic plasticity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study describing a role for any Rho GTPase at mature presynaptic terminals; others have shown their involvement during presynaptic development in axon pathfinding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Govek et al., 2005</xref>) and presynaptic unsilencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Shen et al., 2006</xref>). The immunogold labeling of Rac1 in adult mice, along with our functional analyses that depleted, manipulated, or imaged Rac1 only after synaptic maturation, strongly suggest that Rho GTPase signaling is important in the mature brain. However, we acknowledge there may be differences in aged animals not captured by our study, especially given that our functional analyses utilized in vitro systems.</p><p>We found that presynaptic Rac1 is transiently activated by calcium influx during HFS. However, the measurable time course of action potential-coupled Rac1 activation (on the order of minutes) is slower than the effects of Rac1 activity manipulation on short-term depression (on the order of seconds). Unfortunately, due to the small size of presynaptic terminals, our time resolution was limited to ten seconds per frame in order to capture enough photons for 2pFLIM. This resolution limit did not allow us to image Rac1 activity during the short HFS trains that cause short-term depression. Future work should build on these observations, perhaps testing whether presynaptic Rac1 also affects longer forms of plasticity such as augmentation, post-tetanic potentiation, or structural plasticity. Without technological improvements in 2pFLIM hardware or the development of much brighter activity sensors, we cannot test whether Rac1 is activated during short HFS trains to directly impact vesicle replenishment. Despite this limitation, our data are the first we know of to suggest that Rac1 is activated by action potentials in presynaptic terminals.</p><p>What is the upstream calcium sensor that couples action potentials with Rac1 activation? It is tempting to speculate the involvement of CaMKII, since CaMKII is present in presynaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ding et al., 2013</xref>) and interacts with L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abiria and Colbran, 2010</xref>), and we detected CaMKIIβ in the Synapsin iBioID proteome. Interestingly, the Rac1 GEF identified in our proteomics, Trio, is a likely CaMKII substrate important for plasticity at postsynaptic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Herring and Nicoll, 2016</xref>), and thus may also modulate Rac1 presynaptically. The conservation of Rac1 plasticity signaling at both the pre- and postsynapse is a surprising finding given the different mechanisms tuning efficacy between these sites. This highlights the concept that synaptic actin remodeling is a convergent mechanism for coupling activity to changes in the efficacy of neurotransmission regardless of synaptic locale.</p><p>Defects in Rho GTPases signaling pathways are also heavily implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Spence and Soderling, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib159">Yan et al., 2016</xref>), including missense mutations in <italic>Rac1</italic> that cause intellectual disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Lelieveld et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Reijnders et al., 2017</xref>) and an Arp2/3 mutation associated with schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Gulsuner et al., 2020</xref>). Studies investigating the neural basis for these cognitive impairments, including our own, have focused mainly on deficits in dendritic spine development and plasticity with only limited assessments of presynaptic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Soderling et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Tian et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Volk et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib166">Zoghbi and Bear, 2012</xref>). Our results compel a re-evaluation to include the potential presynaptic phenotypes in these diseases.</p><p>Together, this study sheds light on the previously uncharacterized and conserved regulation of presynaptic actin, and creates a new framework for understanding how presynaptic structure and strength may be altered during learning and disease. The Rac1-Arp2/3 pathway is a common regulator of plasticity at both sides of the synapse, and many other signaling pathways that are thought to be confined to postsynaptic sites may also be engaged presynaptically. The experimental strategies and resources that we developed here open numerous avenues of future research, and bring into focus the exquisite, complex signaling that occurs in presynaptic terminals.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>C57BL/6J</td><td>The Jackson Laboratory</td><td>Cat# 000664;

Candidate guides were not imaged further if there were no positive cells across three coverslips, or if the signal in positive cells was barely detectable above background fluorescence (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>Images of whole neurons were acquired using a 20x/0.75 NA multi-immersion objective, and all images of axons were acquired by z-series (0.13 μm intervals) using a 40x/1.3 NA oil-immersion objective. The sparse labeling of cells aided in the identification of axons, which were located as thin protrusions extending away from cell bodies for long distances with local swellings characteristic of presynaptic boutons. Maximum intensity projections from z-stacks along axons were analyzed in FIJI / ImageJ. Intensity for HA-V5-Myc (or GFP) and Synapsin1 was measured in both presynaptic terminals and the neighboring axonal shaft in small circular regions of interest (0.25 μm diameter). Presynaptic terminals were identified as bouton-like swellings that colocalized with Synapsin1. Presynaptic enrichment was calculated by dividing the background-subtracted intensity in presynaptic terminals by the background-subtracted intensity in the corresponding axon. Enrichment values were then normalized to the average presynaptic enrichment of GFP. Values for each axon were the average of at least three presynaptic terminals, and axons from at least five neurons per guide were analyzed. All images were analyzed blinded to the condition. All guides were tested across four independent cultures. For display purposes, Synapsin1 puncta within axons were obtained by masking Synapsin1 fluorescence with a thresholded image of axonal HA-V5-Myc (or GFP). This was then merged with the original HA-V5-Myc (or GFP) image.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Overrepresentation analysis for comparison of Arp2/3 and formin regulation</title><p>The enrichment of proteins involved in Arp2/3 or formin regulation in the Synapsin iBioID network was calculated using overrepresentation analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boyle et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Rivals et al., 2007</xref>) and hand-annotation based on literature review.

Coverslips were superfused with artificial CSF (aCSF) containing 124 mM NaCl, 26 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 10 mM dextrose, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 3 mM KCl, 1.3 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, and 1.25 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> (310 mOsm/L), continuously bubbled at room temperature with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. For voltage-clamp experiments, pipette intracellular solution contained 135 mM Cs-methanesulfonate, 8 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, 0.3 mM EGTA, 10 mM Na<sub>2</sub>phosphocreatine, 4 mM MgATP, 0.3 mM Na<sub>2</sub>GTP, 5 mM TEA-Cl, and 5 mM QX-314 (pH 7.3 with CsOH, 295 mOsm/L). Light-evoked EPSCs were recorded at −70 mV holding potentials in aCSF with 100 μM picrotoxin, 10 μM bicuculline methiodide, and 50 μM D-AP5. Light-evoked IPSCs were recorded at 0 mV holding potentials in aCSF with 50 μM D-AP5 and 20 μM CNQX. For strontium substitution experiments, 4 mM SrCl<sub>2</sub> replaced 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> in aCSF. For mEPSC, mIPSC, and hypertonic sucrose experiments, aCSF also contained 0.5 μM TTX.

Light-evoked action potentials were recorded at 0 pA holding currents in aCSF with synaptic block (20 μM CNQX, 50 μM D-AP5, 100 μM picrotoxin, and 10 μM bicuculline methiodide). No corrections were made for the 8.5–9.0 mV estimated liquid junction potentials of these solutions. All drugs were purchased from MilliporeSigma or Tocris.</p><p>Light was delivered through a 20x water-immersion objective using an LED light source (CoolLED pE-300ultra) with 460 nm and 525–660 m excitation peaks and corresponding filter sets, with the shutter controlled by TTL inputs. 1 ms pulses of 460 nm light were used to activate ChR2, while 3 ms pulses of 525–660 nm light were used to activate ChrimsonR. Light intensities were kept constant across all recordings (20% for EPSCs and 10% for IPSCs). For paired pulse and strontium substitution experiments, neurons were stimulated at no more than 0.1 Hz between trials. For electrical stimulation, a concentric bipolar electrode (CBAPC75; FHC) was placed ~150 μm from the soma of the patched neuron. Current injection (0.1 ms, 0.5–2.0mA) was applied with an ISO-Flex stimulus isolator (AMPI) controlled by Clampex 10 data acquisition software (Molecular Devices). Recordings were only continued if the light- or electrical-evoked current was ‘monosynaptic’, with single peaks of current with smooth decay to the baseline. Recordings were stopped and not analyzed if the evoked current appeared ‘polysynaptic’ with secondary peaks or contaminating network responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Maximov et al., 2007</xref>). For hypertonic sucrose experiments, a puffer pipette was filled with aCSF plus 500 mM sucrose, and the solution was applied with brief pressure pulses (10–15 s, 15 psi) using a Picospritzer II (Parker). Sucrose visibly washed over the entire area viewed under the 20x objective with 2x digital zoom, including virtually all presynaptic boutons contacting the patched neuron.</p><p>Series resistance was monitored throughout all voltage-clamp recordings with brief 5 mV hyperpolarizing pulses, and only recordings which remained stable over the period of data collection were analyzed. Data were recorded with a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices), digitized at 50 kHz with a Digidata 1550 (Molecular Devices), and low-pass filtered at 1 kHz. For PA-Rac1 experiments, recordings were conducted in the dark with monitors and other light sources covered by blue light filters (135 Deep Golden Amber; Lee). These coverslips were allowed to recover for 15 min in the dark after transferring them to the recording chamber, and between each recording.

Paired-pulse ratio (PPR) was calculated as the average of 6–10 trials conducted every 10 s. Quantal events from strontium substitution experiments were also manually detected in MiniAnalysis with a threshold of 5 pA. All events were counted in 500 ms (for qEPSCs) or 1 s (for qIPSCs) time windows after stimulation, with stimulation every 10 s for 5 min. mEPSCs and mIPSCs were also manually detected in MiniAnalysis with a threshold of 5 pA. For 20 Hz stimulation trains, a linear regression was performed on the final 10 data points on cumulative current curves, as specified by the ‘train method’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Stevens and Williams, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Thanawala and Regehr, 2016</xref>).

For hypertonic sucrose experiments, evoked responses were analyzed in MATLAB R2017a (MathWorks). RRP size was quantified using two different methods, as described in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Schotten et al., 2015</xref>). In the first method, the transient component of the response was integrated to an arbitrary point after the peak (5 s for EPSCs, 10 s for IPSCs). In the second method, the response was baselined to the steady-state current in order to correct for vesicle replenishment. Analysis of kinetics and basal current was done in Clampfit 10 (Molecular Devices). For current-clamp experiments, action potentials were counted if the peak was greater than 0 mV. Action potential waveforms were also analyzed using Clampfit 10.

All conditions were imaged over at least four independent slices.</p><p>To measure the fraction of donor bound to acceptor, we fit a fluorescence lifetime curve summing all pixels over a whole image with a double exponential function convolved with the Gaussian pulse response function:<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula>where <italic>τ<sub>AD</sub></italic> is the fluorescence lifetime of donor bound with acceptor, <italic>P<sub>D</sub></italic> and <italic>P<sub>AD</sub></italic> are the fraction of free donor and donor bound with acceptor, respectively, and <italic>H(t)</italic> is a fluorescence lifetime curve with a single exponential function convolved with the Gaussian pulse response function:<disp-formula id="equ3"><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mfrac><mml:mi>exp</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mtext>erfc</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msqrt><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msqrt><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula>in which <italic>τ<sub>D</sub></italic> is the fluorescence lifetime of the free donor, <italic>τ<sub>G</sub></italic> is the width of the Gaussian pulse response function, <italic>F<sub>0</sub></italic> is the peak fluorescence before convolution, <italic>t<sub>0</sub></italic> is the time offset, and erfc is the error function.</p><p>We fixed <italic>τ<sub>D</sub></italic> to the fluorescence lifetime obtained from free EGFP (2.6ns) and <italic>τ<sub>AD</sub></italic> to 1.1ns based on previous experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Hedrick et al., 2016</xref>).

Synapsin1 puncta within axons were obtained by masking their fluorescence with a thresholded image of axons expressing both mCherry-PBD2-mCherry and mEGFP-Rac1. Presynaptic boutons were manually marked as swellings along axons, and then Synapsin1 puncta were independently marked using the custom Puncta Analyzer plugin for ImageJ 1.29 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ippolito and Eroglu, 2010</xref>). Swellings containing at least one Synapsin1 puncta were counted as Synapsin+ boutons. Images were analyzed from axons in three different slices.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Statistics</title><p>For all graphs, center values represent mean, and error bars represent standard error of the mean (SEM). Details of exact sample sizes and statistical tests used can be found in figure legends. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes, but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Hedrick et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Spence et al., 2019</xref>). Statistical analysis was performed in Prism 8 (GraphPad) and MATLAB R2017a (MathWorks). We compared independent sample means using two-tailed t-tests, one-way ANOVAs, two-way ANOVAs, and repeated measures ANOVAs as appropriate. ANOVAs were followed by Tukey’s, Dunnett’s, or Sidak’s multiple comparisons tests. When required, hypergeometric tests and t-tests were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the FDR method. We confirmed necessary parametric test assumptions using the Shapiro-Wilk test (normality). Violations in test assumption were corrected by transformations when possible; otherwise, the equivalent non-parametric tests were applied instead. Type-1 error rates for all tests were set at 0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. George Augustine for generously providing the GFP-Synapsin1a construct and Tünde Magyar for excellent EM specimen preparation.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Noa Lipstein (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>All three reviewers agree that Dube et al. present a very elegant and substantial paper on the presynaptic function of actin regulators, and that the effects of perturbing Rac1 and ArpC3 on short-term plasticity are very interesting. On the other hand, all three reviewers have raised issues that need to be resolved before the paper can be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Probably most critical in this regard is the fact that the experimental design, albeit elegant, poses shortcomings, so that the conclusion that RhoGTPase signaling indeed controls vesicle recruitment appears insufficiently supported at this point. Below is a summary of the reviewers' comments that need to be addressed.</p><p>Experiments Required</p><p>1. The protocol of optogenetic activation to assess the SV pool size during trains of 20 Hz is problematic as a 20 Hz stimulation for 2 s is probably insufficient to reach a state that is close to SV pool depletion, resulting in an inaccurate quantification of the readily-releasable SV pool. In the absence of an accurate RRP measurement, the conclusion that the SV replenishment rate is a target of Rac1 signaling could be false. At this point, possible effects on endocytosis and calcium dynamics cannot be ruled out. Even the acute and bidirectional changes in SSD (Figure 6) could in principle still be explained by changes in calcium current dynamics during the train or enhanced rates of endocytotic release site clearance. In essence, a more solid quantification of the SV pool is required. It is ackowledged that the use of rather straight forward methods to do this (i.e. hyperosmotic shock) will not work easily in the present setting, and higher-frequency stimulation (40-100 Hz) will also be difficult with the optogenetic approach. Paired recordings might be a way out, or the use of conditions with higher extracellular calcium to facilitate SV pool depletion by increasing release probability. If this is impossible, a much more careful conclusion is warranted.</p><p>2. A second possibly problematic issue related to the RRP measurements concerns the EPSC recordings. The waveform of the EPSCs in repsonse to individual stimulation shows very slow decay, and it is questionable that the authors are indeed monitoring synchronized release events to each optical stimulation. This makes the interpretation of EPSCs in response to repetitive stimulation difficult, where one expects recurrent events to be superimposed, which may or may not involve KO neurons. Decay tau plotted in Figure 4 – Supplement 1 indicates about 15 msec, which is some 3 times of what is expected, and moreover, the traces shown in Figure 4C suggest the presence of a shoulder on the EPSC waveform. Given that the EPSC measurements may be contaminated by recurrent events, estimations of RRP size based on repetitive stimulation are questionable (see point 1 above).</p><p>Changes to Data Presentation and Analysis Required</p><p>3. Viewing the text on p.8 (lines 21-22) and Figures 2P and 2N, it is not clear that Wipf3 and Tagln3 are truly accumulating at presynaptic terminals, especially in the case of Wipf3, where the arrows point to what appear to be somewhat abnormal large blobs. Strangely, in this regard, the diffusible marker GFP also shows some hotspots that coincide with synapsin labelling.</p><p>4. Several aspects regarding the EM analysis need to be clarified. First, multiple large overview images (showing all relevant cellular sub-compartments) are needed for the documentation of the immunogold labeling experiments – to allow a proper assessment of how specific the (pre)synaptic labeling for Rac1 and ArpC2 really is. Second, it seems from Figure 3C that Rac1 signals are also present on mitochondria. It should be clarified how the distribution of Rac1 found on mitochondria compares to the synaptic vesicle labeling. Third, it is unclear how the % localization of Rac1 to presynaptic terminals was quantified – e.g. whether the number of gold particles was corrected with respect to the area of each compartment represented in individual sections analyzed. Finally, the age of the animals used for the EM study should be provided.</p><p>5. As regards the experiments to assess the effects of Rac1 and ArpC3 on synaptic transmission, it should be stated for a given recording, in general how many presynaptic WT or KO neurons formed synaptic inputs to the target neuron, and how many of the presynaptic neurons were likely activated by the optical stimulation.</p><p>Text Changes and Additions Required</p><p>6. The introduction opens with a discussion of calcium sensors that neurons likely use to purposively control short-term synaptic plasticity, but then only mentions Syt7 and states, effectively, that not much else is known. This inappropriately neglects the quite substantial literature on other relevant (calcium) sensors that are well known to control short-term plasticity, such as Munc13s. The corresponding part of the introduction should be extended.</p><p>7. The proteomic analysis targeted animals from day 21-27 in the juvenile stage, and perhaps, the state of maturity may be consistent with the age of hippocampal cultures used for functional analysis. Without data on adult brain, it still remains possible that the relative contribution of Rho GTPase signaling in presynaptic terminals in the mature brain may differ from the present findings. This should be discussed</p><p>8. The requirement in the present setting for unusual ways to measure minis triggered only by the defined presynaptic mutant neurons is acknowledged. However, the following issues arise: It is unclear how mini rates compare with vs. without strontium, and how sure one can be that the measured minis only originate from release by the mutant presynaptic cell. Related to this, it is not clear at this point that strontium-induced asynchronous release and minis measured in the absence of any stimulation and in the presence of TTX are the same thing. Some words of caution – or a more detailed argumentation – are required here.</p><p>9. The measurable time course of AP-coupled Rac1 activation (Figure 7) is slower than the effects of Rac1 activity manipulation on short-term depression. Therefore, it is not clear such changes in actual Rac1 activity can directly impact vesicle turnover and recruitment. This should be discussed.</p><p>10. The essence of the relevant part of the discussion is that actin regulation by Rac1 and the Arp2/3 complex is purposively used by neurons to inhibit vesicle replenishment and thus shape synaptic depression. While one can envision scenarios in which this might make sense, it is a bit counterintuitive. An alternative scenario would be that the effect of Rac1 activation during stimulation has a completely unrelated purpose, even in another subcellular compartment, and the consequences on presynaptic short-term plasticity are a mere 'side effect'. This should be discussed – plus alternative targets of Rac1 and the Arp2/3 complex should be discussed.</p><p>11. Related to the point above, the KO of Rac1 is expected to cause pleiotropic changes beyond presynaptic short-term plasticity, as well as compensatory changes. As these could affect neurons in more general terms, information on neuronal development, differentiation, and viability should be provided.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Action potential-coupled Rho GTPase signaling drives presynaptic plasticity&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been reviewed by three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved substantially, but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Data Analysis and Presentation</p><p>1. Although it is helpful that now a larger field of view is included, the quantification of EM data still requires amendments. First, the number of particles present in each bouton is rather small. The actual number of particles in each bin needs to be specified. Without stating the scale of the particle numbers involved, data normalization and the use of fine bins are questionable – some bins may not even contain a particle. Second, the process of normalization of the distance from the cleft relative to the axodendritic diameter is not fully justified (Figure 3G,H). The bouton profiles obtained from single sections are highly heterogeneous, with some profiles showing large spaces that are irregularly occupied by mitochondria. Such variations make the interpretation of normalized distances difficult. A comparison using the actual distances should be performed. Finally, the conclusion that ArpC2 is preferentially localized to the presynaptic membrane beyond the synaptic vesicle cluster may be an artefact of normalization of the particle number and the distance from the cleft, especially when comparing panels E and F. It seems that the comparison may be based on a very small number of gold particles. This aspect needs to be addressed and/or discussed.</p><p>2. To preserve the high quality of the manuscript, the sucrose-evoked responses should be moved to the supplementary material, or better even, removed completely. Sucrose application in mass culture preparations results in highly inaccurate readouts. Also, quantifying the sucrose-evoked current over 5 s in excitatory neurons and over 10 s in inhibitory neurons makes little sense. In essence, the choice to use sucrose stimulation remains unclear, and the lack of compatibility with the experimental settings used here had been highlighted before by the reviewers.</p><p>Data Interpretation and Discussion</p><p>3. Considering that the authors state that they agree with most of the reviewers' comments regarding the limitations of the optogenetic approach, and given that the authors acknowledge other roles of actin at the presynapse (i.e. in endocytosis), but do not test these directly, it is necessary that the final version of the manuscript provides a still more careful interpretation of the data. This mainly concerns two main conclusions: (1) The sequential relationship of the Rac1 and Arpc3 function, and (2) the notion that the described effects on short term plasticity are mediated solely by an altered SV replenishment phenotype. See below for some related details:</p><p>a. Lines 277-278: The degree of accuracy of the RRP size measurement in this instance is debatable. The statement should be toned down.</p><p>b. P. 14, top paragraph: It is still possible that the increases in release probability and vesicle replenishment rate in Arpc3 KO cells is due to the increased AP width, and hence it is not clear from the dataset that Rac1 and Arpc3 function as part of the same signalling pathway to mediate vesicle replenishment.</p><p>c. Lines 321-325: The authors interpret their Rac1 data to strongly suggest that the effect of Arp2/3 on AP width and Pr is separable from an effect on SV recruitment. However, increases in AP width result in prolonged calcium influx. Since synaptic vesicle replenishment is regulated by residual calcium, the authors' argument seems flawed. Of note, this issue is also relevant when interpreting data obtained using optogenetic stimulation, which result in EPSCs with prolonged decay-time. As the authors mention in their reply letter, this is likely due to the slow nature of the photocurrents. But presynaptically, this slow photocurrent is not only resulting in prolonged SV release, but also in prolonged calcium influx, which will modulate SV replenishment dynamics. Commenting on this in the discussion of the corresponding data is required.</p><p>d. Line 467 (and also paragraph starting at line 505). &quot;Since presynaptic Rac1 requires Arp2/3 to alter synaptic vesicle replenishment rate.…&quot; The authors have provided occlusion data showing that Rac1 and Arp2/3 are likely to operate in the same pathway. However, the vesicle replenishment may have already reached the upper limit from the loss of Arp2/3 alone, such that upon impairing Rac1 there may not be additional vesicles whose replenishment could be sped up. Therefore, whether Rac1 actually requires Arp2/3 to mediate its effect on vesicle replenishment remains to be established. The corresponding text should be toned down accordingly.</p><p>e. Lines 470-483: In this paragraph, discussing the possible mechanisms by which Rac1-Arp2/3 affect SV replenishment, possible effects on calcium dynamics should be included. In essence, alterations in calcium influx, recruitment of calcium channels, or coupling distances between SVs and calcium channels could also result in similar STP changes – but were not tested here.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63756.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Experiments Required</p><p>1.

If this is impossible, a much more careful conclusion is warranted.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this important point. The protocol of 20Hz for 2s was chosen based on prior literature that showed that at cultured hippocampal synapses, stimulation at 20Hz for 1-2s is sufficient to deplete the RRP (Murthy and Stevens, 1998; Otsu et al., 2004; Rosenmund and Stevens, 1996; Schikorski and Stevens, 2001; Stevens and Williams, 2007). Furthermore, ChR2 itself is thought to increase release probability (Zhang and Oertner, 2007), so its use here may already be accelerating SV depletion. As suggested by the reviewers, we optically stimulated cultures sparsely expressing ChR2 at 20Hz in both 2mM and 4mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Figure 4—figure supplement 3A-B). As expected, initial release probability was increased in 4mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but this was balanced by smaller responses at the end of the train such that the cumulative release in both conditions was equal. This confirms that the RRP was sufficiently depleted by 20Hz optical stimulation for 2s in 2mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>. This was also true at inhibitory synapses (Figure 4—figure supplement 3C). Finally, an extracellular bipolar electrode was used to electrically stimulate the same cultures in the same conditions, and measurements taken with optical and electrical stimulation were very similar (Figure 4—figure supplement 3D-E).</p><p>The above data strongly support the prior literature that measurements with 20Hz stimulation trains can accurately estimate the RRP. However, based on this critique, we also created a new tool to inhibit Rac1 specifically at presynaptic terminals, which enabled us to assess synaptic transmission using more traditional methods. W56, a Rac1 inhibitory peptide (Gao et al., 2001; Hedrick et al., 2016), was fused to Synapsin1a and delivered to the entire culture by AAV (Figure 6A-B). Presynaptic Rac1 inhibition did not alter baseline synaptic transmission, as measured by electrical stimulation and minis recorded in TTX (Figure 6C-D, Figure 6—figure supplement 1A-B). High frequency stimulation at both 20Hz and 40Hz showed an increase in SV replenishment rate without altering RRP size (Figure 6E). We also used hyperosmotic shock with 500mM sucrose as an alternative measure of the RRP and found no difference in RRP size (Figure 6F), in agreement with the previous results. As before, these phenotypes were conserved across excitatory and inhibitory synapses (Figure 6G-J, Figure 6—figure supplement 1C-D). We believe these experiments address the reviewers’ concerns about the fidelity of the RRP measurements, and thus the accuracy of the conclusion that Rac1 affects SV replenishment rate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. A second possibly problematic issue related to the RRP measurements concerns the EPSC recordings. The waveform of the EPSCs in repsonse to individual stimulation shows very slow decay, and it is questionable that the authors are indeed monitoring synchronized release events to each optical stimulation. This makes the interpretation of EPSCs in response to repetitive stimulation difficult, where one expects recurrent events to be superimposed, which may or may not involve KO neurons. Decay tau plotted in Figure 4 – Supplement 1 indicates about 15 msec, which is some 3 times of what is expected, and moreover, the traces shown in Figure 4C suggest the presence of a shoulder on the EPSC waveform. Given that the EPSC measurements may be contaminated by recurrent events, estimations of RRP size based on repetitive stimulation are questionable (see point 1 above).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, and originally we spent a lot of time optimizing the sparse seeding of ChR2 neurons as well as the intensity and length of optical stimulation to minimize contamination by recurrent events. After optimization, most neurons displayed an evoked current that appeared “monosynaptic” with a single peak that smoothly decayed to the baseline; these were the only recordings that were included in our analysis. Although infrequent, we immediately discontinued recordings from neurons with currents that appeared to be “polysynaptic” with secondary peaks or contaminating network responses (Maximov et al., 2007). We plotted all the single EPSCs analyzed for the presynaptic Rac1 KO experiments, along with examples of rejected “polysynaptic” recordings (Figure 4—figure supplement 2A-B).</p><p>Regarding Figure 4C- we had originally plotted an individual trial from a paired pulse experiment, which had some spontaneous events also occurring. This has now been replaced with the average of all 10 trials from that neuron.</p><p>The decay time constants for optically-evoked EPSCs were consistently ~14ms. Interestingly, decay time constants for electrically-evoked EPSCs were ~4.5ms (Figure 6—figure supplement 1A), which is in line with the expected value. There are very few studies directly comparing synaptic currents evoked by optogenetic and electrical stimulation, and none that report decay kinetics (Jackman et al., 2014), so we can only hypothesize why this may be the case. It is known that the ChR2 photocurrent itself has slow decay kinetics (Zhang and Oertner, 2007), and the H134R variant we used here is even slower (Lin, 2011). It is possible that this leads to the observed increase in decay time constants for optically-evoked EPSCs. Nevertheless, this did not appear to significantly impact the measurements made during high frequency stimulation trains, as shown by the previously described experiments comparing optical and electrical stimulation in 2mM vs 4mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Figure 4—figure supplement 3).</p><p>Thus, we do not believe the optogenetic EPSC recordings with presynaptic Rac1 KO were contaminated by recurrent events. The new electrical EPSC recordings with presynaptic Rac1 inhibition, which show expected decay constants, corroborate the results from the optogenetic experiments that Rac1 regulates SV replenishment rate. Importantly, we also point out that the IPSCs in both of these experiments are very unlikely to have recurrent events due to their inhibitory nature, and they also support the same conclusions about the presynaptic role of Rac1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Changes to Data Presentation and Analysis Required</p><p>3. Viewing the text on p.8 (lines 21-22) and Figures 2P and 2N, it is not clear that Wipf3 and Tagln3 are truly accumulating at presynaptic terminals, especially in the case of Wipf3, where the arrows point to what appear to be somewhat abnormal large blobs.

It is expected that GFP, as a cell fill, will appear brighter in presynaptic terminals due to the increased volume of this compartment compared to the axon shaft (Gitler et al., 2004). This is why we normalized the measurements in Figure 2B to the GFP bouton/axon intensity. Before normalization, we measured GFP intensity as 2 times higher in presynaptic terminals than axons, with the intensity of the labeled proteins being 4 to 6 times higher in presynaptic terminals than axons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Third, it is unclear how the % localization of Rac1 to presynaptic terminals was quantified – e.g. whether the number of gold particles was corrected with respect to the area of each compartment represented in individual sections analyzed. Finally, the age of the animals used for the EM study should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize if our descriptions of the EM analysis were incomplete or unclear. In response to this concern, multiple large overview images for both Rac1 and ArpC2 immunogold labeling (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,C) have been added. Second, yes – it is correct there was occasional Rac1 labeling on presynaptic mitochondria. This has now been quantified, showing 6.3% of presynaptic Rac1 gold particles were on mitochondrial membranes, with 49.6% adjacent to synaptic vesicles and 44.1% juxtaposed to plasma membranes (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B). Third, to quantify that 70.3% of Rac1 gold particles were in presynaptic terminals, we divided the number of presynaptic Rac1 gold particles by the total number of synaptic Rac1 gold particles and multiplied by 100. There was no normalization based on area and this has now been added to the Materials and methods. The “axo-dendritic” positions of all synaptic particles were plotted in Figure 3E to give the reader a sense of the relative distances. Finally, the EM analysis used brains from young adult mice (5-6 months old). This information is now added to the text, corresponding figure legend, and the Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. As regards the experiments to assess the effects of Rac1 and ArpC3 on synaptic transmission, it should be stated for a given recording, in general how many presynaptic WT or KO neurons formed synaptic inputs to the target neuron, and how many of the presynaptic neurons were likely activated by the optical stimulation.</p></disp-quote><p>The number of presynaptic WT or KO neurons that form synapses with a target neuron in culture is very difficult to quantify; however, we have combined estimates from the literature and new experimental data to address this question. To begin this analysis, we first calculated the upper bound of input neurons as the total number of WT or KO neurons that could be activated as presynaptic input on an entire coverslip. We had fixed and stained several coverslips from the original cultures that we recorded from, so from these the total number of ChR2+ or ChrimsonR+ neurons were counted (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-B). Thus, a given target neuron may have a maximum number of inputs from up to ~140 presynaptic WT or KO neurons. However, this is undoubtedly an overestimation, because these 140 neurons are almost certainly not connected to every other neuron on the coverslip.</p><p>To estimate how many of the labeled 140 neurons likely form synaptic connections with a target neuron, we started with estimates that ~30% of neurons in hippocampal cultures are GABAergic (Ivenshitz and Segal, 2010; Soriano et al., 2008). Thus, these 140 neurons likely represent 98 excitatory neurons and 42 inhibitory neurons. Then, we multiplied by rough estimates of connection probabilities in cultured neurons: 10% for excitatory neurons and 20% for inhibitory neurons (Amendola et al., 2015; Barral and Reyes, 2016; Gerkin et al., 2013; Ivenshitz and Segal, 2010; Papa et al., 1995; Shimazaki et al., 2015). Thus, ~10 WT or KO excitatory neurons and ~8 WT or KO inhibitory neurons likely form synaptic inputs onto a given target neuron.</p><p>To determine how many of these were likely activated, we measured the reach of the optical stimulation using the photoconvertible calcium integrator CaMPARI2 (Moeyaert et al., 2018). We cultured hippocampal neurons and then delivered ChR2 and CaMPARI2 to most neurons by AAV (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C). Then, under synaptic block, we optically stimulated ChR2 neurons in the center of the coverslip with concurrent delivery of 405nm light to mark activated neurons. We found that our optical stimulation was able to reach the entire coverslip (Figure 4—figure supplement 1D). Thus, ~10 WT or KO excitatory neurons and ~8 WT or KO inhibitory neurons likely form synaptic inputs onto a given target neuron, and all of these are likely activated by the optical stimulation (Figure 4—figure supplement 1F-G).</p><p>Finally, we also used a similar strategy to estimate the number of presynaptic inputs activated by electrical stimulation. We found that electrical stimulation reached ~180 neurons within a ~700um radius and likely activated ~13 presynaptic excitatory neurons or ~11 presynaptic inhibitory neurons (Figure 4—figure supplement 1E-G). Please note that these are slightly more neurons than those estimated for ChR2 experiments, even though the radius of activation is smaller. This is because of the very sparse seeding of ChR2 neurons. In conclusion, the ChR2 stimulation and the electrical stimulation (which is the more traditionally used method) likely activate a similar number of presynaptic input neurons to the target neuron. This information is now added to the Results and the Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Text Changes and Additions Required</p><p>6. The introduction opens with a discussion of calcium sensors that neurons likely use to purposively control short-term synaptic plasticity, but then only mentions Syt7 and states, effectively, that not much else is known. This inappropriately neglects the quite substantial literature on other relevant (calcium) sensors that are well known to control short-term plasticity, such as Munc13s. The corresponding part of the introduction should be extended.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this oversight. We have expanded the Introduction with references to Doc2, PKC, Munc13s, and a review article discussing these in more detail.</p><p>The corresponding section now reads as: “…Recent work has clarified some of the calcium sensors important for short-term enhancement, such as Synaptotagmin-7 during facilitation (Jackman and Regehr, 2017; Jackman et al., 2016) and Doc2 during augmentation (Xue et al., 2018), yet the signaling molecules that sense action potentials to translate other forms of short-term plasticity are still poorly understood (de Jong and Fioravante, 2014; Wang et al., 2016). For example, reduction of release during short-term depression (STD) is generally thought to reflect the depletion of the readily releasable pool (RRP) of synaptic vesicles. This depletion is counterbalanced by a calcium-dependent acceleration of RRP refilling that depends on the Munc13 family of calcium sensors (Chen et al., 2013; Junge et al., 2004; Lipstein et al., 2013; Lipstein et al., 2012; Rosenmund et al., 2002). However, at many synapses, vesicle depletion cannot fully account for the extent of depression (Bellingham and Walmsley, 1999; Byrne, 1982; Chen et al., 2004; Garcia-Perez et al., 2008; Hsu et al., 1996; Kraushaar and Jonas, 2000; Parker, 1995; Sullivan, 2007; Thomson and Bannister, 1999; Waldeck et al., 2000; Xu and Wu, 2005; Zucker and Bruner, 1977), suggesting the presence of additional unknown activity-dependent signaling mechanisms that actively drive, rather than counteract, STD.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The proteomic analysis targeted animals from day 21-27 in the juvenile stage, and perhaps, the state of maturity may be consistent with the age of hippocampal cultures used for functional analysis. Without data on adult brain, it still remains possible that the relative contribution of Rho GTPase signaling in presynaptic terminals in the mature brain may differ from the present findings. This should be discussed</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ comment and summarize the different experiments. For the proteomic analysis, daily biotin injections were given from P21-27, with harvesting of brain tissue on P28, a time point when the majority of synapses are believed to have already formed and matured (Fiala et al., 1998; Lohmann and Kessels, 2014). Furthermore, we have previously shown that iBioID biotinylation most rapidly accumulates in the last days of biotin injections (Uezu et al., 2016). We thus believe that our proteomics data is enriched with proteins at mature presynaptic terminals. This notion is corroborated by the 4 supporting experimental conditions: (1) In the CRISPR validation screen in Figure 2, cultured hippocampal neurons from postnatal pups were stained at DIV12-14. In these cultures, synapse formation and maturation is considered complete by DIV12 (Basarsky et al., 1994; Beaudoin et al., 2012; Moutaux et al., 2018). (2) The electron microscopy in Figure 3 shows Rac1 is abundantly expressed in presynaptic terminals in the brains of adult mice (5-6 months old) and is strongly associated with synaptic vesicles, in agreement with the proteomic data from earlier time points. (3) The functional analysis was done in hippocampal cultures at DIV16-18, which represents a functionally mature culture. In the new experiments in Figure 6 with presynaptic Rac1 inhibition, the inhibitory peptide was not added until DIV12 (after synaptic maturation), which further supports that Rac1 affects mature presynaptic terminals. (4) The experiments in Figure 9 with imaging of the Rac1 activity sensor were done in organotypic hippocampal slices at DIV17-24. This also corresponds to a late, mature stage in these slices (Muller et al., 1993).</p><p>Thus, the preponderance of evidence indicates that Rac1 and RhoGTPase signaling are relevant and active in mature presynaptic terminals. However, we acknowledge there may be differences in aged animals not captured by our study, especially given that our functional analyses utilized in vitro systems, so we have stated this potential limitation in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The requirement in the present setting for unusual ways to measure minis triggered only by the defined presynaptic mutant neurons is acknowledged. However, the following issues arise: It is unclear how mini rates compare with vs. without strontium, and how sure one can be that the measured minis only originate from release by the mutant presynaptic cell. Related to this, it is not clear at this point that strontium-induced asynchronous release and minis measured in the absence of any stimulation and in the presence of TTX are the same thing. Some words of caution – or a more detailed argumentation – are required here.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, despite these limitations, strontium-induced asynchronous release was the best way to measure quantal release from the defined presynaptic WT or KO neurons. This method has been commonly used in other contexts to estimate quantal parameters from specific cell types and circuits (Beeson et al., 2020; Bekkers and Clements, 1999; Ding et al., 2008; Gil et al., 1999; Goda and Stevens, 1994; Hull et al., 2009; Wan et al., 2014; Xu-Friedman and Regehr, 2000; Zhang et al., 2015).</p><p>We have added some words of caution to the relevant Results section in the manuscript, stating “We could not use the more traditional method of recording miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), due to the need to measure quantal events from only the defined presynaptic WT or KO neurons. Although strontium-evoked quantal events are not equivalent to mEPSCs, they have been commonly used in other contexts to estimate quantal parameters from specific cell types and circuits… We do note the possibility that some of the measured events might be background spontaneous activity from other WT neurons, rather than all being from presynaptic mutant neurons.”</p><p>We also note that our new development of the presynaptic Rac1 inhibitory peptide enabled us to directly measure mEPSCs and mIPSCs in the presence of TTX, and we found no effect of presynaptic Rac1 inhibition on mini amplitude or frequency (Figure 6D,H). This is in agreement with the strontium data, which is now also emphasized.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. The measurable time course of AP-coupled Rac1 activation (Figure 7) is slower than the effects of Rac1 activity manipulation on short-term depression. Therefore, it is not clear such changes in actual Rac1 activity can directly impact vesicle turnover and recruitment. This should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the measurable time course of AP-coupled Rac1 activation in Figure 9 (on the order of minutes) is slower than the effects of Rac1 activity manipulation on short-term depression (on the order of seconds). Unfortunately, due to the small size of presynaptic terminals, our time resolution was limited to 10s per frame in order to capture enough photons for 2pFLIM. This resolution limit did not allow us to image Rac1 activity during the short stimulation trains that cause short-term depression. We could only ask whether presynaptic Rac1 <italic>could</italic> be regulated by activity. The fact that Rac1 is activated by action potentials at all supports a role for Rac1 in presynaptic plasticity. Future work should build on this observation, perhaps testing whether Rac1 also affects longer forms of plasticity such as augmentation, PTP, or presynaptic structural plasticity. As far as whether Rac1 is really activated during short AP trains to directly impact vesicle replenishment, we cannot answer this question without technological improvements in 2pFLIM hardware or the development of much brighter activity sensors. We have added these points to the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. The essence of the relevant part of the discussion is that actin regulation by Rac1 and the Arp2/3 complex is purposively used by neurons to inhibit vesicle replenishment and thus shape synaptic depression. While one can envision scenarios in which this might make sense, it is a bit counterintuitive. An alternative scenario would be that the effect of Rac1 activation during stimulation has a completely unrelated purpose, even in another subcellular compartment, and the consequences on presynaptic short-term plasticity are a mere 'side effect'. This should be discussed – plus alternative targets of Rac1 and the Arp2/3 complex should be discussed.</p><p>11. Related to the point above, the KO of Rac1 is expected to cause pleiotropic changes beyond presynaptic short-term plasticity, as well as compensatory changes. As these could affect neurons in more general terms, information on neuronal development, differentiation, and viability should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that genetic KOs in general suffer from these limitations, which is why acute alteration of Rac1 signaling with photoactivatable Rac1 mutants was also used (Figure 8). Given the importance of actin remodeling in neuronal development and synapse maturation, the experimental conditions were optimized to limit developmental effects in the cultures by waiting as long as possible to add AAV-hSyn-Cre (DIV10, since we noted that Cre takes ~24 hours to begin expressing, and then ~72 hours for full turnover of endogenous Rac1 or ArpC3). This would lead to full loss of these proteins in neurons only after synaptic maturation has completed. We did not observe any effect of KO at this time point on neuronal viability (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B) or synapse density (Figure 5—figure supplement 2). In the new experiments with presynaptic Rac1 inhibition, the inhibitor peptide was not added until even later, DIV12, and this had very similar effects to the KO of Rac1 and the transient Rac1 inhibition by light. Thus, the three different approaches to alter Rac1 activity (KO, transient light-gated manipulation, and spatially restricted inhibition) all reach the same conclusion of Rac1’s function in presynaptic terminals and strongly support the effects are not due to pleiotropic or compensatory changes on neuronal health.</p><p>References:</p><p>Amendola, J., Boumedine, N., Sangiardi, M., and El Far, O.

Although it is helpful that now a larger field of view is included, the quantification of EM data still requires amendments. First, the number of particles present in each bouton is rather small. The actual number of particles in each bin needs to be specified. Without stating the scale of the particle numbers involved, data normalization and the use of fine bins are questionable – some bins may not even contain a particle.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the reviewer’s concerns we have collected and added more data, and modified our graphs so that the ordinate ‘percent in bins’ were replaced with ‘number of particles per bin’ (Figure 3E-F, Figure 3—figure supplement 1E). We adjusted the figure legends accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, the process of normalization of the distance from the cleft relative to the axodendritic diameter is not fully justified (Figure 3G,H). The bouton profiles obtained from single sections are highly heterogeneous, with some profiles showing large spaces that are irregularly occupied by mitochondria. Such variations make the interpretation of normalized distances difficult. A comparison using the actual distances should be performed. Finally, the conclusion that ArpC2 is preferentially localized to the presynaptic membrane beyond the synaptic vesicle cluster may be an artefact of normalization of the particle number and the distance from the cleft, especially when comparing panels E and F. It seems that the comparison may be based on a very small number of gold particles. This aspect needs to be addressed and/or discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that our immunogold analysis provides a good qualitative estimate of protein organization in terminals, but that it is likely to underestimate the true extent of ArpC2 and Rac1 compartmentalization. To address the concern regarding the normalization process, we modified Figure 3 so that it shows only the ‘raw’ positions of immunogold particles coding for Rac1, ArpC2 and synaptic vesicles, regardless of the size of the pre- and post-synaptic profiles. We also calculated the mean distance ± SD of presynaptic particles from the synaptic cleft and added this to the text. Rac1 is 176 ± 155 nm and synaptic vesicles are 172 ± 108 nm, while ArpC2 is 298 ± 159 nm and synaptic vesicles are 173 ± 129 nm. Thus, presynaptic Rac1 is positioned similarly to synaptic vesicles, while ArpC2 is further away on average, supporting the original conclusion. Nevertheless, we thank reviewer for the suggestion of including more data. In doing so, we can conclude that despite the ‘spaces irregularly occupied by mitochondria’ in terminals, ArpC2 has a distribution both among and beyond the synaptic vesicles, partially overlapping with Rac1, but also away from the active zone.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. To preserve the high quality of the manuscript, the sucrose-evoked responses should be moved to the supplementary material, or better even, removed completely. Sucrose application in mass culture preparations results in highly inaccurate readouts. Also, quantifying the sucrose-evoked current over 5 s in excitatory neurons and over 10 s in inhibitory neurons makes little sense. In essence, the choice to use sucrose stimulation remains unclear, and the lack of compatibility with the experimental settings used here had been highlighted before by the reviewers.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the positive comment on the quality of the manuscript. We did the sucrose experiments in response to the prior reviews, as they necessitated a more solid quantification of the RRP. The prior review mentioned that while hyperosmotic shock would be the most straightforward approach, it would not work with the experimental settings of that version of the manuscript (with only a small fraction of the neurons being WT or KO). In our first revision, we thus modified the experimental conditions with all neurons expressing the presynaptic Rac1 inhibitory peptide (W56-Synapsin). With these new conditions, we were able to use electrical and sucrose stimulation to more solidly quantify the RRP.</p><p>Every experimental paradigm has caveats; it is the responsibility of the electrophysiologist to use orthogonal approaches and draw conclusions based on preponderance of evidence. Sucrose stimulation is an orthogonal approach to the RRP estimate from high-frequency stimulation trains. We acknowledge that the cleanest use of sucrose stimulation is in autaptic cultures, but we wished to keep our experimental conditions constant. Many well-respected presynaptic physiologists have published estimates of the RRP from sucrose application in mass cultures, including the labs of Thomas Südhof (Kaeser et al., 2012; Patzke et al., 2019), Pascal Kaeser (Held et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016), and Edwin Chapman (Courtney et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2014; Xue et al., 2018). There is also some evidence that sucrose responses and other measurements of synaptic transmission are more physiologically relevant in mass cultures than at autapses (Liu et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2009).</p><p>As for the quantification of the current for 5s in excitatory neurons and 10s in inhibitory neurons, we integrated the transient component of the sucrose response in each case (inhibitory responses took longer to reach steady-state level). These values are similar to those published in the literature for both excitatory and inhibitory sucrose responses (Held et al., 2016; Kaeser et al., 2012; Xue et al., 2008). However, in response to this concern, we also quantified sucrose responses by baselining to the steady-state current at the end of the response in order to correct for vesicle replenishment (Arancillo et al., 2013; Schotten et al., 2015). This steady-state corrected charge transfer was similar to the transient charge transfer (Figure 6—figure supplement 1C,F).</p><p>Because these data fully agree with the optical and electrical stimulation results, and because it was requested in the prior review, we believe it is informative and important to keep the sucrose responses in the paper. We have removed them from Figure 6, however, and have put them in the supplementary material (Figure 6—figure supplement 1C,F). We have also added some words of caution to the manuscript in the corresponding Results section: “Estimating the RRP size with hypertonic sucrose has many caveats, especially in mass cultures (Bekkers, 2020; Kaeser and Regehr, 2017). However, it is an orthogonal approach to the optogenetic and electrical stimulation, and the results are all in agreement.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Data Interpretation and Discussion</p><p>3. Considering that the authors state that they agree with most of the reviewers' comments regarding the limitations of the optogenetic approach, and given that the authors acknowledge other roles of actin at the presynapse (i.e. in endocytosis), but do not test these directly, it is necessary that the final version of the manuscript provides a still more careful interpretation of the data. This mainly concerns two main conclusions: (1) The sequential relationship of the Rac1 and Arpc3 function, and (2) the notion that the described effects on short term plasticity are mediated solely by an altered SV replenishment phenotype. See below for some related details:</p><p>a. Lines 277-278: The degree of accuracy of the RRP size measurement in this instance is debatable. The statement should be toned down.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited the sentence to read: “Thus, in this system, 20Hz light stimulation for 2s in 2mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> is sufficient to exhaust the RRP and estimate its size.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. P. 14, top paragraph: It is still possible that the increases in release probability and vesicle replenishment rate in Arpc3 KO cells is due to the increased AP width, and hence it is not clear from the dataset that Rac1 and Arpc3 function as part of the same signalling pathway to mediate vesicle replenishment.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the sentence in this paragraph that linked Rac1 and Arp2/3 as part of the same signaling pathway. The relevant section now reads: “…it is possible that the effect of <italic>Arpc3</italic> deletion on synaptic vesicle replenishment, as seen through increased current amplitudes at the end of the 20Hz train, was actually caused by an increased action potential width or increased release probability during each stimulation. The expected prolonged calcium influx may have raised residual calcium levels, which is known to accelerate synaptic vesicle replenishment (Dittman and Regehr, 1998; Junge et al., 2004; Lipstein et al., 2013; Sakaba and Neher, 2001; Stevens and Wesseling, 1998; Wang and Kaczmarek, 1998). Thus, this set of experiments cannot distinguish whether or not Rac1 and Arp2/3 function in the same pathway to negatively regulate synaptic vesicle replenishment.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. Lines 321-325: The authors interpret their Rac1 data to strongly suggest that the effect of Arp2/3 on AP width and Pr is separable from an effect on SV recruitment. However, increases in AP width result in prolonged calcium influx. Since synaptic vesicle replenishment is regulated by residual calcium, the authors' argument seems flawed. Of note, this issue is also relevant when interpreting data obtained using optogenetic stimulation, which result in EPSCs with prolonged decay-time. As the authors mention in their reply letter, this is likely due to the slow nature of the photocurrents. But presynaptically, this slow photocurrent is not only resulting in prolonged SV release, but also in prolonged calcium influx, which will modulate SV replenishment dynamics. Commenting on this in the discussion of the corresponding data is required.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, we discussed the effect of residual calcium on vesicle replenishment in regards to the increased AP width for Arp2/3. We also added discussion of the optogenetic EPSCs having prolonged decay time. The relevant section now reads: “Related to this point, we observed that decay time constants for optically-evoked EPSCs were larger than expected, even in the WT condition (~14ms; Figure 4—figure supplement 2E, Figure 5—figure supplement 1A). […] Additionally, the results are matched at inhibitory synapses with normal baseline replenishment dynamics, since optically-evoked IPSCs have normal kinetics (Figure 4—figure supplement 2G, Figure 5—figure supplement 1C).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d. Line 467 (and also paragraph starting at line 505). &quot;Since presynaptic Rac1 requires Arp2/3 to alter synaptic vesicle replenishment rate.…&quot; The authors have provided occlusion data showing that Rac1 and Arp2/3 are likely to operate in the same pathway. However, the vesicle replenishment may have already reached the upper limit from the loss of Arp2/3 alone, such that upon impairing Rac1 there may not be additional vesicles whose replenishment could be sped up. Therefore, whether Rac1 actually requires Arp2/3 to mediate its effect on vesicle replenishment remains to be established. The corresponding text should be toned down accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We have adjusted the text accordingly in multiple locations. The Results subtitle reads: “Rac1 alters vesicle replenishment specifically at presynaptic terminals, likely through Arp2/3”. The title of Figure 7 has been changed to: “Arp2/3 loss occludes replenishment rate changes by presynaptic Rac1.”</p><p>The corresponding Results section reads: “This occlusion shows that Arp2/3, and thus actin remodeling, is likely required for Rac1 to alter synaptic vesicle replenishment in presynaptic terminals. However, it is still possible that vesicle replenishment may have reached the upper limit from the loss of Arp2/3 alone, with no additional vesicles whose replenishment could be increased upon Rac1 inhibition.”</p><p>The first Discussion section mentioned now reads: “Since presynaptic Rac1 likely requires Arp2/3 to alter synaptic vesicle replenishment rate, the data from our work and the collective literature indicates this effect may depend on presynaptic actin remodeling. To bolster this hypothesis, it would be informative to perturb Rac1 and probe presynaptic actin filaments at short, fixed intervals following HFS using flash-and-freeze electron microscopy (Watanabe et al., 2013a; Watanabe et al., 2013b).”</p><p>The second Discussion section mentioned now reads: “Nonetheless, our results highlight that there may be different pools of branched actin in presynaptic terminals. If Rac1 really does require Arp2/3 to alter synaptic vesicle replenishment rate, then there is an actin pool in the synaptic vesicle cluster that regulates vesicle replenishment and synaptic depression. There is clearly also an Arp2/3-dependent pool that regulates release probability independently of Rac1…”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e. Lines 470-483: In this paragraph, discussing the possible mechanisms by which Rac1-Arp2/3 affect SV replenishment, possible effects on calcium dynamics should be included. In essence, alterations in calcium influx, recruitment of calcium channels, or coupling distances between SVs and calcium channels could also result in similar STP changes – but were not tested here.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added discussion of these mechanisms at the end of this paragraph: “Finally, Rac1 and Arp2/3 could also affect replenishment rates by altering presynaptic calcium dynamics. […] These mechanisms could be dependent on, or independent of, the actin cytoskeleton (Catterall and Few, 2008; Glebov et al., 2017; Mercer et al., 2011).”</p><p>References:</p><p>Arancillo M, Min SW, Gerber S, Munster-Wandowski A, Wu YJ, Herman M, Trimbuch T, Rah JC, Ahnert-Hilger G, Riedel D, Sudhof TC, and Rosenmund C.
