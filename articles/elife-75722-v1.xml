To understand how reduced brain variability segregates with increased behavioral variability, we investigated the association between reaction time variability, evoked brain responses and ongoing brain signal dynamics, in young (N=36) and older adults (N=39). We studied the electroencephalogram (EEG) and pupil size fluctuations to characterize the cortical and arousal responses elicited by a cued go/no-go task. Evoked responses were strongly modulated by slow (&lt;2 Hz) fluctuations of the ongoing signals, which presented reduced power in the older participants. Although variability of the evoked responses was lower in the older participants, once we adjusted for the effect of the ongoing signal fluctuations, evoked responses were equally variable in both groups. Moreover, the modulation of the evoked responses caused by the ongoing signal fluctuations had no impact on reaction time, thereby explaining why although ongoing brain signal variability is decreased in older individuals, behavioral variability is not. Finally, we showed that adjusting for the effect of the ongoing signal was critical to unmask the link between neural responses and behavior as well as the link between task-related evoked EEG and pupil responses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>EEG</kwd><kwd>pupil</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>brain variability</kwd><kwd>reaction time variability</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FCT/UIDB&amp;P/4950/2020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Castelo-Branco</surname><given-names>Miguel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PTDC/PSIGER/30852/2017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Castelo-Branco</surname><given-names>Miguel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DSAIPA/DS/0041/2020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Castelo-Branco</surname><given-names>Miguel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EXPL/PSI-GER/0349/2021</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ribeiro</surname><given-names>Maria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The explanation of why older people show increased behavioral variability despite having decreased neural signal variability lies in the link between the dynamics of the ongoing neural signal and the trial-by-trial variability of neural evoked responses.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Brain signal variability holds valuable information about brain dynamics that should not be ignored when studying the link between neuronal activity and cognition. Brain signal variability can take many forms. Moment-to-moment variability of the ongoing signal reflects how much brain activity changes from one moment to the next, that is the brain activity range. Trial-by-trial variability in task-related evoked responses reflects differences in the brain responses to repeated task conditions, while brain signal entropy quantifies the irregularity of the time series.</p><p>Within-subject brain signal variability has been shown to change with ageing and is a robust marker of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grady and Garrett, 2014</xref>). The effect of ageing on brain signal variability has been studied using several measures, including temporal standard deviation (SD) and mean square successive difference (MSSD) of the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal acquired with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grady and Garrett, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Samanez-Larkin et al., 2010</xref>), temporal SD of the spectral power within frequency bands measured with electroencephalography (EEG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kumral et al., 2020</xref>), entropy in EEG and magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kosciessa et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McIntosh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Waschke et al., 2017</xref>), the slope of the EEG power spectral density (PSD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Voytek et al., 2015</xref>), and the consistency of task-related evoked responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sander et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tran et al., 2020</xref>). The temporal standard deviation of the BOLD signal and of the amplitude envelop of EEG frequency bands measured in the ongoing signal are markedly decreased in older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garrett et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grady and Garrett, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kumral et al., 2020</xref>). Yet, the localization of these changes does not coincide suggesting that BOLD and EEG variability capture different aspects of brain function. In fact, age differences in BOLD SD might be explained by changes in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular factors that affect the link between neuronal activity and changes in blood flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tsvetanov et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, BOLD MSSD, a measure of how much the BOLD signal changes across successive observations, is more often increased rather than decreased in older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boylan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nomi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Samanez-Larkin et al., 2010</xref>), highlighting the fact that age-related changes in signal dynamics can result in more or less ‘signal variability’ depending on the used metric. In fact, the relationship between the non-invasive measures of brain signal variability used in human neuroscience and neuronal noise is not trivial. Large signal fluctuations will increase signal standard deviation but might originate in a more stable and predictable signal associated with reduced noise. Higher signal variability is, therefore, not equal to a noisier signal. Consistent with this idea, EEG signal entropy increases with ageing and is associated with the EEG spectra slope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Waschke et al., 2017</xref>). Older adults present EEG signals with flatter spectra, i.e., more similar to white noise, potentially reflecting increased neuronal noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Voytek et al., 2015</xref>). Higher brain noise is also consistent with the fact that older people present increased behavioral variability measured as less consistent reaction time across trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grady and Garrett, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">MacDonald et al., 2012</xref>). However, the link between brain signal variability, neuronal noise and behavioral variability remains to be clarified.</p><p>The ongoing brain signal (i.e. spontaneous brain activity) measured with fMRI or EEG during ‘task-free’, ‘resting’ periods reflects activity in large-scale networks each identified as a set of brain regions that show activity co-fluctuations, the resting-state networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beckmann et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). Notably, these networks are functionally active also during task performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abreu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith et al., 2009</xref>). The ongoing activation and de-activation of these networks presents a backdrop of activity on top of which task-related activity occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fox et al., 2006</xref>). Not surprisingly, ongoing activity modulates task-related evoked responses that in turn affect task performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Becker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fox et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mayhew et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ribeiro et al., 2016</xref>). For example, fluctuations in pre-stimulus alpha power affect the amplitude of brain sensory responses, perception and reaction time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Thut et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van Dijk et al., 2008</xref>). Older people display low-frequency (&lt;12 Hz) brain signal fluctuations with reduced amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kumral et al., 2020</xref>), however, previous studies of the effect of ageing on the variability of task evoked responses have yielded contradictory results, revealing increased or decreased trial-by-trial consistency depending on stimulus or task characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sander et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tran et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tran et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wiegand and Sander, 2019</xref>). Finally, to our knowledge, no previous study has investigated the effect of ageing on the link between the dynamics of the ongoing brain activity, trial-by-trial variability of evoked responses and behavioral variability.</p><p>In this study, we aimed at clarifying the effect of ageing on brain signal dynamics and its impact on behavior by investigating the relationship between variability of ongoing brain signals, evoked responses, and behavior. We analysed EEG and pupil data from a previously published study acquired while a group of young and a group of older adults were engaged in a cued auditory go/no-go task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ribeiro and Castelo-Branco, 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ribeiro and Castelo-Branco, 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ribeiro and Castelo-Branco, 2021</xref>). The EEG allows the non-invasive measurement of cortical electrical activity with high temporal resolution, while the pupillogram, acquired under conditions of constant luminance, is associated with fluctuations in arousal and reflects activity in the ascending brainstem neuromodulatory systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Gee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Joshi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Murphy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reimer et al., 2016</xref>). Although, activity modulation in subcortical arousal nuclei (reflected in changes in pupil size) correlates with the EEG signal (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Podvalny et al., 2021</xref>), these two signals capture distinct aspects of brain function, both important and complementary for our understanding of the ageing brain. In our previous study, we showed that, in both signals, the cue stimulus evoked a preparatory response. In the EEG, the cue evoked a frontocentral negative potential [the contingent negative variation (CNV)] that increased in magnitude throughout the preparatory period. The CNV has been previously shown to correlate with reaction time on a trial-by-trial basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boehm et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that trial-by-trial amplitude fluctuations in the CNV are associated with behavioral variability. In the pupillogram, the cue evoked a pupil dilation response of equal magnitude in both groups of participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ribeiro and Castelo-Branco, 2019a</xref>). In the current study, we investigated how trial-by-trial variability in the amplitude of these preparatory responses changed across age groups, how it related to behavior variability and how it was affected by ongoing brain signals. We found that, while behavioral variability was increased in older adults, this group of participants presented reduced variability of the evoked responses both in the EEG and in the pupillogram. We found that the decreased variability in the evoked responses emerged due to a reduction in the amplitude of the slow fluctuations observed in the ongoing signals and did not reflect reduced variability of the evoked responses per se. Once differences in the dynamics of the ongoing signals were accounted for, we observed no group differences in the variability of the evoked responses. Moreover, although the evoked responses were markedly affected by fluctuations in the ongoing signals, the amplitude modulations caused by the ongoing signal did not contribute towards behavioral variability, thereby explaining why although ongoing brain signal variability is decreased in older individuals, behavioral variability is not.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We analysed EEG and pupil data acquired while a group of young (N=36; age = 23 ± 3 years) and a group of older (N=39; age = 60 ± 5 years) adults were engaged in a cued-auditory go/no-go task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Behavioral task design and reaction time results.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Participants performed a cued auditory go/no-go task.

We analysed the PSDs using the FOOOF toolbox that separates the aperiod from the periodic component of the spectra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Donoghue et al., 2020</xref>). The aperiodic component can be described by its two parameters: the spectral exponent (a measure of how steep the spectrum is) and the offset (which reflects the uniform shift of power across frequencies).

Ongoing pupil signal fluctuations happen on a slower time scale than the EEG fluctuations, therefore, it is important to analyse longer time periods to study their dynamics. To analyse ongoing pupil fluctuations in the absence of task related activity, we took advantage of the 4 min long pupillary recordings obtained at the beginning of the acquisition protocol while participants were fixating and passively listening to the cue stimulus being presented with the same frequency as in the task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ribeiro and Castelo-Branco, 2019a</xref>). Besides fixating the centre of the screen no other overt task was required. Due to the absence of task or luminance changes, the dynamics of pupil fluctuations in these recordings can be mostly assigned to ongoing pupillary activity. We analysed the spectral content of these signals in 20 s epochs cut sequentially from these 4 min recordings (not locked to the auditory stimulus).The spectra of the ongoing pupillary signal followed a 1 /f distribution, with power decreasing with increasing frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

We used correlational analyses to investigate if the dynamics of the ongoing EEG and pupil signals captured by the spectral parameters was associated with the variability in task-related evoked responses across participants. For the EEG, to facilitate data presentation and interpretation of the following analyses, we focused on the FCz channel where the CNV showed its highest amplitude. Similar findings were observed in the other EEG channels, including the ones presenting significant correlations with behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Alpha power presented a positive association with CNV variability only in the young group and in posterior EEG channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Beta power was not associated with CNV variability. These findings suggest that the aperiodic signal fluctuations are intrinsically linked to the variability observed in the evoked responses. We then sought to determine which frequencies in the aperiodic spectra were more predictive of the variability in the amplitude of the evoked responses. We found that the correlation between variability in the amplitude of the evoked responses and the amplitude of the power spectra was particularly strong in the lower frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, the correlations were significant in both the aperiodic component of the fitted (FOOOF) spectra and in the raw (total) power spectra. In the total spectral power, the correlation between PD variability and spectral power was highest around 0.44 Hz and decreased for lower frequencies. In the EEG analyses, correlation was highest at 1 Hz, the lowest frequency analysed. These findings suggest that slow aperiodic fluctuations observed in the ongoing signals are associated with trial-by-trial variability in the amplitude of the evoked responses, both in the EEG and in the pupillogram.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Variability in the amplitude of the evoked responses correlates with parameters of the power spectral density (PSD) of the ongoing signals.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) CNV variability measured in the FCz channel plotted against (from top to bottom) exponent, offset, alpha power or beta power estimated from the PSDs of ongoing pre-stimulus EEG signal measured in the same EEG channel.

Background signal fluctuations might reflect fluctuations in brain state and different brain states will be associated with different evoked responses; and/or background signal fluctuations and the evoked responses are two independent signals that sum giving rise to a composite signal where the evoked response appears on top of a fluctuating baseline thereby modulating its shape and amplitude - a simple additive mechanism. In this latter case, the phase of the background fluctuations at the cue-onset rather than the instantaneous amplitude would better capture the relationship between the measured evoked responses and the ongoing signal (at the same amplitude values, the phase of the oscillation will define if the signal is increasing or decreasing). We explored this relationship by estimating the phase of the slow fluctuations in the EEG and pupil signals at cue-onset. For illustrative purposes, we plotted the relationship between the pre-stimulus phase and the amplitude of the respective evoked responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). The evoked responses showed a dependence on the phase of the ongoing fluctuations in line with what would be expected if the measured evoked responses were the summation of an evoked response with an ongoing fluctuating signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B and C</xref>). This relationship was also different from what would be expected if the evoked responses were affected solely by the amplitude of the baseline signal.

We quantified the association between EEG/pupil phase of slow fluctuations estimated at cue-onset (θ) and the amplitude of the respective evoked responses using linear regression. This relationship can be captured in a linear regression by representing the phase as a pair of variables: the cosine and the sine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nurhab et al., 2017</xref>). We multiplied the cosine and sine functions by the amplitude envelop (r) of the slow signal fluctuations because the amplitude envelop varies throughout the recordings and these fluctuations will have differential effects on the evoked responses depending on their amplitude. The two predictors associated with the slow ongoing signal fluctuations were <italic>r • sin θ</italic> and <italic>r •</italic> cos θ. Note that <italic>r •</italic> cos θ is equal to the signal amplitude and therefore to the amplitude at baseline, while <italic>r • sin θ</italic> will capture the additional effect of the signal phase. To study how these factors affected the trial-by-trial amplitude of the task-related responses, we run generalized linear regression models (GLMs) for each participant and separately for each signal type - EEG and pupil. We included as dependent variable the amplitude of the evoked response and as predictors <italic>r • sin θ</italic>, <italic>r •</italic> cos θ and, additionally, time-on-task (that can lead to differential responses due to learning, adaptation, or increased fatigue), and pre-stimulus alpha power (that reflects moment-to-moment spontaneous fluctuations in brain state related to alertness or attentional fluctuations; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">van Diepen et al., 2015</xref>). Run was included as categorical predictor (two consecutive runs of 8 min each were acquired). These models explained a large amount of the evoked responses variance (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> mean ± SE: EEG young 67% ± 8%; EEG older 63% ± 8%; pupil young 73% ± 1%; pupil older 67% ± 1%).

The EEG GLM revealed that the CNV amplitude depended on time-on-task [it became less negative with time-on-task; <italic>t</italic><sub>(73)</sub> = 2.84, p=0.006; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>], and on the phase of the ongoing fluctuations at cue-onset captured by the cosine [<italic>t</italic><sub>(73)</sub>=–36.3, p&lt;0.001] and the sine [<italic>t</italic><sub>(73)</sub>=–81.7, p&lt;0.001] functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>).

After regressing out the effect of the ongoing signal fluctuations from the amplitude of the evoked responses, these were associated with reaction time at least as strongly as without the adjustment. In particular, the CNV amplitude residuals correlated with reaction time in a larger number of electrodes than without the adjustment and unmasked a significant relationship between the CNV amplitude and reaction time in frontal electrodes that was not observed without the adjustment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>), suggesting that the relationship between CNV amplitude and behavior is independent of the baseline fluctuations. On average the correlation coefficients with the adjustment were slightly more positive than without the adjustment. This difference was significantly different in three EEG channels (F4, C1, and C4) after correcting for multiple comparisons. For the pupil responses, we found that regressing out the effect of ongoing signal fluctuations was crucial to detect the link between PD evoked responses and reaction time, that is the PD amplitude residuals correlated with reaction time [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>; one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test: <italic>t</italic><sub>(72)</sub> = –4.77, p&lt;0.001].

However, it was not clear if and how their contributions to the behavioral variability interacted. To address this question, we first checked if these two responses correlated with each other. The pupil dilation response shows a delay of hundreds of milliseconds in relation to the neural responses with which it is associated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Joshi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Joshi and Gold, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reimer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). To take into account the delay in the pupil response, we correlated the CNV amplitude measured in the time window at the end of the preparatory period (1–1.5 s after cue onset) with the pupil dilation response measured in three time windows: one concomitant with the CNV amplitude measurements as used in the previous analyses (1–1.5 s after cue onset), and two later time windows (1.5–2 s and 2–2.5 s after cue onset). In within-subject correlation analyses, we found that the single trial measurements of the CNV and pupil responses were significantly correlated with stronger correlation coefficients observed in posterior channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A and B</xref>). The correlation coefficients were stronger when the pupil response was measured 500ms after the CNV measurements. Just like for the correlations with task performance, these correlations were stronger after adjusting for the ongoing slow signal fluctuations. The effect of pupil time window was stronger in the older group and the correlation coefficients showed a stronger effect of adjustment for the later time windows.

We were interested in understanding the cause of the behavioral variability observed. Therefore, we focused on the neural responses that occur before the button press and only included in these analyses the pupil dilation response measured during the preparatory period before target onset (measured at the same time window as the CNV). The reaction time variance explained by the model including CNV and pupil residuals was significantly higher than the variance explained by the model including only the pupil dilation residuals or the model including only the CNV residuals [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12C</xref>; <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> across participants mean ± SD: pupil only model young group = 2% ± 3%; pupil only model older group = 2% ± 3%; CNV only model young group (average across channels)=2% ± 2%; CNV only model older group (average across channels)=4% ± 4%; pupil +CNV model young group (average across channels)=4% ± 3%; pupil +CNV model older group (average across channels)=7% ± 4 %].

However, it is possible that these signal fluctuations affect behavior independently from their effect on the evoked responses. We tested this hypothesis using within-subject regression analyses including as independent variables the cosine and sine of the signals phase at cue onset and reaction time as dependent variable. We fitted separate models for the EEG and pupil signals. In the EEG, the estimated coefficients for the sine function were significantly different from zero in two left temporal channels (FT7 and T7) after controlling for multiple comparisons. The coefficients were negative suggesting that faster reaction times occurred during the descending phase of these slow fluctuations. The estimated coefficients for the cosine function were not significantly different from zero. The coefficients were also not significantly different across groups, after controlling for multiple comparisons. In contrast, in the pupil analyses, the estimated coefficients were significantly different from zero for the cosine function, that captures fluctuations in amplitude and is equivalent to pupil size at baseline [one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test including all participants - <italic>t</italic><sub>(72)</sub> = –3.30, p=0.002].

In summary, at baseline (before cue onset), the descending phase of the slow signal fluctuations in the EEG in left temporal channels and bigger pupils were associated with faster responses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Task-related brain evoked responses occur on top of ongoing signal fluctuations that markedly affect their amplitude on a trial-by-trial basis. Our results revealed that as a consequence of older people showing reduced amplitude in the ongoing slow signal fluctuations measured in the EEG and pupil signals, trial-by-trial variability in their evoked responses is also decreased. Once the difference in ongoing signal dynamics was adjusted for, the evoked responses were equally variable in young and older adults. This finding is consistent with the fact that behavioral variability does not decrease with age as would be expected if the evoked responses were more consistent across trials. In fact, although ongoing signal fluctuations strongly affected the amplitude of the evoked responses, these amplitude modulations did not appear to have behavioral consequences.</p><p>There are two possible ways through which the slow fluctuations observed in the ongoing signals impact the evoked responses. One possibility is that these slow signal fluctuations reflect fluctuations in brain state that affect the way the brain responds to external stimuli as has been suggested for example for the impact of infra-slow oscillations observed in EEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Monto et al., 2008</xref>) or pre-stimulus activity levels in resting-state networks in fMRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boly et al., 2007</xref>). The other possibility assumes that the effect of the ongoing fluctuations on the evoked responses is purely additive and simply reflects the fluctuating baseline and is therefore not relevant for the type of task studied. This second hypothesis is supported by previous fMRI studies in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fox et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schölvinck et al., 2012</xref>) as well as studies of neuronal responses measured in the sensory cortices of mice and cats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schölvinck et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shimaoka et al., 2019</xref>). Our results further suggest that this latter case dominates the effect of the ongoing EEG and pupil signals on their respective evoked responses, highlighting an effect of ongoing signal’s phase: if the ongoing signal is increasing in amplitude, then the evoked response shows a more positive amplitude and vice-versa. Indeed, similar baseline amplitude levels at different signal phases (with amplitude increasing or amplitude decreasing) have different effects on the amplitude of the evoked responses (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) and the variance of the evoked responses explained by the models tested increased substantially by including the ongoing signal phase [r • sin(θ)] at cue-onset in comparison with including only the signal amplitude (as captured by the cosine function). Importantly, when we adjusted for the effect of the ongoing fluctuations on the evoked response’s amplitude, the correlation between the evoked response and reaction time was at least as strong as without this adjustment, suggesting that the effect of the ongoing signal fluctuations on the evoked responses has no impact on behavior. Interestingly, in both the pupil and EEG signals adjusting for ongoing signal fluctuations unmasked a relationship between the evoked responses amplitude and reaction time that, without the adjustment, was not detectable in the pupil and was evident only in a restricted number of channels in the EEG. This observation suggests that the additional variability imposed on the evoked responses by the ongoing signal can mask brain-behavior associations and therefore should be attended to and adjusted for.</p><p>Although, the effect of the ongoing signal on the amplitude of the evoked responses was not behaviorally relevant, ongoing signal fluctuations might reflect changes in brain activity that affect task performance independently from their impact on the evoked responses. In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schölvinck et al., 2012</xref>, using fMRI data, found that spontaneous activity was associated with visual perception without significantly modulating visual evoked responses. Moreover, an effect of baseline (pre-stimulus) slow activity fluctuations on task performance has been observed in studies using EEG or pupil data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gilzenrat et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Monto et al., 2008</xref>). Accordingly, we explored the relationship between pre-stimulus slow brain signal fluctuations and reaction time, however, it is important to note that as we were using a cued task our pre-stimulus activity refers to activity before cue onset that is at least 1.5 s before target onset. Under these conditions, pre-cue slow signal fluctuations in the EEG were associated with reaction time in two left temporal channels. We found that in these EEG channels the sine of the phase of the ongoing signal was negatively related to reaction time suggesting that faster reactions happen during the descending phase of the ongoing slow EEG fluctuations. In the pupil data, we observed a significant negative relationship between pupil size (captured by the cosine of the signal phase) and reaction time suggesting that larger pupils at cue onset are associated with faster reactions. Large pupils might reflect higher levels of arousal and therefore better task engagement. In fact, this is also what we observe in our pupil evoked response – the larger the pupil response the faster the reaction times. The elucidation of the mechanisms by which baseline pupil size affects task performance is hampered by the fact that baseline pupil is intrinsically linked to the phase of the ongoing slow fluctuations that in turn affect the amplitude of the evoked responses in an additive manner and, in this case, in the opposite direction from the one predicted from its effect on behavior: large baseline pupils are associated with fast reaction times but are also associated with smaller pupil evoked responses that are in turn associated with slower reaction times. This observation further supports the idea that the effect of pupil baseline on behavior is independent of the effect of the pupil baseline on the evoked responses.</p><p>The association between baseline signal fluctuations and reaction time was not significantly different across groups suggesting that signal fluctuations affect reaction time similarly in young and older people. Larger signal fluctuations in the young group would suggest higher reaction time variability. This is not the case, as young participants display lower reaction time variability. It is therefore unlikely that this mechanism contributes towards the age-related differences in behavioral variability.</p><p>Fluctuations in pupil size under constant illumination conditions reflect activity in a restricted number of brain regions. The main areas that have been identified in non-luminance modulation of pupil size are the superior colliculus and the locus coeruleus (LC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joshi and Gold, 2020</xref>). The involvement of the superior colliculus in pupil dilation responses is thought to predominate during the orienting response to sensory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2014</xref>), while activation of the LC modulates pupil size during resting periods as well as during cognitive arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Joshi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Murphy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reimer et al., 2016</xref>). However, the pupil inverse problem (which brain areas are being modulated when we observe changes in pupil size) remains to be solved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joshi and Gold, 2020</xref>). Our results suggest that the fluctuations observed in the ongoing pupil signal and the pupil evoked responses correlate with reaction time even though the effect of the ongoing signal on the evoked responses was not behaviorally relevant. The component of the ongoing pupil signal associated with task performance might be separate from the large fluctuations observed and might even correspond to the same mechanism that is further activated in response to the cue. It is likely that the component of the ongoing pupil signal that is behaviorally relevant constitutes a small part of the signal. In fact, studies describing the association between neural activity and ongoing pupil dilation events report significant but small correlations suggesting that a large proportion of the pupil variance remains unexplained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Joshi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Megemont et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reimer et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The idea that the ongoing pupil signal fluctuations and the task-related pupil evoked response can be two largely independent signals, challenges previous claims. The prevailing model suggests that high baseline (tonic) activity in the LC is associated with weaker task-related (phasic) responses, and that pupil data parallels this observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gilzenrat et al., 2010</xref>). However, the application of this model to human pupil data acquired during performance of typical psychophysical tasks has been challenged given the relatively small modulations in arousal that occur under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joshi and Gold, 2020</xref>). Our analyses further suggest that the effect of pupil baseline on the pupil dilation responses is not behaviorally relevant and merely additive.</p><p>Previous fMRI studies suggest that task evoked responses are affected by ongoing signal fluctuations occurring in the same brain areas but that these ongoing fluctuations are shared across brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fox et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schölvinck et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, single-cell electrophysiology and optical imaging with voltage sensors in anesthetized cats suggest that sensory responses in individual neurons are variable from trial-to-trial and that this variability reflects the sum of the sensory response with an ongoing signal shared across neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arieli et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schölvinck et al., 2015</xref>). The CNV preparatory potential originates not from an unitary neural mechanism but from a set of brain areas, including the supplementary motor area (SMA), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nagai et al., 2004</xref>). Likely, these areas will display ongoing activity that will sum to the evoked responses. Nevertheless, the ongoing EEG fluctuations studied probably originate in a large set of brain areas that will include, but not be limited to, the brain areas involved in the preparatory mechanisms linked to the CNV potential.</p><p>The two markers of preparatory neural activity, the CNV and the pupil dilation response, were found to be correlated on a trial-by-trial basis. The correlation coefficients were stronger after adjusting for the slow ongoing fluctuations of each signal, further highlighting the importance of adjusting for these signal fluctuations. A correlation between the CNV and the pupil dilation response had already been suggested before on between-subjects correlation analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hepsomali et al., 2019</xref>). We found that the correlation was stronger when comparing the CNV amplitude with the pupil dilation measured with a 500 ms delay in line with the idea that the pupil response is slow and lags the associated cortical events by hundreds of milliseconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reimer et al., 2016</xref>). A likely brain area linking the CNV with the pupil dilation response is the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Activity in the ACC is observed during preparatory periods associated with the CNV potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nagai et al., 2004</xref>) and it is associated with pupil dilation events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Joshi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Joshi and Gold, 2022</xref>). Nevertheless, it is intriguing to note that the correlation between the CNV and the pupil dilation response presented a clear posterior topography challenging the focus solely on the ACC. The fact that the CNV and pupil dilation independently explain some of the reaction time variance suggests the existence of brain systems that contribute towards the CNV amplitude independently of the brain systems associated with pupil dilation. Given that, without adjusting the CNV for the effect of the ongoing signal fluctuations, the correlation between the CNV and reaction time was observed mostly in left frontocentral channels, it is likely that this reflects the effect of a component of the CNV associated with motor preparatory activity independent of the orienting response. In turn, it is also intriguing that pupil dilation contributes towards reaction time independently of its effect on the CNV. Possible mechanisms are the priming of sensory cortices or the speeding up of the communication between sensory and motor cortices by the ascending brainstem neuromodulatory systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vazey et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Our analyses showed that ageing affects the dynamics of the ongoing EEG signal (reflecting cortical activity) and the ongoing pupillary signal (reflecting activity in brainstem neuromodulatory systems). In both signals, older people presented flatter spectra with reduced power in the slower aperiodic fluctuations. This flattening of brain signal spectra with ageing has been described before in EEG and ECoG data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Voytek et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Waschke et al., 2017</xref>), is also evident in MEG data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vlahou et al., 2014</xref>), and is here reported in the pupil signal suggesting an age-related decrease in the amplitude of the slow fluctuations in cortical and subcortical networks. In line with our findings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vlahou et al., 2014</xref> showed that, in MEG data, the power of slow fluctuations decreases linearly with ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vlahou et al., 2014</xref>). Sequential activation and de-activation of resting-state networks is observed in the ongoing EEG data both during rest and task performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abreu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). This ongoing dynamic possibly underlies the ongoing signal fluctuations we observe at the channel level EEG. The fact that EEG, MEG and pupil spectra decrease in amplitude with increasing frequency suggests that brain activation patterns that involve large activation volumes accumulate relatively slowly (the larger the brain volume recruited the slower the activity changes). Ageing is characterized by a significant decrease in the strength of long-range structural connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Westlye et al., 2010</xref>) as well as a decrease in the functional connectivity (correlated BOLD activation patterns) within large-scale brain systems, like the default mode network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sala-Llonch et al., 2015</xref>), consistent with the idea that simultaneous activation of distant brain areas supported by long-range structural connectivity is impaired in older individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrews-Hanna et al., 2007</xref>). Reduced amplitude of slow EEG fluctuations might therefore be related to impaired recruitment of large-scale brain systems.</p><p>We started this study with the assumption that if behavior is more variable in older people, then the neural responses that underlie that behavior should also show increased variability. We found that after controlling for differences in the ongoing brain signals, task-related evoked responses were equally variable in young and older adults. This leaves unanswered the origin of the increased behavioral variability observed in older people. It is likely that behavioral variability emerges from the summation of variability at different stages of task processing and thus it is not all captured by the preparatory responses studied here. Moreover, in our study, behavioral variability was only slightly increased in the older group and that might have hindered the detection of increased variability in the evoked responses. The age-related increase in reaction time variability depends on the task used to measure it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dykiert et al., 2012</xref>). For example, the age difference in reaction time variability is smaller in simple RT tasks than in choice tasks and is smaller in tasks using longer preparatory intervals as the ones used in our task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dykiert et al., 2012</xref>). Future studies addressing this question would benefit from using a behavioral task where age differences in behavioral variability are more pronounced.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The current study shows that the amplitude of the preparatory evoked potential, the CNV, and the preparatory pupil dilation responses show comparable trial-by-trial variability in young and older adults once the effect of the ongoing signal fluctuations is considered. This finding suggests a dissociation between ongoing brain activity, which presents reduced variability in older adults, and task-related responses, which do not. This dissociation might explain why although ongoing brain activity is less variable in older adults, behavior variability increases with ageing.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Thirty-six young adults (mean age ± SD = 23±3 years; 29 women; 3 left-handed) and thirty-nine older adults (mean age ± SD = 60±5 years; 31 women; 3 left-handed) were included in this study.

Briefly, we applied two cued auditory tasks: a cued simple RT task and a cued go/no-go task. In this study, for the sake of conciseness, we report only the analyses of the go/no-go task data. Equivalent results were obtained with the data from the simple RT task with the exception that PD amplitude, without the adjustment for the slow ongoing fluctuations, correlated with reaction time. Nevertheless, after the adjustment the correlation was significantly stronger. The auditory stimuli used were three different pure tones, suprathreshold, with duration of 250ms, with the following frequencies: cue - 1500 Hz; go stimulus - 1700 Hz; no-go stimulus - 1300 Hz. Participants performed the two tasks, cued simple RT and cued go/no-go, sequentially. The order of the tasks was counterbalanced across participants, that is, half of the participants started with the simple RT and the other half with the go/no-go. In the simple RT task, the cue was followed by the go stimulus (100 trials) to which participants were instructed to respond by pressing a keyboard key as fast as possible with their right index finger. In the go/no-go task, the cue was followed or by the go stimulus (80 trials) or by the no-go stimulus (20 trials). Participants were instructed to respond as fast as possible to the go stimulus with their right index finger, while refraining from responding to the no-go stimulus. The intertrial interval was variable with a median of 7.6 s (min 6.7 and max 19.6 s). The interval between the cue and the target stimuli and between target and the beginning of the next trial were drawn from a nonaging distribution, –W*ln(P), where W is the mean value of the interval distribution and P is a random number between 0 and 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jennings et al., 1998</xref>).

We considered as error trials all trials where the participants responded after cue presentation, failed to respond to the go stimulus (misses), responded to the go stimulus too slowly (slower than 700ms), or responded to the no-go stimulus in the go/no-go condition. These trials were signalled with a feedback tone warning the participants that an error was committed. Statistical analyses of number of errors were performed using nonparametric Mann-Whitney tests.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>EEG data acquisition and pre-processing</title><p>As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ribeiro and Castelo-Branco, 2019a</xref>), the EEG signal was recorded using a 64-channel Neuroscan system (Compumedics EUROPE GmbH) with scalp electrodes placed according to the International 10–20 electrode placement standard, with reference between the electrodes CPz and Cz and ground between FPz and Fz. Acquisition rate was 500 Hz. Vertical and horizontal electrooculograms were recorded to monitor eye movements and blinks. The participants’ head was stabilized with a chin and forehead rest to record pupillographic data simultaneously. Consequently, the electrodes on the forehead, FP1, FPz, and FP2, displayed signal fluctuation artefacts due to the pressure on the forehead rest. These were excluded from the analyses. A trigger pulse was generated at the onset of each stimulus and at every button press. EEG data analysis was performed with the EEGLAB toolbox versions 14.1.1 and 19.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Delorme and Makeig, 2004</xref>) and Matlab custom scripts.</p><p>We used independent component analysis (ICA) to eliminate nonbrain artefacts from the data, as described previously. The data, re-referenced to linked earlobes, was then band pass filtered with cut off frequencies of 0.1 and 35 Hz, and periods containing further artefacts were manually removed.</p><p>For visualization of the scalp topographies of the EEG analyses results, we used perceptually uniform colour maps developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crameri et al., 2020</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Pupil data acquisition and pre-processing</title><p>As described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ribeiro and Castelo-Branco, 2019a</xref>), the pupil diameter of the right eye was measured by an infrared eye-tracker (iView X Hi-Speed 1,250 system from SMI) with a sampling rate of 240 Hz. Analysis of pupil data was performed using Matlab custom scripts and the EEGLAB toolbox in Matlab. Artefacts and blinks were corrected using the blink correction Matlab script by Greg Siegle (stublinks.m) available in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pitt.edu/~gsiegle/">http://www.pitt.edu/~gsiegle/</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Siegle et al., 2003</xref>). Briefly, artefacts, including blinks, were identified as large changes in pupil dilation occurring too rapidly to signify actual dilation or contraction. Linear interpolations replaced artefacts throughout the data sets. Data were smoothed using a 3-point unweighted average filter applied twice.</p><p>For each run, pupil data was expressed as the percentage of the mean across the whole run by dividing the run data by the mean pupil size within that run. Pupil data were then cut into epochs locked with the onset of the auditory cue from 200ms before cue onset up to 6 s after. Epochs were baseline corrected by subtracting the average amplitude within the 200ms before cue onset.</p><p>Pupil epochs were visually inspected for artefacts not adequately corrected by the automatic linear interpolation procedure. Epochs with remaining artefacts were manually rejected. In addition, we discarded all error trials and correct trials that immediately followed error trials.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Single-trial amplitude and variability of evoked responses in the EEG and pupil signals</title><p>The preparatory evoked responses in the EEG and pupil signals were studied in cue-locked epochs with average baseline amplitude (200ms time window before cue onset) subtracted. The numbers of included trials did not differ significantly across groups (mean ± SD of number of trials included: EEG - young group = 72 ± 7; older group = 71 ± 7; pupil - young group = 66 ± 10; older group = 62 ± 12). Single trial amplitude was calculated by averaging the cue-locked responses within the time window from 1 s to 1.5 s after cue-onset. This time window was chosen to include the period of highest amplitude of the preparatory response while avoiding any activity related to target processing and therefore positioned just before the earliest target onset (1.5 s after cue onset). We chose a 500ms window as a compromise between averaging over time and therefore reducing the ‘noise’ associated with single trial responses and being close enough to the onset of the go stimulus.</p><p>Group comparison of average CNV amplitude and across trials SD of CNV amplitude was performed, for each channel, with independent samples permutation test based on a <italic>t</italic>-statistic. The ‘tmax’ method was used for adjusting the p values of each variable for multiple comparisons, across the 59 electrodes analysed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blair and Karniski, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Groppe et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Correlation between single trial amplitude of evoked responses and reaction time</title><p>For within-subject correlation analyses between reaction time and single-trial amplitude of the evoked responses, we used the Pearson’s skipped robust correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wilcox, 2012</xref>), as implemented in the robust correlation Matlab toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pernet et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rousseeuw, 1984</xref>). Skipped correlations minimize the effects of bivariate outliers by considering the overall structure of the data. Notably, Pearson’s skipped correlation is a direct reflection of Pearson’s <italic>r</italic>. At the group level, correlations were considered significant if the correlation coefficients were significantly different from zero. For the EEG, this was established using one sample permutation test based on a <italic>t</italic>-statistic with the ‘tmax’ method used for adjusting the <italic>p</italic>-values of each variable for multiple comparisons (across the 59 electrodes analysed) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Groppe, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Groppe et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Spectral analyses of ongoing signals</title><p>EEG and pupil power spectral densities (PSDs) estimated via the Welch’s method were fit using the FOOOF algorithm (version 1.0.0) using the Matlab wrapper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Donoghue et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In the EEG analyses, PSDs were estimated in single trials in 3.5 s long pre-cue epochs. PSDs were then averaged across trials for each electrode and fit using the FOOOF algorithm with the following settings: peak width limits = [1 8]; peak threshold = 1; aperiodic mode = 'fixed'; minimum peak height = 0.1; max number of peaks = 4; frequency range = [1 35]. Peaks with peak frequency between 7 and 14 Hz were considered within the alpha range and peaks with peak frequency between 14 and 30 Hz were considered within the beta range. Peaks outside these frequencies were rarely detected and were not analysed.</p><p>In the pupil analyses, PSDs were estimated in 20 s long epochs from a 4 min recording acquired at the beginning of the experiment during which the participants were passively fixating and listening to the cue stimulus being presented with the same frequency as in the cued auditory tasks but without any overt task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ribeiro and Castelo-Branco, 2019a</xref>). The 20 s epochs were cut sequentially and were not locked to the auditory stimulus. These long epochs allowed us to assess the slow signal fluctuations typical of the pupillary recordings. Pupil PSDs were then averaged across trials and were fit using the FOOOF algorithm with the following settings: peak width limits = [-inf.25]; peak threshold = 3.5; aperiodic mode = 'fixed'; minimum peak height = 0.2; maximum number of peaks = 4; frequency range = [0.05 6].</p><p>FOOOF model fitting quality was estimated from the model <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>.

These <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> values reflected good model fittings, however, it is important to note that they were significantly lower in the older group, in most EEG electrodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that the parameter estimation was not as good in this group. Surprisingly, the model <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> correlated with the estimated values for exponent and offset – lower <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> values were associated with lower exponents and offsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This relationship was evident in both groups of participants. To ensure that the study conclusions were not driven by differences in fitting quality, we compared the correlation between the variability in the evoked responses and the fitted spectra with the correlation between the variability in the evoked responses and the raw PSD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). We obtained similar results: the power of low frequencies in the aperiodic fitted spectra and in the raw spectra correlated with the evoked responses amplitude variability.

cognitive aging – that the brain signals of older and younger subjects may differ due to physiological changes that bear little or no relevance to the cognitive processes being studied. Here, the authors demonstrate that older subjects exhibit reduced slow oscillations in EEG and pupil power and that controlling for these differences eliminated group differences in ERP and pupil dilation variability while strengthening their correlation with reaction time. The work should be of interest to those using EEG to study inter-individual and inter-group differences, particularly in the realm of aging and age-related disorders.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75722.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>O'Connell</surname><given-names>Redmond G</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02tyrky19</institution-id><institution>Trinity College Dublin</institution></institution-wrap><country>Ireland</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>O'Connell</surname><given-names>Redmond G</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02tyrky19</institution-id><institution>Trinity College Dublin</institution></institution-wrap><country>Ireland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Schölvinck</surname><given-names>Marieke</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00ygt2y02</institution-id><institution>Ernst Strungmann Institute for Neuroscience</institution></institution-wrap><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.11.18.467545">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.18.467545v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Redmond G O'Connell as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Joshua Gold as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Marieke Schölvinck (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should provide more detailed behavioural results including false alarms and miss rates.</p><p>2) The authors should use more cautious language when discussing the strength and statistical significance of their results in a manner proportionate to the statistical power of this study.</p><p>3) In addition to controlling for their influence in the statistical models, the authors should report the degree to which the observed slow EEG/pupil fluctuations correlate with RT variability.</p><p>4) The authors should consider the possibility that the left-focussed ERP-RT relationships in fact reflect motor preparation as opposed to the CNV.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors report in the abstract and elsewhere that their study resolves the apparently discrepant observation that older adults have higher RT variability but lower brain signal variability. The reported analyses suggest that, after controlling for background slow oscillations, older and younger groups have equivalent levels of brain signal variability. If so, this still leaves a discrepancy – older adults have higher RT variability despite equivalent brain signal variability. The authors should address this in their Discussion. Might the answer lie in the observation that older and younger adults did not differ in their coefficients of variation?</p><p>Insufficient detail is provided on the analysis of the pupil data in the Methods section. How were pupil dilations measured? This is crucial information for the reader to be able to judge the degree to which the analyses might partly reflect variations in baseline amplitude.</p><p>The initial analyses of the relationship between CNV and RT highlight a markedly left central focus in the topography. It does not seem appropriate to me to refer to such effects as relating to the CNV which is defined by its frontocentral focus. Not all activity in the pre-target window necessarily relates to the CNV process. A notable alternative candidate process here would be motor preparation with larger amplitudes reflecting greater preparation and resulting in faster RTs. It is interesting that a more frontal focus appears in the relationship when controlling for the slow fluctuations, but I think it's important for the authors to be more careful in their use of the term CNV and to discuss alternative explanations of these effects.</p><p>I am wondering why the authors did not test for a correlation between the slow EEG/pupil rhythms and RT in their data?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– I felt that this was an excellent paper, but its conclusions seemed very technical. Apart from knowing that we should take aperiodic signals into account in future research, I am not sure what we have now learned about aging or behavioral variability. But perhaps that's fine.</p><p>– The behavioral part of the paper feels very underdeveloped. In the methods it is explained how accuracy was calculated, yet accuracy results are not reported. I think this is quite important, because group differences in reaction time variability can originate from different sources: i) if one group is more cautious this will result in increased variability, slower RTs and higher accuracy, ii) if one group is worse at the task this will result in increased variability, slower RTs and lower accuracy, iii) not mentioning interactions between both (becoming more cautious because performance is worse) or other explanations. The authors try to address this by analyzing SD/M, but the conclusion that &quot;increase in reaction time variability was linked to the slowdown of the responses in the older group&quot; is very weird because RTs are not significantly different. I would think that DDM analyses would be very informative here, but that might be taking it too far (given that this does not seem to be the main focus of the paper).</p><p>– Although the sample size is quite considerable for EEG research (and I can imagine data collection for this kind of research to be far from trivial), from a statistical power perspective having only ~36 participants per group amounts to having power to detect effects of roughly.6 (effect size), which is not very sensitive. This clearly plays in the current manuscript as there are several p=.07's (RT differences; PD differences). It is great to see that the authors do no try to interpret these (e.g. not calling the &quot;marginally significant&quot;) but at the same time, in my reading much of these.07s are very likely an issue of statistical power (i.e., BFs would be &quot;uninformative&quot;). The same goes for the correlations in table 1: N=38 gives you power to detect r=.43 correlations only, so I am not sure what to make of these n.s. correlations. Also, I guess that contrary to the EEG analyses, no correction for multiple comparisons was applied here?</p><p>– P.12, lines 21 and onwards; for this result to be compelling the authors should not just show that these effects become n.s., but that there is a &quot;significant decrease&quot; in effect with and without the adjustment (cf. Nieuwenhuis et al., 2011, Nat Neuro).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– There are a lot of figures with plots showing differences e.g. in mean reaction time, amplitude of the CNV, etc. It would be helpful to indicate significance on these plots (e.g. by an asterisk), so that one does not have to search in the text whether something is significant or not.</p><p>– In the Results, the authors describe that ongoing pupil fluctuations happen at slower time scales than EEG fluctuations, and therefore longer time periods are needed to study their dynamics. While I agree completely with this statement, I am wondering why the pupil recordings from the beginning of data acquisition are analysed, and not from during the task? Wouldn't this be possible too, since there are no visual stimuli in this task?</p><p>– The correlation between CNV amplitude fluctuations and behaviour fluctuations (Figure 3) is being described as 'robust' and 'predicted behaviour fluctuations'; however, the correlations are close to zero for both younger and older adults. I would argue for less strong wording here.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75722.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should provide more detailed behavioural results including false alarms and miss rates.</p></disp-quote><p>This information is now included in the manuscript (Results section page 6).

Nevertheless, as the reviewers showed interest in them, we have now decided to include them. We found that the ongoing slow signal fluctuations at baseline (pre-cue) were associated with reaction time in both the EEG and pupil signals. This is now presented in the Results section pages 28/29 and discussed in the Discussion section pages 30/31.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– I felt that this was an excellent paper, but its conclusions seemed very technical.

But perhaps that's fine.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that one of the main contributions of our manuscript relates to the demonstration that ongoing brain activity can have a strong effect on evoked responses and that this modulation should be considered in future research. Importantly, when applied to the question ’does variability in task-related evoked responses change with ageing?’, taking into consideration this confound was crucial to determine that evoked responses are not less variable in older people. This is an important piece of information for the understanding of the origin of increased behaviour variability in ageing, yet, as pointed out by the reviewers, it does not answer what changes with ageing that leads to an increase in behavioural variability, and this is an important question to be addressed in future studies. This is now discussed in the Discussion section page 34.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The behavioral part of the paper feels very underdeveloped.

Older people showed a significantly higher number of misses (trials where they did not respond to the go stimuli) and significantly higher number of times where they impulsively responded to the cue. This happened however in a small number of trials. These results have already been presented in our previous paper (Ribeiro and Castelo-Branco 2019) and are now briefly presented in this manuscript (Results section page 6).</p><p>We have removed the sentence “increase in reaction time variability was linked to the slowdown of the responses in the older group” as our analyses do not allow for a clear identification of the origin of the increased reaction time variability.</p><p>DDM analyses would indeed be informative, however, these are usually applied to choice tasks with reaction time data for both choices (not the case for our go/no-go task).

Also, it is correct that the correlation analyses shown in Table 1 were not corrected for multiple comparisons. We have now, nevertheless, run the correlation analyses including all channels and show that even after correcting for multiple comparisons across channels the relationships are still significant. Note that to include in the manuscript all the figures that were in the supplementary material, we have substituted Table 1 for a figure and its supplement (Figure 7 and Figure 7 – supplementary figure 1.

We have now included in the results the interaction effects from the repeated-measures ANOVA comparing CNV variability including as within-subject factor adjustment (with or without adjusting for the aperiodic measures) and group as between-subject factor. Significant adjustment x group interaction effects were observed for all comparisons (Results section, page 18).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– There are a lot of figures with plots showing differences e.g. in mean reaction time, amplitude of the CNV, etc. It would be helpful to indicate significance on these plots (e.g. by an asterisk), so that one does not have to search in the text whether something is significant or not.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion.

This is particularly important when using single trial data prone to outliers.
