heterogeneity of white matter damage and symptoms in concussion has been identified as a major obstacle to therapeutic innovation. In contrast, most diffusion MRI (dMRI) studies on concussion have traditionally relied on group-comparison approaches that average out heterogeneity. To leverage, rather than average out, concussion heterogeneity, we combined dMRI and multivariate statistics to characterize multi-tract multi-symptom relationships.</p></sec><sec id="abs2"><title>Methods:</title><p>Using cross-sectional data from 306 previously concussed children aged 9–10 from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study, we built connectomes weighted by classical and emerging diffusion measures. These measures were combined into two informative indices, the first representing microstructural complexity, the second representing axonal density. We deployed pattern-learning algorithms to jointly decompose these connectivity features and 19 symptom measures.</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>Early multi-tract multi-symptom pairs explained the most covariance and represented broad symptom categories, such as a general problems pair, or a pair representing all cognitive symptoms, and implicated more distributed networks of white matter tracts. Further pairs represented more specific symptom combinations, such as a pair representing attention problems exclusively, and were associated with more localized white matter abnormalities. Symptom representation was not systematically related to tract representation across pairs. Sleep problems were implicated across most pairs, but were related to different connections across these pairs. Expression of multi-tract features was not driven by sociodemographic and injury-related variables, as well as by clinical subgroups defined by the presence of ADHD. Analyses performed on a replication dataset showed consistent results.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Using a double-multivariate approach, we identified clinically-informative, cross-demographic multi-tract multi-symptom relationships. These results suggest that rather than clear one-to-one symptom-connectivity disturbances, concussions may be characterized by subtypes of symptom/connectivity relationships. The symptom/connectivity relationships identified in multi-tract multi-symptom pairs were not apparent in single-tract/single-symptom analyses. Future studies aiming to better understand connectivity/symptom relationships should take into account multi-tract multi-symptom heterogeneity.</p></sec><sec id="abs5"><title>Funding:</title><p>Financial support for this work came from a Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (G.I.G.), an Ontario Graduate Scholarship (S.S.), a Restracomp Research Fellowship provided by the Hospital for Sick Children (S.S.), an Institutional Research Chair in Neuroinformatics (M.D.), as well as a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council CREATE grant (M.D.).</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Concussions can damage networks of connections in the brain. Scientists have spent decades and millions of dollars studying concussions and potential treatments. Yet, no new treatments are available or in the pipeline. A major reason for this stagnation is that no two concussions are exactly alike. People affected by concussions may have different genetic or socioeconomic backgrounds. The nature of the injury or how its effects change over time may also vary among people with concussions.</p><p>One central question facing scientists is whether there are multiple types of concussions. If so, what distinguishes them and what characteristics do they share. Some studies have looked at differences among subgroups of patients with concussions. But questions remain about whether – beyond differences between the patients – the brain injury itself differs and what impact that has on symptoms or patient trajectory.</p><p>To better characterize different types of concussion, Guberman et al. analyzed diffusion magnetic resonance imaging scans from 306 nine or ten-year-old children with a previous concussion. The children were participants in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. Using specialized statistical techniques, the researchers outlined subgroups of concussions in terms of connections and symptoms and studied how many of these subgroups each patient had. Some types of injury were linked with a category of symptoms like cognitive, mood, or physical symptoms. Some types of damage were linked with specific symptoms. Guberman et al. also found that one symptom, sleep problems, was part of many different injury subtypes. Sleep problems may occur in different patients for different reasons. For example, one patient with sleep difficulties may have experienced damage in brain regions controlling sleep and wakefulness. Another person with sleep problems may have injured parts of the brain responsible for mood and may have depression, which causes excessive sleepiness and difficulties waking up.</p><p>Guberman et al. suggest a new way of thinking about concussions. If more studies confirm these concussion subgroups, scientists might use them to explore which types of therapies might be beneficial for patients with specific subgroups. Developing subgroup-targeted treatments may help scientists overcome the challenges of trying to develop therapies that work across a range of injuries. Similar disease subgrouping strategies may also help researchers study other brain diseases that may vary from patient to patient.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>diffusion MRI</kwd><kwd>pediatric concussions</kwd><kwd>multivariate statistics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guberman</surname><given-names>Guido I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100013873</institution-id><institution>Government of Ontario</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ontario Graduate Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stojanovski</surname><given-names>Sonja</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006126</institution-id><institution>Hospital for Sick Children</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Restracomp Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stojanovski</surname><given-names>Sonja</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009874</institution-id><institution>Université de Sherbrooke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Institutional Research Chair</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Descoteaux</surname><given-names>Maxime</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CREATE Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Descoteaux</surname><given-names>Maxime</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In paediatric concussions, there are a multiplicity of ways that brain damage gives rise to symptoms, most of which are missed by conventional statistical approaches and study designs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Concussion afflicts approximately 600 per 100,000 individuals every year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cassidy et al., 2004</xref>). It is associated with several psychiatric conditions, such as post-traumatic stress disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Orlovska et al., 2014</xref>). Its incidence rate is rising in children and adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>), and compared to adult populations, the impact of concussions on pediatric brains is understudied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mayer et al., 2018</xref>). Despite considerable funding devoted to clinical and basic research, no major advances in therapeutics have been achieved to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kenzie et al., 2017</xref>). A root cause of this stagnation appears to be a contradiction: while all concussions are treated equally in clinical trials and research studies, they are characterized by extensive heterogeneity in their pathophysiology, clinical presentation, symptom severity and duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kenzie et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hawryluk and Bullock, 2016</xref>). Concussion heterogeneity across patients has been identified as a major hurdle in advancing concussion care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kenzie et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hawryluk and Bullock, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Due to shearing forces transmitted during injury, the brain’s white matter is especially vulnerable to concussion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armstrong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bigler and Maxwell, 2012</xref>). Decades of research have studied white matter structure in individuals who sustain concussions. However, most studies continue to assume consistent, one-to-one structure/symptom relationships and employ traditional group comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dodd et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hulkower et al., 2013</xref>), averaging out the diffuse and likely more idiosyncratic patterns of brain structure abnormalities in favor of shared ones. Hence, the extant literature suggests that a large proportion of the clinical and research studies have not adequately accounted for clinical and neuropathological concussion heterogeneity.</p><p>To remedy this shortcoming, a growing number of studies aim to parse the clinical heterogeneity in concussions by algorithmically partitioning patients into discrete subgroups based on symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Langdon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Si et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yeates et al., 2019</xref>). Other studies aim instead to account for heterogeneity in white matter structure alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stojanovski et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Taylor et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ware et al., 2017</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ware et al., 2017</xref> built individualized maps of white matter abnormalities which revealed substantial inter-subject variability in traumatic axonal injury and minimal consistency of subject-level effects. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Taylor et al., 2020</xref> computed a multivariate summary measure of white matter structure across 22 major white matter bundles which achieved better classification accuracy of concussed patients from healthy controls compared to single tract measures. Hence, studies have attempted to address heterogeneity in symptoms and in white matter structure across concussed patients.</p><p>However, white matter alterations due to concussion are diffuse and can elicit several symptoms that may interact with each other in complex and variable ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kenzie et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hawryluk and Bullock, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Iverson, 2019</xref>). For instance, two individuals may suffer a concussion and develop sleep problems. The first may have damaged white matter tracts related to sleep/wakefulness control, whereas the second may have damaged tracts related to mood, causing depression-like symptoms, which include sleep problems. These two individuals will thus display a common symptom but will have overall different symptom profiles and different white matter damage profiles. This example illustrates an additional, hitherto ignored source of heterogeneity, whereby a variety of white matter structure alterations (‘multi-tract’) may be related to a variety of symptoms (‘multi-symptoms’) in different ways. This disease-specific type of heterogeneity will henceforth be referred to as multi-tract multi-symptom heterogeneity for brevity. Parsing concussion heterogeneity requires accounting for these dynamic, multi-tract multi-symptom relationships.</p><p>The objective of the present study was to leverage advanced diffusion MRI (dMRI) methods as well as a double-multivariate approach to parse multi-tract multi-symptom heterogeneity in a large sample of previously concussed children. Multi-tract multi-symptom relationships captured more information than traditional univariate approaches. Expression of multi-tract connectivity features was not driven by sociodemographic strata, injury characteristics, or clinical subgroups. Analyses comparing clinical subgroups defined by the presence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder showed that multi-tract multi-symptom analyses identified disease-specific connectivity patterns that were missed by single-tract single-symptom approaches.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Data in this study were obtained from the world’s largest child development study of its kind – the ongoing longitudinal Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (ABCD Study; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://abcdstudy.org/">https://abcdstudy.org/</ext-link>), data release 2.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://data-archive.nimh.nih.gov/abcd">https://data-archive.nimh.nih.gov/abcd</ext-link>).

We used 24 seeds-per-voxel with the objective of obtaining approximately 2 million streamlines across the entire brain. We used the b = 0, 500, and 1000 shells to perform tensor fitting, and the b = 0 and 3000 shells to perform Constrained Spherical Deconvolution (CSD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Descoteaux et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tournier et al., 2007</xref>).

To implement <italic>connectoflow</italic>, we first removed redundant and irrelevant labels from the fitted atlas (a list of retained labels is supplied in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), yielding a final atlas with 76 labels. We then thresholded matrices such that a connection was only retained if it was found to be successfully reconstructed (defined as the presence of at least one streamline) across 90% of participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guberman et al., 2020a</xref>). We then performed a procedure to minimize the impact of spurious streamlines on our results (see “Accounting for spurious streamlines” paragraph below). We then randomly divided the sample into a discovery dataset (70%, n = 214) and a replication dataset (30%, n = 92). Every step hereafter was performed separately for each dataset. On each dataset, we weighted thresholded connectomes by FA, mean, radial, and axial diffusivities (MD, RD, AD respectively), apparent fiber density along fixels (AFDf), and number of fiber orientations (NuFO) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The first four measures are derived from the tensor model, whereas the latter two are based on fiber orientation distribution functions (fODFs) obtained from CSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Raffelt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dell’Acqua et al., 2013</xref>). Simulation studies have shown that AFD is more specifically related to axonal density, and by computing it along ‘fixels’ (fiber elements), axonal density specific to particular fiber populations can be studied independently of crossing fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Raffelt et al., 2012</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Illustration of the study’s post-processing pipeline.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>). We applied the DKT parcellation onto each tractogram, thus building a binary connectivity matrix that displayed for all 306 subjects in the full dataset (rows), whether (black) or not (white) a streamline existed between each pair of labels (columns). (<bold>B</bold>). We thresholded connectomes using the full dataset, only keeping connections that existed across 90% of participants (a threshold of 100% is illustrated here for simplicity). On these connections, we also filtered streamlines by computing COMMIT weights. This technique assigns weights to streamlines depending on how well they explain the diffusion signal. We identified connections as spurious if all their streamlines had a COMMIT weight of 0. We only retained connections that were found to be non-spurious across 90% of participants in the full dataset. We then split the dataset into a discovery set (n = 214) and a replication set (n = 92). Using the discovery set, we then constructed connectomes of 6 scalar diffusion measures (Fractional Anisotropy (FA), Axial Diffusivity (AD), Mean Diffusivity (MD), Radial Diffusivity (RD), Apparent Fiber Density along fixels (AFDf), and Number of Fiber Orientations (NuFO)), by computing the average measure across each connection. (<bold>C</bold>). We stacked all columns from each connectivity matrix, creating vectors of every pair of subject and connection, and then joined together these vectors. We then performed principal component analysis (PCA) on these matrices. Principal component (PC) scores were calculated for each subject/connection combination, thus reconstructing connectomes weighted by PC scores. (<bold>D</bold>). From each these new connectomes, we selected 200 connections based on Pearson correlations with symptom-oriented measures. We then performed partial least squares correlation on each of these PC-weighted features and symptom measures, which allowed us to obtain pairs of multi-tract connectivity features (‘MCF’) and multi-symptom features (‘MSF’). Each multivariate feature is composed of linear combinations (weighted sums, illustrated by the black arrows called ‘weights’) of variables from its corresponding feature set.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-70450-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Additional data transformations</title><p>We imputed missing connectivity (prior to the PCA), symptom, and nuisance data (sex, pubertal stage, handedness, scanner) by randomly selecting non-missing data from other participants in the same dataset.

From connectivity and symptom data, we regressed out the following nuisance variables: sex, pubertal stage, scanner (only for connectivity data), and handedness.

To minimize the impact of spurious connections on our results, we implemented an approach called Convex optimization modeling for microstructure informed tractography (COMMIT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Daducci et al., 2015</xref>). This technique assigns weights to streamlines based on how they explain the diffusion signal. After running COMMIT, we identified streamlines with weights of 0, which signified that these streamlines were not necessary to explain the dMRI signal because they were spurious or redundant. When all the streamlines of a connection had a weight of 0, the entire connection was considered spurious. We identified non-spurious connections and only kept those that were found to be non-spurious across 90% of participants in the full dataset.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Principal components analysis</title><p>Although individual diffusion measures are related to different aspects of neuropathology, together they provide more information than when considered separately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guberman et al., 2020a</xref>). A recent framework based on principal component analysis (PCA) has been proposed to combine diffusion measures into biologically interpretable indices of white matter structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chamberland et al., 2019</xref>).

PLSc involves singular value decomposition on the covariance matrix between connectivity and symptom features, creating pairs of multivariate connectivity and multivariate symptom features called multi-tract multi-symptom relationships. Each multi-tract multi-symptom relationship encapsulates a linear combination of connectivity features (‘multi-tract features’), a linear combination of symptom scores (‘multi-symptom features’), and an eigenvalue (reflective of the amount of explained covariance between connectivity and symptom features). Each multi-tract multi-symptom relationship is constructed so as to explain a successively smaller portion of the covariance between symptoms and connectivity features. We constructed the largest number of possible multi-tract multi-symptom relationships, given the dimensionality of the behavioral variable set (k = 19) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-11"><title>Selection and interpretation of multi-tract multi-symptom pairs</title><p>To reduce the number of multi-tract multi-symptom pairs to retain for interpretation, we performed permutation testing by randomly shuffling row labels for the symptom features, without replacement, repeating the PLSc and computing eigenvalues at every permutation (2000 iterations).

At each iteration, labels for data were drawn with replacement, the entire PLSc was repeated and the weights for all pairs were obtained.

This process yields a sampling distribution of weights for each connectivity and symptom feature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McIntosh and Lobaugh, 2004</xref>). The ratio of the original weights to the standard error of each measure’s bootstrap distribution can be interpreted as a <italic>z</italic>-score, which yielded so-called ‘bootstrap ratios’.

The first multi-tract multi-symptom pair from the microstructural complexity PLSc broadly represented most symptoms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> polar plot) and implicated a broad range of frontal commissural and occipito-temporal association tracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, violet brain graph). The third multi-tract multi-symptom pair obtained from the axonal density PLSc represented broadly cognitive problems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> polar plot). The multi-symptom feature from the third pair obtained from the microstructural complexity PLSc also represented cognitive problems broadly and implicated a wide array of tracts with a mostly frontal focus. Features from subsequent pairs represented individual cognitive problems, such as feature 8 which represented processing speed, executive function (card sorting), and working memory, and implicated almost exclusively frontal tracts. The seventh pair obtained from the same PLSc represented attention problems almost exclusively, along with decreased sleep and processing speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> polar plot). This pair implicated mostly frontal tracts, including a connection between the left posterior cingulate and left thalamus, a trajectory that is consistent with the corticospinal tract. This pattern whereby pairs ranged from broadly representing symptom categories and distributed networks to more specific symptom combinations with more localized connections can be best appreciated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. As can be observed, certain groups of connections tended to be represented only once alongside broad symptom categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, orange rectangles). More consistent connectivity/symptom correspondences were only observed for few, more specific single-symptom/single-connection combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> blue rectangle).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Patterns of connection/symptom correspondences across multi-tract multi-symptom pairs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>).

Orange rectangles highlight three connections (right lateral occipital – right precuneus; left putamen – left rostral anterior cingulate; left putamen – left lingual) that were only present in one multi-tract multi-symptom pair (pair 3), which also represented broadly all cognitive problems. This pair is illustrated in B, where cognitive problems are illustrated in color and all other symptoms are illustrated in black, and the highlighted connections are circled in orange. Although only three connections are highlighted, several such ‘broad cognitive problems’ connections can be observed. The blue rectangle highlights two connections (right pars opercularis – right post-central; right pars opercularis – right supramarginal) that were present in 4 multi-tract multi-symptom pairs, all of which also implicated attention problems.

First, the second multi-tract multi-symptom pair obtained from both PLSc analyses strongly represented nausea and vomiting, almost exclusively, and implicated no commissural tracts. Second, sleep problems (especially ‘trouble sleeping’) were implicated across several pairs. Interestingly, despite being found ubiquitously across pairs, they were not consistently associated with the same connections across pairs. In contrast, nearly every time attention problems were implicated in a pair (3/4 pairs), they were found alongside two connections with trajectories that correspond to parts of the right superior longitudinal fasciculus (right pars opercularis – right post-central sulcus; right par opercularis – right sumpramarginal gyrus). However, this type of consistent symptom/connection correspondence was more often than not absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Out of 200 connections selected for the microstructural complexity PLSc, 2 were found to be most frequently implicated across all retained pairs. These were the two connections mentioned above that were related to attention problems, the right pars opercularis – right post-central gyrus, and the right pars opercularis to the right supramarginal gyrus. They were implicated in 4 pairs each, two of which were the same (pairs 1 and 8). Callosal tracts were not among the most often implicated connections.</p><p>Overall, these results illustrate how different symptom profiles are associated with different combinations of tracts. Earlier pairs consisted of broad symptom categories and implicated wider networks of connectivity features, whereas more idiosyncratic pairs consisted of more localized connectivity features that were associated with more symptom-specific profiles. However, some symptoms such as sleep problems were implicated across the spectrum of different multi-tract multi-symptom pairs, illustrating how some symptoms do not demonstrate a one-to-one relationship with connectivity features across multi-tract multi-symptom pairs. No tracts were widely implicated across all pairs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Multi-tract multi-symptom features and clinical subgroup membership</title><p>We identified 33 individuals in the discovery set with diagnoses of ADHD obtained from the KSADS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dodd et al., 2014</xref>). These individuals are shown in black in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> (scatter plots). Despite forming a clinical subgroup based on a gold-standard measure of psychiatric pathology, these individuals were heterogeneous in their expression of multi-tract and multi-symptom features. Further, we computed correlations between the expression of these multivariate features and clinical subgroup membership, and found weak, albeit significant correlations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> scatter plots and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Multivariate vs univariate approaches</title><p>We compared microstructural complexity and axonal density scores across all 200 connections between individuals with and without an ADHD diagnosis, and calculated the percent overlap between each multi-tract connectivity feature and the set of tracts found to be significant in univariate comparisons (ostensibly ‘ADHD-related’ tracts). The percent overlap scores are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Notably, the highest overlap occurred with multi-tract connectivity feature 1 (10–13%) from both PLSc analyses, which implicated a wide network of white matter tracts and were associated with general problems. In contrast, the overlap with multi-tract connectivity feature 7, which implicated mostly frontal connections and was associated with attention problems almost exclusively, was low (5%). Neither of the two univariate analyses implicated the two connections discussed above (right pars opercularis – right post-central sulcus; right par opercularis – right sumpramarginal gyrus) that were consistently associated with attention problems. These results suggest that the putative ‘ADHD-related’ connections identified in univariate comparisons of microstructural complexity and axonal density measures between individuals with ADHD and those without are mostly non-overlapping with the connections identified in an attention-problems specific multi-tract multi-symptom pair.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Relationship with sociodemographic and injury-related factors</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref> illustrates the expression of multi-tract connectivity features color-coded by sociodemographic strata defined by sex, total combined household income, and race/ethnicity. Qualitatively, no clusters defined by these sociodemographic strata are apparent. Further, correlations between multi-tract/multi-symptom feature expression and binary (or dummy-coded) variables defining each strata are overall weak and non-significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>). Out of 24 retained multi-tract multi-symptom pairs, time since the latest injury was only significantly correlated to the expression of one multi-tract connectivity features (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) and no multi-symptom features. Only the expression of two multi-tract connectivity features (features 2 and 15 from the microstructural complexity PLSc) were significantly different between groups defined by injury cause (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">Appendix 1—figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">7</xref>, respectively). Only the expression of one multi-tract connectivity features, feature 15 from the microstructural complexity PLSc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig8">Appendix 1—figure 8</xref>) significantly differed between groups defined by the total number of TBIs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Results on the replication dataset</title><p>We first analyzed the amount of connectivity/symptom covariance explained by each of the multi-tract/multi-symptom pairs. We found that approximately 26% of the connectivity/symptom covariance in the replication set was explained by the first multi-tract/multi-symptom pair from the microstructural complexity PLSc, and 40% was explained by the corresponding pair from the axonal density PLSc. However, with permutation testing, these percentages were not found to be significantly higher than expected by chance. We then projected the replication dataset onto the latent spaces obtained using the discovery set, and ran correlations comparing multi-tract multi-symptom feature expression against a binary variable indexing the dataset. We found very low, non-significant correlations (all coefficients lower than 0.01) between multi-tract and multi-symptom feature expression and set membership. Finally, we reran our PCA and PLSc analyses on the replication set, and compared the features obtained against the original results. The loadings obtained from the PCA performed on the replication set are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig9">Appendix 1—figure 9</xref>. The loadings for the first two PCs from both sets of analyses were highly correlated (<italic>r</italic> = 0.9997, p &lt; 0.001; <italic>r</italic> = 0.996, p &lt; 0.001). Out of the 200 connections originally selected in the discovery set, 73 were also selected in the replication set. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig10">Appendix 1—figure 10</xref> illustrates the loadings for all the multi-symptom features retained after permutation testing. Correlations between the loadings of these new multi-symptom features and the ones obtained from the original PLSc analyses were low to high (0.087–0.810). The correlations between the loadings of the 73 connections that were common to both PLSc analyses were very low to moderate (0.006–0.227). However, the correlations between expression of multi-symptom features obtained from the PLSc performed on the replication dataset and those obtained by projecting the replication set onto the original latent spaces reached higher values (0.01–0.979), which was also found for those between expression of multi-tract features (0.02–0.67). Altogether, these results suggest that despite having mostly different connectivity inputs due to the feature selection step, the analyses led to similar multi-tract multi-symptom features.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Sensitivity analyses</title><p>We first tested the impact that changing the number of retained connections would have on PLSc results. The percentage of covariance explained by the first multi-tract multi-symptom pair from the microstructural complexity PLSc is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig11">Appendix 1—figure 11</xref>. Initially, the percentage of covariance explained increased with an increasing number of connections, and stabilized around 200 connections. These results suggest that a selection of 200 connections is close to the optimal amount that could have been selected.</p><p>We then assessed the impact of modifying our resampling approach, attempting instead to shuffle the original connectivity features before the feature selection step. Using this stricter approach yielded no significant multivariate pairs on permutation testing.</p><p>We then assessed the impact of using different thresholds to retain connections (t = 85%, 95%, 100%). All 629 connections that had survived COMMIT in the original analyses (t = 90%) were among the 1,142 connections that survived the t = 85% threshold, and the 877 connections that survived the t = 95% threshold. Hence, after COMMIT, the same 629 connections were selected in all three thresholds, which led to identical data going into all subsequent analyses. Differences were only seen for t = 100%, where 258 connections survived thresholding. After COMMIT, 252 connections survived, suggesting that only 6 connections that were considered ‘spurious’ were found across 100% of participants. These results suggest that highly consistent connections also tended to be the ones found by COMMIT to be ‘non-spurious’. Compared to the original threshold, the connectivity features obtained from the t = 100% threshold after PCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>), and the weights of the multi-symptom features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig12">Appendix 1—figure 12</xref>) were highly similar. However, using permutation testing, only two multi-tract multi-symptom pairs (12 and 15) were found to be significant (although in the figure, the same multi-symptom features that had been retained using the 90% threshold are shown, to facilitate comparison with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4</xref>). Correlations between expression of multi-tract connectivity features at t = 90% and t = 100% are illustrated in the appendix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig13">Appendix 1—figure 13</xref>). Correlations between the expression of the corresponding multi-tract connectivity features (e.g.: multi-tract feature 1 from t = 90%, multi-tract feature 1 from t = 100%) had high correlations overall, with exceptions arising around the middle features (7-14). As can be observed in both <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig12">12</xref>, these middle features appeared to be switched in order. For instance, multi-symptom feature 8 from the microstructural complexity PLSc using the t = 90% threshold was similar to the multi-symtom feature 7 from the PLSc using the t = 100% threshold, and the expression of these two features were highly correlated as well. Overall, these results indicate that features obtained from the PLSc analyses were similar across thresholds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig13">Appendix 1—figure 13</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, we leveraged novel dMRI methods and a double-multivariate approach to parse heterogeneity in the relationship between white matter structure and symptoms in a large sample of previously-concussed children. By applying PLSc on biologically interpretable measures of dMRI obtained from PCA, we found cross-demographic multi-tract multi-symptom features that captured information about structure/symptom relationships that traditional approaches missed. More representative multi-tract multi-symptom pairs represented broader symptom categories and implicated wider networks of connections, whereas more idiosyncratic pairs represented more specific symptom combinations and implicated more localized connections. Whereas certain symptom/tract correspondences were consistent across the pairs that implicated them, more often than not, tracts were not consistently associated with the same symptoms across pairs. This finding was especially apparent for sleep problems, which were implicated across most pairs. These results suggest that rather than a clean and consistent set of one-to-one symptom/tract relationships, concussions may instead be composed of subsets of symptom combinations that are associated with combinations of structural alterations of different white matter tracts.</p><p>Defining concussions as a clinical syndrome characterized by a set of symptoms stemming from a set of alterations of brain structure and function, multi-tract multi-symptom pairs can be thought of as subtypes of concussion (i.e.: of structure/symptom relationships), not of concussion patients. Patients with concussions can express these different concussion subtypes to varying degrees. We theorize that the combination of these different subtypes and how much they are expressed is what determines the clinical syndrome a person will display. The pairs explaining the most covariance can be interpreted as the subtypes that are most commonly expressed across individuals. Whether these subtypes are dataset-specific remains to be explored. Multi-tract relationships may be driven by the metabolic demands imposed by the network structure of the brain, which is known to predict the course of several brain diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crossley et al., 2014</xref>), by biomechanical constraints imposed by the skull and other structures exposing certain areas to more shearing strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hernandez et al., 2019</xref>), or by both factors simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2020</xref>). These possibilities need to be tested further. Multi-symptom relationships may be driven by feedback mechanisms, with symptoms potentiating each other. One example is sleep: sleep disturbances were implicated in nearly all multi-tract multi-symptom pairs, but showed no consistent correspondence with any particular connection. This result suggests that sleep disturbances across concussed patients may not be associated with the same neural substrate, but may instead arise, in some concussions, as a consequence of other symptoms. Previous theoretical work has proposed that sleep may play a central role in concussions, given that it can arise as a consequence of certain symptoms but can also potentiate other symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kenzie et al., 2018</xref>). The current findings are consistent with this previous work.</p><p>Concussion heterogeneity has been identified as a major obstacle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kenzie et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hawryluk and Bullock, 2016</xref>) in response to decades of failed attempts to translate basic science findings into successful clinical trials and novel therapies. Heterogeneity in symptoms, impact of injury on brain structure and function, and pre-injury factors pose a particular problem for most concussion neuroimaging studies which have traditionally employed univariate comparisons between concussed and healthy or orthopedic injury control groups, or between patients with and without persistent symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dodd et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hulkower et al., 2013</xref>). These sources of inter-subject variability are believed to be problematic because they decrease the statistical power needed for group comparisons and multivariable models to detect the often-subtle effects of concussions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maas et al., 2013</xref>). To overcome this challenge, landmark initiatives such as the IMPACT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maas et al., 2013</xref>), InTBIR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tosetti et al., 2013</xref>), CENTER TBI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maas et al., 2015</xref>), and TRACK TBI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bodien et al., 2018</xref>) aim to standardize and pool multi-center data collected across sociodemographic strata, to identify and statistically correct for pre-injury factors known to impact brain structure, and develop diagnostic and prognostic tools leveraging multimodal data and increasingly sophisticated machine-learning approaches.</p><p>In this study, we posited that disease-specific concussion heterogeneity is also problematic because by pooling across patients, idiosyncratic patterns of connectivity that may be more symptom-specific are sacrificed in favour of shared ones. By assuming that symptoms map cleanly and consistently onto shared connectivity abnormalities in a one-to-one fashion, erroneous inferences could be made about relationships between group-level patterns of connectivity differences and specific symptoms. Our results are consistent with this idea: univariate comparisons between a clinical subgroup defined by a diagnosis of ADHD and the rest of the sample identified connectivity features that mostly overlapped with the first multi-tract multi-symptom pair obtained from both PLSc analyses. These pairs, which accounted for the most covariance, reflected general problems and not specifically ADHD. Both these pairs and the univariate ‘ADHD-related’ connections implicated a distributed network of tracts. Instead, a multi-tract multi-symptom pair that more uniquely represented attention problems implicated mostly frontal connections, including a connection that was part of the corticospinal tract. These findings are consistent with prior literature showing differences in white matter structure, especially in the corticospinal tract, among children with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Silk et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Puzzo et al., 2018</xref>). Nonetheless, children with ADHD were heterogeneous in the expression of this more attention-specific multi-tract multi-symptom pair, suggesting that this clinical subgroup of children with TBIs may have important differences that can be further investigated. Across pairs, nearly every time attention problems were implicated, they were found alongside two connections with trajectories that correspond to parts of the right superior longitudinal fasciculus. This result is consistent with previous work that has shown differences in the structure of the right superior longitudinal fasciculus in children and adults with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cortese et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hamilton et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Konrad et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Makris et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wolfers et al., 2015</xref>). Overall, these results suggest that univariate comparisons in concussed children, even when performed in such a way as to identify a diagnosis-specific set of connectivity features, identified only the most consistent group-level connectivity differences at the expense of more symptom-specific idiosyncratic ones.</p><p>The present findings must be contrasted to the nascent literature addressing concussion heterogeneity. A few recent studies have parsed inter-subject heterogeneity in concussion symptoms, using clustering analyses to group concussion patients into discrete subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Langdon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Si et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yeates et al., 2019</xref>). The symptoms displayed by these reported subgroups differed from those implicated in the multi-symptom features found in the present study. Differences between symptom profiles arose because our multi-symptom features are associated with white matter structure and not driven by variability in symptoms alone. Other prior studies have attempted to address inter-subject heterogeneity in white matter structure in concussions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stojanovski et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Taylor et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ware et al., 2017</xref>). Using two different approaches, these studies generated point summaries that accounted for the high-dimensional variability of white matter structure to better distinguish patients from controls. These prior studies, using a variety of approaches, have all focused on parsing down inter-subject heterogeneity in symptoms or white matter structure. Our approach focuses instead on disease-specific heterogeneity in structure/symptom relationships.</p><p>The present results should be considered in light of methodological limitations. Data on mTBI occurrence was collected retrospectively. Participants did not have baseline data, and additionally had highly variable times since injury. Most individuals with concussions recover from their injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leddy et al., 2012</xref>) which should have led to a concussed group where most participants were similar to healthy controls. Interestingly, our PCA yielded combinations of diffusion measures that differed from those of two prior studies that have used this approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chamberland et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geeraert et al., 2020</xref>). These prior studies used samples of typically developing children without neurological insults. To the extent that the PCs reported in these prior studies reflect healthy neurotypical brains, our PCs suggest that our concussed sample was not as similar in white matter structure to healthy controls as expected. However, variable time since injury made the interpretation of patterns of microstructure difficult. Further, due to the cross-sectional nature of this data, the difference between symptoms and pre-existing characteristics are difficult to discern, especially since some behavioral measures often believed to be symptoms of concussion, such as attention problems, can also be risk factors for brain injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guberman et al., 2020b</xref>). Heterogeneity has several forms, including in symptoms, duration, severity, neuropathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bigler and Maxwell, 2012</xref>), lesion location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ware et al., 2017</xref>), sociodemographics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maas et al., 2013</xref>), genetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stojanovski et al., 2019a</xref>), behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guberman et al., 2020b</xref>), pre-injury comorbidities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yue et al., 2019</xref>), and environmental differences, including access to and quality of care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yue et al., 2020</xref>). These factors have been theorized to interact in complex ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kenzie et al., 2017</xref>). This study only addressed a minority of these complex relationships, further studies integrating more variable sets are needed to address these other drivers of heterogeneity. The connectivity features that were studied came from connectomes, not from well-known bundles. This choice was made to obtain a larger coverage of white matter structure, but as a result, sacrificed interpretability. The reason is that the connectivity features studied here may or may not represent true anatomical units, and hence cannot be interpreted easily on their own. Instead, we relied on patterns across tracts, such as counting the number of connections that corresponded to the same symptom across different multi-tract multi-symptom pairs. Future studies should contrast this approach against procedures used to extract large well-known bundles. Lastly, methodological choices are a central part of this study. As illustrated by the sensitivity analyses and analyses performed on the replication set, some parts of the analytical pipeline were robust to methodological variations, whereas others were not. For instance, the PLSc procedure was robust to variations in input data. This was evidenced by the non-significant correlations between multi-tract multi-symptom feature expressions and a variable indexing the dataset, as well as the similarities observed after running the PLSc analyses on the replication set. However, the univariate feature selection approach was not as robust, as shown by the low overlap of connections when using different input datasets, as well as the loss of significant permutation test results when using a stricter resampling method that reshuffled prior to feature selection. Importantly, this study was not attempting to identify a single best analytical approach for studying multi-tract multi-symptom relationships. Rather, this project aimed to present a fundamentally different way of understanding concussions. Among the myriad of options available, we found a compromise between novel, cutting-edge techniques, and established, well-known ones. However, for parts of the analytical pipeline, refinements can be made. Future iterations of this work will need to exert better control of time since injury, perform longitudinal follow-up, develop predictive models for clinical outcomes, and assess the impact of choices made among the panoply of alternatives along key steps of the analytical pipeline.</p><p>Conversely, this study leveraged some of the most recent and important advances in dMRI to address the major limitations of conventional approaches. We used high-quality multi-shell dMRI data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jones et al., 2013</xref>), as well as modeling approaches, tractography techniques, and microstructural measures robust to crossing fibers, partial volume effects, and connectivity biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Girard et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Descoteaux et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tournier et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Raffelt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dell’Acqua et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chamberland et al., 2019</xref>). We used PCA to combine dMRI measures into meaningful indices of white matter structure. Lastly, we used gold-standard measures of psychiatric illness to divide the sample into meaningful clinical subgroups.</p><p>In conclusion, leveraging advanced dMRI and a pattern-learning algorithm to parse white matter structure/symptom heterogeneity, we have found clinically-meaningful, cross-demographic multi-tract multi-symptom relationships. As the field moves towards large-scale studies which aim to statistically control for sociodemographic sources of heterogeneity to detect a putative consistent white matter signature of concussion across patients, the fundamental insight of this study should be taken into consideration: when pooling across patients, disease-specific multi-tract multi-symptom heterogeneity is lost, leading to the loss of informative, clinically-meaningful, symptom-specific patterns of connectivity abnormalities. Future studies aiming to better understand the relationship between white matter abnormalities and concussion symptomatology should look beyond the group-comparison design and consider multi-tract multi-symptom heterogeneity.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>works as Chief Scientific Officer for IMEKA.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Drs. Shackman (Reviewing Editor) and Büchel (Senior Editor). The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>While the Reviewers highlighted several strengths of the manuscript, they also raised some potentially important concerns about the manuscript in its present form.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The need to quantitatively investigate heterogeneity</p><p>– One weakness of the study stems from a possible, and understandable confusion between heterogeneity and complexity. The study successfully targets the potential complexity of links between observed symptoms and underlying neurobiological mechanisms. Authors use a method that can identify multi-tract multi-symptom relationships, elaborating the inter-relatedness of different brain network features as well as the network of symptoms. Nevertheless, there is no analysis in the manuscript that explicitly studies heterogeneity, such as analyses on inter-subject variability (possibly comparing this to the variability within a healthy sample) or the grouping of subjects and variability of symptom/track profiles assigned to the groups. The manuscript would benefit greatly from such analyses.</p><p>– The only analysis that is related to the heterogeneity is Figure 2, which is a qualitative analysis. The black dots did not constitute a clear cluster and extended over a large portion of the scatter plot(s). I would appreciate a more quantitative analysis.</p><p>Better integration of goals and methods in the Results</p><p>Before reading the methods, I had a hard time understanding the results</p><p>– If authors want to keep the same structure, they should include short explanations within the results, describing briefly &quot;what and how is done&quot; in each section. For example, the section &quot;Combined measures of white matter tract microstructure&quot; starts with &quot;The PCA yielded two biologically-interpretable components…&quot;, and it is not clear what features PCA was applied to and why. Similarly, it is not clear what PLSc stands for, or how and why it was used</p><p>– Comparisons between univariate and multivariate approaches should be explained better in the results. I had to read it twice and then go to the Methods section to understand what was done there. The explanation in the Methods section is much better and cleaner than what is given in the Results section.</p><p>2. The need to address potentially spurious connections</p><p>– There are concerns that some of the connections represented in the 76x76 connectivity matrix used here are spurious connections due to limitations of tractography that cannot be resolved with current methods, especially as the streamlines derived in tractography come close to cortex. These limitations can affect results even when using the state of the art tractography algorithm that was used here, (as demonstrated in Girard et al., 2020, Neuroimage, 221: 117201).</p><p>– The computational tractography arsenal includes several additional ways that could have been used to somewhat mitigate these concerns, including post-processing of the streamlines (e.g., with SIFT or LiFE), using surface-enhanced tractography methods (these may have been used here, but not mentioned) to increase the quality of tractography, and/or focusing on well-defined anatomical structures in the core of the white matter that can be well-detected using bundle recognition algorithms, and where tractography uncertainty due to the indeterminacy of the signal is of less concern. These issues seem particularly important given the substantial difference in the results between the 95% threshold and 100% threshold requirement for inclusion of an edge in the analysis</p><p>– Regarding my comments about tractography methods, I think that improvements to the tractography methods would improve the confidence in the results that are presented here. At the very least, one way to deal with these concerns is to discuss them, and to acknowledge that the estimation procedures used here produce not &quot;tracts&quot; but rather the edges of a connectivity graph, and that these may or may not represent anatomical units.</p><p>3. Concerns with the analytic approach and stability across feature selection</p><p>– Data were collected at multiple sites, and site differences should be considered. Authors say the scanner variable was regressed out from the connectivity data, which is fine, but it would be nice to see the site differences and the effect of regressing it out in a more systematic way.</p><p>– With the bootstrap analysis, how is it guaranteed that you get the same pairs each time? Please clarify.</p><p>– I wonder whether the procedure used to assess the statistical significance of the multi-tract multi-symptom pairs (lines 463-467) doesn't unfairly favor the ones in the unshuffled data. Shouldn't this procedure also include the preliminary feature selection step (lines 427-430) also in the shuffled data? It seems like it should, because some of the correlation in the PLSc is due to these univariate correlations, which could arise by chance in high-dimensional data.</p><p>– Uni vs multivariate 1 of 2. Is it any surprising or even interesting that the correlations between multi-tract and multi-symptom features were higher than all univariate correlations? With PLSc, latent modes are constructed (i.e., coefficients of tracts and symptoms are determined) to maximize the correlations. Thus, it is an expected outcome that those correlations would be higher than univariate correlations. Unless I am missing something, which is possible, I don't think this fact can be reported as a finding. Authors need to clarify this point, or revise the way in which these analyses and results are framed and interpreted.</p><p>– Uni vs multivariate 2 of 2. I also have a few questions regarding comparisons of univariate and mulivariate correlations: Line 122 – 124 makes a statement comparing these values, but doesn't provide quantitative information. Also, I might be misunderstanding, but don't the highest PLSc values have to be at least as high as the highest bi-variate correlation by construction? Are the differences between these values higher than would be expected by chance? In Figure 3, the two univariate brain graphs (red and blue) look very similar to each other. Are they as similar as they seem there? Are the multi-tracts implicated by PLSc1 also similar to the multi-tracts implicated in PLSc2?</p><p>– Why 200 features? Would the results change substantially if you use 100? Is there some way to select a reasonably small number of features empirically (e.g., based on a scree plot?).</p><p>4. Concerns with the approach to psychopathology</p><p>– One reviewer noted that: It is not the best practice to combine all possible psychiatric conditions within a single group and call it &quot;adverse psychiatric outcome&quot;. This adversely affects the interpretability of findings. Knowing that one of the multi-tract features correlates with the adverse psychiatric outcome is not much informative and clinically valuable. Authors need to devise a more appropriate approach. At minimum, they need to provide a compelling motivation for the current approach.</p><p>– While the other reviewer noted that: Some comments regarding the participants that were classified as having psychopathology (marked in black in the scatter plots in Figure 2). It is not clear why these participants were selected based on the CBCL scores, which are indirect measures of psychopathology, rather than the more direct KSADS psychopathology scores? If there are 55% with psychopathological KSADS score, that should provide more than 28 participants marked here. I am also not sure that I agree with the statement that the 28 individuals highlighted in black would be grouped together in clinical studies, given their psychopathology probably varies widely. It is not clear to me whether the paragraph on lines 125 – 131 claims that these participants are different from the other participants in terms of their multi-tract/multi-symptom scores or are not different from the other participants. It seems to me that they might be different based on the first multi-tract/multi-symptom scores (which are both slightly higher in this group), but there might also not be enough subjects to demonstrate this difference statistically. I think that this would also be consistent with the subsequently-described overlap between this score and the univariate scores (lines 132-141).</p><p>5. Concerns with claims of replication</p><p>– The presentation of the results doesn't make it clear whether the structure that was identified in the discovery dataset does in fact replicate in the replication set. Similarly, it hard to judge what to make of the differences in the results of the logistic regression between the samples. If I understand correctly, the logistic regression in the discovery sample indicates as predictive of psychopathology features that are different than the feature that was indicated in the discovery set. But this might lead us to wonder: How should we interpret this? For example, if I had a measurement from a new child that has had a concussion, which of the two models would I use to predict whether they might develop a psychopathology? The one derived in the discovery set or the one remaining feature that was indicated in the discovery set? Authors need to clearly explain the logic and evidence that supports their claim.</p><p>– Regarding my comments about the comparison to the replication set, I think that a few direct comparisons might help. For example, how much of the covariance in the discovery set is explained by the same multi-tract/multi-symptom pair that explained more than 40% of the covariance in the microstructural complexity PLSc in the discovery set? Or, possibly even more rigorous: if you ran a PLSc on the discovery set how similar would the feature sets be? I realize that this might not be possible, given the smaller sample size and the choice of 200 features in the feature-selection phase.</p><p>6. The need for a more sober and precise Discussion</p><p>– Authors say in the discussion that &quot;these results recapitulated well-known findings from the concussion literature and revealed new insights…&quot;. Yet it is not clear what those well-known findings are and what new insights were revealed</p><p>– Overall, the narrative in the Results section would benefit from a better organization</p><p>– Authors should consider reporting more quantitative results, including tables to summarize findings, and precise comparisons of their results with published work.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Multi-tract multi-symptom relationships in pediatric concussion&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Drs. Shackman (Reviewing Editor) and Büchel (Senior Editor), in close consultation with the 2 expert Reviewers.</p><p>Both Reviewers expressed some enthusiasm for the revision, noting that</p><p>&quot;I think the authors did a great job of reorganizing the manuscript and addressing almost all issues raised by reviewers,&quot; and</p><p>&quot;The authors have made substantial changes to the manuscript in their revision and extensive additional analysis has been added in response to the comments made on the previous version. I believe that many of these changes help improve the article, and could provide some more clarity about the robustness of the method proposed and its application. In particular, new analyses that describe the robustness of the approach, and new comparisons with the replication sample could help establish confidence in the conclusions.&quot;</p><p>Nevertheless, there was consensus that additional major revisions are required, as detailed below</p><p>Abstract</p><p>– In the abstract, results are limited to findings in ADHD and the replication set, but both are rather secondary/supporting results. There is virtually nothing about the main findings. How do certain combinations of symptoms relate to certain combinations of tracts? I would give specific results in the abstract with the highest importance, possibly mentioning specific symptom-tract couples, rather than sharing very generic comments, such as &quot;These clinically-informative, cross demographic multi-tract multi-symptom relationships recapitulated well-known findings…&quot; Such text is more suitable for the Conclusions.</p><p>– The current Conclusions in the abstract is again extremely generic and does not fit well the findings. The manuscript does not include much on &quot;stratification strategies&quot; or &quot;predictive biomarkers&quot;. It would be better to discuss how specific findings of the current study would fuel future studies.</p><p>Abstract/Introduction/Results/Discussion</p><p>– Overall, the main goal (not methodological but rather scientific) of the study should be clearer, both in the abstract and other sections (especially, Results). It should be clear for the reader what they learn new about concussion/TBI and how those findings can be used in practice (e.g., in research, in clinics, …).</p><p>– The new focus on ADHD is reasonable, but I would have liked to see more treatment in the manuscript of the relationship between ADHD and concussion and what we learn from the current analysis (if at all) about this relationship. As it is right now, the choice to analyze ADHD is not strongly motivated by the Introduction, and the interpretation of the results does not clearly help us understand what we learned here, beyond the fact that manifestations of concussion in participants with ADHD are heterogeneous.</p><p>Results/Discussion</p><p>– The text in the introduction (page 3, lines 87-96), nicely summarizes the main contribution: &quot;… display a common symptom but will have overall different symptom profiles and different white matter damage profiles… a variety of white matter structure alterations (&quot;multi-tract&quot;) may be related to a variety of symptoms (&quot;multi-symptoms&quot;) in different ways.&quot; This is very clear and interesting. What is missing is that results do not demonstrate this interesting phenomenon clearly. There is one example in Discussions (page 21, lines 600-6004), but it is limited to ADHD symptoms. It would be great if more results/discussions were included about specific symptoms and how they are associated with specific tracts. If possible, talk more about symptom-tract pairs; specifically showing how same/similar symptoms might be related to different tracts. Or how different combinations of symptoms are linked to different tract combinations. This is the most important part of the manuscript, and the results should reflect this fact.</p><p>– The inclusion of new control analysis that uses COMMIT to identify spurious connections is great. I think that the added text on lines 666 – 690 raise important caveats and future directions, which will give the readers not as familiar with the details of dMRI research important context to understand the work. On the other hand, it is very hard to judge the similarity between the results in Appendix 1 Figure 4 and Appendix 1 Figure 14. In particular, there seem to be no black stars in Figure 14 (despite the caption mentioning them). Does this mean that no MCF symptom features are significant in this analysis when COMMIT is used? That would be a real problem for the robustness of this approach to issues related to tractography that are mentioned in this part of the discussion.</p><p>– Figure 3 (and the comparison between univariate and multivariate measures) is still hard to understand.</p><p>A) The authors stated in the response to the reviews that &quot;Figure 3 has been modified, illustrating now two univariate brain graphs (contrasting PC1 and PC2 scores as a function of ADHD diagnosis), and three multivariate brain graphs (PLSc1 – pair 1, PLSc2 – pair 3, and PLSc1 – pair 7).&quot; I see the latter, but not the former. Figure 3 also has two correlation coefficients inset in each plot, (e.g., &quot;r=0.38&quot; and &quot;r=0.26&quot; in the right-hand side of the first row). What do these coefficients refer to?</p><p>B) Relatedly, the methods say (starting on line 279) that &quot;Using threshold of p&lt;0.05, we computed univariate comparisons of connectivity (PC scores) between individuals with and those without a diagnosis of ADHD thus identifying putative &quot;ADHD-related&quot; univariate connectivity features.&quot; This sounds reasonable, but I don't see the conclusion from this analysis in the Results section. Is there a univariate difference between the PC scores of individuals diagnosed with ADHD and those that were not? Was this comparison conducted only within the group that had a psychopathological KSADS scores? In other words, on line 273 in the phrase &quot;We divided the sample&quot;, does the word &quot;sample&quot; here refer only to (how many?) participants who had any psychopathology? Is only their data presented in Figure 3? Or is that all 214 of the discovery set participants?</p><p>C) Furthermore, I am still struggling to understand whether I should interpret Figure 3 as indicating a difference between the subjects marked in black (now subjects diagnosed with ADHD) and the other subjects in the multivariate analysis. As far as I can tell, these individuals (black dots in the scatter plots) are not different in any discernible way from the other participants in these plots (colored dots) -- certainly not in pair 3 (the middle line), where the black dots and colored dots seem completely intermingled. Is there some way to evaluate the difference between the groups across all of the multi-symptom/multi-tract features?</p><p>D) In the same section, what is the statistical test that supports the statement &quot;Further, we computed correlations between the expression of these multivariate features and clinical subgroup membership, and found weak, albeit significant correlations&quot;? It would be good to apply such a statistical test to all of the multi-tract multi-symptom features, and report the results of this test as part of this section, just as it would be good to report the results of a direct test of the &quot;univariate&quot; PCA differences. I believe that this would provide a stronger assessment of multivariate vs. univariate approaches.</p><p>– This might just be a wording issue, but I don't understand the following statement (L413- 416): &quot;Despite forming a clinical subgroup based on a gold-standard measure of psychiatric pathology, these individuals were differentiable by their expression of multi-tract and multi-symptom features&quot;. Maybe the problem is the word &quot;differentiable&quot;? If this is really what you meant, may I suggest something a bit more direct, such as &quot;…, these individuals were heterogeneous in their expression of multi-tract and multi-symptom features&quot;?</p><p>– The analysis on the replication set is much improved in the revision, but questions still remain here as well. First, are 12% and 33% of the covariance that were explained in the replication set, using MCF1 in both PLSc analysis more than would be expected by chance? I think that this could be established through a permutation test in the replication set or some other statistical test. Another question that arises from the comparison is that it looks as though the first set of symptom weights obtained in the PLSc for microstructural complexity in the replication set (Y_1 in Appendix 1, Figure 11) is completely inverted relative to the set of weights in this PLSc conducted on the discovery set. Is this anti-correlation somehow trivial? Or is it significant (either statistically or conceptually)? What do we learn from the fact that the features selected in the discovery and replication sets are quite different? Does performing the COMMIT analysis in both the discovery and replication set improve the situation? Surely the feature selection step is affected by the 35% of connections that COMMIT finds to be spurious in the discovery set? Why not remove them with COMMIT and proceed from there? I realize that you can't try all the different permutations of analysis pipelines, but using COMMIT seems like a principled way to improve the robustness specifically of this part of the pipeline. I also think that the probe for correlation between expression of the multi-symptom multi-tract features and dataset is clever, but some of the explanations that now appear in the response to the reviews (and particularly about this point) should probably appear in the Discussion section, to help readers understand what the point of this analysis is. In general, I wonder whether, now that lines 618 – 626 have been removed, the authors could discuss the implications of the analysis of the replication set in the Discussion. I think that having a replication set analysis is a real strength of the paper.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>– While it is discussed in Discussions how a multivariate approach better captured ADHD-related symptoms than a univariate approach, this is not clear in Results. When I first read it in the discussions, I was surprised but then remembered the parts in the results (scattered all around) that supported this claim. I would make this comparison clearer under the &quot;Results / Multivariate vs Univariate Approaches&quot; section.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70450.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The need to quantitatively investigate heterogeneity</p><p>– One weakness of the study stems from a possible, and understandable confusion between heterogeneity and complexity. The study successfully targets the potential complexity of links between observed symptoms and underlying neurobiological mechanisms. Authors use a method that can identify multi-tract multi-symptom relationships, elaborating the inter-relatedness of different brain network features as well as the network of symptoms. Nevertheless, there is no analysis in the manuscript that explicitly studies heterogeneity, such as analyses on inter-subject variability (possibly comparing this to the variability within a healthy sample) or the grouping of subjects and variability of symptom/track profiles assigned to the groups. The manuscript would benefit greatly from such analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this helpful comment. We agree that our use of the term “heterogeneity” in this context was not as clear as we thought. What the study is meant to target is specifically heterogeneity in how white matter structure alterations (or combinations of them) relate to symptoms. We argue that there are multiple ways that white matter abnormalities are related to symptoms. It is these different relationships that we call multi-tract multi-symptom relationships, and these are the relationships that we wanted to study. Multi-tract multi-symptom relationships reflect heterogeneity of the disease, rather than that of individual subjects. Although “disease heterogeneity” is a factor in “disease complexity”, when revising the manuscript we opted for the first term because it more clearly conveys the multiplicity of structure/symptom relationships that we are aiming to study.</p><p>We have modified the manuscript clarify this point and more accurately reflect the primary goal of our investigation.</p><p>Modifications:</p><p>“This example illustrates an additional, hitherto ignored source of heterogeneity, whereby a variety of white matter structure alterations (“multi-tract”) may be related to a variety of symptoms (“multi-symptoms”) in different ways.

The black dots did not constitute a clear cluster and extended over a large portion of the scatter plot(s). I would appreciate a more quantitative analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree that the black dots did not form a clear cluster, and that is in fact one of the core arguments that we were attempting to make. What would have ostensibly been a cluster based on more rudimentary features like Child Behavior Checklist scores are in fact quite different with respect to their expression of these multi-tract multi-symptom features.</p><p>To address your comment (along with comment 4c), we changed the variable we used to form these psychopathology subgroups and implemented a quantitative analysis. Specifically, we used the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Aged Children (KSADS) questionnaire to identify children with a diagnosis of ADHD. We modified Figure 2 scatter plots to indicate children with ADHD diagnoses as black data points (see modified Figure 2 scatter plots). We then computed Pearson correlations between expression of multi-tract features and a binary score for having an ADHD diagnosis or not, and did the same for multi-symptom features. This simple but effective approach allowed us to quantitatively assess how much the expression of multi-tract multi-symptom features is related to having a diagnosis of ADHD. If individuals with ADHD formed a cluster in their expression of multi-tract and multi-symptom features, we would have expected a strong (i.e.: close to 1 or -1) correlation between their expression and a binary variable indicating the presence of an ADHD diagnosis. For this particular analysis, we found weak correlations (highest was 0.3) that were nonetheless statistically significant (see modified Figure 2). Modifications in the manuscript related to this new analysis can be found in the introduction (lines 97-100), methods (lines 267-278), results (lines 417-436), and discussion (lines 626-636).</p><p>Modifications:</p><p>“Analyses comparing clinical subgroups defined by the presence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder showed that multi-tract multi-symptom analyses identified disease-specific connectivity patterns that were missed by single-tract single-symptom approaches.” (lines 97-100)</p><p>“To compare information captured by the PLSc and univariate approaches, we first divided participants based on whether they had obtained a psychiatric diagnosis. Parents of all participants completed the Kiddie-Schedule for Affective and Psychiatric Disorders in School Age Children (KSADS), a gold-standard tool, to assess the presence of pediatric psychiatric disorders.<sup>38</sup> We divided the sample into clinical subgroups based on whether they had obtained a diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We selected this diagnosis because its behavioural manifestations can be easily related to some of the presently-studied concussion symptoms (e.g.: attention problems). It was also the second-most common diagnosis in our sample (33/214). Using a threshold of p&lt;0.05, we computed univariate comparisons of connectivity (PC scores) between individuals with and those without a diagnosis of ADHD, thus identifying putative “ADHD-related” univariate connectivity features.” (lines 267-278)</p><p>“To compare univariate and multivariate approaches, we identified 33 individuals with diagnoses of ADHD obtained from the KSADS.<sup>9</sup> These individuals are shown in black in Figure 3 (scatter plots). Despite forming a clinical subgroup based on a gold-standard measure of psychiatric pathology, these individuals were differentiable by their expression of multi-tract and multi-symptom features. Further, we computed correlations between the expression of these multivariate features and clinical subgroup membership, and found weak, albeit significant correlations (see Figure 3 scatter plots).</p><p>We compared microstructural complexity and axonal density scores across all 200 connections between individuals with and without an ADHD diagnosis, and calculated the percent overlap between each multi-tract connectivity feature and the set of tracts found to be significant in univariate comparisons (ostensibly “ADHD-related” tracts). The percent overlap scores are presented in Figure 4. Notably, the highest overlap occurred with multi-tract connectivity feature 1 (9-13%) from both PLSc analyses. The second-highest overlap was with multi-tract connectivity feature 7 from the microstructural complexity PLSc (6%). Its corresponding multi-symptom feature represented almost exclusively attention problems. Both the univariate “ADHD-related” brain graphs of microstructural complexity and of axonal density implicated several callosal tracts (16/64 and 31/76 respectively). Multi-tract feature 1 also implicated several callosal connections (13/39). However, fewer callosal connections were implicated in multi-tract connectivity feature 7 (2/10) (Figure 4).” (lines 417-436)</p><p>“Our results are consistent with this idea: univariate comparisons between a clinical subgroup defined by a diagnosis of ADHD and the rest of the sample identified connectivity features that mostly overlapped with the first multi-tract multi-symptom pair obtained from both PLSc analyses.

Both these pairs and the univariate “ADHD-related” connections implicated several callosal tracts. Instead, a multi-tract multi-symptom pair that more uniquely represented attention problems implicated fewer callosal tracts. This pair implicated right-lateralized connections, consistent with prior literature showing more left-right asymmetry in FA in children with ADHD compared to controls.<sup>45,46</sup> These results suggest that univariate comparisons in concussed children, even when performed in such a way as to identify a diagnosis-specific set of connectivity features, identified only the most consistent group-level connectivity differences at the expense of more symptom-specific idiosyncratic ones.” (lines 623-636)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Better integration of goals and methods in the Results</p><p>Before reading the methods, I had a hard time understanding the results</p><p>– If authors want to keep the same structure, they should include short explanations within the results, describing briefly &quot;what and how is done&quot; in each section. For example, the section &quot;Combined measures of white matter tract microstructure&quot; starts with &quot;The PCA yielded two biologically-interpretable components…&quot;, and it is not clear what features PCA was applied to and why.

We have modified this description in three important ways. First, as suggested, we have added a more detailed description of the results (lines 417-436, see modifications in response 1b). Second, to address this comment and one made below (Comment 4c), we have changed the contrast, using instead a KSADS diagnosis of ADHD. Third, using this different contrast, we felt it would be a stronger to select a multi-tract multi-symptom pair that was more specific to attention problems (PLSc1 – pair 7). That is why Figure 3 has been modified, illustrating now two univariate brain graphs (contrasting PC1 and PC2 scores as a function of ADHD diagnosis), and three multivariate brain graphs (PLSc1 – pair 1, PLSc2 – pair 3, and PLSc1 – pair 7). We hope that by providing more details as well as a new comparison of subgroups defined by a single diagnosis, we have made these results clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The need to address potentially spurious connections</p><p>– There are concerns that some of the connections represented in the 76x76 connectivity matrix used here are spurious connections due to limitations of tractography that cannot be resolved with current methods, especially as the streamlines derived in tractography come close to cortex. These limitations can affect results even when using the state of the art tractography algorithm that was used here, (as demonstrated in Girard et al., 2020, Neuroimage, 221: 117201).</p><p>– The computational tractography arsenal includes several additional ways that could have been used to somewhat mitigate these concerns, including post-processing of the streamlines (e.g., with SIFT or LiFE), using surface-enhanced tractography methods (these may have been used here, but not mentioned) to increase the quality of tractography, and/or focusing on well-defined anatomical structures in the core of the white matter that can be well-detected using bundle recognition algorithms, and where tractography uncertainty due to the indeterminacy of the signal is of less concern. These issues seem particularly important given the substantial difference in the results between the 95% threshold and 100% threshold requirement for inclusion of an edge in the analysis</p><p>– Regarding my comments about tractography methods, I think that improvements to the tractography methods would improve the confidence in the results that are presented here. At the very least, one way to deal with these concerns is to discuss them, and to acknowledge that the estimation procedures used here produce not &quot;tracts&quot; but rather the edges of a connectivity graph, and that these may or may not represent anatomical units.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer, it is at times difficult to exhaustively account for spurious connections, even with state-of-the-art techniques. To address this comment, we added to the manuscript’s methods section explanations on the limitations of the diffusion MRI techniques we used and those inherent to all tractography in general (lines 326-330). We also recognize in the manuscript’s discussion how the connections we have studied are not necessarily anatomical units, and that future studies will explore using well-recognized bundles (lines 704-711). Finally, we address in the manuscript how the multivariate approach we employed focuses less on the identity of individual tracts and more on patterns across tracts (lines 708-710).</p><p>In addition, to address your comment in a more quantitative manner, we implemented a post-tractography algorithm called COMMIT, which weighs streamlines by how much they explain the diffusion signal. This technique is known to remove false positive streamlines (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25167548/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25167548/</ext-link>). We defined spurious streamlines as those with COMMIT weights of 0. Given that we were not using streamlines per se but rather diffusion measures averaged across a connection, removing streamlines was not expected to have a large effect on the measures we used. However, when connections are composed of streamlines that are entirely spurious, COMMIT can lead to the removal of all its streamlines, and hence of the entire connection. Thus, we calculated how many connections were entirely removed by COMMIT. Using a criterion of 90%, to be consistent with our original methods, we found that 129 (65%) of the 200 originally-selected connections survived this correction. Multi-symptom features obtained using this subset of connections are highly similar to those obtained in the original analyses (compare Figures S3-S6 with the new supplemental Figure S14). Further, the correlations between the loadings of the corresponding multi-tract features for each PLSc, as well as the correlations between the loadings of the corresponding multi-symptom features for each PLSc were very high overall (the first 8 features had correlations ranging from.78 to 0.999), suggesting that the features were very similar. Further, the correlations between the expression of corresponding multi-tract features as well as the expression of multi-symptom features were also very high (the first 8 ranging from 0.78 to 0.999 as well), suggesting that the latent spaces were very similar between the two sets of analyses. These results suggest that even after accounting for spurious streamlines, PLSc results are highly consistent. These results have been outlined in a new section in the results entitled “Accounting for spurious streamlines”. Modifications to the manuscript related to this new analysis can be found in the methods (lines 330-340), results (lines 557-573), and discussion (lines 714-717).</p><p>Modifications:</p><p>“Most tractography techniques, including the one presently used, depend on propagating the local diffusion model across voxels. This approach has inherent limitations in voxels where the local model lacks the information necessary to inform on the appropriate path for streamline propagation, leading inevitably to the creation of spurious streamlines.<sup>40,41</sup>” (lines 326-330)</p><p>“To assess the impact of spurious connections on our results, we implemented an approach called Convex optimization modeling for microstructure informed tractography (COMMIT).<sup>42</sup> This technique assigns weights to streamlines based on how they explain the diffusion signal. After running COMMIT, we identified streamlines with weights of 0, which we considered to be spurious streamlines. When all the streamlines of a connection had a weight of 0, the entire connection was considered spurious. We identified non-spurious connections and only kept those that were found to be non-spurious across 90% of participants. We then analyzed how many of the original 200 studied connections were found to be non-spurious. Finally, we reran our PLSc analyses on the subset of non-spurious connections and compared these results against those obtained from the original analyses.” (lines 330-340)</p><p>“Finally, we used COMMIT to compare results after accounting for spurious streamlines against the original results.

Further, the correlations between the expression of corresponding multi-tract features as well as the expression of multi-symptom features were also very high (the first 8 ranging from 0.78 to 0.999 as well), suggesting that the resulting features were very similar between the two sets of analyses.

Instead, we relied on patterns across tracts, such as counting the number of connections that implicated the corpus callosum in different multi-tract features. Future studies should contrast this approach against procedures to extract large well-known bundles.” (lines 704-711)</p><p>“For instance, the PLSc procedure was robust to variations in input data.

Concerns with the analytic approach and stability across feature selection</p><p>– Data were collected at multiple sites, and site differences should be considered.

The figure also illustrates the weights of each diffusion measure for the principal components obtained after performing a principal component analysis on data that had been processed without regressing out scanner. Lastly, the figure also includes a barplot illustrating the average expression of multi-tract connectivity feature 1 across participants of a given scanner of before regressing out scanner. Average expression of this feature after regressing out scanner was not included given that, by definition, it was 0 for each scanner.

Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this question, it is indeed a technical subtlety that we did not explain in the original manuscript. The PLSc is performed using singular value decomposition (SVD). The pairs are ordered by the percentage of covariance in inputs that they explain. When inputs are shuffled, the obtained pairs are expected to be different. The only inherent order there is to the pairs is the percentage of covariance explained. Hence, that was the indicator we used to compare the original pairs against the pairs obtained from bootstrap and permutation testing. We have added a sentence specifying this in the methods section of the revised manuscript (lines 259-260).</p><p>Modifications:</p><p>“Although the pairs are expected to differ between iterations, they are always ordered by the percentage of covariance in inputs they explain.” (lines 259-260)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– I wonder whether the procedure used to assess the statistical significance of the multi-tract multi-symptom pairs (lines 463-467) doesn't unfairly favor the ones in the unshuffled data. Shouldn't this procedure also include the preliminary feature selection step (lines 427-430) also in the shuffled data? It seems like it should, because some of the correlation in the PLSc is due to these univariate correlations, which could arise by chance in high-dimensional data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We agree, the connections selected by the univariate feature selection stage could partly be due to chance given the high-dimensional data, and it is necessary to find a way of accounting for this potential issue. However, the optimal approach to account for this issue is not entirely clear. The preliminary feature selection step picks out the optimal connections for PLSc, given that they will already have the highest correlations with symptoms. Shuffling prior to the feature selection stage will lead to selection of connections that are more weakly correlated with symptoms. However, by including the feature selection step, the pipeline will still include an optimization stage that maximizes the relationship between connections and symptoms. Hence, shuffling in this way will lead to comparisons against null distributions with higher covariance explained. Stated more simply, this approach is stricter.</p><p>It is necessary to keep in mind that this permutation approach was not used to determine which pairs are “real” or “meaningful”. The original purpose for using it was: 1. As a heuristic to reduce the number of pairs to interpret (which in retrospect did not help much given the high number of factors retained); 2. To provide a more “objective” way of subselecting pairs, compared to the more traditional but more “subjective” approach of a scree test. Ultimately, none of these selection approaches guarantee that a pair is meaningful. The results of the permutation testing procedure also don’t ultimately impact the pairs themselves and hence the rest of the results.</p><p>Nonetheless, in response to this helpful comment, we have performed this analysis.

Is it any surprising or even interesting that the correlations between multi-tract and multi-symptom features were higher than all univariate correlations? With PLSc, latent modes are constructed (i.e., coefficients of tracts and symptoms are determined) to maximize the correlations. Thus, it is an expected outcome that those correlations would be higher than univariate correlations.

PLSc is performed by applying a singular-value-decomposition to the covariance matrix between two sets of inputs. It is a fundamentally different operation than computing a correlation coefficient. More specifically, PLSc has a loss function that is based on a) internal covariation of each variable set and b) the strength of association with an outcome. As such, there are distinct sources of deviation that can arise when comparing ensuing association strength to other correlation approaches.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are the differences between these values higher than would be expected by chance?</p></disp-quote><p>This question is interesting, but given that, as per the previous comment, the comparison between univariate vs multivariate correlations were removed, we have not tested this idea.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 3, the two univariate brain graphs (red and blue) look very similar to each other. Are they as similar as they seem there?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for catching this. The two brain graphs you are mentioning in Figure 4 looked identical because of a mistake in the code. We have fixed this issue and have made another important modification to the revised Figure 4. As stated in response to comment 1b, we have changed the contrast, comparing instead individuals with and without a KSADS diagnosis of ADHD. Hence, the red and blue brain graphs are contrasting the microstructural complexity and axonal density measures between children with and without ADHD diagnoses (using an α of 0.01 in the figure only to reduce the number of significant connections and improve the illustration). Additionally, we have changed one of the multi-tract features illustrated in the figure, showing now multi-tract feature 7 from the microstructural complexity PLSc. We selected this feature because its associated multi-symptom feature appears to be selectively representing attention problems.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are the multi-tracts implicated by PLSc1 also similar to the multi-tracts implicated in PLSc2?</p></disp-quote><p>We performed our analytical pipeline (univariate feature selection -&gt; PLSc) twice because we kept two principal components from our formed PCA model. With each of these two PCs, we performed the univariate feature selection twice. Hence, the connections that went into the two PLSc analyses are different. From the 200 connections selected for the first PLSc analysis, 48 (24%) were also selected in the second PLSc analysis. However, calculating the %Overlap measure to compare corresponding pairs in both PLSc analyses is not possible, given that this measure requires that the two brain graphs come from the same set. The expression of corresponding multi-tract features from both PLSc analyses showed correlations that ranged from weak (lowest was -0.04) to moderate (highest was 0.67). These results suggest that despite having mostly different inputs, some of the latent spaces derived from these two PLSc analyses share some similarities. We have not presented these results in the manuscript given that we used instead similar analyses on the replication dataset to assess how robust the PLSc procedure is to differences in inputs (see response 5a).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Why 200 features? Would the results change substantially if you use 100? Is there some way to select a reasonably small number of features empirically (e.g., based on a scree plot?).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this question. To quantify the impact of changing the number of features retained on the results, we successively took a larger number of connections from the list of top correlated connections, and plotted the % covariance explained as a function of the number of connections selected (starting from 19, the same number of symptoms). This analysis suggests that, in general, for the first latent factor, % covariance explained decreases with an increasing number of connections, increases again at around 80 features, and then stabilizes around 200 connections. These results suggest that some features included may be redundant, but that selecting 200 connections yields features that explain nearly the maximum amount of covariance possible across the different possible number of features that could be selected. These results are illustrated in the new Figure S12 and outlined in the Sensitivity Analyses paragraph of the results, lines 506-542.</p><p>To answer the first part of this question, our reasoning for selecting 200 connections was as follows: to extract connectivity features, we built connectomes using atlases, giving us several small putative connections, rather than full, well-known bundles. This decision was made because we believed that otherwise, we would lose “coverage”: a connectome built only from major bundles excludes several connections between other areas of the brain. However, unlike major bundles, connections from connectivity matrices are not necessarily individual anatomical units. Hence, to improve interpretation of multivariate connectivity features, we believed we needed to instead consider patterns of connections rather than attempt to interpret individual connections. One example of this approach in the manuscript was when we discussed how many of connections involved the corpus callosum in different brain graphs (Figure 4). If we had selected fewer connections, we reasoned that we would be sacrificing our capacity to make this type of interpretations. Hence, we aimed to include several connectivity features. However, a constraint of singular value decomposition (SVD) is that we require at least as many observations (e.g.: subjects) as we have features (e.g.: connections). The most features we could use is 214 (the number of participants in the discovery dataset). That is why we selected a number close to 214. However, we did not have a concrete reason for choosing 200 over 214 or other nearby numbers. Studies employ a number of different approaches to subselect features from a larger set. Two recent studies that informed our project used a correlation-based feature selection step like ours, and selected enough features so as to constitute 80% of their sample size (CITS). Our feature selection has a similar level of granularity (200/214 = 93%). The reasoning behind our choice of 200 features as well as the similar granularity employed in these two studies have been added to the revised methods section (lines 210-218).</p><p>To answer the second part of this question, unfortunately, there is no empirical way of selecting the number of features that go into the PLSc. A scree plot, or an equivalent approach, is a way of selecting the number of singular vectors (e.g.: multi-tract multi-symptom pairs/latent factors/principal components/canonical variates) by analyzing the successive singular values (% variance/covariance explained), not the number of features that go into the analysis. When comparing successive singular vectors within the same SVD, a scree approach can be used. But comparing singular values when using different features involves a comparison of singular values across different SVDs.</p><p>Modifications</p><p>“Feature selection. Given the constraints on the number of connectivity features that can be included in the partial least squares correlation (PLSc) analysis, we performed a univariate feature selection based on Pearson correlations. This solution is becoming increasingly adopted for high-dimensional variable sets (Figure 2D).<sup>47,48</sup> We selected the 200 connectivity features most correlated with any symptom score, to maximize the number of features included. Given our discovery dataset size, selecting 200 connectivity features corresponded to 93% of our sample, a level of granularity comparable to other recent neuroimaging studies employing a feature selection step prior to multivariate analyses.<sup>35,36</sup>“(lines 210-218).</p><p>“We first tested the impact that changing the number of retained connections would have on PLSc results. The percentage of covariance explained by the first multi-tract multi-symptom pair from the microstructural complexity PLSc is illustrated in Figure S12. Initially, the percentage of covariance explained decreases with an increasing number of connections. However, starting around 80 connections, this percentage increases, and then stabilizes around 200 connections to a level close to its initial value. These results suggest that while some connectivity features included may be redundant, a selection of 200 connections is not far from the optimal amount that could have been selected.” (lines 506-542).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Concerns with the approach to psychopathology</p><p>– One reviewer noted that: It is not the best practice to combine all possible psychiatric conditions within a single group and call it &quot;adverse psychiatric outcome&quot;. This adversely affects the interpretability of findings. Knowing that one of the multi-tract features correlates with the adverse psychiatric outcome is not much informative and clinically valuable. Authors need to devise a more appropriate approach. At minimum, they need to provide a compelling motivation for the current approach.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion, we agree that the measure we used was rather coarse. To address your comment, we selected instead a diagnosis of ADHD based on responses to the KSADS. We selected this diagnosis because its behavioural manifestations can be easily related to some of the presently-studied concussion symptoms (e.g.: attention problems), and because it was the second-most common diagnosis in our sample. We hope this chance improves the interpretability of the results. Please see our response to comment 1b for a list of relevant modifications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– While the other reviewer noted that: Some comments regarding the participants that were classified as having psychopathology (marked in black in the scatter plots in Figure 2). It is not clear why these participants were selected based on the CBCL scores, which are indirect measures of psychopathology, rather than the more direct KSADS psychopathology scores? If there are 55% with psychopathological KSADS score, that should provide more than 28 participants marked here.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. In addressing the previous question, we have switched to using ADHD based on the KSADS questionnaire instead of CBCL scores.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I am also not sure that I agree with the statement that the 28 individuals highlighted in black would be grouped together in clinical studies, given their psychopathology probably varies widely. It is not clear to me whether the paragraph on lines 125 – 131 claims that these participants are different from the other participants in terms of their multi-tract/multi-symptom scores or are not different from the other participants. It seems to me that they might be different based on the first multi-tract/multi-symptom scores (which are both slightly higher in this group), but there might also not be enough subjects to demonstrate this difference statistically. I think that this would also be consistent with the subsequently-described overlap between this score and the univariate scores (lines 132-141).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing up these points. In addressing the previous two comments, we have also addressed this one. We can say more confidently now, given the use of a single psychiatric diagnosis obtained from a gold-standard questionnaire, that this new subgroup of individuals with ADHD would indeed be more likely to be grouped together in clinical trials. We have also computed correlations between expression of multi-tract multi-symptom features and the presence/absence of an ADHD diagnosis. These correlations can be found in the modified Figure 3 scatter plots and in lines 421-423. Overall, these correlations are low to moderate, but statistically significant. The strength of these correlations does indeed follow the pattern that can be observed in Figure 4, whereby the overlap between univariate “ADHD-related” connections and multi-tract features was higher in pairs 1 and 7 than in pair 3. But qualitatively, there are still differences that can be observed in multi-tract multi-symptom feature expression among individuals with an ADHD diagnosis. That is the argument being made in this section, that differences in the expression of these features would be ignored in analyses that would group these individuals together.</p><p>Modifications:</p><p>“Further, we computed correlations between the expression of these multivariate features and clinical subgroup membership, and found weak, albeit significant correlations (see Figure 3 scatter plots).” (lines 421-423)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Concerns with claims of replication</p><p>– The presentation of the results doesn't make it clear whether the structure that was identified in the discovery dataset does in fact replicate in the replication set.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing up this point. If you are asking whether the same multivariate structure was obtained in the replication set, we did not determine this because originally, we did not rebuild a PLSc model from scratch on the replication set. Instead, we only projected the replication data onto the latent space that we had obtained from the discovery set. The challenge with redoing the PLSc on the replication set is that given that the sets have different sizes, we are inputting a different amount of connectivity features than in the original PLSc, which would unsurprisingly lead to some differences between the latent factors obtained. Nonetheless, to address your comment, we performed this analysis, redoing the feature selection step using 92 connections (the maximum number possible). We found that 20 of the original 200 connections were included in the 92 selected for this PLSc. The multi-symptom features are illustrated in Figure S11. Correlations between the loadings of these new multi-symptom features and the ones obtained from the original PLSc analyses were low to high (0.1 to 0.92). The correlations between the loadings of the 20 connections that were common to both PLSc analyses were very low to moderate (0.01 to 0.3). However, the correlations between expression of multi-symptom features were moderate to very high (0.3 to 0.99), and those between expression of multi-tract features were low to moderate (0.1 to 0.5), suggesting that despite having different inputs and hence different weights, the latent spaces obtained through these analyses share some similarities. Modifications to the manuscript relevant to these analyses can be found in a new section of the methods entitled <italic>Analyses on replication dataset</italic> (lines 312-324) and in a new section of the results entitled <italic>Results on the replication dataset</italic> (lines 484-504).</p><p>Modifications:</p><p>“To assess the robustness of our analyses, we first computed the percentage of connectivity/symptom covariance explained in the replication set by the first multi-tract multi-symptom pair of both PLSc analyses performed on the discovery set. We then selected, from the replication set, the same 200 connectivity features originally selected in the discovery set, and projected them, along with symptom features, onto the latent spaces obtained using the discovery set. To assess whether differences existed in multi-tract multi-symptom expression between participants from each set, we performed correlations comparing multi-tract multi-symptom feature expression against a binary variable indexing the dataset. Finally, we reran our feature selection procedure as well as the PLSc analyses on the discovery set, and compared the number of connectivity features that coincided in both analyses. We also performed correlations comparing the loadings of every corresponding multi-tract and multi-symptom feature, as well as the expression of these features.” (lines 312-324)</p><p>“We first analyzed the amount of connectivity/symptom covariance explained by each of the multi-tract/multi-symptom pairs.

We then projected the replication dataset onto the latent spaces obtained using the discovery set, and ran correlations comparing multi-tract multi-symptom feature expression against a binary variable indexing the dataset. We found very low, non-significant correlations (all coefficients lower than 0.01) between multi-tract and multi-symptom feature expression and set membership.

If I understand correctly, the logistic regression in the discovery sample indicates as predictive of psychopathology features that are different than the feature that was indicated in the discovery set. But this might lead us to wonder: How should we interpret this? For example, if I had a measurement from a new child that has had a concussion, which of the two models would I use to predict whether they might develop a psychopathology? The one derived in the discovery set or the one remaining feature that was indicated in the discovery set? Authors need to clearly explain the logic and evidence that supports their claim.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this point. After much consideration, we have decided to remove the section on psychiatric diagnosis prediction from the manuscript, for two important reasons. First, we believe attempting to demonstrate a clinical applicability is rushed, given that, as we stated before, this manuscript is presenting a novel way of looking at concussions, not an optimized analytical pipeline. To achieve a practical outcome, the methods require optimization. Second, given that our data is cross-sectional, we cannot state for certain that our models are predicting outcomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Regarding my comments about the comparison to the replication set, I think that a few direct comparisons might help. For example, how much of the covariance in the discovery set is explained by the same multi-tract/multi-symptom pair that explained more than 40% of the covariance in the microstructural complexity PLSc in the discovery set? Or, possibly even more rigorous: if you ran a PLSc on the discovery set how similar would the feature sets be? I realize that this might not be possible, given the smaller sample size and the choice of 200 features in the feature-selection phase.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these excellent suggestions. We performed the analysis looking at connectivity/symptom covariance explained in the replication set using multi-tract/multi-symptom pairs. We found that approximately 12% of the connectivity/symptom covariance in the replication set was explained by the first multi-tract/multi-symptom pair from the microstructural complexity PLSc, and 33% was explained by the corresponding pair from the axonal density PLSc. We also performed additional comparisons using the replication set. As mentioned above in response to comment 5a, we performed PLSc on the replication set and compared the resulting multivariate features against those obtained with the discovery set. These features had differences compared to the original ones, which were expected given the different inputs, but they also revealed some similarities. In addition, we projected the data from the replication set onto the latent spaces obtained from the discovery set, and we calculated correlations between the expression of multi-tract and multi-symptom features and a binary variable for the set. We found these correlations to be low and non-significant, suggesting that there are no measurable differences in feature expression in the two sets. Altogether, these results suggest that the feature selection step is less robust than we initially thought, but the PLSc step is robust, such that even with different inputs, the features obtained share similarities.

By well-known findings, we meant the central role of the corpus callosum, a result that is reported in the literature with high frequency. By new insights we mainly meant two things: 1. The possibility that the corpus callosum might be identified so frequently because it is a structure that is implicated in all concussions, but it might not be symptom-specific; 2. The idea that concussions can be seen as a combination of a variety of white matter structure alterations with different relationships to combinations of a variety of symptoms. We have made these specifications in the Discussion (see lines 590-603).</p><p>Modifications:</p><p>“In the present study we leveraged novel dMRI methods and a double-multivariate approach to parse heterogeneity in the relationship between white matter structure and symptoms in a large sample of previously-concussed children.

The most consistent multi-tract multi-symptom pairs implicated several callosal tracts, recapitulating a well-known finding from the concussion literature. However, the present results suggest the involvement of these callosal tracts may be more reflective of general problems than specific symptoms.

To address this comment and previous comments made by the other reviewer, we have aimed to increase the amount of quantitative results we present throughout the entire manuscript.

Examples of these analyses can be found in our response to comment 1b, as well as Figure S2. These simple yet clear comparisons allowed us to demonstrate more quantitatively that the expression of multi-tract and multi-symptom features is not strongly related to these “external” variables.

Individual pairs selected for further discussion are shown in Figures 3 and 4. Figure 3 also illustrates the expression of three multi-tract multi-symptom pairs (scatter plots). For each pair, the symptom profiles of two example participants, one with high feature expression, one with low, are shown. These example participants illustrate how these multi-tract multi-symptom features can represent a diversity of symptom profiles.</p><p>Across most extracted pairs, the representation of tracts and symptoms formed a continuum, with earlier pairs capturing broader symptom categories and more distributed networks of connections, and later pairs capturing more idiosyncratic symptom/connectivity relationships. The first multi-tract multi-symptom pair from the microstructural complexity PLSc broadly represented most symptoms (Figure 3A polar plot) and implicated a broad range of frontal commissural and occipito-temporal association tracts (Figure 4, violet brain graph). The third multi-tract multi-symptom pair obtained from the axonal density PLSc represented broadly cognitive problems (Figure 3B polar plot). The multi-symptom feature from the third pair obtained from the microstructural complexity PLSc also represented cognitive problems broadly and implicated a wide array of tracts with a mostly frontal focus, whereas features from subsequent pairs represented individual cognitive problems, such as feature 8 which represented processing speed, executive function (card sorting), and working memory, and implicated almost exclusively frontal tracts. The seventh pair obtained from the same PLSc represented attention problems almost exclusively, along with decreased sleep and processing speed (Figure 3C polar plot). This pair implicated mostly frontal tracts, including a connection between the left posterior cingulate and left thalamus, a trajectory that is consistent with the corticospinal tract. This pattern whereby pairs ranged from broadly representing symptom categories and distributed networks to more specific symptom combinations with more localized connections can be best appreciated in Figure 6. As can be observed, certain groups of connections tended to be represented only once alongside broad symptom categories. More consistent connectivity/symptom correspondences were only observed for few, more specific single-symptom/single-connection combinations.</p><p>Although this pattern was observed in both PLSc analyses, important exceptions were observed as well. First, the second multi-tract multi-symptom pair obtained from both PLSc analyses strongly represented nausea and vomiting, almost exclusively, and implicated no commissural tracts. Second, sleep problems (especially “trouble sleeping”) were implicated across several pairs. Interestingly, despite being found ubiquitously across pairs, they were not consistently associated with the same connections across pairs. In contrast, nearly every time attention problems were implicated in a pair (3/4 pairs), they were found alongside two connections with trajectories that correspond to parts of the right superior longitudinal fasciculus (right pars opercularis – right post-central sulcus; right par opercularis – right sumpramarginal gyrus). However, this type of consistent symptom/connection correspondence was more often than not absent (Figure 5).</p><p>Out of 200 connections selected for the microstructural complexity PLSc, 2 were found to be most frequently implicated across all retained pairs. These were the two connections mentioned above that were related to attention problems, the right pars opercularis – right post-central gyrus, and the right pars opercularis to the right supramarginal gyrus. They were implicated in 4 pairs each, two of which were the same (pair 1 and 8). Callosal tracts were not among the most often implicated connections.</p><p>Overall, these results illustrate how different symptom profiles are associated with different combinations of tracts. Earlier pairs consisted of broad symptom categories and implicated wider networks of connectivity features, whereas more idiosyncratic pairs consisted of more symptom-specific combinations of connectivity features were associated with more symptom-specific profiles. However, some symptoms such as sleep problems were implicated across the spectrum of different multi-tract multi-symptom pairs, illustrating how some symptoms do not demonstrate a one-to-one relationship with connectivity features across multi-tract multi-symptom pairs. No tracts were widely implicated across all pairs.” (lines 398-462)</p><p>Answering this question also allowed us to create a new figure (Figure 5 shown below) which we believe more clearly illustrates the relationships between symptoms and connections. In addressing your comment, we have also come up with a new way of interpreting the findings that we believe is more clearly conveys the main message of the manuscript (lines 638-645).</p><p>“Defining concussions as a clinical syndrome characterized by a set of symptoms stemming from a set of alterations of brain structure and function, multi-tract multi-symptom pairs can be thought of as subtypes of concussion (i.e.: of structure/symptom relationships), not of concussion patients. Patients with concussions can express these different concussion subtypes to varying degrees. We theorize that the combination of these different subtypes and how much they are expressed is what determines the clinical syndrome a person will display. The pairs explaining the most covariance can be interpreted as the subtypes that are most commonly expressed across individuals.” (lines 638-645)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The inclusion of new control analysis that uses COMMIT to identify spurious connections is great. I think that the added text on lines 666 – 690 raise important caveats and future directions, which will give the readers not as familiar with the details of dMRI research important context to understand the work. On the other hand, it is very hard to judge the similarity between the results in Appendix 1 Figure 4 and Appendix 1 Figure 14. In particular, there seem to be no black stars in Figure 14 (despite the caption mentioning them). Does this mean that no MCF symptom features are significant in this analysis when COMMIT is used? That would be a real problem for the robustness of this approach to issues related to tractography that are mentioned in this part of the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your feedback on this addition and thank you also for your question.

We have now added it. To answer your question, these coefficients are from a Pearson correlation between expression of a multi-symptom feature (near Y axis), or a multi-tract feature (near X axis), and a binary variable indexing whether or not each participant had an ADHD diagnosis. The further away from 0, the stronger the correlation between the multivariate feature expression and whether or not participants had an ADHD diagnosis.

Is there a univariate difference between the PC scores of individuals diagnosed with ADHD and those that were not? Was this comparison conducted only within the group that had a psychopathological KSADS scores? In other words, on line 273 in the phrase &quot;We divided the sample&quot;, does the word &quot;sample&quot; here refer only to (how many?) participants who had any psychopathology?

We did not provide a detailed summary of these hundreds of univariate tests, but instead focused on how many of the connections identified as significant in these univariate tests were also implicated in the multi-tract features. These were the results presented in Figure 4. The manuscript has been modified to increase clarify regarding this analysis.</p><p>“To compare information captured by the PLSc and univariate approaches, we first identified, among the 214 participants from the discovery set, those that had obtained a psychiatric diagnosis.” (lines 290-292)</p><p>“We identified 33 individuals in the discovery set with diagnoses of ADHD obtained from the KSADS.” (lines 464-465)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>C) Furthermore, I am still struggling to understand whether I should interpret Figure 3 as indicating a difference between the subjects marked in black (now subjects diagnosed with ADHD) and the other subjects in the multivariate analysis. As far as I can tell, these individuals (black dots in the scatter plots) are not different in any discernible way from the other participants in these plots (colored dots) -- certainly not in pair 3 (the middle line), where the black dots and colored dots seem completely intermingled. Is there some way to evaluate the difference between the groups across all of the multi-symptom/multi-tract features?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing up these points, ensuring their clarity is vital for the manuscript. The objective of Figure 3 is to illustrate that individuals who would be considered “similar”, or considered as belonging to the same clinical subgroup due to their sharing of a psychiatric diagnosis, are spread out in these multi-tract multi-symptom “spaces”. Consider the opposite scenario: imagine that individuals with ADHD and those without were perfectly split in these multivariate spaces. In such a scenario, this multivariate approach would be trivial, since we could as easily discern individuals with ADHD from those without based on their diagnosis. But in these multivariate spaces, individuals with ADHD are spread out, and that is what we meant by “discernible”. But we understand that calling these individuals “discernible” made it sound as if we meant “discernible from non-ADHD individuals”. What we meant to say is that individuals with ADHD are discernible from each other in multivariate space. We have followed the excellent suggestion made in comment 7f to better reflect this point (lines 466-468).</p><p>Despite forming a clinical subgroup based on a gold-standard measure of psychiatric pathology, these individuals were heterogeneous in their expression of multi-tract and multi-symptom features. (lines 466-468)</p><p>To answer your second question, what we did to evaluate the difference between the groups across specific multi-tract multi-symptom pairs was to compute correlations between expression of multi-tract features, or multi-symptom features, and a binary variable indexing whether or not individuals have an ADHD diagnosis (please see our response to question 7b). These analyses were what led to the coefficients illustrated in the Figure 3 scatter plots. To address your comment however, we have computed these correlations across all retained multi-tract multi-symptom features, and have displayed this information in a new table in the supplementary material (Supplementary File 3) (line 470).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>D) In the same section, what is the statistical test that supports the statement &quot;Further, we computed correlations between the expression of these multivariate features and clinical subgroup membership, and found weak, albeit significant correlations&quot;? It would be good to apply such a statistical test to all of the multi-tract multi-symptom features, and report the results of this test as part of this section, just as it would be good to report the results of a direct test of the &quot;univariate&quot; PCA differences. I believe that this would provide a stronger assessment of multivariate vs. univariate approaches.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. What we computed were Pearson correlations between the expression of multi-tract and multi-symptom features and a binary variable indexing clinical subgroup membership. These are the correlations described in the response to the previous comment (7d). As you suggested, we have now computed these correlations across all multi-tract multi-symptom features, and have reported the results in a new table entitled Supplementary File 3. The results of univariate PCA differences were reported in the form of the red and blue brain graphs illustrated at the top of Figure 4. Given the large amount of connections identified, we thought it would not be clear to provide a list of significant connections, which is why we opted to illustrate these connections in brain graphs. Further, the individual connections identified in these univariate analyses were not of particular interest. What was of interest was how many of these connections were also implicated in our multi-tract features. These are the results we presented in the Figure 4 line graph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– This might just be a wording issue, but I don't understand the following statement (L413- 416): &quot;Despite forming a clinical subgroup based on a gold-standard measure of psychiatric pathology, these individuals were differentiable by their expression of multi-tract and multi-symptom features&quot;. Maybe the problem is the word &quot;differentiable&quot;?

First, are 12% and 33% of the covariance that were explained in the replication set, using MCF1 in both PLSc analysis more than would be expected by chance? I think that this could be established through a permutation test in the replication set or some other statistical test.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. We followed your suggestion and performed permutation testing, using 2000 permutations and shuffling at each iteration the subject labels in the connection dataset and recalculated the percent covariance explained in the shuffled replication dataset by the first multi-tract multi-symptom pair.

Is this anti-correlation somehow trivial? Or is it significant (either statistically or conceptually)?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your question, we understand how this might appear confusing. When performing matrix decomposition techniques such as PCA and PLSc, what we are doing is finding linear combinations of variables, which define new “spaces” (or axes). The direction of these axes is trivial, as long as the relationship between the weights is maintained (so whatever was positive became negative and whatever was negative became positive). This property is called reflection invariance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What do we learn from the fact that the features selected in the discovery and replication sets are quite different? Does performing the COMMIT analysis in both the discovery and replication set improve the situation? Surely the feature selection step is affected by the 35% of connections that COMMIT finds to be spurious in the discovery set? Why not remove them with COMMIT and proceed from there? I realize that you can't try all the different permutations of analysis pipelines, but using COMMIT seems like a principled way to improve the robustness specifically of this part of the pipeline.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these excellent questions, these are all important discussion points. First, the fact that the features selected in the discovery and replication sets are quite different suggests to us that the feature selection step was less robust than we initially believed. However, despite these differences, the results comparing the loadings and the expression of multi-tract multi-symptom features suggests that after the PLSc analyses, these features share some similarities, ultimately suggesting that the PLSc procedure is quite robust.</p><p>In our previous resubmission, we demonstrated how the multi-tract and multi-symptom features obtained from PLSc after performing COMMIT are highly similar (~0.99 correlation) to the features obtained from PLSc without performing COMMIT, highlighting once again the robustness of the PLSc approach. However, we agree that using COMMIT, or another streamline filtering approach, is a principled way to improve robustness of the pipeline. It is certainly our intention that future studies inspired by ours consider doing a filtering approach, which is why we have decided to follow your advice and repeat all analyses using the COMMIT filtered data. To do so, we modified the analytical pipeline, by performing COMMIT after the post-processing stage (i.e.: after thresholding and imputation), <italic>before</italic> the PCA (see modifications to Figure 2 and its caption, found below, and the modifications to the methods, where the COMMIT section now follows the section on <italic>Additional Data Transformations</italic> and precedes the section on PCA). This meant that the PCA and all following steps were performed on the COMMIT filtered connections.</p><p>To answer your second question, redoing the univariate feature selection step on the replication set with the COMMIT-filtered connections, 73 of the original 200 connections selected in the discovery set were selected. This represents a major improvement in robustness, even for this feature selection step (compared to the 20/200 connections that were selected in the previous iteration). Since we have modified the analytical pipeline though and since testing the impact of COMMIT on our pipeline was not part of the main research questions, we did not report this comparison between the results of this feature selection step on COMMIT-filtered connections and on non-filtered connections. We only reported the results on COMMIT-filtered connections.</p><p>Given that all analyses were performed again, a detailed summary comparing these new results with the prior ones is necessary.</p><p>– Results from the PCA, despite including now only COMMIT-filtered connections, are nearly identical.</p><p>– Early multi-symptom features are nearly identical to the previous iteration of the analytical pipeline (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, with the new set of multi-symptom features from the microstructural complexity PLSc shown in Figure 4, and the same features but from the previous, non-COMMIT-filtered pipeline shown on the right).

Now, the % covariance explained for the first multi-tract multi-symptom pair does not have an initial drop before increasing again. Instead, it starts off low, and increases with increasing numbers of connections, suggesting that the choice of 200 connections was nearly optimal (see figure 11).</p><p>– The focus on the corpus callosum was dropped. The reason was that we were drawing conclusions about the role of the corpus callosum based on which multi-tract features implicated more callosal tracts. However, the total numbers were so low across pairs (e.g.: mult-tract feature 7 implicated 2 callosal tracts, but 10 overall), that we felt this conclusion was not very strong. The new version of the manuscript focuses more on symptom/connection correspondences as per earlier suggestions.</p><p>– Using the COMMIT-filtered data, the results with the T=85%, 90%, and 95% thresholds are identical, because this thresholding step was less severe than COMMIT. However, encouragingly, none of the connections that were lost to this thresholding were connections that would have passed COMMIT. The only difference was found with the T=100% threshold. However, even with this threshold, only 6 connections that would have survived COMMIT were lost due to this thresholding. These results and their implications can be found in lines 560-568.</p><p>“All 629 connections that had survived COMMIT in the original iteration (t=90%) were among the 1142 connections that survived the t=85% threshold, and the 877 connections that survived the t=95% threshold. Hence, after COMMIT, the same 629 connections were selected in all three thresholds, which led to identical data going into all subsequent analyses. Differences were only seen for t=100%, where 258 connections survived thresholding. After COMMIT, 252 connections survived, suggesting that only 6 connections that were considered “spurious” were found across 100% of participants. These results suggest that highly consistent connections tended to be the ones found by COMMIT to be “non-spurious”.” (lines 560-568)</p><p>– All other results are nearly identical to the ones presented in the previous iteration of the analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I also think that the probe for correlation between expression of the multi-symptom multi-tract features and dataset is clever, but some of the explanations that now appear in the response to the reviews (and particularly about this point) should probably appear in the Discussion section, to help readers understand what the point of this analysis is. In general, I wonder whether, now that lines 618 – 626 have been removed, the authors could discuss the implications of the analysis of the replication set in the Discussion.

Neither of the two univariate analyses implicated the two connections discussed above (right pars opercularis – right post-central sulcus; right par opercularis – right sumpramarginal gyrus) that were consistently associated with attention problems. These results suggest that the putative “ADHD-related” connections identified in univariate comparisons of microstructural complexity and axonal density measures between individuals with ADHD and those without are mostly non-overlapping with the connections identified in an attention-problems specific multi-tract multi-symptom pair.” (lines 476-487)</p></body></sub-article></article>
