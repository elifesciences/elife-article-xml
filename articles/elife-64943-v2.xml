playing essential functions by catalyzing protein phosphorylation. Annotation of subcellular distribution of the kinome greatly facilitates investigation of normal and disease mechanisms. Here, we present Kinome Atlas (KA), an image-based map of the kinome annotated to 10 cellular compartments. 456 epitope-tagged kinases, representing 85% of the human kinome, were expressed in HeLa cells and imaged by immunofluorescent microscopy under a similar condition. KA revealed kinase family-enriched subcellular localizations and discovered a collection of new kinase localizations at mitochondria, plasma membrane, extracellular space, and other structures. Furthermore, KA demonstrated the role of liquid-liquid phase separation in formation of kinase condensates. Identification of MOK as a mitochondrial kinase revealed its function in cristae dynamics, respiration, and oxidative stress response. Although limited by possible mislocalization due to overexpression or epitope tagging, this subcellular map of the kinome can be used to refine regulatory mechanisms involving protein phosphorylation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>kinome</kwd><kwd>subcellular localization</kwd><kwd>phase separation</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial</kwd><kwd>MOK</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31970726</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Bin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81730069</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Bin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017YFA0504502</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Bin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004731</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LZ21C070002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Bin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Key Laboratory of Growth Regulation and Translational Research of Zhejiang Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2020E10027</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Bin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012226</institution-id><institution>Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Bin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An immunofluorescent analysis of 465 protein kinases revealed a substantial role of liquid-liquid phase separation in kinase localization and identified new kinase localizations to mitochondria and other organelles.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The kinome, encoded by about 2% of the human genome, is one of the largest superfamilies of homologous proteins consisting of 538 kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Manning et al., 2002b</xref>). These enzymes catalyze the transfer of γ-phosphate of ATP to the alcohol groups (on Ser and Thr) or phenolic groups (on Tyr) of proteins to generate phosphate monoesters. As a consequence, the substrate protein could be altered in many ways, such as activity, subcellular localization, and interacting proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cohen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Manning et al., 2002a</xref>). Therefore, protein phosphorylations function as molecular switches in essentially every aspect of cellular activities. Mutation and dysregulation of protein kinases are causal to many diseases such as cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Greenman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lahiry et al., 2010</xref>). Kinases are also among the most important targets for precision medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Klaeger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Spatial partitioning of molecules into functional compartments is a basic principle for the organization of a cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bauer et al., 2015</xref>). Compartmentation determines the chemical environment, and thus profoundly affects kinase activity and substrate selectivity. Kinases were found in most organelles, and study of subcellular localization on the proteome level facilitated mapping of the kinome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thul et al., 2017</xref>). In imaging-based approaches, antibodies were used to label proteins for visualization. For instance, Cell Atlas of the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) project mapped more than 12,000 proteins to 13 major organelles using antibodies against endogenous proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thul et al., 2017</xref>). However, reliability was limited by antibody specificity in such one antibody one protein approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker, 2015</xref>). Alternatively, organelle proteome could be identified by mass spectrometry after fractionation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Calvo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Orre et al., 2019</xref>). Although empowered by proximity-labeling technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Branon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lönn and Landegren, 2017</xref>), compartments accurately analyzed this way are still limited. Furthermore, curation of subcellular localization data from UniProt, literatures, and open resources has resulted in comprehensive databases such as COMPARTMENTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Binder et al., 2014</xref>). However, accuracy is often affected by complex data source. As a result, understanding of subcellular localizations of the kinome is still fragmented.</p><p>Here, we report a subcellular map of the kinome generated by immunofluorescent (IF) imaging of ectopically expressed epitope-tagged kinases in HeLa cells. This dataset, the Kinome Atlas (KA), annotated 456 kinases to 10 compartments of the cell. Although mislocalization was possible due to overexpression or epitope tagging, KA technically complements previous approaches in presenting a whole picture of the kinome. Experiments done in the same cell line transfected and cultured in a similar condition allowed comparison within the dataset, revealing localization features of kinase families and a broader role of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in formation of both nuclear and cytosolic kinase condensates. This study not only discovered a collection of new kinase localizations, but also demonstrated the role of MOK in mitochondrial structure and functions. This resource lays a foundation for further investigation of kinases and protein phosphorylation in terms of regulation and functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mapping subcellular localizations of the kinome</title><p>We constructed an expression plasmid library of the kinome using gateway cloning as described in the Materials and methods section. 464 protein kinase-encoding plasmids were got (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), representing 86.2% of the human kinome, and covering each family similarly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). 95.1% of genes in the library are of human origin, and the rest are of mouse or rat origins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). All clones are epitope-tagged, with 46.8% in Flag tag, 46.5% in tandem HA/Flag tags, 3.4% in HA tag, 2.4% in Myc tag, and 0.9% in GFP tag. 54.7% of the clones have epitope tags on the amino (N)-terminal, and 45.3% of clones are tagged on the carboxyl (C)-terminal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The protein kinase-like (PKL) family is overrepresented with N-terminal tag, while the nucleoside diphosphate kinases (NDK) and tyrosine kinases (TK) families have higher ratio of C-terminal tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

According to Cell Atlas of the HPA project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thul et al., 2017</xref>), 10 subcellular compartments were annotated, including cytosol (C), nucleus (N), plasma membrane (PM), mitochondrion (MI), endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus (GL), vesicle (V), cytoskeleton (CS), centrosome (CT), and aggresome (AG). Two representative fields were captured for each kinase and the images were deposited to the Cell Image Library database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cellimagelibrary.org/pages/kinome_atlas">http://cellimagelibrary.org/pages/kinome_atlas</ext-link>). Annotation was based on patterns of kinase localization similar to that of an organelle marker protein as demonstrated in a similar condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). A sum of 10 points were assigned to each kinase to reflect their distribution across the 10 compartments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). A total of 456 kinases were annotated, while the other 8 kinases were not detected. We defined specific localization to a compartment as a localization score of 5 or more. When the score was 5/5 between cytosol and another compartment, it was defined specific to the non-cytosolic compartment. A kinase was called multilocalizing if its localization scores at any localization were less than 5. Representative kinases with specific localizations are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>. This collected resource was referred to as the KA.</p><p>In the initial screen, about 50.2% of the kinome mainly localized in the cytosol, followed by 16.4% in nucleus, and 10.3% on plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Each of mitochondria, ER, Golgi, and vesicle structures held less than 5% of the kinome. Three kinases DCLK2, MAP4K3, and ABL2 exhibited specific localization to cytoskeleton-like structures, but 12 other kinases exhibited some level of cytoskeletal localization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Only two kinases PLK4 and PLK1 had centrosomal localization. Aggresomes were distinguished from vesicles mainly by an irregular shape or aberrant distribution pattern, and were adopted only by WNK4, TSSK3, and STYK1 as specific localization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Interestingly, plotting of subcellular localizations onto the kinome tree using KinMap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eid et al., 2017</xref>) revealed a family-centered enrichment of cellular compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), which was confirmed by clustering analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). 77.5% of the STE (homologues of yeast Ste7, Ste11, and Ste20 kinases) family were in cytosol, significantly higher than other families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). On the other hand, CMGC (CDK, MAPK, GSK3, and CLK kinases), atypical, and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CAMK) families were more enriched for nuclear kinases, 39.0, 34.5, and 30.2%, respectively. The TK family was enriched for kinases on the plasma membrane, largely due to the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) subfamily. The AGC (family of protein kinases A, G, and C) family was also overrepresented on the plasma membrane reflecting their functions in relaying extracellular signals. Most mitochondrial kinases were in the atypical kinase family. Finally, the receptor guanylate cyclase (RGC) and PKL families were largely formed by ER- and Golgi-localized kinases. Shared localization by the same family is likely due to common evolutionary ancestor and structural similarities, and suggests related functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>KA complements current databases for kinome localization</title><p>We compared KA with protein subcellular localization databases for coverage of the kinome. COMPARTMENTS has four evidence channels: knowledge, experiments, text-mining, and predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Binder et al., 2014</xref>). Information from the knowledge channel is based on annotations from UniProtKB and other resources, with a confidence score from one star (lowest confidence) to five stars (highest confidence). We considered only high-confidence localizations with at least four stars, resulting in 429 kinases with an average of 2.3 localizations per kinase. Less reliable information from text-mining and predictions was not included. The experiments channel holds data from the HPA project and was thus separately compared to KA. There are 438 kinases with an average of 1.3 ‘main’ localizations in HPA. 6 kinases were not covered by any of the three resources, and KA annotated 18 kinases on top of COMPARTMENTS and HPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).

These matched localizations were mainly cytosol, nucleus, and plasma membrane. However, 97 kinases did not match with COMPARTMENTS. 27 among them were cytosolic in KA, but mainly plasma membrane, Golgi, extracellular space, and mitochondria-localized in COMPARTMENTS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The ratio of N-terminal tag (70.4%) in these 27 kinases was higher than that in the whole library (54.7%) suggesting that for some kinases the N-terminal tag had interfered with localizations requiring N-terminal signal peptide. However, among 187 N-tagged kinases with high-confidence localizations in COMPARTMENTS, 131 were consistent with that found in KA. Among the 56 differential kinases, 34 had membrane-related localizations in COMPARTMENTS. An additional four N-tagged kinases had transmembrane regions and predicted signal peptides. Thus, we designed C-tagged version plasmids for these 38 plasmids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Following a similar imaging procedure, we found 9 kinases could not be detected and 8 kinases were not affected by tag position, but 21 kinases had different subcellular localization pattern. The KA was therefore revised (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). To further validate specific ER, GL, CS, and CT localizations with a score ≥5, we carried out co-staining with respective markers. 36 out of 42 kinases were validated, and 6 kinases were revised in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>. The kinome tree plot of kinase subcellular localizations was also revised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Various intracellular vesicles were not further validated by co-staining, and new MI and PM localization was validated below by co-staining and fractionation, respectively.</p><p>Comparison between revised KA and COMPARTMENTS revealed 74.8% localizations were consistent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). 29 differential kinases were cytosolic in KA, among which 17 had nuclear localization in COMPARTMENTS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). It is possible that these kinases shuttle between cytosol and the nucleus. Indeed, half of them had low levels of nuclear localization in KA. When compared with HPA, a higher ratio of kinases exhibited different localizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). An important reason was antibody specificity in HPA because if only 229 kinases with more reliable ‘enhanced’ or ‘supported’ localizations were included, the ratio of matched localizations increased by 10% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Different from KA-COMPARTMENTS comparison, KA-HPA unmatched localizations were higher in cytosol (51.5%), and more than half of these kinases were mainly nuclear in HPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). This observation is consistent with the finding that the number of nuclear proteins in HPA Cell Atlas considerably exceeds previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thul et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting a tendency of nuclear background for antibodies in the HPA collection.</p><p>For some kinases, COMPARTMENTS and HPA annotated different localizations.

Furthermore, KA uniquely annotated 103 kinase localizations different from other databases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). Importantly, these localization were largely unpredictable by main stream subcellular localization prediction tools such as WoLF PSORT and YLoc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Briesemeister et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Horton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>), suggesting new localization mechanisms.

Selected kinases from the remaining 45 were further validated. Seven kinases exhibited novel plasma membrane localization in KA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Cellular fraction confirmed that RPS6KA2, BRSK2, NIM1K, CSNK1G3, and NLK were mainly membranous, while MAPK11 and FRK were partially in membrane fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

By co-expression with GFP-tagged SEC61B, an ER resident protein, we confirmed the ER localization of POMK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). SGK3 was enriched in vesicles around the Golgi, with lower expression in the Golgi itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In addition, SGK3 colocalized with endosomal marker EEA1 as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We speculated that SGK3 and other Golgi-localized kinases might also be secreted to the extracellular space. Cell lysates and culture mediums were collected from transfected cells, and were further concentrated by immunoprecipitation. FAM20C but not NLK could readily be detected in medium before and after immunoprecipitation, serving as positive and negative controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Interestingly, SGK3, but not other kinases examined, could be immunoprecipitated from culture medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), indicating it was secreted, although at a much lower level than FAM20C. Furthermore, C-terminal-tagged SGK3 was also secreted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). SGK3 lacks a signal peptide, but instead has a PX domain, suggesting it may be secreted unconventionally in exosomes, which was supported by two experiments. First, treatment of cells with brefeldin A (BFA), an inhibitor of ER/Golgi‐trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Misumi et al., 1986</xref>), blocked secretion of FAM20C, but not SGK3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Second, when exosomes were sedimented from medium by ultracentrifugation, SGK3 but not FAM20C was enriched in the pellet fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

However, MAP4K3 tubules were overlapping with ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), which was confirmed by super-resolution microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Interestingly, MAP4K3 tubules were also obvious in A549, Du 145, and H460 cells, all of which, as well as HeLa cells, have mutation of the <italic>LKB1</italic> gene, an upstream regulator of mTOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Corradetti et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>).

Furthermore, restoration of LKB1 expression in H460 cells markedly inhibited MAP4K3 tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). We noticed that the MAP4K3 cDNA in the library was the same as originally reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Diener et al., 1997</xref>), which lacks N-terminal 12 amino acids compared with reference sequence. We therefore cloned the full-length MAP4K3 with N- and C-terminal tags, and confirmed their tubule-like localization in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F, G</xref>).

While wildtype HIPK2 were mostly in nuclear puncta, inactive HIPK2 was diffusive in cytoplasm in more than 50% of cells.

Furthermore, similar structures were also found in cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Puncta were more abundant in cells with high expression levels, suggesting concentration-dependent LLPS as an underlying mechanism. Protein kinases such as DYRK1A were reported to function in structures formed by LLPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu et al., 2018</xref>). We tested the role of LLPS in formation of kinase condensates first using 1,6-hexanediol (Hex), a compound perturbing weak hydrophobic interactions to disassemble structures that exhibit liquid-like properties. Nuclear puncta formed by TRIB3 and HIPK2, as well as cytoplasmic puncta of BMP2K and CIT were largely eliminated by Hex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). However, Hex did not eliminate puncta formed by other kinases examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Although structures formed by LLPS may not be sensitive to Hex treatment due to possibilities such as liquid-to-solid transition, we chose Hex-sensitive structures for further analysis to avoid complex interpretations. We confirmed similar localization pattern using GFP-tagged kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Time-lapse live-cell imaging revealed frequent puncta movements and fusion events for TRIB3, HIPK2, and BMP2K, demonstrating their dynamic and liquid-like properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). LLPS of proteins are mainly mediated by multivalent interactions through multiple folded domains or intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boeynaems et al., 2018</xref>). All three kinases lack multiple protein-protein interaction domains, but have IDRs predicted by IUPred2A and PLAAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). However, IDRs were also frequently predicted when analyzing randomly selected five nuclear kinases and five cytosolic kinases with even distribution pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F, G</xref>), suggesting that predicted IDR is not sufficient for LLPS. Importantly, among all kinases analyzed, HIPK2, and BMP2K uniquely have prion-like regions overlapping with IDRs, which are largely devoid of charged residues, but enriched for polar residues, and are frequently involved in LLPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F, G</xref>). Furthermore, deletion of IDRs eliminated puncta of TRIB3 and BMP2K, supporting IDR-mediated LLPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). However, deletion of both IDRs in HIPK2 interrupted nuclear but not puncta localization, suggesting the involvement of other unpredicted region. In addition, the IDR of BMP2K, but not other kinases, formed puncta similar to the full-length protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H</xref>). To determine whether BMP2K could form puncta through LLPS on endogenous expression level, we generated BMP2K 3xHA tag knock-in HeLa cells through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1I</xref>). Successful knock-in was confirmed by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1J</xref>). Two types of BMP2K patterns were found, in cytoplasmic puncta or both in cytoplasmic puncta and nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Nuclear BMP2K was not observed in overexpression expression experiments and could be due to a different isoform. Importantly, cytoplasmic puncta of endogenous BMP2K were also eliminated by Hex treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Taken together, LLPS may have a broader role in kinase subcellular localization and functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>KA identified novel mitochondrial kinases</title><p>Mitochondria generate ATP and play multiple regulatory roles in cells.

The mitochondrial localization of MOK and TNK1 was further enhanced by moving epitope tags to the C-terminal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We further searched HPA and found 11 mitochondrial kinases not recorded by MitoCarta2.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

First, while mitochondrial MOK was visualized after cell permeabilization by Triton X-100, which breached both PM and OMM, it was not detected after cell permeabilization by digitonin, a detergent that penetrates PM but leaves OMM intact at limited concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vercesi et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Thus, MOK was inside mitochondria. Second, extraction of isolated mitochondria using high pH hypotonic buffer released MOK as well as IMS protein EndoG, matrix protein HSP60, but not membrane components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Thus, excluded MOK as a mitochondrial membrane protein. In addition, Hessian SIM super-resolution live-cell imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2018</xref>) found that MOK-GFP wrapped around both IMM as marked by Mitotracker and matrix as marked by HSP60-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). The above data revealed MOK as an IMS protein. Noteworthy, the signal of MOK was discontinuous and enriched in puncta reminiscent of the Mitochondrial Contact Site and Cristae Organizing System (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jakobs and Wurm, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), suggesting roles of MOK in mitochondrial structure.</p><p>We next determined the sequence basis for MOK mitochondrial localization. We confirmed that MOK isoform 1, longer than the isoform 2 as in the library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>), was also present in mitochondria, although at a lower ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Surprisingly, both an N-terminal fragment of MOK containing the kinase domain and a C-terminal fragment exhibited mitochondrial localizations similar to the wildtype protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), suggesting at least two sequences mediating mitochondrial importing. Deletion of amino acids 53–103, but not other N-terminal fragments, largely eliminated the mitochondrial localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F,</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In the C-terminal fragment, further truncating 30 or 60 amino acids (331–389, 361–389) eliminated mitochondria localization, and a peptide comprising only amino acids 301–360 had weak mitochondrial localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Therefore, two peptides 53–103 and 301–330 of MOK2 mediated the mitochondrial localization of MOK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). However, by sequence comparison to other new mitochondrial kinases, no new linear motif for mitochondrial localization was found.</p><p>Classically, mitochondrial importing of nuclear-encoded proteins relies on multi-protein translocator complexes such as the TOM complex, which imports precursors containing mitochondrial targeting sequences across OMM, and translocase of inner membrane (TIM) complex, which sorts precursors into matrix or IMM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schmidt et al., 2010</xref>). shRNA-mediated knockdown of precursor receptor <italic>TOM20</italic> but not <italic>TOM70</italic> blocked mitochondrial localization of MOK, suggesting TOM20 as a receptor for MOK importing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G,</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Furthermore, knockdown of <italic>TIM23</italic>, <italic>TIM17A</italic>, and <italic>TIM50</italic> in the same complex, but not <italic>TIM22</italic> and <italic>TIM9</italic>, eliminated mitochondrial MOK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Knockdown of <italic>HSPA9</italic>, which is responsible for translocation of matrix protein downstream of the TIM23 complex, also suppressed MOK mitochondrial localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). These observations suggest a mechanism involving coupled TOM20 OMM receptor and TIM23 IMM channel under facilitation by HSPA9. In this case, MOK must be reversely transported to IMS or be cleaved by proteases before entry into the matrix. Since mitochondrial MOK had a similar molecular weight as cytoplasmic MOK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), a cleavage is unlikely. We therefore examined the role of OXA1L and BCS1L, which are responsible for export of matrix proteins in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stiller et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wagener et al., 2011</xref>). However, knockdown of <italic>OXA1L</italic> or <italic>BCS1L</italic> did not affect mitochondrial or sub-mitochondrial localizations of MOK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G,</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Furthermore, mitochondrial MOK was also insensitive to knockdown of <italic>MIA40</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>), which facilitates import of proteins into IMS through an oxidation-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chacinska et al., 2004</xref>). Nevertheless, by co-immunoprecipitation, we confirmed that MOK and its kinase domain physically interacted with TOM20 and TIM23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Taken together, MOK is an IMS protein imported by a TOM20-TIM23-dependent mechanism independent of classical mitochondrial importing signal.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>MOK regulates mitochondria structure and functions</title><p>To determine functions of MOK, we generated <italic>MOK</italic> knockout cells using CRISPR/Cas9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Using in vitro autophosphorylation as an assay, we confirmed that MOK2 was kinase inactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1I</xref>), consistent with its incomplete kinase domain. Nevertheless, MOK2 not only had better mitochondrial localization than MOK1, but also rescued mitochondrial structure and functions in KO cells. Thus, MOK played a functional role in mitochondria in an activity-independent manner. We next identified MOK-interacting proteins by tandem affinity purification (TAP) from MCF10A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). Mass spectrometry revealed that about 20% of proteins co-purified with MOK were mitochondrial proteins, including mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, solute carriers, oxidative phosphorylation-related proteins, and chaperones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1J</xref>). Immunoprecipitation confirmed interactions of MOK with IMM protein ATAD3A and solute carriers SLC25A13 and SLC25A11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I,</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1K</xref>). ATAD3A spans OMM and IMM with two transmembrane regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gilquin et al., 2010</xref>), and has important functions in mitochondrial structure dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cooper et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">He et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, ATAD3A knockdown cells also exhibited reduced cristae number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J, K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1L</xref>). However, knockdown of ATAD3A did not worsen oxidative stress, suggesting that this function was mediated by other effectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1M</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we present Kinome Atlas (KA), a consolidated image database of the kinome on subcellular level with compartment annotations (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cellimagelibrary.org/pages/kinome_atlas">http://cellimagelibrary.org/pages/kinome_atlas</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Experiments in the same cell line transfected and cultured in a similar condition allowed comparison of individual kinases and kinase families. 19.1% (87/456) of kinases had only one localization, 72.4% (330/456) had a specific major localization (score ≥5), and 8.5% (39/456) were multi-localizing. While classical signal transduction pathways begin from signaling sensing at the plasma membrane, followed by signal transduction in the cytosol, and further to transcriptional regulation in the nucleus, we found enrichment of TK and AGC families on the plasma membrane, STE family in the cytosol, and CMGC, atypical, as well as CAMK families in the nucleus, suggesting division of roles between families. Consistently, small families are also enriched in organelles with more distinct functions, such as the enrichment of atypical kinase family in mitochondria, and overrepresentation of the RGC and PKL families in ER/Golgi. This distribution reflects the spatial dynamics of kinases as key molecules in signal transduction. It should be noted that due to the use of epitope tags and overexpression mislocalization is possible. However, KA will direct further validation of kinase subcellular localizations at the endogenous level in their physiologically relevant contexts. In relation to that, it should also be noticed that many kinases exhibit multiple subcellular localizations at different ratios, and other physiologically relevant localizations are also possible under a different context. It would be important to further investigate translocations of the kinome in response to various stimuli.</p><p>KA revealed kinases with previously unknown localizations to major or sub-compartments. Identification of SGK3 as an exosomal kinase suggests a role in intercellular communication. KA also found MAP4K3 in tubule structures overlapping with ER and microtubules, which is different from previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hsu et al., 2018</xref>). While the nature of this structure is not entirely clear, it is specifically regulated by LKB1, an upstream component of the mTOR pathway. It is possible that LKB1 regulates the structure itself or the localization of MAP4K3 to this structure. Intriguingly, MAP4K3 was reported to mediate the regulation of mTOR activity by amino acid sufficiency. Consistently, studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mice indicated a role of MAP4K3 in regulation of body size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bryk et al., 2010</xref>), immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chuang et al., 2011</xref>), and longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chuang et al., 2019</xref>), although the mechanism of action is not clear. Further elucidation of this LKB1-regulated localization of MAP4K3 may help solve the mystery. KA has also identified kinases enriched at nuclear peripheral regions, which may play a role in the maintenance and functions of this domain featured by gene-poor and compact chromatin with gene silencing markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stevens et al., 2017</xref>). KA has also documented a collection of new kinases on plasma membrane, in ER, and in nucleolus, which all worth further studies. Except for cytosolic and nuclear localizations, prediction of these new localizations were largely ineffective, suggesting novel sorting mechanisms such as signal patches.</p><p>LLPS of proteins was recently recognized to play physiological roles in various contexts. Many protein kinases such as DYRK3, DYRK1A, PLK4, and FYN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amaya et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Park et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wippich et al., 2013</xref>), were reported to function in condensates formed by LLPS. In KA, we found that 38.2% of specific nuclear kinases had uneven localizations with puncta in varying size under overexpression condition. Furthermore, similar condensates were also found for cytoplasmic kinases. We did not rule out the possibility that overexpression was a reason for the frequent observation of kinase condensates in KA since LLPS is highly dependent on protein concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alberti et al., 2019</xref>). Nevertheless, the fact that a high ratio of these kinases contains prion-like regions, and the deletion of which abolished condensate formation, suggests regulation with specificity. Importantly, at least for BMP2K, condensate formation was observed on the endogenous level. Kinase condensates formed by LLPS could regulate kinase activity. For instance, the yeast kinase Atg1 was found to form condensates through LLPS, which was important for autophagy initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fujioka et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, LLPS could also organize multi-component condensates for phosphorylation of substrates, for example, in the case of DYRK1A, in regulation of RNA polymerase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, BMP2K was mutated in the IDR in developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) and high myopia diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting functional roles of LLPS in BMP2K regulation and functions.</p><p>Mitochondrial kinases regulate mitochondria structure and functions. For example, PINK accumulates on dysfunctional mitochondria and recruits Parkin in a kinase-dependent manner to mediate autophagic removal of damaged organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen and Dorn, 2013</xref>). In this report, KA systematically identified new mitochondrial kinases, including MOK, LIMK2, PKN3, PRKCH, and TNK1, and confirmed less well-studied RPS6KA6, MAP3K11, and GRK6. All these new mitochondrial kinases lack classical mitochondrial importing signal peptide. However, at least for MOK, the importing still depends on the TOM-TIM complex. Although we did not exclude the possibility of an indirect mechanism, physical interaction between MOK and the TOM-TIM complex suggests unrecognized importing functions. Compared with other tissues, the mRNA level of MOK is much higher in spermatocytes and round spermatids. Thus, it is interesting to speculate MOK may function in spermatogenesis, during which mitochondria are dramatically remodeled for efficient energy production to support sperm movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moraes and Meyers, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Otani et al., 1988</xref>). In addition, elevated expression of MOK in cancer, such as in cholangiocarcinoma, and skin cutaneous melanoma (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://firebrowse.org/">http://firebrowse.org/</ext-link>), also suggests a functional role in tumorigenesis.</p><p>Taken together, the kinome of a single cell is partitioned with family-based features. Although limited to a snapshot of the live cell, KA compared 456 kinases under a similar experimental condition, thus resolved spatial distribution of one of the largest protein superfamilies. This resource, coupled with phospho-proteome analysis of cellular organelles, could broadly facilitate dissection of regulatory mechanisms for various cellular activities in normal and disease states.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Construction of the kinome plasmid library and other plasmids</title><p>The majority of clones were made by gateway technology using human open reading frame (ORF) entry clones from two sources, Center for Cancer Systems Biology (CCSB) of Harvard University (hORFeome v3.1), or Thermo Fisher (Ultimate ORF Clone LITE Collection).

subcellular map of the human kinome&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jonathan Cooper as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Tony Hunter (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper presents the a large survey of the subcellular localizations of over 80% of the human kinome, as determined by appending an epitope or fluorescent tag at the N or C terminus. The results are catalogued in the Kinase Atlas (KA). A subset of the localizations were investigated further, including those of a putative secreted kinase SGK3 and a mitochondrial kinase, MOK1. The KA will be a useful resource, but it has limitations owing to the use of transient over-expression and possible mislocalization caused by the tagging. These limitations need to be more explicitly stated, and some of the conclusions should be moderated.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The original reviews are at the end of this email for your consideration. The reviewers have discussed their reviews with the editor and we consider the following revisions to be essential.</p><p>1. The main concern is that some localizations in the KA may be artifactual. This has been an issue with previous large scale tagging surveys in other organisms. Over-expression and the position of the tag could affect subcellular localization. This is more of a concern because the position of the tag (at N or C terminus) seems to be somewhat arbitrary, based on availability of the construct in the library. We therefore recommend softening the claims in the paper, including modifying the Abstract to explicitly state that, for some kinases, either over-expression or the epitope tag may alter localization, so the KA may not in all cases represent the localization of the endogenous protein.</p><p>2. It is not clear whether subcellular localization was assessed by the co-staining with specific markers or recognizing specific patterns. This should be clarified. Also, the authors should explain how they loaded subcellular fractions for the blots (equalized for ug protein or for cell number).</p><p>3. Conclusions regarding MOK localization and function should be modified (reviewer 1, points 2-3), but we are not requiring additional experiments as they are beyond the scope of this paper.</p><p>4. More experiments are needed to understand whether SGK3 is secreted (reviewer 1 point 5). The SGK3 in the media could be soluble or in extracellular vesicles (microvesicles or exosomes). SGK3 has a PX domain for binding endosomes, so it may enter MVBs. The authors should perform high-speed centrifugation and confirm whether SGK3 is in the soluble fraction or pellet. In addition, the text should be modified to clarify that, if secreted, release would be through an unconventional secretion pathway.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Here, the authors have carried out a systematic survey of the subcellular localizations of a large fraction of the protein kinases in the human kinome, which they have catalogued in a Kinase Atlas (KA). To do this they tagged 464 out of the 538 human protein kinases with Flag, HA, HA-Flag, Myc or GFP at either the N- or C-terminus, and transiently expressed them by transfection in HeLa cells. ~95% of the tagged kinases could be detected, with about half being expressed at high level. Staining for the pertinent tags and comparison with cells stained for organellar marker proteins allowed the authors to assign each protein kinase to one of 10 subcellular compartments: cytosol (C), nucleus (N), plasma membrane (PM), mitochondrion (MI), endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus (GL), vesicle (V), cytoskeleton (CS), centrosome (CT), and aggresome (AG). Half the kinases were localized to the cytosol, 15% to the nucleus, and 10% to the plasma membrane, and the rest were divided among other compartments, with several kinases having more than one location. Families of kinases tended to have preferred locations; for instance, as expected the tyrosine kinase family was enriched on the plasma membrane, largely due to the large number of RTKs. Most of the assigned mitochondrial kinases were atypical protein kinases, whereas the RGC and PKL subfamilies were ER/Golgi localized. They found about 70% overlap between their KA localizations and other databases, such as COMPARTMENTS and the Human Proteome Atlas. Some of the discrepancies may depend on whether the tags were N- or C-terminal and the nature of the tag. They found 104 kinase localizations that were uniquely annotated by KA, with 7 localized to the plasma membrane, as confirmed by cell fractionation studies. POMK, the protein-O-mannose kinase, was confirmed to be ER localized, as expected. SGK3 was annotated as specific for the Golgi compartment, but could also be detected in conditioned medium. MAP4K3/MEKK3 was found to decorate tubular structures that were shown to overlap with the ER. Several nuclear kinases were unevenly distributed in puncta of varying size, Including TRIB3 and HIPK2, whereas BMP2K formed puncta in the cytoplasm. Treatment with hexanediol disrupted puncta formed by several of these protein kinases but not puncta formed by other protein kinases, suggesting that the hexanediol-sensitive puncta might form as a result of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Deletion of predicted IDRs in TRIB3 and BMP2K eliminated their puncta formation. To determine if endogenous BMP2K formed LLPS puncta, they generated BMP2K-HA tag knock-in HeLa cells, and observed BMP2K present in cytoplasmic and/or nuclear puncta, which were abolished by hexanediol treatment. They also found four previously unidentified mitochondrial kinases not annotated in MitoCarta2: MOK, LIMK2, PKN3 and the TNK1 tyrosine kinase. They confirmed the mitochondrial localization of MOK by generating a MOK-Flag knock-in HeLa cell line, and showing that both a full-length 50 kDa form and shorter 20 kDa form were enriched in a mitochondrial fraction. Fractionation and IF analysis indicated that MOK and TNK1 were localized to the mitochondrial intermembrane space, whereas LIMK2 was on the outer mitochondrial membrane. They mapped two short regions in MOK (aa53-103 and aa301-330), required for mitochondrial import. To explore a possible mitochondrial function of MOK, the authors generated MOK knockout A375 melanoma cells and stable MOK knockdown Caki-1 cells, and found that MOK KO/KD cell mitochondria had fewer cristae based on EM analysis, and that both respiration rate and ATP level were reduced, and could be rescued by expression of the MOK2 splice variant but less well by full length MOK1. They showed that the MOK2 splice variant, missing 30 residues near the N terminus of the catalytic domain, lacked in vitro kinase activity, and yet was able to rescue the mitochondrial phenotype of the MOK KO A375 cells. Finally, in investigating possible mechanisms of MOK mitochondrial import, they showed that depletion HSPA9, which is responsible for inward translocation of matrix proteins downstream of the TIM23 complex, reduced MOK import, and that MOK was associated with the IMM protein ATAD3A, which spans between the IMM and OMM, and the SLC25A13 and SLC25A11 solute carriers.</p><p>The authors' efforts to carry out a nearly complete (464/538) kinome-wide subcellular localization assessment of the human protein kinases has led to some new findings with regard to protein kinase localization and function, and the resultant Kinome Atlas should be a useful resource for people working in the phosphorylation field. However, this analysis has largely relied on transient expression of tagged protein kinases, and the resultant overexpression and/or the added tag may have led to artifactual subcellular localization, meaning that some fraction of the reported kinase localizations may not be correct. Although many of the analyzed protein kinases appear to have the expected subcellular localization, only the new localizations of two protein kinases, BMPK2 and MOK, were validated at the endogenous level by knocking in a tag, and very few of the other protein kinase localizations were checked by staining for the endogenous proteins. The observation that some protein kinases form hexanediol-sensitive liquid-liquid phase separated (LLPS) puncta could imply previously unsuspected new regulatory biology, but only BMPK2 was shown to form puncta at endogenous levels, and it is possible that transient overexpression might have driven LLPS formation for other protein kinases. In consequence, it would be reassuring to check whether the endogenous protein kinases in question can form hexanediol-sensitive puncta. The new finding that the MOK protein kinase localizes to the mitochondrial intermembrane space is interesting, although more needs to be done to understand how MOK is targeted to this location and how it functions to regulate mitochondrial morphology and activity in a kinase-independent manner.</p><p>1. It is unclear to what extent the observed protein kinase localizations require intrinsic protein kinase activity (apart from MOK). This could be checked by expressing kinase-dead mutants of a subset of the protein kinases with interesting localizations. Such studies may be beyond the scope of this paper, but this issue should be discussed.</p><p>2. We do not learn anything (new) about subcellular localization signals for protein kinases that have exclusive localizations; for instance, were any new localization motifs found by sequence analysis. Even in the case of MOK, where two short motifs required for mitochondrial import were mapped, it remains unclear how these MOK motifs trigger mitochondrial import, despite the significant number of knockdown and IP/MS experiments carried out to define a possible mechanism of mitochondrial import.</p><p>3. MOK was the single understudied protein kinase they examined in depth, and the data demonstrating MOK localization to the mitochondrial intermembrane space in A375 melanoma cells seem quite convincing. However, MOK is expressed at very low levels in most tissues (except testes), and since MOK mitochondrial function was shown to be kinase-independent, its mechanism of action in regulating cristae morphology remains unclear. Also, the effects of MOK KO/KD on mitochondrial function in cells other than A375 cells were not so striking, casting some doubt on whether MOK is likely to be of general importance MOK in mitochondrial morphology and function.</p><p>4. Based on Figure 1D, it appears that the authors did not co-stain for a protein kinase of interest and a compartment specific marker to localize the protein kinase, but rather relied on patterns of kinase localization similar to that of an organelle marker protein. If this was what was done, it needs to be explained.</p><p>5. Figure 3: Despite these data, it is not clear that SGK3 is secreted in the usual sense of the word, since lacking a signal peptide, one would not expect SGK3 to enter the conventional secretory pathway. For this reason, the authors need to establish whether the SGK3 protein that they identified in the medium is soluble or rather is in or associated with membrane vesicles of some sort, which seems more likely. The authors provide no information in the Materials and methods on how they immunoprecipitated Flag-SGK3 from the culture medium. For instance, was detergent used, in which case SGK3 would have been released from vesicles. The authors could test SGK3 association with vesicles by centrifuging the medium at 100,000 g, which would sediment vesicles, and see whether or not the SGK3 protein remains n the supernatant. Also, as is the case for the other fractionation experiments (see point 6 below), an aliquot of medium corresponding to the fraction of the cell lysate that was analyzed in parallel should be immunoprecipitated to provide the reader a sense of what percentage of the SGK3 population is &quot;secreted&quot;. In this regard, it is clear from the figure that the efficiency of SGK3 &quot;secretion&quot; was a lot lower than that of FAM20C, which is a well authenticated secreted protein kinase.</p><p>6. For the cell fractionation experiments shown in Figures 3 and 5, and elsewhere, it needs to be made clear in the Materials and methods whether the different fractions represent samples from the same number of cells or rather the same amount of protein. For a fair comparison, the proper way to do this is to normalize to the same number of cells.</p><p>7. Figure 4A: Are the protein kinases with prominent IF signals at the nuclear periphery localized inside or outside the nucleus?</p><p>8. Figure 5E: The MOK1 and MOK2 alternatively spliced isoforms should generate two proteins separated by ~3 kDa. However, only a single MOK band from the MOK-KI cells is arrowed here and in Figure S5H, and yet one would have expected two bands if MOK2 is expressed in these cells.</p><p>9. Figures 6 and 7: It is not clear how the 20 kDa MOK isoform is generated, but since the 3X Flag tag was at the C-terminus, this form must contain the C-terminus of MOK1/2. Can the 20 kDa form be detected in the MOK-KI cells?</p><p>10. Figure S7: MOK1 and MOK2 KR mutants were used in panel I, but these mutants are not described in the legend or in the Materials and methods. One assumes that these were designed as kinase-dead mutants -which Lys was mutated to Arg?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Zhang et al. describe the Kinome Atlas (KA), a map of the subcellular localization of 456 kinases representing 85% of the human kinome. The KA is based on experimentally acquired imaging data; the authors have assessed the localization of these kinases using immunofluorescence of overexpressed tagged cDNAs. Importantly, the authors define 10 subcellular compartments that are used to catalog each kinase based on their localization.</p><p>Using KA, the authors define the subcellular localization of a collection of kinases that had not been previously studied. In addition, they further report a particular subcellular pattern in some kinases, which the authors attribute to molecular condensates.</p><p>Among the novel kinases identified to localize in mitochondria, the authors decided to further characterize MOK. This kinase localized in the intermembrane space, due to the presence of two localization peptides and through a TOM20/TIM23-dependent mechanism. Moreover, knocking out MOK in cells resulted in decreased mitochondrial cristae, reduced oxygen consumption and ATP levels, and increased reactive oxygen species. The authors conclude that MOK plays an important role in mitochondrial function.</p><p>Overall, this work is an important resource for many scientists interested in kinase biology because it represents a unique catalog assessing the subcellular localization of virtually all the kinome. The conclusions are well-supported by the data and the authors discover novel insights of poorly characterized kinases. Moreover, it is likely the KA will catalyze novel discoveries based on the unexpected subcellular localization of many kinases.</p><p>These are some of the concerns that I have found that require some additional clarification:</p><p>1. Although the authors claim that KA has been obtained by a unified experimental approach, this does not seem to be the case. There is a significant number of cDNAs that have been expressed with either N or C-terminal tags, with different affinity tags, or are from different species. A more systematic approach to curate, tag, and express these kinases would yield a much more robust dataset. Along these lines, it would have been extraordinary to have curated the whole human kinome.</p><p>2. When looking at the different kinases used in this work and their tags (Sup Table 1), it appears that the authors did not take into consideration the biology of each kinase when deciding whether to use an N- or C-terminal tag. Instead, it was decided based on the availability of Gateway entry clones (which some contain Stop codon, while others don't). For instance, several RTK are tagged at the N-terminal side (KIT, FGFR4, IGFR1, Tie2, and others), which is known to affect their localization, cleavage into the mature form, and interaction to ligands. This limitation has been addressed in some specific cases, where the authors have performed both N- and C-terminal tagging. However, in my opinion, because it is not possible to anticipate how tagging would affect the localization or biology of many kinases that contain regulatory motifs at the N/C terminal regions, the results from KA have to be interpreted with caution, since in some cases could be artifactual.</p><p>3. While the authors have not really elucidated the mechanism and/or function of MOK in mitochondria, I believe that it is beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p>4. Given how valuable these reagents could be for the scientific community, I would recommend that the library is deposited in a public repository (i.e. Addgene).</p><p>5. I would recommend the authors to carefully review the list of kinases and their domain architecture and assess whether some of these should be repeated using a different tagging approach. If possible, including some of the protein kinases that are missing would make this resource even more important and useful to the scientific community.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A subcellular map of the human kinome&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. I have read over your revised article and agree that you have addressed essentially all of the reviewers' concerns, including adding more experiments that were not requested. The paper is much improved and I am ready to accept it.</p><p>I noticed a couple of points that you may wish to address before acceptance.</p><p>First, regarding MAP4K3, you say the localization is overlapping with microtubules and ER (line 277, Figure 3F). This is not at all obvious from 3F, although the super resolution image in 3G shows excellent co-localization with Sec61. I wonder whether increasing the intensity of the red channel in the merge, and zooming in on region of apparent co-localization, would be helpful.</p><p>Second, regarding MOK, line 410, I think you mean that 0.5% digitonin does not permeabilize the IMM. Is there a citation to digitonin permeabilization, and what is the purpose of 0.1% Triton in the figure (it must permeabilize both membranes to allow antibody access but does not allow MOK to leak out). Please explain.</p><p>Third, please double check grammar. I will ask staff to proof read carefully upon acceptance, but it will help if you make corrections yourself.</p><p>Congratulations on the research. This paper will be a valuable resource for cell biology.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64943.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The original reviews are at the end of this email for your consideration.

Also in the original manuscript, mitochondrial localizations were confirmed by co-staining with TOM20. We did not co-stain all markers for all kinases in the initial screen due to a tremendous amount of work. However, during the revision, we validated specific ER, Golgi, cytoskeleton and centrosome localizations with a score ≥ 5 by co-staining with respective markers (page 7, line 208). A total of 40 kinases were validated this way, and 36 were consistent with initial conclusions. Initial observations for 4 kinases were not supported by co-staining. TYRO3 previously annotated as mainly GL was in vesicles around GL. ROR1 previously annotated as GL was mostly ER. PAK4 previously annotated as ER was mostly in cytoplasm and in aggresomes. PRKCH previously annotated as ER were found in both MI and ER, and slightly more in MI, suggesting a role in ER-MI interaction. These revisions were documented in Supplementary Table 2, related images were deposited in CIL or in Figure 5C (PRKCH). Plasma membrane localizations were either consistent with previous reports or were validated by fractionation in the original manuscript, thus were not further validated by co-staining. Intracellular vesicles comprising many organelles with distinct markers, and were morphologically obvious to distinguish, thus were not further validated by marker co-staining. We revised workflow of KA mapping (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C).</p><p>For western blots of subcellular fractions, the loading was normalized to the same number of cells. We revised respective figure legends for better understanding.

However, no new linear motif of mitochondrial localization was found. We add this discussion in page 14, line 433; page 17, line 545, and in page 18, line 576.</p><p>In response to reviewer 1, point 3, we searched for MOK expression levels. MOK mRNA expression is high in testes in both human and mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>), suggesting a physiological role of MOK in spermatogenesis, during which mitochondria is dramatically remodeled for efficient energy production to support sperm movements. The potential function of mitochondrial MOK in spermatogenesis could be further examined by future investigations. Furthermore, we found that the mRNA level of MOK was deregulated in some cancers in the TCGA database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). For instance, MOK was elevated in cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL), and has highest level in skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), suggesting a functional role in cancer. In melanoma cell line A375, knockout of MOK strongly decreases mitochondria cristae number, mitochondrial respiration, and cellular ATP level (Figure 7A-E). In Caki-1 cells, MOK was knocked down by shRNAs, while both shRNAs also reduces mitochondria cristae number (p &lt; 0.0001), reduction of cellular ATP level was only marginally inhibited by shRNA #2 (p = 0.0377) (Figure 7-supplement 1C-E). This could be due to cell type-dependent metabolic reprogramming which may produce ATP through other pathways, such as glycolysis. We modified statements in page 18, last paragraph.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Expression of MOK in human and mouse tissues.</title><p>Data was analyzed from the HPA RNA-seq normal tissues project (human) and the Mouse ENCODE transcriptome data.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-64943-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Expression of <italic>MOK</italic> in human cancers in TCGA database as analyzed by FireBrowse (http://firebrowse.org/).</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-64943-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) More experiments are needed to understand whether SGK3 is secreted (reviewer 1 point 5). The SGK3 in the media could be soluble or in extracellular vesicles (microvesicles or exosomes). SGK3 has a PX domain for binding endosomes, so it may enter MVBs. The authors should perform high-speed centrifugation and confirm whether SGK3 is in the soluble fraction or pellet. In addition, the text should be modified to clarify that, if secreted, release would be through an unconventional secretion pathway.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this constructive suggestion. To determine whether SGK3 is secreted by conventional ER/Golgi pathway or MVB pathway, we first examined the effect of brefeldin A (BFA), an inhibitor of ER/Golgi‐trafficking. As shown in the revised Figure 3E, BFA blocked secretion of FAM20C, but not SGK3, suggesting it was not secreted through ER/Golgi pathway. Furthermore, we performed ultracentrifugation at 100,000 g, and found SGK3 but not FAM20C in pellet (revised Figure 3—figure supplement 1D). These findings indicate that SGK3 is secreted unconventionally through the MVB pathway. Text was modified accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…]</p><p>The authors' efforts to carry out a nearly complete (464/538) kinome-wide subcellular localization assessment of the human protein kinases has led to some new findings with regard to protein kinase localization and function, and the resultant Kinome Atlas should be a useful resource for people working in the phosphorylation field. However, this analysis has largely relied on transient expression of tagged protein kinases, and the resultant overexpression and/or the added tag may have led to artifactual subcellular localization, meaning that some fraction of the reported kinase localizations may not be correct. Although many of the analyzed protein kinases appear to have the expected subcellular localization, only the new localizations of two protein kinases, BMPK2 and MOK, were validated at the endogenous level by knocking in a tag, and very few of the other protein kinase localizations were checked by staining for the endogenous proteins. The observation that some protein kinases form hexanediol-sensitive liquid-liquid phase separated (LLPS) puncta could imply previously unsuspected new regulatory biology, but only BMPK2 was shown to form puncta at endogenous levels, and it is possible that transient overexpression might have driven LLPS formation for other protein kinases. In consequence, it would be reassuring to check whether the endogenous protein kinases in question can form hexanediol-sensitive puncta. The new finding that the MOK protein kinase localizes to the mitochondrial intermembrane space is interesting, although more needs to be done to understand how MOK is targeted to this location and how it functions to regulate mitochondrial morphology and activity in a kinase-independent manner.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for a positive opinion on our manuscript. Regarding localization of endogenous protein kinases, we have also tried staining with commercially available anti-endogenous protein antibodies for TRIB3 and PRPF4B, two kinases with LLPS-like puncta. Nevertheless, the specificity of these antibodies could not be satisfactorily verified. These data were thus not included.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. It is unclear to what extent the observed protein kinase localizations require intrinsic protein kinase activity (apart from MOK). This could be checked by expressing kinase-dead mutants of a subset of the protein kinases with interesting localizations. Such studies may be beyond the scope of this paper, but this issue should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>To determine the effect of protein kinase activity in its localization, we selected 2 PM kinases, 2 MI kinases, 2 kinases with LLPS-like puncta, and MAP4K3 with tubule-like structures. Kinase inactive mutants were made, and localizations were examined. Except HIPK2, all other inactive kinases showed localization patterns similar to their wildtype counterparts (Figure 3—figure supplement 1H). While wildtype HIPK2 were mostly in nuclear puncta, inactive HIPK2 was diffusive in cytoplasm in more than 50% of cells. Thus, case by case, subcellular localizations of protein kinases could be dependent on their activity. This new result is discussed in page 10, line 295.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. We do not learn anything (new) about subcellular localization signals for protein kinases that have exclusive localizations; for instance, were any new localization motifs found by sequence analysis. Even in the case of MOK, where two short motifs required for mitochondrial import were mapped, it remains unclear how these MOK motifs trigger mitochondrial import, despite the significant number of knockdown and IP/MS experiments carried out to define a possible mechanism of mitochondrial import.</p></disp-quote><p>It would be interesting to decode consensus linear motifs from newly identified kinases with specific localizations. In order to do so, we have searched for known motifs using Motif Scan (https://myhits.sib.swiss/cgi-bin/motif_scan/), MOTIFS (https://molbiol-tools.ca/Motifs.htm), and searched for new linear motifs using MEME Suite (http://meme-suite.org/). To exclude the interference of the kinase domain, which is highly homologous, we have also performed analysis using sequences excluding the kinase domain. However, no new motifs related to mitochondrial or plasma membrane localizations were found. Other localizations were not analyzed. We postulate that unconventional localization signals may be diverse and present at low ratios. There may be a higher chance to identify such motifs when analysis was performed on the proteome level beyond the kinome. In addition, as we discussed in page 17, line 545, novel sorting mechanisms such as signal patches are possible, which could not be predicted from secondary sequence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. MOK was the single understudied protein kinase they examined in depth, and the data demonstrating MOK localization to the mitochondrial intermembrane space in A375 melanoma cells seem quite convincing. However, MOK is expressed at very low levels in most tissues (except testes), and since MOK mitochondrial function was shown to be kinase-independent, its mechanism of action in regulating cristae morphology remains unclear. Also, the effects of MOK KO/KD on mitochondrial function in cells other than A375 cells were not so striking, casting some doubt on whether MOK is likely to be of general importance MOK in mitochondrial morphology and function.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer pointed out, MOK expression is high in testes in both human and mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>), suggesting a physiological role of MOK in spermatogenesis, during which mitochondria is dramatically remodeled for efficient energy production to support sperm movements. The potential function of mitochondrial MOK in spermatogenesis could be further examined by future investigations.

Based on Figure 1D, it appears that the authors did not co-stain for a protein kinase of interest and a compartment specific marker to localize the protein kinase, but rather relied on patterns of kinase localization similar to that of an organelle marker protein. If this was what was done, it needs to be explained.</p></disp-quote><p>In the original manuscript, nucleus was contained by DAPI and other organelles were recognized by specific patterns (revised manuscript page 5 line138). Also in the original manuscript, mitochondrial localizations were confirmed by co-staining with TOM20. We did not co-stain all markers for all kinases in the initial screen due to a tremendous amount of work. However, during the revision, we validated specific ER, Golgi, cytoskeleton and centrosome localizations with a score ≥ 5 by co-staining with respective markers (page 7, line 208). A total of 40 kinases were validated this way, and 36 were consistent with initial conclusions. Initial observations for 4 kinases were not supported by co-staining. TYRO3 previously annotated as mainly GL was in vesicles around GL. ROR1 previously annotated as GL was mostly ER. PAK4 previously annotated as ER was mostly in cytoplasm and in aggresomes. PRKCH previously annotated as ER were found in both MI and ER, and slightly more in MI, suggesting a role in ER-MI interaction. These revisions were documented in Supplementary Table 2, related images were deposited in CIL or in Figure 5C (PRKCH). Plasma membrane localizations were either consistent with previous reports or were validated by fractionation in the original manuscript, thus were not further validated by co-staining. Intracellular vesicles comprising many organelles with distinct markers, and were morphologically obvious to distinguish, thus were not further validated by marker co-staining. We revised workflow of KA mapping (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure 3: Despite these data, it is not clear that SGK3 is secreted in the usual sense of the word, since lacking a signal peptide, one would not expect SGK3 to enter the conventional secretory pathway. For this reason, the authors need to establish whether the SGK3 protein that they identified in the medium is soluble or rather is in or associated with membrane vesicles of some sort, which seems more likely. The authors provide no information in the Materials and methods on how they immunoprecipitated Flag-SGK3 from the culture medium. For instance, was detergent used, in which case SGK3 would have been released from vesicles. The authors could test SGK3 association with vesicles by centrifuging the medium at 100,000 g, which would sediment vesicles, and see whether or not the SGK3 protein remains n the supernatant. Also, as is the case for the other fractionation experiments (see point 6 below), an aliquot of medium corresponding to the fraction of the cell lysate that was analyzed in parallel should be immunoprecipitated to provide the reader a sense of what percentage of the SGK3 population is &quot;secreted&quot;. In this regard, it is clear from the figure that the efficiency of SGK3 &quot;secretion&quot; was a lot lower than that of FAM20C, which is a well authenticated secreted protein kinase.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this constructive suggestion. To immunoprecipitate SGK3 from medium, 1% NP-40 was added before IP. This information was updated in Materials and methods. To determine whether SGK3 is secreted by conventional ER/Golgi pathway or MVB pathway, we first examined the effect of brefeldin A (BFA), an inhibitor of ER/Golgi‐trafficking. As shown in the revised Figure 3E, BFA blocked secretion of FAM20C, but not SGK3, suggesting it was not secreted through ER/Golgi pathway. Furthermore, we performed ultracentrifugation at 100,000 g, and found SGK3 but not FAM20C in pellet (revised Figure 3—figure supplement 1D). These findings indicate that SGK3 is secreted unconventionally through the MVB pathway. Text was modified accordingly. In the revised Figure 3E, loading was normalized by the number of input cells, and IP samples were loaded at 5 × of input. Indeed, the secretion of SGK3 is much lower in comparison to FAM20C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. For the cell fractionation experiments shown in Figures 3 and 5, and elsewhere, it needs to be made clear in the Materials and methods whether the different fractions represent samples from the same number of cells or rather the same amount of protein. For a fair comparison, the proper way to do this is to normalize to the same number of cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not explain explicitly. But indeed, the loading was normalized to the same number of cells. We revised respective figure legends for better understanding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Figure 4A: Are the protein kinases with prominent IF signals at the nuclear periphery localized inside or outside the nucleus?</p></disp-quote><p>To answer the reviewer’s question, we stained cells for the kinase and a nuclear envelope marker protein Lamin A/C. Images were captured by Zeiss Airyscan high-resolution microscopy. The results indicate that all 6 kinases were overlapping or within the boundaries of cell nuclei. The new data was provided in revised Figure 4—figure supplement1A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Figure 5E: The MOK1 and MOK2 alternatively spliced isoforms should generate two proteins separated by ~3 kDa. However, only a single MOK band from the MOK-KI cells is arrowed here and in Figure S5H, and yet one would have expected two bands if MOK2 is expressed in these cells.</p></disp-quote><p>It is possible that one isoform of MOK is dominating in HeLa cells. We thus PCR amplified MOK and sequenced TA clones for the differential region. Indeed, among 17 clones sequenced, 14 (82%) were MOK1 and 3 were MOK2. Thus, HeLa cells mainly express MOK1, which accounts for a major band in MOK-KI cells. Furthermore, a non-specific band slightly smaller than MOK1 was found in HeLa cells, which also interferes with identifying a minor band of MOK.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Figures 6 and 7: It is not clear how the 20 kDa MOK isoform is generated, but since the 3X Flag tag was at the C-terminus, this form must contain the C-terminus of MOK1/2. Can the 20 kDa form be detected in the MOK-KI cells?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the 20KDa band could be detected in MOK-KI cells by anti-Flag western blotting (Figure. 5E). This band is MOK because MOK siRNA reduced the intensity of this band (Figure 5—figure supplement 1H and I). It could be a different isoform or a degradation product. But the exact mechanism for the generation of this band is unknown.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10.

The figure legend of Figure 7—figure supplement 1I was revised.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…]</p><p>These are some of the concerns that I have found that require some additional clarification:</p><p>1. Although the authors claim that KA has been obtained by a unified experimental approach, this does not seem to be the case. There is a significant number of cDNAs that have been expressed with either N or C-terminal tags, with different affinity tags, or are from different species. A more systematic approach to curate, tag, and express these kinases would yield a much more robust dataset. Along these lines, it would have been extraordinary to have curated the whole human kinome.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, it was our goal to map the whole human kinome. However, this was limited first by resources of our lab, and second by intrinsic characters of some leftover kinases. While many of these kinases were cloned, protein expression was undetectable when transfected. We revised statement of “a unified condition” to “in the same cell line transfected and cultured in a similar condition”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. When looking at the different kinases used in this work and their tags (Sup Table 1), it appears that the authors did not take into consideration the biology of each kinase when deciding whether to use an N- or C-terminal tag. Instead, it was decided based on the availability of Gateway entry clones (which some contain Stop codon, while others don't). For instance, several RTK are tagged at the N-terminal side (KIT, FGFR4, IGFR1, Tie2, and others), which is known to affect their localization, cleavage into the mature form, and interaction to ligands. This limitation has been addressed in some specific cases, where the authors have performed both N- and C-terminal tagging. However, in my opinion, because it is not possible to anticipate how tagging would affect the localization or biology of many kinases that contain regulatory motifs at the N/C terminal regions, the results from KA have to be interpreted with caution, since in some cases could be artifactual.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the editor and reviewers for pointing out limitations that should be further explained to readers. We revised the manuscript accordingly to explain potential limitations caused by overexpression and epitope tagging in the abstract, introduction, and conclusion sections (page 2, line 46; page 4, line 102; page17, line 520).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. While the authors have not really elucidated the mechanism and/or function of MOK in mitochondria, I believe that it is beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for understanding. The function and mechanism of MOK in mitochondria will be further investigated in future works.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Given how valuable these reagents could be for the scientific community, I would recommend that the library is deposited in a public repository (i.e. Addgene).</p></disp-quote><p>Kinase plasmids are currently available for request from the core facility of the Life Sciences Institute of Zhejiang University by emailing to lsicf@zju.edu.cn. We will try to deposit to Addgene once the COVID pandemic is resolved. For easier access to images of KA, images were deposited to the Cell Image Library database during the revision (http://flagella.crbs.ucsd.edu/pages/kinome_atlas?token=dHqMbfi06S). This replaces the original Supplementary document S1. A reviewer link was provided in the revised manuscript, and this will be replaced by a public link if accepted. The current reviewer portal allows browsing of images but is not searchable. However, the public version will be fully searchable for easier use of the dataset.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. I would recommend the authors to carefully review the list of kinases and their domain architecture and assess whether some of these should be repeated using a different tagging approach. If possible, including some of the protein kinases that are missing would make this resource even more important and useful to the scientific community.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for suggestions on further improving this resource. At the library construction stage, we have tried our best to either cloning or inquiring the missing kinases. However, the leftover kinases are mostly large genes, and we failed to clone them due to various reasons. Furthermore, many leftover kinases were undetectable when transfected, although we cloned the cDNA into multiple plasmid vectors. This is likely due to intrinsic features of the kinases. To assess the impact of N-tag, we compared KA to COMPARTMENTS. Among 187 N-tagged kinases with high confidence localizations in COMPARTMENTS, 131 were consistent with that found in KA, indicating that the N-terminal tag did not generally interfere with kinase localization. Among the 56 differential kinases, 34 have membrane-related or mitochondrial localizations in COMPARTMENTS. An additional 4 N-tagged kinases have transmembrane regions and predicted signal peptides. Thus, we constructed C-tagged version of these kinases, and imaging was done. KA was then revised according to the results (Supplementary Table 2). This procedure is part of KA and was described in page 7, line 204. This workflow was described in Figure 1—figure supplement 1C.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I noticed a couple of points that you may wish to address before acceptance.</p><p>First, regarding MAP4K3, you say the localization is overlapping with microtubules and ER (line 277, Figure 3F). This is not at all obvious from 3F, although the super resolution image in 3G shows excellent co-localization with Sec61. I wonder whether increasing the intensity of the red channel in the merge, and zooming in on region of apparent co-localization, would be helpful.</p><p>Second, regarding MOK, line 410, I think you mean that 0.5% digitonin does not permeabilize the IMM.
