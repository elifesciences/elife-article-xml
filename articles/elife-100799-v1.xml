Mutations in human leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), a multi-domain protein containing both a kinase and a GTPase, are a leading cause of the familial form of PD. Pathogenic LRRK2 mutations increase LRRK2 kinase activity. While the bulk of LRRK2 is found in the cytosol, the protein associates with membranes where its Rab GTPase substrates are found, and under certain conditions, with microtubules. Integrative structural studies using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy and in situ cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) have revealed the architecture of microtubule-associated LRRK2 filaments, and that formation of these filaments requires LRRK2’s kinase to be in the active-like conformation. However, whether LRRK2 can interact with and form filaments on microtubules in its autoinhibited state, where the kinase domain is in the inactive conformation and the N-terminal LRR domain covers the kinase active site, was not known. Using cryo-ET, we show that full-length human LRRK2 can oligomerize on microtubules in its autoinhibited state. Both WT-LRRK2 and PD-linked LRRK2 mutants formed filaments on microtubules. While these filaments are stabilized by the same interfaces seen in the active-LRRK2 filaments, we observed a new interface involving the N-terminal repeats that were disordered in the active-LRRK2 filaments. The helical parameters of the autoinhibited-LRRK2 filaments are different from those reported for the active-LRRK2 filaments. Finally, the autoinhibited-LRRK2 filaments are shorter and less regular, suggesting they are less stable.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>LRRK2</kwd><kwd>microtubules</kwd><kwd>parkinson's disease</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03zj4c476</institution-id><institution>Aligning Science Across Parkinson's</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ASAP-000519</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Siyu</given-names></name><name><surname>Basiashvili</surname><given-names>Tamar</given-names></name><name><surname>Hutchings</surname><given-names>Joshua</given-names></name><name><surname>Sanz Murillo</surname><given-names>Marta</given-names></name><name><surname>Villagran Suarez</surname><given-names>Amalia</given-names></name><name><surname>Xiong</surname><given-names>Erica</given-names></name><name><surname>Alegrio Louro</surname><given-names>Jaime</given-names></name><name><surname>Leschziner</surname><given-names>Andres E</given-names></name><name><surname>Villa</surname><given-names>Elizabeth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/021nxhr62</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DBI 1920374</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Villa</surname><given-names>Elizabeth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04yhme281</institution-id><institution>Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Siyu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/013kjyp64</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Basiashvili</surname><given-names>Tamar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04wfr2810</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF 871-2020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hutchings</surname><given-names>Joshua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/006w34k90</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Villa</surname><given-names>Elizabeth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Full-length, autoinhibited LRRK2 assembles into distinct, shorter microtubule-bound filaments via a previously unobserved N-terminal repeat interface, revealing new structural states with potential therapeutic implications.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders, with about 10% of cases being familial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Monfrini and Di Fonzo, 2017</xref>).

The C-terminal half contains a Ras-like guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase, or Ras of complex, ROC) domain, followed by a ‘C-terminal of ROC’ (COR) domain, a kinase domain, and a WD40 domain, with the latter found at the C terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Structures of both LRRK2’s C-terminal catalytic half (LRRK2<sup>RCKW</sup>) and full-length LRRK2 have been solved by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), along and bound to both nucleotides and kinase inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deniston et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Myasnikov et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhu et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sanz Murillo et al., 2023</xref>).

In general, type-I inhibitors capture kinases in a closed conformation by binding to the ATP-binding site and target the kinase in its ‘active-like’ conformation, inhibiting its kinase activity. Meanwhile, type-II inhibitors capture them in an open, inactive conformation. MLi-2 is a widely used LRRK2-specific type-I kinase inhibitor with very high potency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Scott et al., 2017</xref>). Although no LRRK2-specific type-II inhibitors have been reported, broad spectrum type-II inhibitors, such as GZD-824 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ren et al., 2013</xref>), have been shown to bind LRRK2 with high affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deniston et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sanz Murillo et al., 2023</xref>). As expected, the type-I inhibitor MLi-2 locks the LRRK2<sup>RCKW</sup> kinase domain in the closed, active-like conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deniston et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sanz Murillo et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Snead et al., 2022</xref>), while the type-II inhibitor GZD-824 stabilizes the kinase domain in the open, inactive conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sanz Murillo et al., 2023</xref>). Interestingly, recent high-resolution structures of full-length, in-solution LRRK2 show its kinase in an open conformation regardless of which kinase inhibitor was bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sanz Murillo et al., 2023</xref>). In that study, we suggested that the conformational restraining imposed by the N-terminal repeats of full-length LRRK2 prevent the kinase domain from closing. Thus, LRRK2 autoinhibition results from the combination of this effect and a physical blocking of the kinase’s active site by the LRR domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sanz Murillo et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Schmidt et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>When overexpressed, most PD-mutant hyperactive LRRK2 variants show strong co-localization with microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kett et al., 2012</xref>). One such mutant, LRRK2<sup>I2020T</sup>, has been used to solve its in situ structure on microtubules using cryo-ET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Watanabe et al., 2020</xref>). In vitro reconstitution of microtubules with LRRK2<sup>RCKW</sup> also revealed a similar filamentous assembly on microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Snead et al., 2022</xref>). LRRK2 inhibitors, such as MLi-2 and LRRK2-IN-1, augment LRRK2’s co-localization with microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deniston et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schmidt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Blanca Ramírez et al., 2017</xref>). MLi-2 stabilizes this interaction and was used for the cryo-EM reconstruction of the in vitro reconstituted microtubules-associated LRRK2<sup>RCKW</sup> filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Snead et al., 2022</xref>). On the other hand, it has been shown that type-II inhibitors decrease the formation of LRRK2 filaments in cells, even for hyperactive PD mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deniston et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Schmidt et al., 2021</xref>). Whether binding of LRRK2 to microtubules occurs under physiological conditions, if and how this is affected by PD-linked mutations, and how this could affect intracellular trafficking remain open questions.</p><p>The same COR:COR interface identified in the LRRK2 homodimer is present in the microtubule-associated LRRK2 (in situ) and LRRK2<sup>RCKW</sup> (in vitro reconstituted) filaments. In the structure of microtubule-bound filaments in situ, the N-terminal half of full-length LRRK2<sup>I2020T</sup> was not resolved during subtomogram analysis, suggesting that this part of the protein was flexible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Watanabe et al., 2020</xref>). Consistent with this, the kinase domain of MLi-2-bound LRRK2RCKW in the in vitro reconstituted filaments adopts the closed conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Snead et al., 2022</xref>). In addition to the COR:COR dimerization interface, the microtubule-associated filaments are formed by a WD40:WD40 interaction between adjacent LRRK2 dimers. While in situ LRRK2 and in vitro LRRK2<sup>RCKW</sup> share almost identical filament geometry on microtubules, this assembly is incompatible with the autoinhibited form of LRRK2: direct docking of the autoinhibited-LRRK2 dimer model into the microtubule–LRRK2<sup>RCKW</sup> map results in clashes involving the N-terminal domains. It is not known whether LRRK2 binds to microtubules only in its active state, or whether the autoinhibited state can bind as well. Given the importance of type-I LRRK2 inhibitors in the current PD-related clinical trials, as well as the different effects on LRRK2–microtubule association induced by type-I and type-II LRRK2 inhibitors, it is important to determine whether autoinhibited LRRK2 can bind to microtubules and, if it does, to understand the association structurally. In this study, we present cryo-ET structures of full-length LRRK2 bound to microtubules in the inactive, autoinhibited conformation. Additionally, we explored the effect of PD-linked mutations and type-I and type-II inhibitors in LRRK2 filament formation and structure on microtubules.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Architecture of microtubule-bound filaments of inactive LRRK2</title><p>To determine whether the autoinhibited form of LRRK2 can bind to and oligomerize on microtubules, we used cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) to image purified full-length LRRK2 (LRRK2<sup>WT</sup>) and one of its hyperactive PD-linked mutants (LRRK2<sup>I2020T</sup>) reconstituted with microtubules, either in the absence or presence of type-I (MLi-2) or type-II (GZD-824) LRRK2 inhibitors. We found that both WT and I2020T full-length LRRK2-decorated microtubules in the presence of either inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, C</xref>). As was the case with the truncated version of LRRK2 (LRRK2<sup>RCKW</sup>), co-polymerization of full-length LRRK2<sup>I2020T</sup> and microtubules also yielded LRRK2-decorated microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Snead et al., 2022</xref>) (see methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>To determine the structure of the oligomers formed by full-length inactive LRRK2 on microtubules, we collected cryo-ET tilt series on four samples: (1) LRRK2<sup>WT</sup> with GZD-824 on pre-formed microtubules; (2) LRRK2<sup>I2020T</sup> with MLi-2 on pre-formed microtubules; (3) LRRK2<sup>I2020T</sup> with MLi-2 co-polymerized with microtubules; and (4) LRRK2<sup>WT</sup> with MLi-2 on pre-formed microtubules. Reconstructed tomograms from all samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, C</xref>) showed that all combinations resulted in a similar overall architecture for the microtubule-bound LRRK2, and MLi-2 does not lead to an active conformation with FL-LRRK2 as observed from in-solution LRRK2 structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sanz Murillo et al., 2023</xref>). To corroborate the conformations and interactions of these filaments, we performed subtomogram analysis and obtained subnanometer-resolution structures for all four conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> and Methods). From dataset (2) (LRRK2<sup>I2020T</sup> with MLi-2 on pre-formed microtubules), we performed focused refinement from the map including both the microtubule and LRRK2 and obtained a 7.8-Å map of LRRK2 only, which showed the highest LRRK2 resolution after subtomogram analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Microtubule-focused 3D classification showed the existence of microtubules with different protofilament numbers in the sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>), from which we obtained a 5.9-Å 13-protofilament microtubule map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F, H–I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A–C</xref>), that we used to build a composite map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Both of the focused maps were docked into the microtubule–LRRK2 map to show the entire assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–G</xref>).</p><p>The cryo-ET maps we obtained showed distinct features compared to the in situ microtubule-bound LRRK2 map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Watanabe et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, we set out to build a molecular model of microtubule-bound full-length LRRK2 filaments using the aforementioned maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Our model of full-length LRRK2 on microtubules is similar to the published cryo-EM models of in-solution, autoinhibited full-length LRRK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Myasnikov et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhu et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sanz Murillo et al., 2023</xref>), with the LRR domain blocking the kinase’s active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As was the case with the structures of in-solution LRRK2, the ARM domain is flexible in our map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sanz Murillo et al., 2023</xref>). While the resolution of our maps is not sufficient to resolve side chains or determine whether inhibitors are bound, we compared the region of the map corresponding to the kinase domain to the recent structures of in-solution LRRK2 bound to either MLi-2 or GZD-824 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhu et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sanz Murillo et al., 2023</xref>). In agreement with those structures and the proposal that the N-terminal repeats constrain conformational changes in LRRK2, the kinase in our full-length LRRK2 adopted an inactive, open conformation in the presence of the type-I inhibitor MLi-2. In the published high-resolution structures of in-solution LRRK2, the ‘DYG’ motif and G-loop show different conformations in the presence of type-I or type-II inhibitors. We observed similar conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), suggesting that full-length LRRK2, whether LRRK2<sup>WT</sup> or LRRK2<sup>I2020T</sup>, bound to microtubules is in its autoinhibited state in our reconstituted system.

The fact that none of the interactions bury large surfaces, and that we could only resolve the additional density, which has lower local resolution, after focused classification, suggests that the ARM/ANK domains of autoinhibited LRRK2 are still flexible in the oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D–F</xref>).

We selected WD40:WD40 LRRK2 dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A, B</xref>) as the species to carry out this analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>) because we used the same species to analyze the WD40:ARM/ANK interface. This revealed that the helical angle between the previously reported microtubule-bound filaments of active-like LRRK2 or LRRK2RCKW and our filaments of autoinhibited LRRK2 is different. The distribution of these angles in our samples peaked at around 90° (<italic>θ</italic> angle, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), leading to ring-like structures around the microtubule, in contrast to the right-handed helices with helical angles around 33° observed with the active-like forms of LRRK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Snead et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Watanabe et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, our analysis of the distribution of LRRK2 subtomograms showed that the LRRK2 oligomers do not form continuous filaments wrapping around microtubules. Instead, the most frequently observed species were individual dimers and short oligomers consisting of two to six LRRK2 dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Since the COR:COR LRRK2 dimer is the dominant species in solution while we chose the WD40:WD40 dimer as the reference to search the LRRK2 subtomograms, it is worth noting that one copy of an LRRK2 monomer may be missed at the edge of the LRRK2 groups, or that only one copy of an LRRK2 monomer from the picked WD40:WD40 dimer on the edge contributed to the refinement. Both cases may happen within a single LRRK2 subtomogram that does not belong to a multi-subtomogram group, thus resulting in individual LRRK2 monomers or part of a COR:COR dimer. The results were consistent across all datasets, regardless of the LRRK2 variant used, the type of inhibitor added, or the protocol used to generate the microtubule-bound filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Notably, this is in contrast to the highly ordered long-range filaments observed in the LRRK2<sup>RCKW</sup>–microtubule data.

However, none of them covered more than half a turn around the microtubule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>), and this difference does not increase the coverage of LRRK2 decorations on microtubules in our sample, as shown by the LRRK2 coverage analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Autoinhibited-LRRK2 forms short, sparse oligomers perpendicular to the microtubule axis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Tomographic slices 4.6 nm in thickness showing LRRK2-decorated microtubules.

This assembly shares features with the previously reported structures of active-like LRRK2 bound to microtubules, but also shows different helical parameters and entails a new interface involving the N-terminal repeats, which, in contrast to the filaments formed by active-like LRRK2, are ordered in this structure. Our previously published active-like LRRK2 structures of in situ (LRRK2) and in vitro reconstituted (LRRK2<sup>RCKW</sup>) microtubule-bound filaments formed right-handed helices with the same interfaces and helical parameters. In the in situ structure, the N-terminal repeats were flexible and not visible in the subtomogram averages. The kinase domain adopted a closed, active-like conformation in both of those structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Snead et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Watanabe et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, our in vitro reconstituted microtubule-bound filaments of autoinhibited LRRK2 revealed a stabilized N-terminal half (ARM/ANK/LRR domains) covering the kinase’s active site. The kinase domain in our structure was in the open, inactive conformation, as expected from the autoinhibited state of LRRK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Myasnikov et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhu et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sanz Murillo et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhu et al., 2023</xref>). Our data showed that LRRK2 is capable of binding to microtubules in its autoinhibited state, although it appears to do so without forming the long, continuous filaments observed with its active form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Notably, we previously demonstrated that active‐like LRRK2, when bound to a type-I inhibitor, can form roadblocks that impair vesicular transport. Since autoinhibited LRRK2 assembles into shorter, less stable oligomers on microtubules, we anticipate it will exert reduced road‐blocking effects in cells, regardless of the inhibitor bound.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Summary of the comparison between the autoinhibited-LRRK2 state and the active-like LRRK2 state on microtubules.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Autoinhibited-LRRK2 filaments observed from this study.

Our findings revealed that different LRRK2 kinase inhibitors bind to autoinhibited LRRK2 similarly either in solution or on microtubules. Furthermore, the observation of autoinhibited-LRRK2 forming short, less stable oligomers on microtubules opens new possibilities to inhibit LRRK2 activity in PD patients. A type-I inhibitor specifically targeting autoinhibited LRRK2 may alleviate the effect of LRRK2 roadblocks on microtubules. Alternatively, a promising strategy of LRRK2 inhibitor design can focus on the stabilization of allosteric N-terminus blocking on the kinase domain, which favors the formation of autoinhibited-LRRK2 oligomers on microtubules and causes fewer side effects.</p><p>The new WD40:ARM/ANK interface we identified near the WD40:WD40 pseudo-twofold axis showcased again the capability of LRRK2 to form different types of oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Myasnikov et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Watanabe et al., 2020</xref>), and further addressed the importance of the scaffolding function of the LRRK2 WD40 domain. The biological role of this interface and whether PD-related LRRK2 mutations affect the WD40:ARM/ANK interaction remains to be determined. Genetic analysis of PD patients revealed two missense mutations, K544E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Xiromerisiou et al., 2007</xref>) and N551K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Di Fonzo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hui et al., 2018</xref>), located on the same α-helix near one of the interfaces on the N-terminal repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1I</xref>). N551K was reported to confer protection to both PD and Crohn’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hui et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kalogeropulou et al., 2022</xref>), and an overexpression study showed a mild but statistically significant negative impact of N551K on MLi-2-induced association between LRRK2 and microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kalogeropulou et al., 2022</xref>). Our data suggests a need to understand if and how LRRK2 interacts with microtubules under physiological conditions, and further, whether LRRK2 is able to alternate its oligomerization states on microtubules in the cell, a possibility raised by this and our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Snead et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Watanabe et al., 2020</xref>) which show that LRRK2 can interact with microtubules in more than one conformation. LRRK2 plays multiple roles in the endolysosomal system, such as phosphorylation of Rab-GTPases and homeostasis maintenance when lysosomes are stressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Steger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bonet-Ponce et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eguchi et al., 2018</xref>). LRRK2 has also been shown to bind and reshape a negatively charged tubular membrane template in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). Our findings further demonstrate the ability of LRRK2 to oligomerize on microtubules in both active-like and inactive conformations. Given the geometric and electrostatic similarities between microtubules and tubular membrane structures, we speculate that this may also occur on membranes where LRRK2 performs its physiological functions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

Specifically, motion correction, CTF estimation, and gain correction were performed in Warp and then all tilt series were aligned in eTomo in IMOD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mastronarde and Held, 2017</xref>) (v4.11.25, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/">https://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/</ext-link>, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:SCR_003297">SCR_003297</ext-link>) using patch tracking. To ensure better alignment on true features rather than the carbon substrate and empty space, tilt series were manually examined to preserve patches only in regions containing microtubules. The residual error mean (in nm) calculated from eTomo was used to assess the alignment quality for different tilt series. Tomograms with &lt;2 nm residual error mean are eligible for future analysis. Next, the eTomo alignment data was fed back to Warp for tomogram reconstruction using weighted back-projection at 10 Å/pxl. Tomogram visualization and microtubule tracing were performed on deconvoluted tomograms generated from Warp with default settings.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Microtubule tracing, LRRK2 particle picking, and ab initio model building in Dynamo</title><p>IMOD was used to visualize all reconstructed tomograms and manually trace the backbone of microtubules. Only microtubules with LRRK2 decoration and without extensive overlapping were selected for further analysis. The coordinates of selected microtubules were analyzed in Dynamo in MATLAB (v11509, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.dynamo-em.org/w/index.php?title=Main_Page">https://www.dynamo-em.org/w/index.php?title=Main_Page</ext-link>, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:SCR_025592">SCR_025592</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Castaño-Díez et al., 2017</xref>) and re-sampled equidistantly for particle extraction from the reconstructed tomogram. The azimuth angle around the microtubule of the picked subtomograms was randomized to minimize the effect of the missing wedge as performed in our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Watanabe et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Croxford et al., 2021</xref>). Next, the picked subtomograms were aligned with a featureless tubular reference generated from the class average of microtubule particle stack without alignment, with local parameters limiting the first two Euler angles and movements along the microtubule. Duplicate subtomograms were then removed based on distance, and coordinates were smoothed again to be equidistantly distributed for LRRK2 particle picking in the next step. The box size of subtomograms was 48 nm in this step.</p><p>To pick LRRK2 subtomograms in Dynamo, coordinates of microtubules were used as reference points to pick subtomograms in rings orthogonal to the path, pointing outwards. LRRK2 subtomograms were over-picked, with a radius of 23 nm to the center, particle separation of 7 nm between ring layers, and 18 subunits per ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). With this set of parameters, both LRRK2 and about half of the microtubule filaments are included with a particle box size of 36 nm. Next, subtomograms from a microtubule with relatively full LRRK2 decoration were manually chosen to build the initial model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), with subtomograms aligned in Dynamo for 10 iterations without any initial reference. This low-resolution initial model was used for all subtomogram analysis in this study. All LRRK2 subtomograms were then aligned to the reference for only one iteration in Dynamo, and both duplicate subtomograms as well as subtomograms having lower than 0.32 cross-correlation value against the reference were removed. Meanwhile, the average density from each microtubule was manually examined using IMOD to check the skewing direction of tubulin filaments from <italic>z</italic>-direction. The orientation of traced microtubules was random, so subtomograms with opposite skewing directions were flipped in Dynamo to align microtubules better. Meanwhile, the refined particle stack was centered to the WD40:WD40 interaction surface of LRRK2 oligomer for better alignment. The selected subtomograms were then subjected to four iterations of rough and local refinement in Dynamo, resulting in relatively regular but scarcely distributed oligomers around the microtubule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The coordinates were then used for further subtomogram analysis in Relion3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zivanov et al., 2018</xref>) and Relion4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zivanov et al., 2022</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/relion">http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/relion</ext-link>, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:SCR_016274">SCR_016274</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Subtomogram analysis and three-dimensional model reconstruction</title><p>For the 3D reconstruction of the LRRK2<sup>I2020T</sup>–MT complex, 65,612 subtomograms were supplied to Relion3 after Warp particle extraction. The subtomograms were binned by 2 at this stage (4.322 Å/pxl). Subtomograms were refined in Relion3 with C1 symmetry first, and the middle row of the LRRK2 oligomer was masked to perform focused refinement. To further improve resolution, coordinates of refined subtomograms were used to extract subtomograms in Relion4, then Tomo-frame alignment and CTF refinement were applied to optimize the tilt alignment for each tomogram. Satisfyingly, the map resolution improved, reaching the Nyquist limit after these refinement steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Next, focused refinement was applied to the middle 2 copies of LRRK2 followed by a 10-class 3D classification without any alignment. To avoid overfitting, the regularization parameter T was set to 1 instead of default 4, and the resolution E-step was set to 20 Å to disable alignment of high-frequency signals. Class averages containing at least one good-looking LRRK2 were all chosen for further alignment, subjected to a C2 refinement. Next, one copy of LRRK2 was masked for further refinement, and the stack was symmetry expanded by twofold so that all LRRK2 copies can be included for alignment. A 3D classification with the same set of parameters was applied, resulting in two good classes containing 60,556 LRRK2 subtomograms. The refined stack was unbinned (2.161 Å/pxl) and refined to 8.0 Å, then further improved to 7.8 Å with another round of Tomo-frame alignment, with motions of each subtomograms estimated as well. All reported resolutions correspond to the gold-standard Fourier Shell Correlation using the 0.143 criterion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Scheres, 2012</xref>). A similar pipeline was applied to another dataset of LRRK2I2020T with MLi-2 on microtubules, with microtubules and LRRK2 co-polymerized with MLi-2 (83,007 subtomograms). However, since the reconstruction shows stripe-like artifacts after initial refinement in Relion3, possibly coming from missing wedges, initial steps of pseudo-tomogram reconstruction in Relion4 were performed with down-weighting particle signals in a 10° cone in Fourier space along the <italic>z</italic> axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The particle stacks were resumed to normal after CTF refinement. 45,155 subtomograms from 3D classification finally give an 8.3 Å map, and when combined with the previous stack, the final map resolution was improved slightly to 7.7 Å. The map from the C2 refinement of co-polymerized LRRK2<sup>I2020T</sup> + MLi-2 + microtubule dataset, called microtubule–LRRK2 full map, was used to make the composed model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>The further optimized pipeline was applied to other datasets – LRRK2 with MLi-2 on microtubules (45,052 subtomograms) and LRRK2 with GZD on microtubules (70,363 subtomograms). First, the Relion3 initial alignment steps were skipped, and dynamo stacks were directly used to extract bin-2 subtomograms in Relion4. After that, subtomograms were refined with a full mask covering microtubules and the middle row of LRRK2 oligomers, then subjected to the same pipeline of Tomo-frame alignment, CTF refinement, focused refinement, and 3D classification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>). In the end, 42,687 subtomograms from the LRRK2 + MLi-2+microtubule dataset resulted in an 8.3 Å map and 53,214 subtomograms from the LRRK2 + GZD-824 + microtubule dataset resulted in an 8.1-Å map.</p><p>Subtomograms from the stepwise polymerization dataset were used to generate the microtubule map containing 13 protofilaments for the composed model. Since C2 refinement on LRRK2 oligomers may flip the <italic>y</italic>-orientation of LRRK2 subtomograms, a C1 refinement focusing on only one copy of LRRK2 was performed, then followed by a 3D classification to remove bad LRRK2 subtomograms. Next, coordinates of 41,853 subtomograms were processed in Dynamo and geometrically re-centered to focus on the bound microtubule. The <italic>z</italic>-direction of each particle was rotated as well, from being perpendicular to becoming parallel to the microtubule. This way, only microtubules decorated by at least one good copy of LRRK2 can be picked. Next, microtubule subtomograms were extracted in 10 Å/pxl and box size of 72 nm in Dynamo and briefly aligned against a 13-pf microtubule initial model for 1 iteration. The aligned stack was then subjected to a 1-iteration multi-reference alignment in Dynamo using 11–16 protofilament microtubules as reference models. Finally, 6,487 subtomograms fall into the class of 13-pf microtubule, and this sub-stack was subjected back to Relion4 to extract bin-2 microtubule subtomograms with box size of 176 pixels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Using a feature-less tube as initial reference, Relion4 helical refinement (with tube diameter 300 Å, twist –27.7°, rise 9.4 Å, central <italic>z</italic>-length 30%, all parameters are optimal for a 13-protofilament microtubule) gives an 8.644-Å map, which is the Nyquist limit of the data. Unbinned subtomograms were then further refined with the same set of parameters, resulting in a 5.9-Å microtubule map.</p><p>The same dataset was used to refine the novel WD40:ARM/ANK interaction surface. After getting the 7.8 Å LRRK2 map, a partial soft mask focusing on the ARM/ANK domain and the WD40 domain it interacts with (from the other copy of LRRK2) was applied to the LRRK2 map, and the subtomograms were re-centered, binned by 2, and re-extracted in Relion4 to perform a focused refinement, which resulted in an 8.9-Å focused map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Similar to the previous pipeline, a 3-class 3D classification was performed, resulting in one class showing extended density corresponding to the N-terminal region of LRRK2. Such region remained flexible and was not resolved in the LRRK2 map. 28,128 subtomograms from this class were then selected for focused refinement, and the unbinned stack resulted in an 8.6-Å map of the focused region, suitable for further model building.</p><p>UCSF ChimeraX (v1.7, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimerax/">https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimerax/</ext-link>, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:SCR_015872">SCR_015872</ext-link>) was used for all the volume segmentation, figure and movie generation, and automatic rigid-body docking processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Pettersen et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Model building</title><p>Published models of LRRK2 were used as references to build the LRRK2 model on microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Myasnikov et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sanz Murillo et al., 2023</xref>). ChimeraX was first used to rigidly fit each domain of the in-solution full-length LRRK2 model into the map, then the interactive molecular-dynamics flexible fitting software (v1.7, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://tristanic.github.io/isolde/">https://tristanic.github.io/isolde/</ext-link>, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:SCR_025577">SCR_025577</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Croll, 2018</xref>) was used to examine each connecting loop between domains and resolve the clashing and obvious wrong fitting with torsion and distances restrained. An MLi-2 molecule was placed in the model based on the alignment between our model and our in-solution high-resolution LRRK2<sup>I2020T</sup>–MLi-2 model published recently. Using the map focused on the WD40:ARM/ANK interface, we fitted the alphafold2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>) prediction model of the N-terminal region of LRRK2 that is missing in the previous structures as a starting model. ISOLDE was then used with restraints to resolve clashes at the connection between our LRRK2 model and the alphafold2 model, as well as moving a helix that was obviously outside the density in the initial model.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Geometric analysis of LRRK2 subtomograms on microtubules</title><p>For the stepwise polymerization dataset (dataset (1)), LRRK2 subtomograms included in the final map were used, but the coordinates of each subtomogram were extracted from the previous C2 refinement job in the Relion pipeline because they correspond to a WD40:WD40 dimer of LRRK2. The coordinates were re-formatted to be analyzed in Dynamo with a pixel size of 10 Å/pxl. Similar to the pipeline of microtubule map generation, the particle stack was sub-boxed to center on microtubules and each LRRK2 subtomogram has a corresponding microtubule subtomogram. The microtubule subtomograms were briefly aligned against a tubular reference so that subtomograms track the microtubule direction. Next, the distances and orientations of all LRRK2 subtomogram pairs were calculated and plotted. There are two most frequently observed LRRK2 pairs on microtubules, one relatively parallel to the microtubule and the other relatively perpendicular to it. Since the composed LRRK2–microtubule indicates that LRRK2 oligomers are growing roughly perpendicular to the microtubule, only this type of subtomogram pairs was picked for further analysis. Distances between all selected pairs were first plotted to make sure LRRK2 was not over- or under-picked, then selected pairs containing overlapping subtomograms were grouped into chains, and the number of LRRK2 dimer chains containing a certain number of LRRK2 dimers was counted and plotted. For each selected pair, the helical angle (<italic>θ</italic> angle) between the LRRK2 pair and the <italic>z</italic>-direction of its corresponding microtubule particle was calculated in Dynamo and plotted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Note that the <italic>y</italic>-orientation of LRRK2 subtomograms can be either the same as, or opposite to the microtubule growth direction, so the angles range from 0° to 180°. Next, the number of LRRK2 subtomograms obtained from each microtubule was counted and plotted, and the dynamo microtubule tracing coordinates obtained from the previously described pipeline were used to calculate the length of each picked microtubule. Such information was used to calculate and plot the number of LRRK2 subtomograms obtained along a fixed length (1 nm) of microtubules. All three other datasets were analyzed in a similar way.</p><p>The detailed protocol describing all of the data analysis steps from tomogram reconstruction to subtomogram geometric analysis is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.protocols.io/view/tomogram-reconstruction-and-sub-tomogram-averaging-n92ld89zxv5b/v2">https://www.protocols.io/view/tomogram-reconstruction-and-sub-tomogram-averaging-n92ld89zxv5b/v2</ext-link>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) data collection and model statistics.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-100799-supp1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-100799-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Command-line based Dynamo functions are used in matlab environment, and the step-by-step instructions were described in the correponding protocols.

The structures of the inactive LRRK2 complexed to microtubules are of medium resolution and do not allow visualisation of side chains.</p><p>This study is extremely well-written and the figures are incredibly clear and well-presented. The finding that LRRK2 in the inactive autoinhibited form can be associated with microtubules is an important observation that merits further investigation. This new observation makes an important contribution to the literature and builds upon the pioneering research that this team of researchers has contributed to the LRRK2 fields. However, in my opinion, there is still significant work that could be considered to further investigate this question and understand the physiological significance of this observation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the positive comments and we agree that more work can be done next to understand the physiological significance of the autoinhibited LRRK2 in cellular environments. We are actively working on understanding how the stability of autoinhibited full-length LRRK2 is regulated, especially how the transfer between autoinhibited and active forms of LRRK2 can happen. Our in situ data (Watabane et al. 2020) indicates that overexpressed hyperactive PD-mutant LRRK2 mainly adopts its active-like conformation in cells.

Mutations in this protein have been shown to be linked to Parkinson's Disease. It is already shown that the active-like conformation of LRRK2 binds to the MT lattice, but this investigation shows that full-length LRRk2 can oligomerize on MTs in its autoinhibited state with different helical parameters than were observed with the active-like state. The structural studies suggest that the autoinhibited state is less stable on MTs.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The protein of interest is very important biomedically and a novel conformational binding to microtubules in the proposed.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The structures are all low resolution.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comments on both the strengths and weaknesses of the manuscript. We agree with the reviewer that higher resolution would provide more information about how LRRK2 interacts with microtubules and oligomerizes in its autoinhibited form. However, with the current resolution, our model-building benefited significantly from the published high-resolution models and the alpha-fold predictions. We used cryo-ET and subtomogram analysis to solve the structure because this filament is less regular than the right-handed active LRRK2 filament, preventing us from using conventional single-particle analysis. As highlighted by reviewer 1, being able to push the resolution to sub-nanometer is an important advance reflecting state-of-the-art subtomogram analysis, especially for a heterogeneous sample. Notably, the microtubule reconstruction reached higher resolution, comparable to our previous single-particle studies on LRRK2-RCKW (Snead and Matyszewski et al.), confirming the data quality.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) There are no measurements of the affinity of the various LRRK2 molecules (with and without inhibitors) to microtubules.

We attempted to purify the LRRK2 with mutants on the WD40:ARM/ANK interface we identified in the manuscript..

The updated figure and legend have incorporated the changes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In Figure S7B, the conformation changes of the 'G-loop' and the 'DYG' motifs are not so convincing at the current resolution.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing it out. We agree that our model resolution is not high enough to support the unbiased observation of the conformation changes of the key kinase motifs. In the revised manuscript, we avoided emphasizing the comparison between the two models. Instead, we state that for both the MLi-2 bound map and the GZD-824 bound map, the corresponding published high-resolution models fit into each kinase map, but the MLi-2 bound model doesn’t fit as well in the GZD-824 bound map, with a correlation value dropped from 0.44 to 0.4, supporting our statement that “full-length LRRK2 bound to microtubules is in its autoinhibited state in our reconstituted system”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Are there any cellular experiments that could be done to demonstrate that inactive LRRK2 associates with microtubules in cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this direction for future studies. We are studying the physiological significance of the autoinhibited LRRK2 in cells, but haven’t yet been successful at demonstrating physiological binding to microtubules. Further, as noted in our response to reviewer #3, we are also actively working on understanding how the stability of autoinhibited full-length LRRK2 is regulated, especially how the transfer between autoinhibited and active forms of LRRK2 can happen. Our in situ data (Watabane et al. 2020) indicates that hyperactive PD-mutant overexpressed LRRK2 mainly adopts its active-like conformation in cells. Thus, learning how the state transfer occurs will allow us to target autoinhibited LRRK2 specifically and efficiently in cells and study its structure and function in physiological conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Previous work that the authors and others have undertaken has suggested that only LRRK2 in its active conformation can associate with microtubule filaments and the authors have shown that this leads to a roadblock in vesicular transport only when LRRK2 is complexed with Type 1 but not Type 2 inhibitors. There seems to be some discrepancy here that is not addressed in the paper as based on the current results one would also expect LRRK2 bound to Type 2 inhibitors to induce roadblocks in microtubule filaments. How can this be explained?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important question. Taking all of our published data together, we believe that LRRK2 can introduce roadblocks with Type 1 inhibitor bound in the active-like conformation, where N-terminus LRRK2 domains are flexible and don’t block the kinase active site. In other words, full-length LRRK2 can form roadblocks when it behaves more like the truncated LRRK2<sup>RCKW</sup> variant. The autoinhibited LRRK2 forms shorter and less stable oligomers on microtubules, making it harder to block transport. Consistent with this, our in situ LRRK2-microtubule structure was observed in cells where LRRK2 is in an active-like conformation, and the LRRK2 N-terminus appeared to be flexible and away from the microtubule when forming right-handed filaments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Does the finding that inactive LRRK2 only binds to microtubules as a short filament, explain the differences between the inactive and active forms of LRRK2 binding to microtubules and causing roadblocks?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for discussing this point with us and asking the question. As we replied in the previous comment, the reviewer’s conclusion explains how the roadblock phenomenon occurs only under certain circumstances. We expanded our discussion to add the following and address the question:</p><p>“Notably, we previously demonstrated that active‐like LRRK2, when bound to a Type I inhibitor, can form roadblocks that impair vesicular transport. Since autoinhibited LRRK2 assembles into shorter, less stable oligomers on microtubules, we anticipate it will exert reduced road‐blocking effects in cells, regardless of the inhibitor bound.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Could the authors undertake further characterization of the new WD40-ARM-ANK interphase that they have identified? Is this important for the binding of the autoinhibited mutant? Could mutants be made in this interphase to see if this prevents the autoinhibited but not the active conformation of LRRK2 binding to microtubules?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. As mentioned in our response to Reviewer #2, public comment #2, we attempted to purify the LRRK2 with mutants on the WD40:ARM/ANK interface we identified in the manuscript multiple times. Unfortunately, either LRRK2 or LRRK2<sup>I2020T</sup> with N-terminal mutants (R521A/F573A/E854K), the yield and purity of the final samples are significantly worse than our routine LRRK2 prep. Our chromatography and gel electrophoresis results indicate that proteins are degrading during purification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The authors identify several disease-relevant missense mutations that appear to lie within the novel interphase that the authors have characterised in this study. Although this is discussed in the Discussion, some experimental data demonstrating how these missense mutations impact the ability of inactive LRRK2 to bind to microtubule filaments in the presence or absence of Type 1 and Type 2 compounds could provide further experimental data that emphasises the physiological importance of the results presented in this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for discussing this interesting direction. The disease-relevant missense mutations can have a direct or indirect impact on the binding of autoinhibited LRRK2 to microtubules, and we agree that it would be interesting to test it out in the future. However, we anticipate that significant effort would be required for further experiments. Alas, our funding for this project ended suddenly and we want to report our results to the community.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) For the data that is shown in Figure 1, could the authors explain how this differs from results in previous papers of the authors showing that the active form of LRRK2 binds microtubules? How does the binding observed here differ from that observed in the previous studies? To a non-specialist reader, the data looks fairly like what has previously been reported.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for asking the question. As mentioned in the response to the public review, the detailed comparison between the data and the previous papers is described in Figure 3, and we agree that it is helpful to incorporate this information in Figure 1. In the revised manuscript, we have incorporated the comparison panel in Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) The finding that the autoinhibited LRRK2 forms short and sparse oligomers on microtubules raises the question of how physiological this observation is. Having some data that suggests that this is physiologically relevant would boost the impact of this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer on this comment. As discussed in the response to the first comment from the reviewer, we have not been able to assess the physiological relevance of LRRK2 binding to microtubules in either active or inactive state, but continue to pursue this line of research. We are aware and regret that this lessens the impact of this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) For the more general reader the authors could potentially better highlight why the key finding in this paper is important.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. To further address the significance of the key findings, especially how it can open up more possibilities for inhibitor-based drug development, we expand our discussion section to include the following:</p><p>“Understanding how Type I and Type II inhibitors’ binding to LRRK2 affects its mechanism is vital to the design of inhibitor-based PD drug development strategies. Our findings revealed that different LRRK2 kinase inhibitors bind to autoinhibited LRRK2 similarly either in solution or on microtubules. Furthermore, the observation of autoinhibited LRRK2 forming short, less stable oligomers on microtubules opens new possibilities to inhibit LRRK2 activity in PD patients. A Type I inhibitor specifically targeting autoinhibited LRRK2 may alleviate the effect of LRRK2 roadblocks on microtubules. Alternatively, a promising strategy of LRRK2 inhibitor design can focus on the stabilization of allosteric N-terminus blocking on the kinase domain, which favors the formation of autoinhibited LRRK2 oligomers on microtubules and causes fewer side effects.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>In the third paragraph of the introduction, expand on whether type-1 inhibitors which &quot;capture kinases in a closed, &quot;active-like&quot; conformation still inhibit the kinase activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the request to expand this paragraph. We added the following explanation for better understanding in the third paragraph:</p><p>“Type-I inhibitors bind to the ATP binding site and target the kinase in its ‘active-like' conformation, inhibiting its kinase activity.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
