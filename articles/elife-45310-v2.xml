The apocarotenoid acted in parallel to the repressor of photomorphogenesis, DEETIOLATED1 (DET1), to transcriptionally regulate PROTOCHLOROPHYLLIDE OXIDOREDUCTASE (POR), PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR3 (PIF3) and ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5).

In addition to providing plant flowers, fruits and seeds with distinct colours, carotenoids have accessory roles in facilitating the assembly of the light harvesting complex, light capture during photosynthesis and photoprotection during high light and/or temperature stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Nisar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Baranski and Cazzonelli, 2016</xref>).

Next, phytoene desaturase (PDS), ζ-carotene desaturases (ZDS), ζ-carotene isomerase (ZISO) and <italic>cis-trans</italic>-carotene isomerase (CRTISO) convert the colourless phytoene into the pinkish-red coloured all-<italic>trans</italic>-lycopene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bartley et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Isaacson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Park et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Dong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Yu et al., 2011</xref>). In the dark, the isomerisation of tri-<italic>cis</italic>-ζ-carotene to di-<italic>cis</italic>-ζ-carotene and tetra-<italic>cis</italic>-lycopene to all-<italic>trans</italic>-lycopene has a strict requirement for ZISO and CRTISO activity respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Park et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chen et al., 2010</xref>). However, light-mediated photoisomerisation in the presence of a photosensitiser can substitute for a lack of isomerase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Giuliano et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Vijayalakshmi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alagoz et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The carotenoid biosynthetic pathway branches after lycopene to produce α/β-carotenes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cunningham et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Cunningham et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Pecker et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Ronen et al., 1999</xref>). α-carotene and β-carotene are further hydroxylated to produce the oxygenated carotenoids called xanthophylls (e.g. lutein, violaxanthin and zeaxanthin), which comprise the most abundant carotenoids found in photosynthetic leaves. Carotenoids are precursors for apocarotenoids (carotenoid cleavage products) such as phytohormones abscisic acid (ABA) and strigolactone (SL) as well as other apocarotenoids that function in root-mycorrhizal interactions, leaf development, acclimation to environmental stress and retrograde signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Havaux, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Walter et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hou et al., 2016</xref>). The carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase and nine-<italic>cis</italic>-epoxy-carotenoid dioxygenase (CCD/NCED) family cleave carotenoids to yield apocarotenoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hou et al., 2016</xref>). The CCDs have substrate preferences depending on the tissue and nature of the assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Walter and Strack, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Harrison and Bugg, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bruno et al., 2016</xref>). The five members of the NCED sub-group are exclusively involved in cleavage of violaxanthin and neoxanthin to form ABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Finkelstein, 2013</xref>). The four CCDs have well defined roles in carotenoid degradation in seeds (CCD1 and CCD4) and the synthesis of strigolactones (CCD7/MAX3 and CCD8/MAX4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Auldridge et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gonzalez-Jorge et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ilg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Babili and Bouwmeester, 2015</xref>). Non-enzymatic oxidative cleavage of carotenoids can also generate apocarotenoids by singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>)-mediated photo-oxidation or by lipoxygenase and peroxidase-mediated co-oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Leenhardt et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">González-Pérez et al., 2011</xref>). Non-enzymatic carotenoid degradation acts preferentially on selective molecules such as β-carotene and its apocarotenoid derivatives.</p><p><italic>cis</italic>-carotenes such as phytoene, phytofluene and tetra-<italic>cis</italic>-lycopene are reported to be resistant to non-enzymatic degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Schaub et al., 2018</xref>), although there are some reports that CCDs cleave specific <italic>cis</italic>-carotenes in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bruno et al., 2016</xref>). Whether there is a physiological relevance for a <italic>cis</italic>-carotene derived cleavage product or apocarotenoid signal (ACS) in vivo, remains unclear. A hunt is on to identify a <italic>cis</italic>-carotene cleavage product that functions as a retrograde signal to fine-tune nuclear gene expression during development or in response to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kachanovsky et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Fantini et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Avendaño-Vázquez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Álvarez et al., 2016</xref>). CCD4 was implicated in the generation of a <italic>cis</italic>-carotene-derived apocarotenoid signal that regulates leaf shape, chloroplast and nuclear gene expression in the Arabidopsis <italic>clb5/zds</italic> (chloroplast biogenesis-5 / ζ-carotene desaturase) mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Avendaño-Vázquez et al., 2014</xref>). A metabolon regulatory loop around all-<italic>trans</italic>-ζ-carotene was proposed in tomato fruit that can sense <italic>cis</italic>-carotene accumulation, their derivatives or the enzymes themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Fantini et al., 2013</xref>). The accumulation of <italic>cis</italic>-carotenes in tomato fruit have also been linked to the metabolic feedback-regulation of <italic>PSY</italic> transcription and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kachanovsky et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Álvarez et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, <italic>cis</italic>-carotenes themselves or their cleavage products appear to have functional roles, of which the targets and regulatory mechanism(s) remains unknown.</p><p>Determining a mechanistic function for <italic>cis</italic>-carotenes in planta has been challenged by low levels of <italic>cis</italic>-carotene accumulation in wild type tissues. When the upper carotenoid pathway is perturbed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alagoz et al., 2018</xref>), seedling lethality (<italic>psy</italic>, <italic>pds</italic> and <italic>zds</italic>), impaired chlorophyll and <italic>cis</italic>-carotene accumulation (<italic>ziso</italic> and <italic>crtiso</italic>) as well as a reduction in lutein (<italic>crtiso</italic>) become apparent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Isaacson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Park et al., 2002</xref>). <italic>ziso</italic> mutants in maize (<italic>y9</italic>) and Arabidopsis (<italic>zic</italic>) display transverse pale-green zebra-striping patterns and delayed cotyledon greening respectively, resembling impaired chloroplast development that causes a leaf virescence phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Janick-Buckner et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chen et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, <italic>crtiso</italic> loss-of-function in tomato (<italic>tangerine</italic>), melon (<italic>yofi</italic>) and rice (<italic>zebra</italic>) mutants show varying degrees of unexplained leaf virescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Isaacson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Park et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Galpaz et al., 2013</xref>), of which the cause triggering this phenomena could be attributed to light/dark cycles even though carotenoid composition remained unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Han et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>During skotomorphogenesis prolamellar bodies (PLB) develop in etioplasts of seedling tissues. The PLB is a crystalline agglomeration of protochlorophyllide (PChlide), POR enzyme and fragments of pro-thylakoid membranes. The PLB provides a structural framework for the light-catalysed conversion of PChlide into chlorophylls by POR within picoseconds in conjunction with the assembly of the photosynthetic apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Sundqvist and Dahlin, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Sytina et al., 2008</xref>). The de-etiolation of seedlings upon exposure to light activates a sophisticated network consisting of receptors, genetic and biochemical signals that trigger photomorphogenesis. Changes in light-induced morphogenesis include: short hypocotyls; expanded and photosynthetically-active cotyledons with developing chloroplasts; and activation of self-regulated stem cell populations at shoot apices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arsovski et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lau and Deng, 2012</xref>). DETIOLATED1 (DET1) and CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1) promote skotomorphogenesis, while <italic>det1</italic> and <italic>cop1</italic> mutants lack POR and cannot assemble a PLB. They broadly promote photomorphogenesis in the dark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Chory et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Sperling et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Datta et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This is a consequence of DET1 and COP1 post-transcriptionally controlling the levels of PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 3 (PIF3; constitutive transcriptional repressor of photomorphogenesis) and ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5; positive transcriptional regulator of photomorphogenesis) that control PORA and <italic>PHOTOSYNTHESIS ASSOCIATED NUCLEAR GENE</italic> (<italic>PhANG</italic>) expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Stephenson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lau and Deng, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Xu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Llorente et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, in the dark, wild-type plants accumulate PIF3, but lack HY5, conversely <italic>det1</italic> lacks PIF3 and accumulates HY5 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>PLB formation occurs in carotenoid deficient mutants. Norflurazon (NF) treated wheat seedlings grown in darkness lack carotenoids, other than phytoene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and yet still form a PLB that is somewhat aberrant in having a looser attachment of POR to the lipid phase and which dissociates early from the membranes during photomorphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Denev et al., 2005</xref>). In contrast, <italic>ccr2</italic> is similar to <italic>cop1</italic>/<italic>det1</italic> mutants in that it lacks a PLB in etioplasts, yet it is unique among PLB-deficient mutants in having normal PChlide and POR protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Park et al., 2002</xref>). The associated hyper accumulation of <italic>cis</italic>-carotenes led to the untested hypothesis that <italic>cis</italic>-carotenes structurally prevent PLB formation in etioplasts of dark germinated <italic>ccr2</italic> during skotomorphogenesis and this in turn delayed cotyledon greening following illumination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Park et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Datta et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Cuttriss et al., 2007</xref>). However, it was never apparent why other carotenes, such as 15-<italic>cis</italic>-phytoene and all-<italic>trans</italic>-lycopene, permitted PLB formation, and whether there were regulatory functions for the <italic>cis</italic>-carotenes themselves, or their cleavage products that accumulate in <italic>ccr2</italic>.</p><p>In this paper, we describe how changes in photoperiod are sufficient to perturb or permit plastid development in <italic>ccr2</italic>, the former leading to leaf virescence. A revertant screen of <italic>ccr2</italic> revealed new connections between a <italic>cis</italic>-carotene-derived signalling metabolite, PLB formation during skotomorphogenesis and chloroplast development following photomorphogenesis. We demonstrate how an unidentified apocarotenoid signal acted in parallel to DET1 to control PLB formation as well as <italic>POR</italic>, <italic>PIF3</italic> and <italic>HY5</italic> transcript levels, thereby fine-tuning plastid development in tissues exposed to extended periods of darkness.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A shorter photoperiod perturbs chloroplast biogenesis and promotes leaf virescence</title><p>The <italic>crtiso</italic> mutants have been reported to display different leaf pigmentation phenotypes in a species-independent manner, with rice and tomato showing yellow and green sectors resembling signs of virescence, but no such observations have been made in Arabidopsis.

As development progressed the yellow leaf (YL) phenotype became less obvious and greener leaves (GL) developed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Therefore, by reducing the photoperiod we were able to replicate the leaf virescence phenotype in Arabidopsis previous reported to occur in tomato and rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Isaacson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chai et al., 2011</xref>).

We replicated the YL phenotype by shifting three weeks old <italic>ccr2</italic> plants from a long 16 hr to shorter 8 hr photoperiod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). The newly emerged leaves of <italic>ccr2</italic> appeared yellow and virescent, while leaves that developed under a 16 hr photoperiod remained green similar to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Consistent with the phenotype, the yellow sectors of <italic>ccr2</italic> displayed a 2.4-fold reduction in total chlorophyll levels, while mature green leaf sectors formed prior to the photoperiod shift had chlorophyll levels similar to that of WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The chlorophyll <italic>a</italic>/<italic>b</italic> as well as carotenoid/chlorophyll ratios were not significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Consistent with the reduction in chlorophyll, total carotenoid content in yellow sectors of <italic>ccr2</italic> was reduced due to lower levels of lutein, β-carotene and neoxanthin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The percentage composition of zeaxanthin and antheraxanthin was significantly enhanced in yellow sectors, perhaps reflecting a greater demand for xanthophyll cycle pigments that reduce photo-oxidative damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that yellow <italic>ccr2</italic> leaf sectors contained poorly differentiated chloroplasts lacking membrane structures consisting of thylakoid and grana stacks, as well as appearing spherical in shape, rather than oval when compared to green leaf tissues from WT or <italic>ccr2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

Norflurazon, a carotenoid inhibitor of PDS activity and inducer of a retrograde signal(s) was able to induce 30–35% of DE genes in <italic>ccr2,</italic> which was not apparent in <italic>ccr2 ziso-155</italic> (12–14%). This finding was further corroborated by comparison with another published data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Page et al., 2017</xref>), where etiolated seedlings of <italic>ccr2</italic> and NF treated de-etiolated seedlings shared a 15–21% overlap in DE genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). In contrast, there was no clear overlap in DE genes associated with a brief period of white light following de-etiolation under far red light that induced generation of singlet oxygen, a retrograde signal that obviously regulates a different set of nuclear encoded genes to that of NF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Page et al., 2017</xref>).

However, none of the 20 contra-regulated genes were miss-regulated by a brief period of white light following de-etiolation under far red light, that was shown to be associated with the generation of a singlet oxygen related retrograde signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Page et al., 2017</xref>). The expression of <italic>DET1</italic> and <italic>COP1</italic> genes, encoding skotomorphogenesis-associated proteins, were up-regulated in <italic>ccr2</italic>, yet down-regulated in <italic>ccr2 ziso-155</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). This finding is consistent with the fact that DE genes miss-expressed in <italic>ccr2 ziso-155</italic> leaf tissues were enriched in chromatin modifying processes. <italic>det1.1</italic> mutants were shown to have reduced <italic>PIF3</italic> transcripts, and higher HY5 protein levels that activate downstream <italic>PhANG</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lau and Deng, 2012</xref>). A lower PIF3/HY5 ratio can be associated with <italic>PhANG</italic> expression. Indeed, our comparative analysis of contra-expressed genes in <italic>ccr2 ziso-155</italic> revealed the down-regulation of <italic>PIF3</italic>, up-regulation of <italic>HY5</italic> and <italic>PhANG</italic> expression (e.g. <italic>LHCB2; LIGHT-HARVESTING CHLOROPHYLL B-BINDING 2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). This would lead to a lower PIF3/HY5 ratio in <italic>ccr2 ziso-155</italic> when compared to WT. It is not unusual to observe miss-regulation of <italic>PhANG</italic> expression in mutants having impaired plastid development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ruckle et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Woodson et al., 2011</xref>). However, when we compared the 20 contra-regulated gene list with two different published data sets that reported miss-regulation of genes following NF treatment of de-etiolated seedlings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Koussevitzky et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Page et al., 2017</xref>), only three <italic>PhANGs</italic> (<italic>LHCB2.2</italic>, <italic>PSI-D</italic> and <italic>DXS</italic>) and <italic>GUN5</italic> were down-regulated in <italic>ccr2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Further comparison of the 20 contra-regulated genes with DE genes miss-regulated in the <italic>gun5</italic> mutant revealed no similarity. This highlights that <italic>ccr2</italic> regulates a unique set of genes not related to a NF generated or GUN5 mediated retrograde signal. In summary, the repression of negative regulators of photomorphogenesis, correlates well with the up-regulation of <italic>PhANG</italic> expression in <italic>ccr2 ziso-155</italic> and links

Lincomycin treatment, on the other hand can suppress PLB formation in etiolated seedlings and unlike norflurazon, affects the phenotype of <italic>pifq</italic> mutant (quadruple mutant of <italic>pif1 pif3 pif4 pif5</italic>) seedlings grown in the dark. GUN1-facilitated retrograde signalling antagonized <italic>PIF</italic>-regulated gene expression and attenuated de-etiolation phenotypes triggered by lincomycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Martín et al., 2016</xref>). Lincomycin can inhibit PLB formation in the <italic>pifq</italic> mutant, revealing that PIFs are not necessary for PLB formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Martín et al., 2016</xref>). Previous research showed that <italic>hy5</italic>, <italic>pif3</italic> and <italic>pifq</italic> dark grown seedlings contain etioplasts with PLBs, albeit in some cases reduced in size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Stephenson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Martín et al., 2016</xref>). GUN1-dependent and independent signalling pathways were proposed to act upstream of HY5 to repress photomorphogenesis of cotyledons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ruckle et al., 2007</xref>). Intriguingly, the <italic>ccr2</italic> generated <italic>cis</italic>-carotene derived cleavage product also regulated a distinct set of genes involved in a photomorphogenic-dependent pathway. The nature by which a <italic>cis</italic>-carotene derived cleavage product regulates PLB formation by transcriptionally enhancing <italic>PORA</italic> is quite distinct to that of GUN regulation of <italic>PhANG</italic> gene expression. Consequently, we deduce that the lack of a PLB in <italic>ccr2</italic> is neither a consequence of apocarotenoid regulation of PIF3 or HY5, nor a lack of POR. As an alternative hypothesis we propose that the apocarotenoid signal and DET1 regulate an unknown factor necessary for PLB formation that is independent of POR abundance and GUN activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>An apocarotenoid signal regulated <italic>PIF3</italic> and <italic>HY5</italic> transcript levels</title><p>Here we demonstrate that the <italic>ccr2</italic>-generated apocarotenoid acted in a retrograde manner to transcriptionally regulate <italic>POR</italic>, <italic>PIF3</italic> and <italic>HY5</italic> transcript levels in <italic>ccr2</italic> and <italic>ccr2 det1-154</italic> backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). Of particular interest is how the abundances of all three transcript and protein levels were reverted in <italic>ccr2 det1-154</italic> to expected levels for <italic>det1</italic> mutants by treatment with D15. Similarly, D15 reverted <italic>HY5</italic> and <italic>PIF3</italic> transcript and protein levels back to WT levels in <italic>ccr2</italic>. The contra-regulation of the PIF3/HY5 ratio by D15 treatment was further contrasted by an even lower PIF3/HY5 ratio (due to the up-regulation of <italic>HY5</italic> and reduction in <italic>PIF3</italic> transcript levels compared to WT) in the <italic>ccr2 ziso-155</italic> mutant etiolated seedlings and leaves collected from plants grown under a shorter photoperiod (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). While D15 has been shown to only impair substrate cleavage, the loss-of-function in ZISO can block substrate production in the dark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and limit biosynthesis of tri-<italic>cis</italic>-ζ-carotene and neurosporene in leaves from <italic>ccr2 ziso-155</italic> plants grown under a shorter photoperiod when photoisomerisation becomes rate-limited.

Under favourable conditions of light, when activity of ZISO, CRTISO as well as photoisomerisation are not limited, the absence of the <italic>cis</italic>-carotene derived cleavage product enables the lowering of the PIF3/HY5 ratio to maintain <italic>PhANG</italic> expression in concert with chloroplast development.

Here we linked a perturbation in <italic>cis</italic>-carotene accumulation in <italic>ccr2 ziso</italic>-155 juvenile leaves grown under a shorter photoperiod to an enriched gene ontology in chromatin and DNA modifying processes, in particularly the repression of <italic>DET1</italic> gene expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). DET1 was required for <italic>cis</italic>-carotene biosynthesis in wild type tissues, as <italic>det1</italic> mutants accumulate phytoene, phytofluene and tri-<italic>cis</italic>-ζ-carotene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). Similarly, the down-regulation and/or loss-of-function in <italic>det1</italic> in tomato lines revealed an accumulation of phytoene and phytofluene in ripe fruits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Enfissi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Talens et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, CRTISO and DET1 can control the accumulation of <italic>cis</italic>-carotenes and the apocarotenoid signal that regulates plastid development, a process that perhaps is fine-tuned with epigenetic and chromatin modifying processes that control light-mediated development.</p><p>Herein we revealed how <italic>ccr2</italic> and <italic>det1</italic> oppositely regulate the chlorophyll biosynthetic enzyme, POR at the transcriptional level during skotomorphogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). There are relatively few mutants published to date that do not produce a PLB in dark grown tissues and all, except <italic>ccr2,</italic> are due to reduced levels of <italic>PORA</italic> and/or PChlide. Arabidopsis mutants like <italic>det1-1</italic> and <italic>cop1</italic> mutants have less photoactive PChlide-F655 and higher total PChlide levels due to a reduction in POR that thereby blocks PLB formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Sperling et al., 1998</xref>). Like <italic>det1-1</italic>, <italic>det1-154</italic> exhibits all the same phenotypes and indeed D15 treatment of <italic>ccr2 det1-154</italic> blocked PLB formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Chory et al., 1989</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). While etioplasts in <italic>ccr2</italic> dark grown cotyledons do not make a PLB, the abundance of POR and PChlide levels are similar to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). Therefore, <italic>ccr2</italic> and <italic>det1</italic> control PLB formation via distinct, although perhaps mutually dependent signalling pathways, whereby the <italic>cis</italic>-carotene derived signal blocks the <italic>det1</italic>-mediated transcriptional repression of <italic>PORA</italic> gene expression. Can the <italic>ccr2</italic>-derived cleavage product directly regulate DET1? This is unlikely for several reasons. First, <italic>ccr2</italic> and <italic>ccr2 ziso-155</italic> displayed closed cotyledons, an apical hook and normal hypocotyl length revealing that the <italic>cis</italic>-carotene derived cleavage metabolite does not activate photomorphogenesis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Second, DET1 protein levels were relatively unchanged in WT, <italic>ccr2</italic>, <italic>det1-154</italic> and <italic>ccr2 det1-154</italic>, regardless of D15 chemical inhibition. Hence, the <italic>cis</italic>-carotene-derived apocarotenoid cleavage product can transcriptionally up-regulate POR levels in <italic>det1</italic>, thereby enabling PLB formation in etioplasts and chloroplast differentiation following de-etiolation.</p><p><italic>DET1</italic> encodes a nuclear protein acting downstream from the phytochrome photoreceptors to negatively regulate light-driven seedling development and promote skotomorphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Schroeder et al., 2002</xref>). DET1 interacts with COP1 and the chromatin regulator DDB1, to limit the access of transcription factors to promoters and negatively regulate the expression of hundreds of genes via chromatin interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Schroeder et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lau and Deng, 2012</xref>). Light stimulates photomorphogenesis and the rapid down-regulation of <italic>DET1</italic> leading to a lower PIF3/HY5 protein ratio and the up-regulation of <italic>PhANG</italic> expression according to published results. Genetic mutations in <italic>cop1</italic> and <italic>det</italic>1 also lower the PIF3/HY5 ratio and activate <italic>PhANG</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Osterlund et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Benvenuto et al., 2002</xref>). Consistent with these findings, <italic>ccr2 det1-154</italic> etiolated and de-etiolated seedlings treated with D15 displayed higher HY5 and lower PIF3 protein levels, contrasting opposite to that of <italic>ccr2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). The <italic>cis</italic>-carotene derived cleavage metabolite can transcriptionally antagonise the DET1 mediated post-transcriptional regulation of HY5 and PIF3. In conclusion, we deduce that the unknown apocarotenoid retrograde signal acts at the transcriptional level in parallel with the negative regulator DET1, to control POR, PIF3 and HY5 and thus regulate etioplast development during skotomorphogenesis and chloroplast development under extended periods of darkness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mutants used in this study</title><p>All germplasms are in the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> ecotype Columbia (Col-0) background except where otherwise indicated.

Carotenoids and chlorophylls were identified based upon retention time relative to known standards and their light emission absorbance spectra at 440 nm (chlorophyll, β-carotene, xanthophylls, pro-neurosporene, tetra-cis-lycopene), 400 nm (ζ-carotenes), 340 nm (phytofluene) and 286 nm (phytoene). Absolute quantification of xanthophyll pigments was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Pogson et al., 1996</xref>). Quantification of <italic>cis</italic>-carotenes was performed by using their molar extinction coefficient and molecular weight to derive peak area in terms of micrograms (µg) per gram fresh weight (gfw) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Britton, 1995</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)</title><p>Cotyledons from 5-d-old etiolated seedlings were harvested in dim-green safe light and fixed overnight in primary fixation buffer (2.5% Glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.2) under vacuum, post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 hr, followed by an ethanol series: 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% and 3 × 100% for 10 min each. After dehydration, samples were incubated in epon araldite (resin): ethanol at 1: 2, 1: 1 and 2:1 for 30 min each, then 3 times in 100% resin for 2 hr. Samples were then transferred to fresh resin and hardened under nitrogen air at 60°C for 2 d, followed by sectioning of samples using Leica EM UC7 ultramicrotome (Wetzlar). Sections were placed on copper grids, stained with 5% uranyl acetate, washed thoroughly with distilled water, dried, and imaged with H7100FA transmission electron microscope (Hitachi) at 100 kV. For each of the dark-grown seedling samples, prolamellar bodies were counted from 12 fields on three grids, and data analysed using two-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey HSD.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>DNA-seq library construction, Sequencing and Bioinformatics Identification of SNPs</title><p>Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). One microgram of gDNA was sheared using the M220 Focused-Ultrasonicator (Covaris) and libraries were prepared using NEBNext Ultra DNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs) followed by size selection (~320 bp) using AMPure XP Beads (Beckman Coulter). Paired-end sequencing was performed using the Illumina HiSEQ1500. After sequencing, the raw reads were assessed for quality using the FastQC software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/">http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/</ext-link> projects/fastqc/), and subjected to trimming of illumina adapters and filtering of low quality reads with AdapterRemoval programme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lindgreen, 2012</xref>). The reads were mapped to the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (TAIR9) genome with BWA mapper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Li and Durbin, 2009</xref>). The resultant BWA alignment files were converted to sorted bam files using the samtools v0.1.18 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Li et al., 2009</xref>) and were used as input for the subsequent SNP calling analyses. The SNPs were called and analysed further on both the parent and mutant lines using NGM pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Austin et al., 2011</xref>) and SHOREmap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Schneeberger et al., 2009</xref>). For the NGM pipeline, SNPs were called using samtools (v0.1.16) as instructed and processed into ‘.emap’ files using a script provided on the NGM website. The. emap files were uploaded to the NGM web-portal to assess SNPs with associated discordant chastity values. To identify mutant specific SNPs, SNPs from parental lines were filtered out and EMS-induced homozygous SNPs were defined based on the discordant chastity metric. For SHOREmap, the SHORE software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ossowski et al., 2008</xref>) was used to align the reads (implementing BWA) and call the SNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hartwig et al., 2012</xref>). SHOREmap backcross was then implemented to calculate mutant allele frequencies, filter out parent SNPs and define the EMS mutational changes. Where appropriate, custom scripts were used to identify mutant specific EMS SNPs, filter out parent SNPs and annotate the region of interest. The SNPs and InDels were localized based on the annotation of gene models provided by TAIR database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.arabidopsis.org/">http://www.arabidopsis.org/</ext-link>). The polymorphisms in the gene region and other genome regions were annotated as genic and intergenic, respectively. The genic polymorphisms were classified as CDS (coding sequences), UTR (untranslated regions), introns and splice site junctions according to their localization. SNPs in the CDS were further separated into synonymous and non-synonymous amino substitution. The GO/PFAM annotation data were further used to functionally annotate each gene.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>RNA-seq library construction, Sequencing and Differential Gene Expression Analysis</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from Arabidopsis leaf tissues grown under an 8 hr photoperiod or cotyledons from etiolated seedlings grown in dark for 7 d by TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scientific) followed by DNase treatment at 37°C for 30 min. RNA was recovered using x1.8 Agencourt RNAClean XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter). RNA (1 μg) libraries were constructed using Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit (ROCHE) followed by bead size selection (~280 bp) using AMPure XP Beads and libraries sequenced using the Illumina HiSEQ2000. Fifteen million reads were obtained from sequencing each library and 21365 to 23840 mRNA transcripts were identified. Quality control was performed with FASTQC v.0.11.2. Adapters were removed using scythe v.0.991 (flags -p 0.01 for the prior), reads trimmed with sickle v.1.33 (flags q 20; quality threshold and -l 20 for minimum read length after trimming) and aligned to the Arabidopsis genome (TAIR10) using the subjunc v.1.4.6 aligner (-u and -H flags to report reads with a single, unambiguous mapping location) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Liao et al., 2014</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jürgen Kleine-Vehn as the Reviewing Editor and Christian Hardtke as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Enrique Lopez Juez (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Your extensive work links carotenoid biosynthesis and plastid development, revealing that an apocarotenoid signaling molecule acts in plastid formation.

Clear demonstration that another apocarotenoid signal is a retrograde regulator of plastid development would be a significant advance in our understanding of this important process. This is a thorough study and the quality of the presented data is very high. The interpretation of the experiments with respect to an apocarotenoid signal regulating plastid development is sound, but is more difficult to follow when discussing the mechanism for this. This is partly because the paper is not clearly written in places. The Discussion in particular left me less clear on what is being proposed than before I read it. The description of the gene expression studies was also difficult to follow with lots of different experiments conducted and the data only shown in some poorly explained supplementary files. The key result seems to be changes in expression of nuclear genes important in plastid development in Supplementary file 5 and Supplementary Table 6 (the data are duplicated). More could have been made of these data (table or figure in main paper) and it would have been nice to see some of these results confirmed by qPCR as the effect of the <italic>det1-154</italic> mutation and D15 could then be included.</p><p>Overall, although it is an interesting story, there are quite a few points I'm still confused about. Firstly, the role of carotenoid cleavage products in signalling. The <italic>ccr2</italic> mutant shows changes in nuclear gene expression that are reversed by the ziso mutation, but the absence of an effect of D15 leads to the conclusion that <italic>cis</italic>-carotenoid cleavage does not directly affect transcriptional regulation of these genes (subsection “A <italic>cis</italic>-carotene cleavage product acts downstream of DET1 to post-transcriptionally regulate protein levels”, first paragraph). So are we talking about two different signals, one a <italic>cis</italic>-carotene and one a <italic>cis</italic>-carotene cleavage product? The data in Figure 7A that addresses this point are very incomplete and need to include the <italic>ccr2</italic> and <italic>det1-154</italic> mutants. In addition, the PIF3 and HY5 genes show the opposite regulation compared to WT in Supplementary Table 6, but in this figure they are regulated similarly (though of course a direct comparison is not possible). What is the explanation for this?</p><p>It is also unclear why, when there are major changes in transcript abundance for PIF3 and HY5 in <italic>ccr2</italic>, it was concluded so strongly that regulation of the PIF3 and HY5 protein levels was post-transcriptional. The regulation of PIF3 and HY5 transcript abundance in <italic>ccr2</italic> with and without D15 needs to be completed before this can be concluded. Moreover, it is concluded (subsection “An apocarotenoid post-transcriptionally regulates PIF3 and HY5 protein levels”) that the lack of a PLB in <italic>ccr2</italic> is not due to the reduction in PIF3, but other PIFs (especially PIF1) have not been tested and multiple <italic>pif</italic> mutants do lack PLBs even if <italic>pif3</italic> alone doesn't.</p><p>The relationship with <italic>det1</italic> is quite difficult to understand. <italic>det1</italic> mutants lack a PLB and therefore the rescue of PLBs in <italic>ccr2 det1-154</italic> is extremely surprising in my view. A rescue in nuclear gene expression might account for it in part, but, although expected, this is not tested properly. Finally, there is also confusion in the related discussion of POR. Even in the Abstract it is stated that &quot;<italic>ccr2</italic> has no PLB and normal POR&quot; as well as that &quot;the apocarotenoid signal and <italic>det1</italic> complemented each other to restore POR levels and PLB formation&quot;. If the <italic>ccr2</italic> phenotype is mediated by the production of apocarotenoids it is hard to reconcile these two statements. The statement in the second paragraph of the subsection “An apocarotenoid signal regulates skotomorphogenesis and plastid biogenesis in parallel to DET1” also cannot be true as it seems quite clear that the level of POR is not controlling PLB formation in this system (as opposed to the experiments of Armstrong et al. in which POR levels were modulated). The explanation later in the aforementioned subsection for <italic>det1</italic> rescue of <italic>ccr2</italic> doesn't make sense to me either. If the <italic>cis</italic>-carotene cleavage product is up-regulating POR and enhancing Pchlide levels (no evidence of this) to enable PLB formation why does <italic>ccr2</italic> not have a PLB? The <italic>det1</italic> mutant would only counter the POR effect.</p><p>In summary, this is a fascinating system that has the potential to reveal some important regulatory pathways in the control of plastid development, but some of the logical inconsistencies highlighted above need to be ironed out to make this story more coherent to the reader.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript follows and dramatically expands on two sets of intriguing previous observations of the phenotypes of two carotenoid biosynthesis mutants, the current <italic>ccr2</italic>, defective in the enzyme CRITSO, as well as clbs5, defective in ZDS, the preceding enzyme in the synthesis of (all-trans) lycopene. According to the evidence obtained from both mutants, the authors propose an apocarotenoid signal (ACS) is derived from <italic>cis</italic>-carotenoids, which accumulate in both mutants. Such a signal has a range of developmental impacts, impairing the normal course of cellular differentiation and morphogenesis during leaf development in the light, It also causes a complex alteration of plastid development from dark (etioplast) to light (chloroplast), which in some respects prevents etioplast development, but in others enhances the characteristics which differentiate etioplasts from chloroplasts, and so may play a fundamental role in skotomorphogenesis.</p><p>The current manuscript includes an extraordinarily large body of observations which, in essence, are as follows:</p><p>- The Arabidopsis <italic>ccr2</italic> mutant does not have a visible phenotype under standard laboratory conditions. This is in contrast to tomato (tangerine) and rice (zebra2) mutants. <italic>ccr2</italic> is now shown to develop yellow early leaves, or a &quot;virescent&quot; phenotype, with leaf primordia or differentiating cells of developing leaves having underdeveloped chloroplast thylakoid membranes, only when grown under short day, long night photoperiods.</p><p>- The virescent phenotype is caused by accumulation of <italic>cis</italic>-carotenoids. Mutations in the previous enzyme in carotenoidd metablism, zeta-carotene isomerase, ZISO, or in the photomorphogenesis repressor DET1 revert the <italic>ccr2</italic> virescence phenotype. These are two of 25 revertant mutations of <italic>ccr2</italic> identified, and their identity is demonstrated by independent allele reversion and by wild type complementation. The <italic>det1</italic> revertant mutation indeed causes a deetiolated phenotype in the dark, something which is not shown by <italic>ccr2</italic>.</p><p>- The surprising, initially reported phenotype of <italic>ccr2</italic> is the absence of a prolamellar body (PLB) in etioplasts. The ziso revertant also restores the PLB in etioplasts.</p><p>- A whole transcriptome analysis of differentially expressed (DE) genes in <italic>ccr2</italic> or the <italic>ccr2</italic> ziso revertant shows that, although surprisingly more DE genes can be identified between the revertant and the wild type, the <italic>ccr2</italic> mutant is defective in photosynthesis associated nuclear genes and in some photomorphogenesis genes (HY5), while it shows elevated photomorphogenesis negative agents or regulators (PIF3, COP1, DET11). This is observed when examining etiolated seedlings (mutants and wild type) and also, surprisingly, young, virescent leaves. The gene expression reprogramming bears little resemblance to the changes which occur when seedlings are treated with the early carotenoid biosynthesis inhibitor norflurazon, which photobleaches chloroplasts.</p><p>- Both the absence of PLB and the virescence of <italic>ccr2</italic> can by suppressed by treatment with the pharmacological agent D15, a specific inhibitor of carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases, which act on <italic>cis</italic>-carotenoids and produce apocarotenoids.</p><p>- Treatment with D15 and observation of <italic>ccr2</italic> and the <italic>ccr2 det1</italic> revertant reveal a post-translational change in accumulation of PORA/B, a marker of etioplasts, PIF3, a skotomorphogenesis driver, and HY5, a photomorphogenesis driver, in a way consistent with the ACS (accumulating in <italic>ccr2</italic> but not the revertant and blocked by D15) promoting etioplast or skotomorphogenic development, and reducing photomorphogenic development. This action of the ACS appears additive, and most probably occurs in parallel to the action of DET1.</p><p>The volume and depth of the experiments in this study is extraordinary. While the identity of the ACS remains unknown, there is no doubt about its nature (a <italic>cis</italic>-carotene apocarotenoid or a result of its present) and impact. The role of the ACS in the development of etioplasts and in the skotomorphogenesis programme are particularly significant. There are, nevertheless, areas of the manuscript which need addressing:</p><p>1) The visible phenotype of CRITSO mutants, its basis and its relevance. This phenotype is variously described as &quot;variegated&quot; or &quot;virescent&quot;, and is referred to as triggered by short days, a potential seasonal signal. This matters because the terminology suggests both mechanistic basis and fitness significance. A variegated mutation causes a stochastic failure in chloroplast development in some young, differentiating cells, but not others. As a result, some differentiated cell clusters/regions will show complete failure of greening, and others normal greening. This does not describe the phenotype of <italic>ccr2</italic>, where all young cells show impaired greening, and all completely differentiated ones appear normal. This is virescence. a kind of delayed chloroplast development. The rice CRITSO mutant, zebra2, shows transverse pale and green stripes, while variegated cereal mutants (like barley albostrians) show longitudinal stripes. The study of Han et al., 2012, showed that stripes of zebra2 disappeared when plants were grown under continuous light, even though the carotenoid composition appeared unaffected by photoperiod. In other words, the pale stripes resulted from periods in which chloroplast differentiation in leaf meristematic cells occurred in the dark. This study is cited but such observations are not. The observations with Arabidopsis <italic>ccr2</italic> are uncannily similar, the short photoperiod causing virescence being, more importantly, a long daily dark period. The most parsimonious explanation for the phenotype is the occurrence of a phenomenon or accumulation of a product in the dark, one which, upon light exposure, causes chloroplast development impairment, deceleration (arabidopsis and tomato) or arrest (rice).</p><p>2) The consequences of the action of ACS in the dark were described by Han et al. as production of reactive oxygen species, particularly singlet oxygen, upon light exposure of accumulated tetra-<italic>cis</italic>-lycopene. The authors of the current manuscript rightly highlight the differences between the transcriptome programme of <italic>ccr2</italic> seedlings or virescent leaves and those related to the &quot;genomes uncoupled&quot; regulation of photosynthesis associated nuclear genes. It has been shown (Page et al., 2017) that the repression of such genes by the &quot;FR block of greening&quot; treatment, which in fact impairs the correct etioplast-to-chloroplast transition, is associated to singlet oxygen damage. The source of the damaging oxygen species in this case is accumulated protochlorophyllide in the absence of its reductase, PORA (and of a prolamellar body). A comparison by the authors of the programme in <italic>ccr2</italic> and Page data could be revealing as to the root of the <italic>ccr2</italic> phenotype.</p><p>3) Particularly if the above turns out to be correct, one may not need to invoke a change in apocarotenoids as the cause for the reversion of <italic>ccr2</italic> by <italic>det1</italic>. Instead, <italic>det1</italic> would prevent the occurrence of a skotomorphogenic programme during the daily, extended dark period. Consequently, no photodynamic reagent (unbound protochlorophyllide?), source of singlet oxygen, or otherwise chloroplast repressive signal would accumulate during such periods.</p><p>4) The more parsimonious interpretation above does not diminish the importance of the ACS in the development of etioplasts or pre-chloroplasts. If could, instead, throw a new angle on it and emphasise its importance. It appears that the modified skotomorphogenic and the virescent stages of <italic>ccr2</italic> show commonalities in transcriptome programmes, and in the ratio of key transcription factor drivers of skoto- or photo-morphogenic stages (high and low PIF3/HY5 ratios respectively). As the authors note, this could place the still unidentified ACS signal in a central role in skotomorphogenesis.</p><p>5) Some of the protein blots in Figure 7 could have had separate control genotypes or conditions. Some description of exposures would help. See below.</p><p>6) The entire manuscript text uses a degree of confidence in the enzymatic activities and their responsible genes which the reviewer, admittedly not a specialist, wonders whether it can be justified. Early carotenoid biosynthesis genes are strongly seedling lethal. Losses of many later genes cause profile differences but relatively healthy development, which would be consistent with a combination of enzyme- and non-enzyme-mediated activities, or with redundancy in gene function, or both. This is referred in relation to the phenotypes of individual ccd mutants, but one wonders whether similar caution should be used throughout.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript links carotenoid biosynthesis and plastid development with specific events in seedling and leaf development occurring in light and dark environments. In my view this manuscript presents a well done, detailed analysis of the links between these processes from carotenoid content to plastid morphology to gene expression and protein accumulation. I found it well written with thoughtfully constructed figures and supplementary materials. The finding that an apocarotenoid signaling molecule derived from linear carotenoids acts in plastid formation and development and skotomorphogenesis is a highly interesting finding and will have a broad impact from cellular to developmental biology to carotenoid metabolism onto environmental response. I have no substantive concerns and congratulate the authors on this well done manuscript.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A <italic>cis</italic>-carotene derived apocarotenoid regulates etioplast and chloroplast development&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Christian Hardtke (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The reviewers request more precision in describing &quot;FR-block of greening&quot;. During the review consultation, the reviewers also discussed that the term &quot;leaf meristematic cells&quot; could be misleading and that the term &quot;differentiating cells&quot; would be more suitable.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Cazonelli and collaborators have modified this manuscript in the following key ways:</p><p>1) The previous observations of <italic>ccr2</italic>-like mutants in other species, including the zebra mutants, are much more completely and carefully described. This includes the plastid-impairing impact of extended dark periods, which presumably led to their experimentation in the Arabidopsis mutant. This is accompanied with a more careful description of the enzyme- and non-enzyme-mediated conversion steps in carotenoid metabolism. While the authors do not emphasise these changes, they provide a key piece of evidence for the argument of the existence of the unidentified apocarotenoid signal (ACS) and its repressive impact on chloroplast development.</p><p>2) The global gene expression analysis of differentially expressed genes in etiolated seedlings and young leaves of the <italic>ccr2</italic> and <italic>ccr2</italic> ziso mutants has been more thoroughly carried out, incorporating it into the main text and adding comparisons to the effect of norflurazon treatments and &quot;FR-block of greening&quot;.</p><p>3) The experimentation providing confusing data in the previous Figure 7, which lacked controls and also description of conditions, has been completely repeated. The results are difficult to compare with the previous, as those lacked a description of conditions, but appear rather different, and now much more in keeping with published data where relevant (on PIF3 and HY5). Those data now much more clearly support the authors' interpretation of the role the ACS.</p><p>4) The text and the model figures are partly rewritten and clearly improved.</p><p>Overall the changes make a very positive difference to the manuscript, which now provides clearer and more compelling evidence on the possible nature and the action of the ACS.</p><p>Particularly noteworthy is the fact that the authors refer to a role of light in the non-enzymatic isomerisation of tetra-<italic>cis</italic> lycopene, an alternative to the enzymatic step (CRTISO) lost in the <italic>ccr2</italic> mutant (see 1 above). This, combined with the lack of overlap with the singlet-oxygen regulated genes identified in the study of Page et al., 2017, strongly support a role for the ACS as opposed to the generation of a photodynamic molecule during the dark periods to explain the mutant phenotype. For this they should be congratulated, and this version of the manuscript is a very real improvement.</p><p>However the authors, in this reviewer's reading, describe that study of Page et al., and the impact of their experimental intervention, incorrectly. This is important because it obscures the relevance of the comparison and the importance of the findings. The so-called &quot;FR-block of greening&quot; cannot be described as &quot;the action of FR light&quot; or &quot;a FR treatment&quot;. Rather it is the action of WHITE light on seedlings which had PREVIOUSLY been deetiolated under FR light. Such pretreatment results in a repression of PORA activity, while synthesis of Protochlorophyllide continues without a concomitant conversion into chlorophyllide. As a consequence, subsequent exposure to white light leads to absorption by Pchlide and generation of singlet oxygen, with lethal consequences for the seedlings overall. It was not impossible to conceive before that the extended dark periods resulted in the establishment of a similar condition in the <italic>ccr2</italic> mutant. The authors have now both ruled this out and provided an alternative explanation for the &quot;corrective&quot; effect of reducing dark periods. This issue, addressed at multiple points in the manuscript's text, needs redressing.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This revision is addresses my previous comments and is well done resulting in an improved manuscript overall.

We have made changes throughout the manuscript to reflect the above and below comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The consequences of the action of ACS in the dark were described by Han et al. as production of reactive oxygen species, particularly singlet oxygen, upon light exposure of accumulated tetra-cis-lycopene. The authors of the current manuscript rightly highlight the differences between the transcriptome programme of ccr2 seedlings or virescent leaves and those related to the &quot;genomes uncoupled&quot; regulation of photosynthesis associated nuclear genes. It has been shown (Page et al., 2017) that the repression of such genes by the &quot;FR block of greening&quot; treatment, which in fact impairs the correct etioplast-to-chloroplast transition, is associated to singlet oxygen damage. The source of the damaging oxygen species in this case is accumulated protochlorophyllide in the absence of its reductase, PORA (and of a prolamellar body). A comparison by the authors of the programme in ccr2 and Page data could be revealing as to the root of the ccr2 phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We have re-analysed our dataset in parallel with the Page et al., 2017. We compared DE genes miss-regulated by Far Red (Fr) light and norflurazon (NF) treatment in de-etiolated seedlings from Page et al., 2017 with DE genes miss-regulated in <italic>ccr2</italic> and <italic>ccr2</italic> ziso-155. There was no significant overlap in DE genes miss-regulated by Fr (see Supplementary file 3). This supports our observation that singlet oxygen damage is unlikely to be the root of the <italic>ccr2</italic> generated signal, and further strengthens are observations that a <italic>cis</italic>-carotene cleavage product is the signal that impaired PLB formation in <italic>ccr2</italic>, and the etioplast-to-chloroplast transition following de-etiolation independent of singlet oxygen/GUN signalling pathways. We have highlighted this data in the Results and Discussion. During this analysis, we confirmed an overlap in miss-regulated genes between NF treatment and <italic>ccr2</italic>, that in our first version was reported in Supplementary Table 6, We updated this this table and moved to main paper as Table 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Particularly if the above turns out to be correct, one may not need to invoke a change in apocarotenoids as the cause for the reversion of ccr2 by det1. Instead, det1 would prevent the occurrence of a skotomorphogenic programme during the daily, extended dark period. Consequently, no photodynamic reagent (unbound protochlorophyllide?), source of singlet oxygen, or otherwise chloroplast repressive signal would accumulate during such periods.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your thinking and suggestions for future work. As you note, the amount of data in the current manuscript is already “extraordinary” and we will address this line of experimentation in future investigations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The more parsimonious interpretation above does not diminish the importance of the ACS in the development of etioplasts or pre-chloroplasts. If could, instead, throw a new angle on it and emphasise its importance. It appears that the modified skotomorphogenic and the virescent stages of ccr2 show commonalities in transcriptome programmes, and in the ratio of key transcription factor drivers of skoto- or photo-morphogenic stages (high and low PIF3/HY5 ratios respectively). As the authors note, this could place the still unidentified ACS signal in a central role in skotomorphogenesis.</p></disp-quote><p>Action. The additional data requested by the reviewers has enabled us to incorporate the reviewer’s advice into our modified models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Some of the protein blots in Figure 7 could have had separate control genotypes or conditions. Some description of exposures would help. See below.</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected. Thank you for your advice. We have fixed the problems in the new Figures 7 and 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The entire manuscript text uses a degree of confidence in the enzymatic activities and their responsible genes which the reviewer, admittedly not a specialist, wonders whether it can be justified. Early carotenoid biosynthesis genes are strongly seedling lethal. Losses of many later genes cause profile differences but relatively healthy development, which would be consistent with a combination of enzyme- and non-enzyme-mediated activities, or with redundancy in gene function, or both. This is referred in relation to the phenotypes of individual ccd mutants, but one wonders whether similar caution should be used throughout.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks, we appreciate your comments about not overstating the complexity of functional redundancy with enzymatic and non-enzymatic activities and have ensured our language is consistent with best practice and understanding in the carotenoid community. We have revised accordingly to insure caution in our interpretation.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The reviewers request more precision in describing &quot;FR-block of greening&quot;. During the review consultation, the reviewers also discussed that the term &quot;leaf meristematic cells&quot; could be misleading and that the term &quot;differentiating cells&quot; would be more suitable.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their constructive suggestions and valuable comments. We have addressed all issues as suggested. In summary, we corrected: 1) the descriptions related to data interpretation from Page et al., 2017; 2) terminology related to cells in the leaf primoridia; and 3) added a Figure 7—figure supplement 1 gel blot to show the reduction in DET1-154 peptide size compared to DET1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] The authors, in this reviewer's reading, describe that study of Page et al., and the impact of their experimental intervention, incorrectly. This is important because it obscures the relevance of the comparison and the importance of the findings. The so-called &quot;FR-block of greening&quot; cannot be described as &quot;the action of FR light&quot; or &quot;a FR treatment&quot;. Rather it is the action of WHITE light on seedlings which had PREVIOUSLY been deetiolated under FR light. Such pretreatment results in a repression of PORA activity, while synthesis of Protochlorophyllide continues without a concomitant conversion into chlorophyllide. As a consequence, subsequent exposure to white light leads to absorption by Pchlide and generation of singlet oxygen, with lethal consequences for the seedlings overall. It was not impossible to conceive before that the extended dark periods resulted in the establishment of a similar condition in the ccr2 mutant. The authors have now both ruled this out and provided an alternative explanation for the &quot;corrective&quot; effect of reducing dark periods. This issue, addressed at multiple points in the manuscript's text, needs redressing.</p></disp-quote><p>Fixed at all multiple points.</p></body></sub-article></article>
