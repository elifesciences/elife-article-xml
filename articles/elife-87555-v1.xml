pathogenesis is the potential for antibody-dependent enhancement, which is associated with deadly DENV secondary infection, complicates the identification of correlates of protection, and negatively impacts the safety and efficacy of DENV vaccines. Antibody-dependent enhancement is linked to antibodies targeting the fusion loop (FL) motif of the envelope protein, which is completely conserved in mosquito-borne flaviviruses and required for viral entry and fusion. In the current study, we utilized saturation mutagenesis and directed evolution to engineer a functional variant with a mutated FL (D2-FL), which is not neutralized by FL-targeting monoclonal antibodies. The FL mutations were combined with our previously evolved prM cleavage site to create a mature version of D2-FL (D2-FLM), which evades both prM- and FL-Abs but retains sensitivity to other type-specific and quaternary cross-reactive (CR) Abs. CR serum from heterotypic (DENV4)-infected non-human primates (NHP) showed lower neutralization titers against D2-FL and D2-FLM than isogenic wildtype DENV2 while similar neutralization titers were observed in serum from homotypic (DENV2)-infected NHP. We propose D2-FL and D2-FLM as valuable tools to delineate CR Ab subtypes in serum as well as an exciting platform for safer live-attenuated DENV vaccines suitable for naïve individuals and children.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dengue virus</kwd><kwd>fusion loop</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>saturation mutagenesis</kwd><kwd>vaccine</kwd><kwd>serum</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI107731</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DeSilva</surname><given-names>Arivianda M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01AI106695</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DeSilva</surname><given-names>Arivianda M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Operating as a serum profiling tool for dengue infection and vaccination, the D2-FLM variant, which is insensitive to antibody-dependent enhancement-prone fusion loop antibodies, also offers potential for a safer dengue virus vaccine.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dengue virus (DENV) is a member of the <italic>Flavivirus</italic> genus and is a major global public health threat, with four major serotypes of DENV found worldwide. Dengue causes ~400 million infections each year, of which ~20% of cases present clinically, a subset of which may progress to severe dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhatt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brady et al., 2012</xref>). DENV is transmitted through <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito vectors, and globalization and global warming are increasing the endemic range of dengue worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ebi and Nealon, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Messina et al., 2019</xref>). The pathogenesis of dengue is complex as first-time infections are rarely severe and lead to serotype-specific immunity. However, reinfection with a different serotype increases the risk of developing DHF/DSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Halstead, 1988</xref>). This is thought to be due to the phenomenon of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), in which poorly neutralizing cross-reactive (CR) antibodies (Abs) lead to enhanced viral uptake and infection of unique cell populations in an Fcγ-receptor-mediated manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Katzelnick et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>ADE remains a major challenge for DENV vaccine development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rey et al., 2018</xref>). The leading DENV vaccine platforms in clinical testing are tetravalent live-attenuated virus mixtures of all four serotypes. However, creating formulations that elicit a balanced response has proven challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rabaa et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, lab-grown strains differ from patient-derived DENVs in both maturation status and antigenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Raut et al., 2019</xref>). In particular, Abs targeting the fusion loop (FL) have been reported to neutralize lab and patient strains with differing strengths and have been observed to facilitate Fcγ-receptor uptake in vitro and therefore ADE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beltramello et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Costin et al., 2013</xref>). Currently, there is a single FDA-approved DENV vaccine, Dengvaxia. However, it is only approved for use in individuals aged 9–16 with previous DENV infection living in endemic areas and is contraindicated for use in naïve individuals and younger children. In naïve children, vaccination stimulated non-neutralizing CR Abs that increased the risk of severe disease after DENV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wilder-Smith, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anonymous, 2019</xref>). Other DENV vaccines have been tested or are currently undergoing clinical trial, but thus far none have been approved for use in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Izmirly et al., 2020</xref>). The vaccine Qdenga has been approved in the European Union, Indonesia, and Brazil, although vaccine efficacy in adults, naïve individuals, and with all serotypes has not yet been shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angelin et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>The DENV FL is located in Envelope (E) protein domain II (EDII) and is involved in monomer–monomer contacts with EDIII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Modis et al., 2004</xref>). During the DENV infection cycle, low pH triggers a conformational change in the E protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klein et al., 2013</xref>). The structure of the virion rearranges, and individual monomers form a trimer with all three FLs in the same orientation, ready to initiate membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Modis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klein et al., 2013</xref>). The core FL motif (DRGWGNGCGLFGK, AA 98–110) is highly conserved, with 100% amino acid conservation in all DENV serotypes and other mosquito-borne flaviviruses, including yellow fever virus (YFV), Zika virus (ZIKV), West Nile virus (WNV), Kunjin virus (KUNV), Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Usutu virus (USUV), and Saint Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Although the extreme conservation and critical role in entry have led to it being considered difficult to alter the antigenic epitope by changing more than one amino acid of the FL, we successfully tested the hypothesis that massively parallel-directed evolution could produce viable DENV FL mutants that were still capable of fusion and entry, while altering the antigenic footprint. The FL mutations, in combination with optimized prM cleavage site mutations, ablate neutralization by the prM- and FL-Abs, retain sensitivity to other protective Abs, and provide a novel vaccine strategy for DENV.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Generation of DENV2 fusion loop mutants via directed evolution.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Alignment of top: dengue virus fusion loops; bottom: mosquito-borne flavivirus fusion loops, including yellow fever virus (YFV), Zika virus (ZIKV), West Nile virus (WNV), Kunjin virus (KUNV), Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Usutu virus (USUV), and Saint Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV).

We generated two different saturation mutagenesis libraries, each with five randomized amino acids: DRG<bold>X</bold>G<bold>X</bold>G<bold>XXX</bold>FGK (Library 1; AA 101, 103, 105–107) and DRG<bold>XXXXX</bold>GLFGK (Library 2 AA 101–105). Library 1 was designed to mutate known residues targeted by FL mAbs while Library 2 focused on a continuous linear peptide that is the epitope for FL-Abs to maximally alter antigenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Smith et al., 2013</xref>). Saturation mutagenesis plasmid libraries were used to produce viral libraries in either C6/36 (<italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquito) or Vero 81 (African green monkey) cells and passaged three times in their respective cell types. Following directed evolution, viral genomes were extracted and subjected to deep sequencing to identify surviving and enriched variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Due to the high level of conservation, it was not surprising that most mutational combinations failed to yield viable progeny. In fact, evolutions carried out on Library 2 only yielded wildtype sequences. For Library 1, wildtype sequences dominated in Vero 81-evolved libraries. However, a novel variant emerged in C6/36 cells with two amino acid changes: DRGWG<bold><underline>S</underline></bold>GC<bold><underline>L</underline></bold>LFGK. The major variant comprised ~95% of the population, while the next most populous variant (DRGWG<bold><underline>S</underline></bold>GC<bold><underline>W</underline></bold>LFGK) comprised only 0.25% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Bulk Sanger sequencing revealed an additional Env-T171A mutation outside of the FL region. Residues W101, C105, and L107 were preserved in our final sequence, supporting the importance of these residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Modis et al., 2004</xref>). When modeled on the pre-fusion DENV2 structure, the N103S and G106L mutations are located at the interface with the neighboring monomer EDIII domain, protected from the aqueous environment. In the post-fusion form, the two residues are located between W101 and F108 and form the bowl concavity above the chlorine ion in the post-fusion trimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We used reverse genetics to re-derive the FL N103S/G106L/T171A mutant, which we term D2-FL. As enhancing Abs also target prM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rodenhuis-Zybert et al., 2010</xref>), we also created a mature version of D2-FL termed D2-FLM, containing both the evolved FL motif and our previously published evolved prM furin cleavage site, which results in a more mature virion like those found in infected patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Raut et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tse et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>We performed growth curves comparing DENV2, D2-FL, and D2-FLM in both C6/36 and Vero 81 cells. In C6/36 cells, the growth of all three viruses was comparable, reaching high titers of 10<sup>6</sup>–10<sup>7</sup> FFU/mL. However, in Vero 81 cells, both FL mutant viruses were highly attenuated, with a 2–2.5 log reduction in titer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The species-specific phenotype in culture involved a change from insect to mammalian cells, as well as a change in growth temperature. To investigate whether the mutant viruses were more unstable at higher temperatures, we performed a thermostability assay, comparing viruses incubated at temperatures ranging from 4 to 55°C before infection. The three viruses had comparable thermostabilities, indicating that this does not explain the attenuation of the FL mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Because the D2-FLM virus contains mutations that increase prM cleavage frequency, we also assayed the maturation status of the three viruses by western blot. D2-FL had a comparable prM:E ratio to the isogenic wildtype DENV2 (DV2-WT), while, as expected, D2-FLM had a reduced prM:E ratio, indicating a higher degree of maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Biological and physical properties of mature DENV2 fusion loop mutants.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Multistep growth curves [Multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 0.05–0.1] of DV2-WT, D2-FL, and D2-FLM on C6/36 cells (left) or Vero 81 cells (right).

Importantly, D2-FL and D2-FLM were resistant to mAbs targeting the FL. Neutralization by 1M7 is reduced by ~2 logs in both variants, 1N5 neutralization is reduced by ~1 log for D2-FL and reduced to background levels for D2-FLM, and no neutralization was observed for 1L6 or 4G2 for either variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Smith et al., 2013</xref>). Focusing on the D2-FLM virus containing both evolved motifs, we then characterized the antigenicity of the whole virion with a panel of mAbs.

For Abs targeting epitopes in non-mutated regions, including the ED1 and EDE epitopes that target EDII and EDIII, FRNT<sub>50</sub> values were generally comparable, although EDE1-C10 shows a moderate but statistically significant reduction between DV2-WT and D2-FLM, indicating that the overall virion structural integrity was intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Fusion loop (FL) mutant is insensitive to FL monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), the major target for cross-reactive Abs in non-human primates (NHPs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left: FRNT<sub>50</sub> values for neutralization of DV2-WT, D2-FL, and D2-FLM with mAbs against the FL (1M7, 1N5, 1L6, 4G2).

In the first cohort (NHP infected with 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> FFU Vero-grown virus via subcutaneous [SC] injection) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Young et al., 2023</xref>), serum from homotypic DENV2-infected NHPs (n = 3) did not display a difference in neutralization between DV2-WT, D2-FL, and D2-FLM, confirming that prM and FL epitopes are not significant contributors to the homotypic type-specific (TS) neutralizing Ab response in primates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In two NHPs infected with DENV4, strong neutralization potency (FRNT<sub>50</sub> between 1:100 and 1:1000) was demonstrated against DV2-WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Heterologous cross-neutralization was significantly reduced to background levels (FRNT<sub>50</sub> &lt; 1:40) against the D2-FLM virus at 90 days post-infection (dpi). Neutralization observed against D2-FL, in general, fell between DV2-WT and D2-FLM. NHP 0Y0 displayed little difference in neutralization between D2-FL and D2-FLM, suggesting that FL Abs were more prominent in this animal. Interestingly, in animal 3Z6, at 20 dpi, neutralization against DENV-FL was comparable to DV2-WT, while D2-FLM was greatly reduced, indicating that Abs in the sera targeting the immature virion formed a large portion of the CR response. These data suggest that after a single infection many of the CR Ab responses target prM and the FL and the reliance on these Abs for heterotypic neutralization increases over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p>In the second cohort (NHPs infected with 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> FFU C6/36-grown virus via SC injection) and the third cohort (human serum tested positive by ELISA for homotypic DENV infection) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lopez et al., 2021</xref>), most of the serum (18/24) did not cross-neutralize DV2-WT (FRNT<sub>50</sub> &lt; 1:40), leading to inconclusive result in determining the CR-Ab population in these sera (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The difference between the three cohorts also highlights the heterogeneity of Ab composition in humans and NHPs after DENV exposure. Nevertheless, the collection of FL, mature, and FL-mature variants provides new opportunity to delineate antibody composition in complex polyclonal serum from DENV natural infection and vaccination.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Summary of FRNT<sub>50</sub> values of human convalescent serum and non-human primates (NHP) infection serum against DV2, D2-FL (not determined in human serum) and D2-FLM.</title><p>FRNT<sub>50</sub> values were derived from an eight-point dilution curve of serum started from 1:40 with subsequent threefold dilutions.

The dual protective and enhancing properties of DENV Abs create major challenges for dissecting the role of various Ab populations in disease protection. Cross-reactive weakly neutralizing prM- and FL-Abs are often immunodominant after primary DENV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Smith et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Oliphant et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dejnirattisai et al., 2010</xref>), and can lead to overestimation of the levels of heterotypic protection in traditional neutralization assays. Since these same antibodies are also associated with ADE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rodenhuis-Zybert et al., 2010</xref>), inaccurate conclusions could have dire consequences if protection in vitro translates to the enhancement of disease in human vaccinees. Unfortunately, Ab profiling in polyclonal serum is mainly performed by ELISA, and a neutralization assay that can discriminate Abs does not exist. The D2-FLM variant is not neutralized by FL- and prM-mAbs and appears insensitive to neutralization by these Abs in polyclonal serum. Of note, EDE1-C10 neutralization potency was also reduced in our FL-M variant, further indicating our mutations are affecting the tip of the EDII region that partially overlaps with the EDE1 epitope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sharma et al., 2021</xref>). In combination with other chimeric DENVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrade et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Young et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gallichotte et al., 2015</xref>), D2-FLM provides a reagent to distinguish between TS, protective CR (e.g. E dimer epitope [EDE]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barba-Spaeth et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dejnirattisai et al., 2015</xref>) and ADE-prone CR (e.g. FL and prM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dejnirattisai et al., 2010</xref>) Ab subclasses in neutralization assays after infection and vaccination.</p><p>Due to the ADE properties of DENV Abs, studies to understand and eliminate ADE phenotype are under active investigation. For example, mAbs can be engineered to eliminate binding to the Fcγ receptor, abolishing ADE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kotaki et al., 2021</xref>). While this methodology holds potential for Ab therapeutic development and passive immunization strategies, it is not relevant for vaccination. As FL and prM targeting Abs are the major species demonstrated to cause ADE in vitro, we and others hypothesized that these Abs are responsible for ADE-driven negative outcomes after primary infection and vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beltramello et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Costin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Alwis et al., 2014</xref>). We propose that genetic ablation of the FL and prM epitopes in vaccine strains will minimize the production of these subclasses of Abs responsible for undesirable vaccine responses. Indeed, covalently locked E-dimers and E-dimers with FL mutations have been engineered as potential subunit vaccines that reduce the availability of the FL, thereby reducing the production of FL Abs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rouvinski et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rockstroh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Slon-Campos et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Metz et al., 2017</xref>). DENV subunit vaccines are an area of active study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kudlacek et al., 2021</xref>); however, monomer/dimer subunits can also expose additional, interior-facing epitopes not normally exposed to the cell. Furthermore, dimer subunits are not a complete representation of the DENV virion, which presents other structurally important interfaces such as the threefold and fivefold symmetries. Concerns about balanced immunity to all four serotypes also apply to subunit vaccine platforms. Given the complexity of the immune response to DENV, live virus vaccine platforms have thus far been more successful. However, the FL is strongly mutationally intolerant. Previous reported mutations in the FL are mainly derived from experimental evolution using FL-Abs to select for escape mutant or by deep mutational scanning (DMS) of the Env protein for Ab epitope mapping. Mutations in the FL epitope were observed in a DENV2-NGC-V2 (G106V) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goncalvez et al., 2004</xref>), attenuated JEV vaccine strain SA14-14-2 (L107F) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gromowski et al., 2015</xref>), and attenuated WNV-NY99 (L107F) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). While most of the mutations, including the double mutations reported here lead to attenuation of the virus, a recent DMS study showed that Zika-G106A has no observable impact on viral fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chambers et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, we also recovered a mutation G106L, suggesting that positions 103, 106, and 107 are tolerable FL positions for mutation in mosquito-borne flavivirus. On the other hand, tick-borne flaviviruses, no known vector flaviviruses, and invertebrate-specific flaviviruses show a more diverse FL composition. The inflexibility of mosquito-borne flaviviruses might be due to the evolutionary constraint of the virus to switch between mosquito and vertebrate hosts. Using directed evolution, we successfully generated our D2-FLM variant that combines viability with the desired Ab responses. Therefore, the D2-FLM variant is a novel candidate for a vaccine strain, which presents all the native structures and complex symmetries of DENV necessary for T-cell-mediated responses and which can elicit more optimal protective Ab responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tian et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Elong Ngono and Shresta, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Waickman et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Other considerations of high importance when designing a live DENV vaccine include strain selection and serotype balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gallichotte et al., 2018</xref>). In the current study, we used DENV2 S16803, a prototype for DENV2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Halstead and Marchette, 2003</xref>). However, S16803 was isolated several decades ago, and it may be beneficial to utilize more contemporaneous strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rabaa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Juraska et al., 2018</xref>). Work is currently ongoing to demonstrate the portability of the evolved FL motif on additional DENV2 strains and other serotypes, which is essential for tetravalent vaccine production. D2-FLM was highly attenuated in Vero cells, creating a challenge for vaccine production. Therefore, further adaptation of this strain to grow efficiently in mammalian cells while retaining its antigenic properties is needed. We have tested a panel of FL-Abs; however, we cannot exclude the possibility that other FL-Abs may not be affected by N103S and G106L. Our study confirmed that saturation mutagenesis could generate mutants with multiple amino acid changes, and we are currently using D2-FLM as backbone to iteratively evolve additional mutations in FL to further vary the FL antigenic epitope. Taken together, the FLM variant holds new possibilities for a new generation of DENV vaccines, as well as a platform to readily measure TS and CR ADE-type responses and thereby assess the true protective potential of DENV vaccine trials and safeguard approval of DENV vaccines for human use.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cells and viruses</title><p><italic>A. albopictus</italic> C6/36 (ATCC CRL-1660) cells were grown in MEM (Gibco) with 5% FBS (HyClone), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco), 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids (Gibco), 1% HEPES (Gibco), and 2 mM GlutaMAX (Gibco), cultured at 32°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

The authors used saturation mutagenesis and directed evolution to mutate the highly conserved fusion loop (98 DRGWGNGCGLFGK 110) of the Envelope (E) glycoprotein of Dengue virus (DENV). They created 2 libraries with parallel mutations at amino acids 101, 103, 105-107, and 101-105 respectively. The in vitro transcribed RNA from the two plasmid libraries was electroporated separately into Vero and C6/36 cells and passaged thrice in each of these cells. They successfully recovered a variant N103S/G106L from Library 1 in C6/36 cells, which represented 95% of the sequence population and contained another mutation in E outside the fusion loop (T171A). Library 2 was unsuccessful in either cell type.</p><p>2. The fusion loop mutant virus called D2-FL (N103S/G106L) was created through reverse genetics. Another variant called D2-FLM was also created, which in addition to the fusion loop mutations, also contains a previously published, evolved, and optimized prM-furin cleavage sequence that results in a mature version of the virus (with lower prM content). Both D2-FL and D2-FLM viruses grew comparably to wild type virus in mosquito (C6/36) cells but their infectious titers were 2-2.5 log lower than wildtype virus when grown in mammalian (Vero) cells. These viruses were not compromised in thermostability, and the mechanism for attenuation in Vero cells remains unknown.</p><p>4. Next, the authors probed the neutralization of these viruses using a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against fusion loop and domain I, II and III of E protein, and against prM protein. As intended, neutralization by fusion loop mAbs was reduced or impaired for both D2-FL and D2-FLM, compared to wild type DENV2. D2-FLM virus was equivalent to wild type with respect to neutralization by domain I, II, and III antibodies tested (except domain II-C10 mAb) suggesting an intact global antigenic landscape of the mutant virion. As expected, D2-FLM was also resistant to neutralization by prM mAbs (D2-FL was not tested in this batch of experiments).</p><p>5. Finally, the authors evaluated neutralization in the context of polyclonal serum from convalescent humans (n=6) and experimentally infected non-human primates (n=9) at different time points (27 total samples). Homotypic sera (DENV2) neutralized D2-FL, D2-FLM, and wild type DENV similarly, suggesting that the contribution of fusion loop and prM epitopes is insignificant in a serotype-specific neutralization response. However, heterotypic sera (DENV4) neutralized D2-FL and D2-FLM less potently than wild type DENV2, especially at later time points, demonstrating the contribution of fusion loop- and prM-specific antibodies to heterotypic neutralization.</p><p>Impact of the study-</p><p>1. The engineered D2-FL and D2-FLM viruses are valuable reagents to probe antibodies targeting the fusion loop and prM in the overall polyclonal response to DENV.</p><p>2. Though more work is needed, these viruses can facilitate the design of a new generation of DENV vaccine that does not elicit fusion loop- and prM-specific antibodies, which are often poorly neutralizing and lead to antibody-dependent enhancement effect (ADE).</p><p>3. This work can be extended to other members of the flavivirus family.</p><p>4. A broader impact of their work is a reminder that conserved amino acids may not always be critical for function and therefore should not be immediately dismissed in substitution/mutagenesis/protein design efforts.</p><p>Appraisal of the results -</p><p>The data largely support the conclusions, but some improvements and extensions can benefit the work.</p><p>1.

The authors used saturation mutagenesis and directed evolution to mutate the highly conserved fusion loop (98 DRGWGNGCGLFGK 110) of the Envelope (E) glycoprotein of Dengue virus (DENV). They created 2 libraries with parallel mutations at amino acids 101, 103, 105-107, and 101-105 respectively. The in vitro transcribed RNA from the two plasmid libraries was electroporated separately into Vero and C6/36 cells and passaged thrice in each of these cells. They successfully recovered a variant N103S/G106L from Library 1 in C6/36 cells, which represented 95% of the sequence population and contained another mutation in E outside the fusion loop (T171A). Library 2 was unsuccessful in either cell type.</p><p>1. The fusion loop mutant virus called D2-FL (N103S/G106L) was created through reverse genetics. Another variant called D2-FLM was also created, which in addition to the fusion loop mutations, also contains a previously published, evolved, and optimized prM-furin cleavage sequence that results in a mature version of the virus (with lower prM content). Both D2-FL and D2-FLM viruses grew comparably to wild type virus in mosquito (C6/36) cells but their infectious titers were 2-2.5 log lower than wild type virus when grown in mammalian (Vero) cells. These viruses were not compromised in thermostability, and the mechanism for attenuation in Vero cells remains unknown.</p><p>1. Next, the authors probed the neutralization of these viruses using a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against fusion loop and domain I, II and III of E protein, and against prM protein. As intended, neutralization by fusion loop mAbs was reduced or impaired for both D2-FL and D2-FLM, compared to wild type DENV2. D2-FLM virus was equivalent to wild type with respect to neutralization by domain I, II, and III antibodies tested (except domain II-C10 mAb) suggesting an intact global antigenic landscape of the mutant virion. As expected, D2-FLM was also resistant to neutralization by prM mAbs (D2-FL was not tested in this batch of experiments).</p><p>1. Finally, the authors evaluated neutralization in the context of polyclonal serum from convalescent humans (n=6) and experimentally infected non-human primates (n=9) at different time points (27 total samples). Homotypic sera (DENV2) neutralized D2-FL, D2-FLM, and wild type DENV similarly, suggesting that the contribution of fusion loop and prM epitopes is insignificant in a serotype-specific neutralization response. However, heterotypic sera (DENV4) neutralized D2-FL and D2-FLM less potently than wild type DENV2, especially at later time points, demonstrating the contribution of fusion loop- and prM-specific antibodies to heterotypic neutralization.</p><p>Impact of the study-</p><p>1. The engineered D2-FL and D2-FLM viruses are valuable reagents to probe antibodies targeting the fusion loop and prM in the overall polyclonal response to DENV.</p><p>1. Though more work is needed, these viruses can facilitate the design of a new generation of DENV vaccine that does not elicit fusion loop- and prM-specific antibodies, which are often poorly neutralizing and lead to antibody-dependent enhancement effect (ADE).</p><p>1. This work can be extended to other members of the flavivirus family.</p><p>1. A broader impact of their work is a reminder that conserved amino acids may not always be critical for function and therefore should not be immediately dismissed in substitution/mutagenesis/protein design efforts.</p><p>Evaluating this study in the context of prior literature -</p><p>The authors write &quot;Although the extreme conservation and critical role in entry have led to it being traditionally considered impossible to change the fusion loop, we successfully tested the hypothesis that massively parallel directed evolution could produce viable DENV fusion-loop mutants that were still capable of fusion and entry, while altering the antigenic footprint.&quot;</p><p>&quot;.....Previously, a single study on WNV successfully generated a viable virus with a single mutation at the fusion loop, although it severely attenuated neurovirulence. Otherwise, it has not been generated in DENV or other mosquito-borne flaviviruses&quot;</p><p>The above claims are a bit overstated.

We have adjusted the text above to better reflect and credit the prior literature.

Mutations in the FL epitope were observed in a DENV2-NGC-V2 (G106V)39, attenuated JEV vaccine strain SA14-14-2 (L107F)40, attenuated WNV-NY99 (L107F)41. While most of the mutations, including the double mutations reported here lead to attenuation of the virus. A recent DMS study showed that Zika-G106A has no observable impact on viral fitness42. Interestingly, we also recovered a mutation G106L, suggesting position 106 and 107 might be the most tolerable position for mutation in mosquito borne flavivirus FL. On the other hand, tick borne flavivirus as well as vector only flavivirus show a more diverse FL composition. The inflexibility of mosquito borne flavivirus might be due to the evolution constraint of the virus to switch between mosquito and vertebrate hosts.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Appraisal of the results -</p><p>The data largely support the conclusions, but some improvements and extensions can benefit the work.</p><p>1.

This mutation in JEV is associated with viral attenuation. This sentence is referring to the fact that, in our libraries, we did not recover variants with mutations at these positions, in contrast to D2-FL with variants at N103 and G106, indicating less mutational tolerance. However, we want to re-direct the focus of this manuscript to engineer a viable DENV that is antigenically different in the FL epitope, but not which residue is more tolerance for mutation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

The methods and figure legend have been updated to include greater detail. The polyclonal E antibody was specifically chosen for this study as our previously used monoclonal antibody targeted the fusion loop. The polyclonal antibody was raised against a fragment of E (AA 1-495) and should have minimal effect by the fusion loop mutations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Lines 149 -151: &quot;Importantly, D2-FL and D2-FLM were resistant to antibodies targeting the fusion loop. While neutralization by 1M7 is reduced by ~2-logs, no neutralization was observed for 1N5, 1L6, and 4G2 for either variant (Figure 3 A)&quot;.</p><p>a) Partial neutralization was observed for 1N5, for D2-FL.</p></disp-quote><p>The text has been updated to more accurately describe the 1N5 neutralization data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Do these mAbs cover the full spectrum of fusion loop antibodies identified thus far in the field?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not test every known fusion loop antibody that has been described, instead focusing on 1M7, 1N5, 1L6, and 4G2, which were previously described by Smith et al and Crill et al.

However, we have shown that saturation mutagenesis could generate mutants with multiple amino acid changes, and we are currently using D2-FLM as backbone to iteratively evolve additional mutations in FL to further deviate the FL antigenic epitope.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Are the epitopes known for these mAbs? It would be useful to discuss how the epitope of 1M7 differs from the other mAbs? What are the critical residues?</p></disp-quote><p>Critical residues for these antibodies have been described. They are as follows: 1M7: W101R, W101C, G111R; 1N5: W101R, L107P, L107R, G111R; 1L6: G100A, W101A, F108A; 4G2: G104H, G106Q, L107K. The critical residues for 1M7 are slightly different than the others, perhaps explaining the residual binding to D2-FL. Note that the critical residue identified previously for 1M7 and 1N5 do not overlap with D2-FLM mutations, suggesting the FL mutations has extending effect on the antigenic FL epitope.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) Maybe the D2-FL mutant can be further evolved with selection pressure with fusion loop mAbs 1M7 +/-1N5 and/or other fusion loop mAbs.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it may be possible to further evolve D2-FL using antibody selection, although we have not yet performed these experiments, we are currently performing iterative saturation mutagenesis and directed evolution to further evolve away from the natural FL.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. It would have been useful to include D2-M for comparison (with evolved furin cleavage sequence but no fusion loop mutations).</p></disp-quote><p>Neutralization data for some of the mAbs against D2-M can be found in our previous study (Tse et al. 2022 mBio), in which no difference in neutralization was observed compared to DV2 wildtype. Given the limited resources of the anti-DENV NHP and human serum, we did not add D2-M for comparison. Although some insight can be deduced from the D2-FL vs D2-FLM comparison, we agree future studies that are designed to delineate CR-Ab population between prM, FL and other CR-epitopes should include D2-M for comparison.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Data for polyclonal serum can be better discussed. Table 1 is not discussed much in the text. For the R1160-90dpi-DENV4 sample, D2-FL and D2-FLM are neutralized better than wild type DENV2? The authors' interpretation in lines 181-182 is inconsistent with the data presented in Figure 3C, which suggests that over time, there is INCREASED (not waning) dependence on FL- and prM-specific antibodies for heterotypic neutralization.</p></disp-quote><p>We remade Table 1 to show dilution factors instead of dilution factor-1 of FRNT<sub>50</sub>.</p><p>In general, our human convalescent sera from heterotypic infection (DENV1, 3 and 4) showed none to low neutralization against our DENV2. FRNT<sub>50</sub>s were between 1: 40 – 1:200. Given the weak potency of the antiserum, it is difficult to compare the FRNT<sub>50</sub>s between DV2-WT and D2-FLM.</p><p>Similarly, in a different NHP cohort (2nd NHP cohort shown in Table 1), only one DENV4 infected NHP (R1160) showed a low heterotypic titer against DENV2. The detectable FRNT<sub>50</sub>s were between 1: 50 – 1:90. The value was extrapolated based on a single data point (1:40) which has above 50% neutralization. Given the Hill slope of all the neutralization curves were below 0.5, readers should be cautious when analyzing these FRNT<sub>50</sub> values. * denotes the Hill slopes of all the neutralization curve of them sample are &lt;0.5 (low confidence of neutralization) in Table 1.</p><p>In conclusion, we do not think serum from Table 1 is potent enough to shows difference between the viruses. The intension to show the negative data in Table 1 is to highlight the difference in serum heterogeneity in DENV infected patients and experimental infected NHPs.</p><p>As the reviewer pointed out, the dependence of FL-Ab in later time points increased (the difference between DV2 and D2-FL at 20dpi vs 60dpi vs 90dpi), suggesting non-FL CR-Ab is waning but not prM- and FL-Abs. We rewrote the sentence as follow:</p><p>“These data suggest that after a single infection, many of the CR Ab responses target prM and the FL and the reliance on these Abs for heterotypic neutralization increase overtime (Figure 3C).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Suggestions for further experiments-</p><p>1. It would be interesting to see the phenotype of single mutants N103S and G106L, relative to double mutant N103S/G106L (D2-FL).</p><p>1. The fusion capability of these viruses can be gauged using liposome fusion assay under different pH conditions and different lipids.</p><p>1. Correlative antibody binding vs neutralization data would be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestions; we agree these would be of interest and, indeed, these studies are currently underway. In regard to single mutants, these were present in the initial plasmid library but did not enrich after viral production and passage. Two possible explanations can be drawn, (1) The stochastic of directed evolution prevents a single mutant with similar fitness to enriched. (2) The two mutations are compensatory to each other to make a functional mutant. The 2nd hypothesis highlights the difference between saturation mutagenesis (this study) and DMS (in previous studies).</p><p>Fusion capability is indeed very interesting, however, the mechanistic difference or not between wildtype FL and the mutated FL in supporting fusion is not the focus of this study. Instead, we are currently working on adapting the D2-FLM in mammalian cells. If successful, the difference in fusion mechanism between the Vero adapted and D2-FLM in different lipid, insect vs mammalian would be of interest.</p><p>We are currently developing whole virus ELISA; we avoid using rE monomer for the study as it might neglect the conformation Ab.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of Dengue is largely driven by cross-reactive antibodies that target the DENV fusion loop or pre-membrane protein.

There is inadequate description of these experiments in the materials and methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We remade Table 1 to show dilution factors instead of dilution factor-1 of FRNT<sub>50</sub> and removed the unnecessary color code. We also added discussion for Table 1 and clarify the difference between the three cohorts of serum in the text with the corresponding references.</p><p>In general, our human convalescent sera from heterotypic infection (DENV1, 3 and 4) showed none to low neutralization against our DENV2. FRNT<sub>50</sub>s were between 1: 40 – 1:200. Given the weak potency of the antiserum, it is difficult to compare the FRNT<sub>50</sub>s between DV2-WT and D2-FLM.</p><p>Similarly, in a different NHP cohort (2nd NHP cohort shown in Table 1), only one DENV4 infected NHP (R1160) showed a low heterotypic titer against DENV2. The detectable FRNT<sub>50</sub>s were between 1: 50 – 1:90. The value was extrapolated based on a single data point (1:40) which was above 50% neutralization. Given the Hill slope of all the neutralization curves were below 0.5, the FRNT<sub>50</sub> values are not reliable.</p><p>In conclusion, we do not think sera from Table 1 is potent enough to show difference between the viruses. The intension to show the negative data in Table 1 is to highlight the difference in serum heterogeneity in DENV infected patients and experimental infected NHPs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor critique:</p><p>Figure 1C: Legend is not clear for this panel. What is on the x-axis of the bubble plots? Are these mutations across the entire viral genome or is this just the prM-E sequence?</p></disp-quote><p>The X-axis is a scatter of all of the sequences contained in the library, similar to graphs used for plotting CRISPR screen results. These represent individual sequences from the saturation mutagenesis libraries in the fusion loop of E as described in Figure 1B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The wording in Lines 92-94 is not clear. It looks like the T171A mutation was present in 95% of the sequences (Line 92). Yet this sequence was not incorporated into the variant virus. What is the rationale for omitting this mutation in downstream variant virus generation?</p></disp-quote><p>The 95% in Line 92 refers to the variant containing N103S/G106L mutations as seen in Figure 1C. The high-throughput sequencing approach did not include residue 171, so the presence of the T171A mutation in combination with fusion loop mutations cannot be determined. However, the E171A mutation was included in the infectious clone for D2-FL and D2-FLM. The text has been modified to clarify this confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors discuss the potential of the D2-FL or D2-FLM virus as a potential vaccine platform in the abstract, introduction, and conclusion. This is a good idea, but the authors provide no evidence of feasibility in this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>The ultimate goal to engineer a viable DENV with distinct FL antigenic epitope is for it use as a cost-effective, live attenuated vaccine. As this is the rationale for the study, we introduce the concept throughout the manuscript. The current study demonstrated the possibility to mutate a novel fusion loop motif in DENV and provided evidence to show the favorable antigenic properties of D2-FLM. We agree with the reviewer that definitive work in animal to show vaccine efficacy need to be done and are currently undergoing. To avoid misleading our audience, we tone down the emphasis of vaccine use in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 150-153: Figure 3A demonstrates that the FL-specific antibodies broadly do not neutralize the mutant viruses.

The assumption that both our manuscript and others have drawn was that Abs that are cross-reactive and weakly neutralizing are more prone for ADE. As discussed, other groups have attempted to mutate the FL from recombinant E protein to achieve similar goal to remove the fusion loop epitope to reduce ADE. We have re-written the sentence in the followings:</p><p>“As FL and prM targeting Abs are the major species demonstrated to cause ADE in vitro, we and others hypothesized these Abs are responsible for ADE-driven negative outcomes after primary infection and vaccination,10–12,32 we propose that genetic ablation of the FL and prM epitopes in vaccine strains will minimize the production of these subclasses of Abs responsible for undesirable vaccine responses. Indeed, covalently locked E-dimers and E-dimers with FL mutations have been engineered as potential subunit vaccines that reduce the availability of the FL, thereby reducing the production of FL Abs.33–36”</p></body></sub-article></article>
