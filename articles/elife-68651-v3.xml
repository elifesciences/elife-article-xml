In isolated nervous system preparations of <italic>Aplysia</italic>, we have found that irregularly expressed cycles of motor output underlying food-seeking behavior arise from regular membrane potential oscillations of varying magnitude in an identified pair of interneurons (B63) in the bilateral buccal ganglia. This rhythmic signal, which is specific to the B63 cells, is generated by organelle-derived intracellular calcium fluxes that activate voltage-independent plasma membrane channels. The resulting voltage oscillation spreads throughout a subset of gap junction-coupled buccal network neurons and by triggering plateau potential-mediated bursts in B63, can initiate motor output driving food-seeking action. Thus, an atypical neuronal pacemaker mechanism, based on rhythmic intracellular calcium store release and intercellular propagation, can act as an autonomous intrinsic releaser for the occurrence of a motivated behavior.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pacemaker</kwd><kwd>central pattern generator</kwd><kwd>Aplysia</kwd><kwd>feeding behavior</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-13-BV5-0014-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nargeot</surname><given-names>Romuald</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-Idex-03-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bédécarrats</surname><given-names>Alexis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An atypical neuronal pacemaker mechanism triggers feeding motor pattern in <italic>Aplysia.</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Motivated behaviors, such as feeding or sexual activity, are triggered by an interplay between impulsive signals originating within the central nervous system (CNS), peripheral stimuli such as sensory cues, and the positive or negative consequences of an act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balleine, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Berridge, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Berridge, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Dickinson and Balleine, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Fujimoto et al., 2019</xref>). This combination of flexible extrinsic and intrinsic neural releasers determines both the likelihood of occurrence and the selection of action patterns, which in turn imparts irregularity to the expressed goal-directed behavior. However, depending on sensory experience motivated behaviors can be transformed from variable to regular, rhythmically repeating action patterns that lead to the expression of habits, routines, or compulsive behaviors. The production of such stereotyped repetitive behavior, often reinforced by associative learning processes, is considered to become more strongly dependent upon an automatic internally arising drive and less sensitive to the sensory consequences of the executed action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balleine, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Balleine and Dezfouli, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Everitt and Robbins, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Everitt and Robbins, 2005</xref>). Although the contribution of internal drives to the induction of motivated behavior is recognized, unanswered questions remain about their neural origin and whether the highly flexible expression of a motivated behavior relies on similar inherent neuronal processes as found for rhythmic behaviors generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Grillner and El Manira, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Marder et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Selverston, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Steuer and Guertin, 2019</xref>).</p><p>A suitable animal model for addressing such issues is the sea slug <italic>Aplysia</italic>, in which aspects of feeding behavior are generated by a well-characterized neuronal network within the buccal ganglia. In the absence of food stimuli, <italic>Aplysia</italic> spontaneously expresses food-seeking behavior, which in addition to locomotor and head-waving movements, includes buccal and radula (a tongue-like organ) biting movements emitted at highly irregular intervals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kupfermann, 1974</xref>). This spontaneous and variable behavior can be regulated by operant-reward conditioning that leads to the expression of regular and rhythmic biting movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brembs et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Costa et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Nargeot et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sieling et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, neural correlates of this motivated behavior continue to be expressed by the underlying neuronal network in the isolated buccal ganglia, thereby enabling the mechanisms responsible for autonomously driving both the irregular and regular emissions of radula movement cycles to be analyzed at the cellular and synaptic levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">McManus et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Nargeot and Simmers, 2012</xref>). Identified components of this central pattern generator (CPG) circuit, such as the electrically coupled B63, B30, B31/32 neurons, were previously found to be essential contributors to the decision-making process that drives radula motor output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Costa et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hurwitz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Jing et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Nargeot et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sieling et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Susswein and Byrne, 1988</xref>). Among these elements, the two bilateral B63 interneurons are the only cells whose spontaneous production of an action potential burst is necessary and sufficient to trigger each radula output cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Nargeot et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, deciphering the mechanisms underlying the bursting activity of these key decision neurons is critical to understanding the process of radula motor pattern expression. Although earlier modeling evidence suggested that B63 bursting might rely on the cell’s electrical synapses with other circuit neurons that possess a plateau potential-generating capability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Susswein et al., 2002</xref>), the actual triggering process for spontaneous B63 bursts and consequently the irregular emission of buccal CPG output remains unknown. Our findings reported here indicate that such motor pattern genesis relies on a voltage-insensitive pacemaker mechanism that at least partly derives from organelle-driven fluxes in intracellular calcium in this pair of neurons themselves.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Motor output responsible for radula biting behavior, which in the absence of any food stimulation consists of irregularly recurring cycles of radula protraction, closure and retraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), continues to be expressed by identified CPG circuitry in isolated buccal ganglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and can be recorded from the corresponding buccal motor nerves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Individual radula bites are instigated by synchronous impulse burst activity in the two bilateral, electrically coupled B63 interneurons that via electrical and chemical synapses with their ipsi- and contralateral buccal network partners, are able to trigger the two-phase buccal motor pattern (BMP) for a bite cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hurwitz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Nargeot et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Nargeot et al., 2009</xref>). This essential role played by B63 is partly mediated by sustained, large amplitude membrane depolarizations that activate high-frequency bursts of action potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Nargeot et al., 2009</xref>). Consistent with these underlying depolarizations arising from a bistable membrane property (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Russell and Hartline, 1978</xref>), a brief intracellular injection of depolarizing current into an otherwise silent B63 neuron can trigger a depolarizing plateau and accompanying burst discharge that far outlasts the initiating stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The stimulated B63 in turn activates a similar burst-generating depolarization in the contralateral B63 cell and elicits a single BMP by the buccal CPG network.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Aplysia</italic>’s spontaneous radula biting behavior and underlying motor pattern generation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In vivo food-seeking behavior.

Such recordings (episodes of &gt;10 min per cell) revealed that B63’s membrane potential underwent continuous depolarizing fluctuations over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>), many of which remained below threshold for action and plateau potential generation. Others of these low-amplitude depolarizations elicited isolated action potentials without a plateau depolarization, whereas the remainders were associated with the production of a plateau potential and the expression of a BMP. Consequently, B63’s plateau potentials and fictive bite cycles were spontaneously generated at irregular time intervals ranging from tens of seconds to several minutes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Periodicities in B63’s spontaneous bioelectrical behavior.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A 10 min recording excerpt of radula BMP genesis (black dots) in an in vitro buccal ganglion preparation showing associated spontaneous fluctuations in membrane potential of an intracellularly recorded B63 neuron.

To assess this possibility, Fourier (spectral) analysis (see Materials and methods) was applied to 10 min excerpts of the 26 B63 cell recordings. As seen in the spectral density periodogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) for the B63 neuron illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, the cell’s spontaneous membrane potential changes decomposed into two distinct periodicities with peaks at 61 s and 144 s, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, upper panel; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Moreover, a mathematical reconstruction based on these dominant periods showed that the slower waveform was correlated with the largest plateau depolarizations and the production of BMPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In contrast, the faster waveform was timed with virtually all membrane voltage changes, including the subthreshold fluctuations and events associated with isolated action potentials or plateau potential-driven bursts.</p><p>The faster of the two periodicities (mean ± CI95, 58 ± 5 s) varied relatively little between different preparations, as evidenced by the sharper spectral density peak in the averaged periodogram for all 26 buccal preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lower panel; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). In contrast, the broader peak of the slower rhythm (mean ± CI95, 146 ± 23 s) was indicative of the wide variability in occurrence of plateau potentials over time and between preparations. Moreover, for both rhythms, the considerable variability in their power spectral magnitudes (1441 ± 765 mV².s, 1524 ± 670 mV².s; mean ± CI95%, respectively) was attributable to the large amplitude variations between spontaneous membrane depolarizations that succeeded or failed to trigger plateau potentials in the different preparations (also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>To further characterize the temporal nature of B63’s faster oscillatory rhythm, spectral analysis was performed on cells (N = 14) that did not produce plateau potentials and resultant BMPs throughout 10 min recording sequences. Such non-plateauing neurons continued to express repetitive, now uniquely sub-threshold, membrane depolarizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) that again were clearly rhythmic as revealed by the single dominant peak both in individual (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, top) and averaged periodograms of the 14 recorded neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, bottom; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Moreover, the mean period (± CI95%) of this solitary rhythm (69 ± 7 s) was within a range equivalent to that of the faster oscillatory waveform found in B63 neurons that additionally expressed plateau potentials (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and B</xref>). Although the magnitude of the remaining subthreshold rhythm varied over time and between preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), as also evidenced by waveform reconstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), it had a much smaller amplitude than the corresponding waveform in plateau-expressing cells.</p><p>Altogether, these results show that B63’s spontaneous bioelectrical behavior includes a rhythmic depolarizing signal that can remain below threshold for neuronal excitability or, in an apparently random manner, can lead to action and plateau potential production. However, despite their irregularity, the expression of plateau potentials, and resultant BMPs, is also inscribed with a periodicity, albeit considerably slower and more variable than the underlying oscillation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The voltage oscillation is endogenous to B63 and drives plateauing</title><p>In principle, the low amplitude oscillation of the B63 neurons could originate extrinsically from a presynaptic source, or derive intrinsically from a rhythmogenic property inherent to the neurons itself. Although no other buccal ganglia cell has been found to provide such a synaptic drive, we distinguished between these two possibilities by recording B63 cells in isolated preparations in which chemical synapses were blocked by bath perfusion of a modified saline containing a low calcium concentration (3 mM) and 10 mM cobalt, a nonspecific calcium channel blocker.</p><p>The application of such ‘Low Ca+Co’ saline soon induced a prolonged depolarization of recorded B63 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), then after ca. 20 min, which was necessary to fully block chemical synapses - as confirmed by the suppression of the excitatory synapse between B63 and a contralateral B31 neuron (data not shown) - the membrane potential repolarized to its initial level. Significantly, these neurons thereafter continued spontaneously to express a low-amplitude oscillation for &gt; 1.5 hr, although its magnitude gradually decreased over time (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As in normal saline conditions, the cyclic depolarizations were either sub- or supra-threshold for spike generation, or at irregular intervals, were associated with sustained plateau-like depolarizations and high-frequency bursts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Significantly, the continued expression of this burst-generating capability under functional synaptic isolation confirmed that the underlying plateau potentials, as suggested by evidence reported above (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), arose from an endogenous membrane property of the B63 neurons themselves. It also is noteworthy that in Low Ca+Co saline, due to the resultant suppression of burst-terminating inhibitory synaptic input from buccal neurons of the retraction generator (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), B63’s plateau potentials still had variable durations, but overall lasted longer than in normal saline (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>B63’s voltage oscillations in the absence of functional chemical synapses.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Membrane potential fluctuations and plateauing in a recorded B63 neuron immediately before and during onset of bath-applied Low Ca+Co saline (horizontal blue line) to block chemical synapses in the buccal CPG network.

The periodograms and corresponding waveform reconstructions indicated that the slowest oscillation (mean period ± CI95%: 274 ± 61 s) of large magnitude (mean spectral density ± CI95%: 10214 ± 3764 mV².s) was mainly associated with the expression of plateau potentials. The fastest oscillation (mean period ± CI95%: 104 ± 12 s) of smaller amplitude (mean spectral density ± CI95%: 4679 ± 2699 mV².s) corresponded to rhythmic depolarizations that remained subthreshold, or were associated either with low frequency spiking or plateau driven bursts. As found in unblocked ganglia, this faster periodicity was more clearly evident when plateauing was absent: in 10 of the 15 buccal ganglia, B63 failed to produce plateaus during at least 10 min of analyzed recording excerpts, although these neurons continued to spontaneously express a rhythmic subthreshold oscillation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>).

Furthermore, inspection of the superimposed reconstructions of these oscillations under Low Ca+Co (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), as in ASW (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), indicated that the onset of each plateau potential was invariably associated with a depolarizing phase of the faster oscillation, suggesting that the latter membrane voltage signal might be responsible for triggering the former.</p><p>This initiating process was further indicated by comparing the kinetics of B63’s spontaneous voltage changes during subthreshold cycles of oscillation with those associated with plateaus. From recordings under both synaptic blockade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>) or normal saline conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), the superposition of single cycles with and without plateau potential occurrences indicated that the relatively fast rising phases of the two events shared similar trajectories. In the absence of a plateau potential, this initial depolarization could trigger large amplitude impulse firing, or when a plateau occurred, it emerged as an additional and sustained (lasting tens of seconds) depolarization of 20–30 mV that in turn elicited a high frequency burst of low amplitude action potentials. The relationship between the voltage oscillation and plateauing in both Low Ca+Co and ASW conditions was quantified by phase plane analysis, which enables visualizing the voltage trajectory of neuronal oscillatory activity independent of time. To this end, recordings from B63 were low pass filtered to remove action potentials, then membrane voltage was plotted against the first derivative dV/dt, which is proportional to the net membrane ionic current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>).

Subsequently, depending on the membrane potential reached at the end of this initial phase, the level of which varied considerably from one cycle to another, the trajectories bifurcated to give rise either to the large and stereotyped voltage changes of plateau potentials, or if subthreshold, immediately spiraled back to the baseline potential.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>B63’s voltage oscillation triggers plateau potentials.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Intracellular recording of a B63 neuron under chemical synapse blockade during an excerpt in which each spontaneous voltage oscillation was associated (first two cycles) or not (last two cycles) with the expression of plateau potentials.

Presumably, this was due to the membrane potential shifting relative to the reversal potential of the depolarizing inward currents producing the oscillation (see below).

To test this likelihood, we examined two groups of six isolated buccal ganglia that were all initially bathed in Low Ca+Co saline to block chemical synapses.

By contrast, its slow decline in the absence of extracellular calcium is not consistent with a primary role of transmembrane calcium influxes in oscillation genesis per se. Rather, although necessary for oscillation, calcium may act in an underlying regulatory process involving the dynamics of intracellular calcium and its control by intracellular stores, and that this signal is temporarily preserved after the cation’s extracellular removal as the store calcium gradually runs down until depletion.</p><p>The main organelles that regulate intracellular calcium concentration are the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) whose membrane carries calcium channels, the calcium-ATPase reuptake pump (SERCA) and calcium release channels (the inositol triphosphate (IP3) and ryanodine (Ry) receptors), and mitochondria that act in energy supply as well as calcium sequestration and release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Groten et al., 2013</xref>). To test the implication of ER and mitochondrial calcium in B63’s voltage oscillation, isolated buccal ganglia (N = 6) were bathed in Low Ca+Co saline before and after addition of 20 µM CPA, a selective inhibitor of SERCA (see Materials and methods). In a second group of ganglia, (N = 6), the same protocol was used, but with the addition of 20 µM FCCP, an oxidative phosphorylation uncoupling agent that leads to calcium release from mitochondrial stores.

Depletion of mitochondrial calcium (induced by FCCP) or of ER calcium by an impairment of reuptake pumps (by CPA) would be expected to block this dynamic, leading to a rise in intracellular calcium levels and a resultant tonic cell membrane depolarization, which is precisely what we observed in the experiments reported above (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A,C</xref>).</p><p>To further establish the ER’s involvement in B63’s voltage oscillation, a final series of experiments were conducted in which we assessed the effects of blocking the membrane calcium channels of the organelles themselves. This was achieved by pressure injecting heparin (20 mg/ml), a well-known non-permeable IP3 receptor antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bezin et al., 2008</xref>), into the somata of either bilateral pairs of B63 neurons, or their two B31 network partners.

These findings were further supported by spectral analysis of recording excerpts from B63 cells in the two groups of preparations after bilateral B31 (N = 4) or B63 (N = 5) heparin injection. Recorded B63 neurons continued to express a distinct voltage oscillation with a mean period of 67 ± 3.2 s when heparin was injected into the two B31 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig10sdata1">Figure 10—source data 1</xref>), but this dominant oscillation disappeared with heparin’s presence in the B63 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig10sdata1">Figure 10—source data 1</xref>).

Our findings indicate that this highly irregular motivated act arises from an atypical pacemaker property of a homologous pair of decision-making interneurons belonging to the animal’s buccal feeding network. The pacemaker signal does not derive from an oscillatory mechanism based on voltage-dependent ionic currents, but rather depends on a cyclic release/reuptake of calcium from intracellular stores acting on voltage-insensitive membrane channels. The resultant oscillation in membrane potential, which spreads to gap junction-coupled network partners, is blocked by an IP3 receptor antagonist injected selectively into the two decision neurons, indicating that the command process for the oscillation originates, at least predominantly, in these specific cells. The low amplitude oscillation is spontaneously expressed with a regular period but a varying magnitude. Depending on the membrane potential reached during the depolarizing phase of a given oscillation cycle, a prolonged plateau and accompanying spike burst may be initiated, which in turn elicits network output for a cycle of food-seeking movement. The calcium dynamic in two key circuit neurons thus provides a continuous rhythmic carrier signal from which burst-generating plateau potentials necessary for behavioral action can sporadically arise.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Intracellular calcium oscillation as a neuronal pacemaker mechanism</title><p>The endogenous oscillatory capability of invertebrate and vertebrate neuronal pacemakers is mainly attributed to sets of plasma membrane ion channels whose specific functional properties allow the production of cyclic membrane depolarization/repolarization and associated impulse bursting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Benson, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brocard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Calabrese, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Chevalier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Golowasch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Harris-Warrick, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Selverston, 2010</xref>). Although this pacemaker mechanism can be regulated by second-messenger cascades and cytosolic calcium released from intracellular stores, its expression relies essentially on the voltage-sensitivity of the membrane channels themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Butera et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Canavier et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kadiri et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Liu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Yu et al., 2004</xref>).

Such pump-driven oscillations require tonic cellular activation or disinhibition and are not blocked by extracellular calcium removal or Na channel blockers such as TTX. Finally, non-excitable glial cells can contribute to the expression of rhythmic electrical activity in neighboring neurons via their regulatory effect on the surrounding ionic (including extracellular calcium) and chemical environment or by direct neuron-glia interactions through gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alvarez-Maubecin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Deitmer et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Morquette et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>An increasing body of evidence from studies on endocrine, muscle and non-excitable tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Fridlyand et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Vinogradova et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>), but also in early developing neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Gu et al., 1994</xref>), has indicated that a slow oscillatory cell signal with cycle periods of seconds to several minutes can be generated spontaneously by organelle-derived fluctuations in intracellular calcium concentration. Such a rhythmic calcium dynamic, involving notably the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, may be a source of plasma membrane voltage oscillation without the participation of voltage-sensitive ion channels. Specifically, the oscillation arises from a periodic accumulation/removal of cytoplasmic calcium, principally by IP3 and Ry receptor-mediated calcium efflux and ATP-dependent pump-mediated influx across the store membrane, which in turn is translated into a voltage signal by an activation of calcium-sensitive channels at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Fridlyand et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hickey et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">van Helden et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Vinogradova et al., 2005</xref>). Glial cells can also express such intracellular calcium oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Deitmer et al., 1998</xref>). Although in most cases these require specific inducing stimuli, such as neuronal activity, the presence of an excitatory transmitter or mechanical stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Charles et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Cornell-Bell et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Morquette et al., 2015</xref>), spontaneous calcium oscillations in glia have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wang et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In a corresponding and novel manner for a neuronal system, our present data indicate that an intracellular calcium oscillation arising from organelle calcium release and reuptake in two specific neurons is responsible for the spontaneous low-amplitude voltage oscillation in these cells and their gap junction-coupled network partners: (1) the voltage oscillation originating in B63, which gives rise to a delayed and smaller oscillation in coupled neurons, is not only suppressed with pharmacological treatments that block SERCA pumps or disrupt energy production and calcium storage by mitochondria, but is also inhibited by the specific intracellular presence of an IP3 receptor antagonist in these two neurons; (2) experimental manipulation of the cell’s membrane potential over voltage ranges where most voltage-dependent channels would be expected to be altered had no effect on either the occurrence or frequency of this oscillation, thus excluding a possible contribution of voltage-dependent channels to oscillation genesis. Nevertheless, such imposed voltage changes modified the amplitude of B63’s ongoing oscillation, as expected by changes in ion fluxes through the manipulated cell’s membrane channels; (3) at variance with a possible essential contribution of plasma membrane sodium or calcium pumps, the voltage oscillation was suppressed in TTX-containing saline and its magnitude increased, rather than decreased, as would be expected with low extracellular calcium concentrations. Presumably, the primary intracellular calcium dynamic in B63 neurons drives plasma membrane voltage oscillation by activating calcium-sensitive and voltage-insensitive sodium or other cation channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hickey et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kadiri et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kramer and Zucker, 1985</xref>).</p><p>The organelle calcium release and resulting voltage oscillation could be localized to a neuronal compartment, such as the junctional synapses or neuropile where a close proximity between ER, mitochondria, and plasma membrane is likely to exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Thompson et al., 1976</xref>), but which is remote from the soma compartment where plateau potentials occur. In this scheme, local calcium release and IP3/calcium-dependent amplification/propagation along the ER membrane could activate nearby plasma membrane conductances at this soma distant site and generate a voltage oscillation that is passively backpropagated to the cell body where it can trigger plateau potentials. Such spatially separate loci for intracellular calcium oscillation and plateau potential production in turn provides a plausible explanation for several of our experimental observations, including: (1) the ability of local organelle calcium release to produce a membrane potential oscillation of B63, despite the presumed presence of strong cytoplasmic calcium buffering mechanisms; (2) the near synchronous expression of the voltage oscillation, but not the somatic plateau potentials, throughout B63’s gap junction-coupled cell partners; and (3) the inability of experimental soma depolarization or spontaneous plateau potentials and resulting somatic calcium influxes to modify or reset the remotely-produced calcium oscillation.</p><p>This organelle-driven oscillatory property of B63 does not exclude a possible contribution of a neuron-glia interplay in the generation of the voltage oscillation and/or its propagation through the buccal network, especially since neurons and glia can reciprocally modify their intercellular ionic environment or intracellular content via gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alvarez-Maubecin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Deitmer et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Goldstein et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Keicher et al., 1991</xref>).

Indeed, in contrast to the organelle-derived mechanism reported here, where B63 was behaving spontaneously in the absence of any experimental stimulation, this cell also possesses an oscillatory bursting capability that does rely on voltage-dependent ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Nargeot et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Nargeot et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sieling et al., 2014</xref>). However, this latter mechanism is activated only when the cell is conveyed to more depolarized levels by sensory-induced changes in excitability or in response to direct current injection. This state-dependent expression of two different burst-generating processes by the B63 neuron is therefore reminiscent of the multiple rhythmogenic ionic mechanisms reported in other oscillatory neurons, where each mechanism’s participation varies according to different stimulus conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Harris-Warrick and Flamm, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kadiri et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Peña et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Variability in motor pattern emission with a periodic pacemaker mechanism</title><p>Irregularity in the expression of motor activity is a fundamental feature of motivated or goal-directed exploratory behaviors, including <italic>Aplysia’s</italic> food-seeking movements, when animals are faced with an uncertain surrounding environment.

In this context, random processes such as stochastic variations in the activation of intrinsic and voltage-dependent properties of individual neurons and synaptic noise can be sources of variability in motor output expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Carroll and Ramirez, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Darshan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Melanson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Nargeot et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, modeling evidence has suggested that an aperiodicity in slow cytosolic calcium dynamics can lead to irregular voltage oscillations in otherwise regularly bursting CPG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Falcke et al., 2000</xref>). In contrast, our experimental data indicate that spontaneous and irregular motor pattern genesis can derive from a cell-specific pacemaker mechanism involving an intracellular calcium dynamic that itself is strictly periodic, but where randomness arises from cycle-to-cycle variations in the amplitude of the rhythmic membrane depolarizations it produces. By oscillating close to the threshold for voltage-dependent plateau potential genesis required for CPG circuit output, these low-amplitude depolarizations thereby determine the variability with which <italic>Aplysia’s</italic> exploratory movements are expressed.

In addition to such processes, irregular magnitude fluctuations in the voltage oscillation of the B63 neurons could also partly result from plateau potential production in the different electrically coupled neurons of the buccal CPG network. Presumably, because these plateaus are generated in the soma, far from the intercellular junctions, they are not phase-coupled in the different network neurons, producing only weak depolarizations in post-junctional cell partners. Nevertheless, these uncoordinated plateau-related depolarizations in different cells would be sufficient to participate in randomly modifying the amplitude of the ongoing voltage oscillation in the B63 neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Propagation of pacemaker activity amongst gap junction-connected neurons</title><p>It is well known that gap junction-mediated electrical coupling promotes the synchronization of pacemaker neuron bursting in CPG networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Leznik and Llinás, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Marder, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Nadim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sasaki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Soto-Treviño et al., 2005</xref>), and is similarly involved in <italic>Aplysia’s</italic> buccal feeding circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sieling et al., 2014</xref>).

Rather, calcium wave propagation through gap junctions is most likely mediated by a diffusion of IP3 and its chain activation of IP3/Ry receptors and calcium release within adjacent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Harootunian et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Miyazaki et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Takeuchi et al., 2020</xref>).

First, the magnitude of B63’s voltage oscillation, which is presumably proportional to the intracellular calcium signal, was consistently stronger than in any other network cells, such as B30, B31, and B65, despite their similar membrane input resistances. Second, the voltage oscillation in B63 preceded that recorded in these other cells by several seconds, which is compatible with a slower propagation (~70 µm/s) of the underlying calcium oscillatory signal by a metabolic process rather than by direct electrical transmission of the voltage oscillation itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Benninger et al., 2008</xref>). Third, the intracellular injection of the IP3 receptor antagonist heparin into B63, but not into B31, suppressed the voltage oscillation in both neurons, thus indicating that its origin and intercellular propagation is selectively dependent on IP3 signaling in B63. These findings also argue against the possibility that the oscillation occurring throughout the buccal CPG circuit is a network property that emerges from electrical coupling between equivalently-active neurons, but rather, further underline the crucial pacemaker role played by B63 in buccal network operation. However, because our experiments were mainly conducted with all the network’s chemical synapses blocked, we were unable to establish whether B63’s endogenous oscillatory and plateau properties are alone sufficient in the decision process for BMP genesis. Nevertheless, in normal saline conditions with the network remaining functionally intact, in contrast to all other identified circuit cells, the B63 neuron pair are the only elements found to be necessary and sufficient for triggering motor pattern expression and resultant food-seeking movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hurwitz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Nargeot et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, this essential leading role persists after appetitive operant conditioning-when the network’s junctional conductances are strengthened and the transition from irregular to rhythmic BMP genesis occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Nargeot et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Nargeot and Simmers, 2012</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, without excluding the involvement of other cellular mechanisms, our study shows that in the absence of extrinsic stimulation, the CPG network output for <italic>Aplysia’s</italic> food-seeking behavior can arise from a combination of spontaneous intracellular calcium dynamics in two decision neurons and IP3-dependent circuit-wide metabolic propagation. Although autonomously bursting neurons may employ intracellular stores as a source of calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kadiri et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Levy, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Scholz et al., 1988</xref>), in all cases, the mobilization of store calcium, by interacting with calcium-activated membrane channels, is thought to regulate the voltage dynamics of ongoing bursting behavior.

Experiments are now required to determine whether B63’s intracellular calcium handling is regulated by associative learning when hungry <italic>Aplysia</italic> switches its impulsive and irregular food-seeking movements to a rhythmic compulsive-like act as found in more complex organisms.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Carbonyl cyanide 4- (trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP)</td><td>Merck-Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>C2920</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Cyclopianozic acid (CPA)</td><td>Merck-Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>C1530</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)</td><td>Merck-Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>D5879</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Ethylene glycol-bis (2-aminoethylether)-N, N, N ′, N′-tetraacetic acid (EGTA)</td><td>Merck-Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>E4378</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Fast green</td><td>Merck-Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>F7252</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Heparin sodium salt</td><td>Tocris</td><td>2812</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Tetrodotoxin (TTX)</td><td>Tocris</td><td>1069</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>R</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cran.r-project.org/">https://cran.r-project.org/</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>PMCMRplus</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PMCMRplus/index.html">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PMCMRplus/index.html</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>WaveletComp</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/WaveletComp/index.html">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/WaveletComp/index.html</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Adult <italic>Aplysia californica</italic> (purchased from the University of Florida, Florida), and <italic>A. fasciata</italic> (caught locally in the Bassin d'Arcachon, France) were used in the experiments.

The membrane voltage recordings were initially smoothed using the Spike 2 ‘Smooth’ filter with a time constant of 500 ms to suppress signals of frequencies higher than those within the desired band-width and down-sampled at 1 Hz in order to decrease computation time. The resulting power spectral density periodograms were then used to identify oscillation periods of peak magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The periodograms were computed from the FFT frequency spectrograms by converting the frequency band (in Hz) to its reciprocal, period (in secs), to facilitate discerning the temporal correspondence between these plots and the relatively slow (from secs to mins) spontaneous membrane voltage fluctuations occurring in the raw recordings. Reconstruction of the sinusoidal waveforms corresponding to dominant periods and the phase-relationships between signals from neuron pairs were computed from Wavelet decomposition using the R-CRAN ‘WaveletComp’ package for the built-in analysis of univariate and bivariate time series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Roesch and Schmidbauer, 2018</xref>). Averaged periodograms represent means +/- 95% confidence interval (CI95%) of the individual periodograms.

One-sample comparisons to a theoretical value (0 s.) were performed using the two-tailed one-sample Wilcoxon signed rank test (V<sub>0</sub> statistic). Within-group comparisons of two datasets were carried out using the two-tailed Wilcoxon signed rank test (V statistic). Between-group comparisons of two independent groups were conducted using the two-tailed Mann-Whitney test (W statistic). The application of these non-parametric statistical tests to small datasets was justified by the failure to satisfy assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity with high statistical powers. Statistical analyses were performed using the R-CRAN ‘Base’ and ‘PMCMRplus’ packages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Pohlert, 2019</xref>). Similar results were obtained with analyses performed both with and without outlier values, and all statistics reported in the text and figures were computed without data removal.

The reviewers provide useful feedback for revision in the Recommendations for the Authors. There are two major points that should be thoroughly addressed.</p><p>1. A main concern was the question of where the plateau potentials that drive network activity are being generated. The references that are cited don't support the claims made about B63. It is however possible that the authors can present other data or cite other work to support their claim. Even if they can't, there is little doubt that activity in B63 is important for initiating activity in the feeding CPG. As a result, what drives the phasic depolarization in B63 is also of interest (even if the network driving plateau potentials are subsequently generated in B31/32). See Major comment #1 from Reviewer 3.</p><p>2. Please remove the Choline for Na<sup>+</sup> substitution experiments from the manuscript, See major comment #6 of Reviewer 2.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The labeling of the traces was inconsistent. For example, in Figure 6A, B63r and B63l are above their respective traces, but in Figure 6B, the labels are below their traces. A standard position of the label either above, below, or preferably to the left of the trace should be adopted.</p><p>In the electrical coupling circuits, it is common to show a resistor symbol to indicate electrical coupling. The single diagonal swipe is not a standard representation. Also, just for simplicity, put B63r to the right of B63l in A and in the plot in D.</p><p>Figure 6C shows an extracellular recording of B8r, which is not sufficient to demonstrate an absence of subthreshold oscillations.</p><p>Figure 7C, Phase lag cannot be represented in seconds. Phase is unit-less. Seconds would indicate latency.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) With respect to the non-voltage dependence of the small oscillation, note more strongly that cell membrane potential, changed either by current injection or by spontaneous plateau potentials, does not re-set the oscillation. Refer to Figure 6A, Suppl. Figure 1, and Suppl. Figure 4 in doing so.</p><p>2) In Figure 5 the authors demonstrate that mean small oscillation amplitude varies with membrane potential, becoming smaller with depolarization and larger with hyperpolarization. This suggests that the cell membrane channels opened by the intracellular mechanism carry Na or Ca. However, the authors do not provide quantitative measurements and summaries of the changes in this amplitude. Please do so as is so admirably done for the other types of data in the manuscript.</p><p>3) I do not understand the logic of lines 315-324 in the manuscript, the portion arguing that the fact that the B63 small oscillation cycle is out of phase with that of other buccal CPG neurons, e.g., B31 (the text associated with Figure 7), indicates the oscillation is not an emergent network property. That two parts of an network oscillate out of phase is not, to my mind, evidence that the oscillations are not an emergent network property. A classic counter-example is half-center oscillation, which in some instantiations generates 180º out-of-phase oscillations in the two half-centers, but in which the oscillation is clearly a network-emergent property. That the oscillations originate in the B63 cell pair, and are passively transmitted to the other neurons is instead best demonstrated by the data in Figure 10. I would move this text to this figure. As to some of the (presumably) follower neurons being out of phase, this could be explained by the delays in cell-to-cell communication the authors present in the Discussion. It is unfortunate that, in the heparin experiments, the cell pairs never included recordings from the out-of-phase neurons, as such recordings would resolve whether these out-of-phase oscillations depended on B63 oscillations.</p><p>4) In the low Ca-cobalt saline used to block synaptic transmission, B63 plateau duration dramatically increases. My rough measurements from Figure 1, 2, and the first plateau in Figure 3A show plateau durations in the 10 to 40 s range. The initial low Ca-cobalt saline plateau potentials in Figure 3A are again in this duration range, but after this saline had been on for a longer time, plateau potential durations became longer (40 to 60 s in Figure 4, 1 to 2.5 min in Figure 3B, 3 to 4 min in Figure 5, and 5 min in Figure 6A). I do not believe that this large change in any way affects manuscript conclusions, but it should be pointed out as it may be of interest to workers in the membrane conductances underlying plateau potential production.</p><p>5) I do not understand the comparisons being made in lines 308-314 in the manuscript, the comparison being made between different pairs, e.g., B31//B31 vs. B31/B63. Please expand or clarify what is being compared here.</p><p>6) In the experiments in which extracellular Na and Ca concentrations are being changed, all the data in which Na was replaced by choline must be stricken from the manuscript. Thuma and Hooper [Thuma, JB, Hooper, SL (2018) Choline and NMDG directly reduce outward currents: reduced outward current when these substances replace Na<sup>+</sup> is alone not evidence of Na+-activated K<sup>+</sup> currents. J Neurophysiol 120:3217-3233. doi: 10.1152/jn.00871.2017) have shown that choline alone blocks K channels, as would be expected for tertiary or quaternary amines. In the opinion of this reviewer, the prior long use of this substitution without testing for the effects of simple choline addition is inexplicable and a dismaying example of how error can remain in science for long periods. Regardless, this error must not continue now that these direct effects have been described. In the case at hand, I agree that the effects are indeed due to the lack of Na, but the use of choline actually diminishes the intended demonstration, as the disappearance of the oscillation in choline could be due to either reduced Na or K currents. The disappearance in TTX is sufficient and unambiguous.</p><p>7) In the Discussion, I would add a paragraph about how B63 membrane potentials do not re-set the underlying oscillation. This disconnect from neuron activity is striking. One thinks of neurons as being largely electrical entities. For a process that is itself altering neuron electrical activity to not be affected by that activity seems worth commenting on.</p><p>8) Lines 542-545 in the present manuscript about cytosolic Ca buffering expressed a concern I had throughout the manuscript, the idea that Ca release from ER and mitochondria would alter global cytoplasm [Ca]. I would expect this Ca would instead form a shell around the ER and mitochondria membranes, just as Ca entry across the cell membrane forms a shell of high [Ca] under the membrane. Admittedly, in muscles Ca release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum causes a global change in muscle cell cytoplasm [Ca], but that is a highly evolved system in which that is the goal. Do the authors imagine perhaps that there is specialized ER or mitochondria located close enough to the cell membrane that Ca moves to form a shell under the cell membrane? That Ca released from the ER and mitochondria diffuses to form a shell under the cell membrane? Or that the cytoplasmic buffering system is overwhelmed? Of course, injecting positive current through an electrode with K or Na ions does depolarize the membrane, and it is presumably not the injected ions that are depolarizing the cell membrane, rather a redistribution of charge in the cytoplasm to maintain iso-voltage in it that results in the ion shell under the cell membrane being altered so as to depolarize the membrane. But these ions are not highly buffered, and I do not know the literature of whether injecting Ca through an electrode into a cell depolarizes it. Regardless, this difficulty of release of Ca from organelles embedded in a cytoplasm with a high Ca buffering capacity causing a change in potential across the cell membrane should be more fully dealt with in the Discussion. I think it is exactly the same problem they mention with the B63 oscillation being transmitted to electrically coupled cells in this part of the Discussion. Including references showing that Ca injection into a cell through an electrode causes the cell to depolarize would be sufficient.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Organelle calcium-derived voltage oscillations in pacemaker neurons drive the motor program for food-seeking behavior in <italic>Aplysia</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Paul Katz as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Scott Hooper (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>After consultation with the reviewers, it was decided that the authors should respond in the paper to the interstitial cell hypothesis that has been raised by Reviewer 1. We are all sorry that this was raised at a late stage in the review process, but we agree that it is better that the paper address the issue than to be proven wrong later. If the mechanism turns out to be a novel involvement of the interstitial cells, then the impact of the paper would be increased.</p><p>We debated about whether a mechanism involving changes in extracellular calcium concentration could account for low amplitude oscillations observed in B63. Ultimately, we decided that it was up to the authors to decide whether their data are consistent with two alternate hypotheses (release and sequestration of calcium intracellularly by organelles or extracellularly by interstitial cells) or whether they can eliminate one of these hypotheses. One consideration is whether the authors can determine the resting calcium conductance and can estimate the change in extracellular calcium concentration that would be needed to observe the small membrane potential fluctuations based on changes to the predicted calcium equilibrium potential. It would be advisable to consider looking at persistent sodium current magnitudes to get an idea of how large gCa would need to be to generate sufficient calcium current.</p><p>The interstitial cell hypothesis explains a concern that one reviewer had expressed, and that the authors now explicitly cover in the manuscript (lines 237-278), about how changing B63's membrane potential does not change the underlying oscillation in B63. If the source of the underlying oscillation were the interstitial cells, current injection into B63 would not be expected to change the oscillation, just whether the oscillation were able to trigger a burst, exactly what the data show.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The Central Conclusion as expressed in the abstract is that there is a &quot;rhythmic signal, which is endogenous and specific to the B63 cells, [and] is generated by organelle-derived intracellular calcium fluxes that activate voltage-independent plasma membrane channels.&quot;</p><p>The evidence that the oscillations derive from organelle calcium fluxes is indirect. It is possible that the calcium oscillations are arising from non-neural interstitial cells that have been shown to take up and release calcium.

That two parts of an network oscillate out of phase is not, to my mind, evidence that the oscillations are not an emergent network property. A classic counter-example is half-center oscillation, which in some instantiations generates 180º out-of-phase oscillations in the two half-centers, but in which the oscillation is clearly a network-emergent property. That the oscillations originate in the B63 cell pair, and are passively transmitted to the other neurons is instead best demonstrated by the data in Figure 10. I would move this text to this figure. As to some of the (presumably) follower neurons being out of phase, this could be explained by the delays in cell-to-cell communication the authors present in the Discussion. It is unfortunate that, in the heparin experiments, the cell pairs never included recordings from the out-of-phase neurons, as such recordings would resolve whether these out-of-phase oscillations depended on B63 oscillations.</p></disp-quote><p>We accept that the logic here was confusing, especially with the use of terminology such as ‘emergent property of a network’. Lines 320-324 of the original manuscript stating that “the relative timing and amplitude differences therefore support the conclusion that the voltage oscillation is not an equivalent emergent property of a network of electrically-coupled neurons” have been removed in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Moreover, as suggested by the reviewer, the conclusion of the heparin experiments (Lines 415-419) is now used to better make these points and states: “these results, along with the previous findings of a consistently larger amplitude and phase advance of B63’s voltage oscillation (see Figure 6), further indicated that it originates in, and is specific to, the B63 cell pair – the sole necessary and sufficient elements for triggering BMPs – and spreads presumably via gap junctional connections throughout the remaining circuit.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the low Ca-cobalt saline used to block synaptic transmission, B63 plateau duration dramatically increases. My rough measurements from Figure 1, 2, and the first plateau in Figure 3A show plateau durations in the 10 to 40 s range. The initial low Ca-cobalt saline plateau potentials in Figure 3A are again in this duration range, but after this saline had been on for a longer time, plateau potential durations became longer (40 to 60 s in Figure 4, 1 to 2.5 min in Figure 3B, 3 to 4 min in Figure 5, and 5 min in Figure 6A). I do not believe that this large change in any way affects manuscript conclusions, but it should be pointed out as it may be of interest to workers in the membrane conductances underlying plateau potential production.</p></disp-quote><p>Inspection of our recordings does not indicate that plateau potential durations increased progressively with time under application of low Ca+Co saline. However, there was often a relatively abrupt increase in plateau durations soon after perfusion onset due to the removal of synaptic inhibition from retractor generator neurons, which contributes to terminating B63 plateaus during BMP genesis. This point is now added to the revised text (Lines 181185): ”It also is noteworthy that in Low Ca+Co saline, due to the resultant suppression of burst-terminating inhibitory synaptic input from buccal neurons of the retraction generator (see Figure 1B), B63’s plateau potentials still had variable durations, but overall lasted longer than in normal saline (compare Figure 2A and Figure 6—figure supplement 1A)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) I do not understand the comparisons being made in lines 308-314 in the manuscript, the comparison being made between different pairs, e.g., B31//B31 vs. B31/B63. Please expand or clarify what is being compared here.</p></disp-quote><p>The reason for quantifying and comparing oscillation phase delays between different neuron pairs (see Figure 7; Lines 308-314 of the original manuscript) was to gain indirect access to the relative timing between pairs of cells that were not recorded simultaneously. For example, the B31/B30 neurons were not pair-wise recorded. But, the absence of a statistical difference in the phase delays between the recorded pairs B31/B63 and B30/B63 allowed deducing that the oscillations of B31 and B30 were in fact synchronous. However, since such comparisons provide only indirect evidence and manifestly confuse rather than enlighten, they have been removed from the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In the experiments in which extracellular Na and Ca concentrations are being changed, all the data in which Na was replaced by choline must be stricken from the manuscript. Thuma and Hooper [Thuma, JB, Hooper, SL (2018) Choline and NMDG directly reduce outward currents: reduced outward current when these substances replace Na<sup>+</sup> is alone not evidence of Na+-activated K<sup>+</sup> currents. J Neurophysiol 120:3217-3233. doi: 10.1152/jn.00871.2017) have shown that choline alone blocks K channels, as would be expected for tertiary or quaternary amines. In the opinion of this reviewer, the prior long use of this substitution without testing for the effects of simple choline addition is inexplicable and a dismaying example of how error can remain in science for long periods. Regardless, this error must not continue now that these direct effects have been described. In the case at hand, I agree that the effects are indeed due to the lack of Na, but the use of choline actually diminishes the intended demonstration, as the disappearance of the oscillation in choline could be due to either reduced Na or K currents. The disappearance in TTX is sufficient and unambiguous.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for passionately pointing out the unintended error of our ways with the use of choline for Na substitution. All mention and data related to the use a of 0 sodium solution containing choline have been removed from the revised manuscript (main text, Materials and methods ‘Modified salines’ section and Figure 8). Accordingly, statistical treatment of the data has been rerun with the Mann-Whitney test for comparing two independent groups (rather than the Kruskal-Wallis and post-hoc Conover tests for comparing three groups). The ‘Statistical analysis’ section in the Materials and methods section has also been modified accordingly (Lines 710-711).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In the Discussion, I would add a paragraph about how B63 membrane potentials do not re-set the underlying oscillation. This disconnect from neuron activity is striking. One thinks of neurons as being largely electrical entities. For a process that is itself altering neuron electrical activity to not be affected by that activity seems worth commenting on.</p></disp-quote><p>A new paragraph has now been added to the Discussion (Lines 485-500) in which we offer an explanation for the inability of plateau potentials or experimental manipulation of the somatic membrane potential to modify the small oscillation’s cycle period or cause resetting. This paragraph, which also relates to the following reviewer comment 8 now states: “The organelle calcium release and resulting voltage oscillation could be localized to a neuronal compartment, such as the junctional synapses or neuropile where a close proximity between ER, mitochondria, and plasma membrane is likely to exist (Thompson et al., 1976), but which is remote from the soma compartment where plateau potentials occur. In this scheme, local calcium release and IP3/calcium-dependent amplification/propagation along the ER membrane could activate nearby plasma membrane conductances at this soma distant site and generate a voltage oscillation that is passively backpropagated to the cell body where it can trigger plateau potentials. Such spatially separate loci for intracellular calcium oscillation and plateau potential production in turn provides a plausible explanation for several of our experimental observations, including: (1) the ability of local organelle calcium release to produce a membrane potential oscillation of B63, despite the presumed presence of strong cytoplasmic calcium buffering mechanisms; (2) the near synchronous expression of the voltage oscillation, but not the somatic plateau potentials, throughout B63’s gap junction-coupled cell partners; and (3) the inability of experimental soma depolarization or spontaneous plateau potentials and resulting somatic calcium influxes to modify or reset the remotely-produced calcium oscillation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Lines 542-545 in the present manuscript about cytosolic Ca buffering expressed a concern I had throughout the manuscript, the idea that Ca release from ER and mitochondria would alter global cytoplasm [Ca]. I would expect this Ca would instead form a shell around the ER and mitochondria membranes, just as Ca entry across the cell membrane forms a shell of high [Ca] under the membrane. Admittedly, in muscles Ca release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum causes a global change in muscle cell cytoplasm [Ca], but that is a highly evolved system in which that is the goal. Do the authors imagine perhaps that there is specialized ER or mitochondria located close enough to the cell membrane that Ca moves to form a shell under the cell membrane? That Ca released from the ER and mitochondria diffuses to form a shell under the cell membrane? Or that the cytoplasmic buffering system is overwhelmed? Of course, injecting positive current through an electrode with K or Na ions does depolarize the membrane, and it is presumably not the injected ions that are depolarizing the cell membrane, rather a redistribution of charge in the cytoplasm to maintain iso-voltage in it that results in the ion shell under the cell membrane being altered so as to depolarize the membrane. But these ions are not highly buffered, and I do not know the literature of whether injecting Ca through an electrode into a cell depolarizes it. Regardless, this difficulty of release of Ca from organelles embedded in a cytoplasm with a high Ca buffering capacity causing a change in potential across the cell membrane should be more fully dealt with in the Discussion. I think it is exactly the same problem they mention with the B63 oscillation being transmitted to electrically coupled cells in this part of the Discussion. Including references showing that Ca injection into a cell through an electrode causes the cell to depolarize would be sufficient.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not wish to suggest that the voltage oscillation results from a global cytoplasmic change in calcium concentration. As in many other cells, the calcium oscillation may be generated locally (e.g. in the neuropile or junctional synapses) where a close apposition between ER, mitochondria and plasma membrane may occur. At this local site the calcium oscillation may be translated into a voltage oscillation that backpropagates to the soma where plateaus are produced. As indicated in our response to preceding point 7, this hypothesis is now developed in Lines 485-500 of the revised manuscript.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>After consultation with the reviewers, it was decided that the authors should respond in the paper to the interstitial cell hypothesis that has been raised by Reviewer 1. We are all sorry that this was raised at a late stage in the review process, but we agree that it is better that the paper address the issue than to be proven wrong later. If the mechanism turns out to be a novel involvement of the interstitial cells, then the impact of the paper would be increased.</p><p>We debated about whether a mechanism involving changes in extracellular calcium concentration could account for low amplitude oscillations observed in B63. Ultimately, we decided that it was up to the authors to decide whether their data are consistent with two alternate hypotheses (release and sequestration of calcium intracellularly by organelles or extracellularly by interstitial cells) or whether they can eliminate one of these hypotheses. One consideration is whether the authors can determine the resting calcium conductance and can estimate the change in extracellular calcium concentration that would be needed to observe the small membrane potential fluctuations based on changes to the predicted calcium equilibrium potential. It would be advisable to consider looking at persistent sodium current magnitudes to get an idea of how large gCa would need to be to generate sufficient calcium current.</p><p>The interstitial cell hypothesis explains a concern that one reviewer had expressed, and that the authors now explicitly cover in the manuscript (lines 237-278), about how changing B63's membrane potential does not change the underlying oscillation in B63. If the source of the underlying oscillation were the interstitial cells, current injection into B63 would not be expected to change the oscillation, just whether the oscillation were able to trigger a burst, exactly what the data show.</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The Central Conclusion as expressed in the abstract is that there is a &quot;rhythmic signal, which is endogenous and specific to the B63 cells, [and] is generated by organelle-derived intracellular calcium fluxes that activate voltage-independent plasma membrane channels.&quot;</p><p>The evidence that the oscillations derive from organelle calcium fluxes is indirect. It is possible that the calcium oscillations are arising from non-neural interstitial cells that have been shown to take up and release calcium.
