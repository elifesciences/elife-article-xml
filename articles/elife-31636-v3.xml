In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the shade-induced de-phosphorylation of the transcription factor PIF7 (PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR 7) is the key event linking light perception to stem elongation. However, the mechanism through which phosphorylation regulates the activity of PIF7 is unclear. Here, we show that shade light induces the de-phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of PIF7. Phosphorylation-resistant site mutations in PIF7 result in increased nuclear localization and shade-induced gene expression, and consequently augment hypocotyl elongation. PIF7 interacts with 14-3-3 proteins. Blocking the interaction between PIF7 and 14-3-3 proteins or reducing the expression of 14-3-3 proteins accelerates shade-induced nuclear localization and de-phosphorylation of PIF7, and enhances the shade phenotype. By contrast, the 14-3-3 overexpressing line displays an attenuated shade phenotype. These studies demonstrate a phosphorylation-dependent translocation of PIF7 when plants are in shade and a novel mechanism involving 14-3-3 proteins, mediated by the retention of PIF7 in the cytoplasm that suppresses the shade response.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>shade avoidance syndrome</kwd><kwd>phytochrome interacting factor 7</kwd><kwd>dephosphorylation</kwd><kwd>subcellular localization</kwd><kwd>14-3-3 proteins</kwd><kwd>cytoplasmic-retention</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31470374</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Lin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31500973</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Lin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017YFA0503800</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Lin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A phosphorylation dependent translocation of PIF7 and involvement of 14-3-3 proteins reveal novel regulation mechanisms in shade signal transduction.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Because chlorophyll preferentially absorbs light in the red and blue ranges but not in the far-red range of the light spectrum, a perceived decrease in the ratio of red/far-red (R/FR) radiation, and thus in photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) of between 400 and 700 nm, provides a signal that shading by other plants is imminent. Shade-intolerant plants, such as <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, sense this reduction and initiate the shade avoidance syndrome (SAS). In the SAS, energy resources are reallocated from storage organs to stem-like organs, including hypocotyls and petioles, thereby enabling plants to initiate a rapid growth response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cole et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Casal, 2012</xref>). Prolonged shade exposure leads to reduced branching, early flowering and seed set, and reduced yield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ballaré, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Franklin and Whitelam, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Procko et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The R/FR-absorbing photoreceptor phytochrome B (phyB) plays the most dominant role during the SAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Reed et al., 1993</xref>). In an open environment under sunlight (where the ratio of R/FR is about 1.2–1.5), most of the phyB is in the far-red-absorbing (Pfr) active form and moves to the nucleus, where it interacts with basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins known as PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTORS (PIFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duek and Fankhauser, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Leivar and Quail, 2011</xref>). The photoactivation of phyB induces the rapid phosphorylation of PIF1/3/4/5 prior to their degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Sady et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shen et al., 2007</xref>), although the short half-lives of these PIFs impedes the tracing of the phosphorylated forms. When plants are in the shade, phyB is mostly in the inactive red-absorbing (Pr) cytosolic form, which facilitates the accumulation of PIFs and restricts the growth of the hypocotyl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lorrain et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Leivar and Quail, 2011</xref>).</p><p>PIF7 is a major regulator of the shade response, as shown by the severe shade-defective phenotype of <italic>pif7</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Wit et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mizuno et al., 2015</xref>). PIF7 is less vulnerable than PIF1/3/4/5 to the rapid turnover of induced by the Pfr form of phyB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Leivar et al., 2008</xref>). Instead, the activity of PIF7 is controlled by rapid de-phosphorylation in response to shade, which leads to its binding to G-boxes in the promoters of auxin biosynthesis genes, causing an increase in auxin levels and a rapid growth response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The 14-3-3 proteins are highly conserved in all eukaryotes. Research in recent years has revealed several putative 14-3-3 targets in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jaspert et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yoon and Kieber, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). These studies have revealed that 14-3-3 proteins can interact with the phosphorylated forms of their client proteins in response to certain signals, and that this binding finalizes the signaling event by enabling a change in the subcellular localization, protein stability or intrinsic enzymatic activity of the client, or by promoting an association between the client and other proteins. The cellular 14-3-3 'pool' enables these proteins to react to altered signaling cues in an immediate and precise way through dynamic interactions with their clients.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate a shade induction of the nuclear localization of dephosphorylated PIF7 and a role for the 14-3-3 proteins in the cytoplasmic retention of PIF7 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Our work reveals a novel mechanism that rapidly switches PIF7 function in response to light conditions and the role of 14-3-3 proteins in SAS.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Shade induces the rapid nuclear localization of PIF7</title><p>To monitor the cellular localization of PIF7, we generated 35S::<italic>GFP-PIF7</italic> transgenic plants and analyzed the GFP signal in white-light-grown seedlings before and after shade treatment.

We also mutated S139 and S141 to aspartic acid residues to mimic phosphorylation (PIF7[2D]: S139D S141D) (PIF7[5D]: S78D S80D S125D S139D S141D) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>).</p><p>In yeast, PIF7(2A) showed decreased interaction with 14-3-3λ/κ proteins and PIF7(2D) displayed a level of interaction that was similar to that of wildtype PIF7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). In tobacco leaves, the weak BiFC signals from PIF7(2A) and PIF7△ mainly occurred in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), which is probably due to the nuclear localization of PIF7(2A) and PIF7△ or to an attenuated interaction with 14-3-3 λ/κ proteins. When all five serine residues were mutated (PIF7[5A]), fluorescence was largely absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that these serine residues are critical for binding to 14-3-3 proteins.

Several phosphorylation sites have been identified in PIF1/3/4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ni et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernardo-García et al., 2014</xref>). These phosphorylation events lead to apparent ubiquitylation and degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Sady et al., 2006</xref>). In sustained light, PIF1/3/4/5 are maintained at a relatively low steady-state level. After subsequent exposure to shade light, new protein synthesis is required for the accumulation of these PIF proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lorrain et al., 2008</xref>). PIF7, however, is a light-stable bHLH factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Leivar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, at least two phosphorylation sites (S139 and S141) in PIF7 are found to be critical for its activity and for hypocotyl elongation. These sites also mediate the binding of PIF7 with 14-3-3 λ and κ. Shade-induced nuclear accumulation of PIF7 and the constitutive nuclear localization of PIF7(2A) mutants in transgenic plants suggest that the interaction of 14-3-3 proteins and PIF7 is involved in determining the subcellular distribution of PIF7. Although there was a lack of interaction in the BiFC and pull-down assays, S-to-D substitution does enhance the interaction between 14-3-3 proteins and PIF7 in vivo. Moreover, PIF7(2D)-Flash was mainly localized in cytoplasm and was unable to complement the shade-defective gene expression and phenotype of <italic>pif7-1</italic>, which functionally reflects the phosphorylation defects in the in vivo system. The phosphorylation state of PIF7 determines its localization and function, and also affects its ability to bind to 14-3-3 proteins.</p><p>14-3-3 proteins have been reported to regulate transcription factors by sequestering them in the cytoplasm; for example, BZR1 and RSG are regulated by the binding of 14-3-3 λ, ω or μ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Igarashi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gampala et al., 2007</xref>). Although functional redundancy and different combinations of 14-3-3 isoforms bring difficulties in clarifying the specific roles of 14-3-3 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jaspert et al., 2011</xref>), the involvement of 14-3-3 proteins in light signaling has been illustrated by the elongated hypocotyls (relative to those of Col-0 seedlings) of 14-3-3 κ, ν and χ mutants grown in red light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mayfield et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2014</xref>). In our work, there was no significant effect of R18 treatment and 14-3-3 mutations on PIF7’s localization and phosphorylation state under white light, which could be due to the strong light radiance, the inhibitory potency of R18 or the redundancy of the 13 14-3-3 proteins in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. By contrast, 14-3-3s significantly delay the shade-induced translocation and de-phosphorylation of PIF7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), and consequently enhance shade-induced hypocotyl elongation which is dependent on PIF7 <italic>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</italic> The weak shade phenotype might be caused by functional redundancy of 14-3-3 proteins. It is also possible that a compensatory increase in other isoforms occurs in <italic>14-3-3 λκ</italic>. It is possible that 14-3-3 proteins sequester phosphorylated PIF7 in cytoplasm by protecting the PIF7 proteins from phosphatases during the transition from white light to shade.</p><p>PIF7 is a major controller for shade-induced hypocotyl elongation, as demonstrated by the severe shade-defective phenotype of <italic>pif7</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2012</xref>). It is known that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> grows rapidly in response to the shade stimulus, with an induction of <italic>PIL1</italic> transcript levels detectable after only 8 min of low R/FR and growth measurable after just 30 or 45 min of exposure to shade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Salter et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cole et al., 2011</xref>). A quick shade regulatory mechanism is required to achieve this rapid response. Phosphorylation-dependent translocation of PIF7 is such a quick mechanism that can give rise to efficient photomorphogenesis. Moreover, several negative regulators of PIF7 have been shown to reduce the transcriptional activity of light-responsive genes and to prevent exaggerated shade responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hornitschek et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Galstyan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2014</xref>). In our current study, the binding of 14-3-3 proteins delays the de-phosphorylation and nuclear import of PIF7 in response to shading, forming another layer of regulation to determine the appropriate SAS.</p><p>A conserved 14-3-3-binding motif has been identified in PIF3 (RNP<bold>S</bold>PP), and PIF3 has been found to be a 14-3-3 interaction partner in an affinity-purification assay using His-tagged 14-3-3-coated beads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2014</xref>). However, the disruption of putative phosphorylation sites on the 14-3-3-binding motifs of PIF3 did not prevent 14-3-3 from binding to PIF3 or disturb the nuclear localization of PIF3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2014</xref>). Although the 14-3-3-binding sites of PIF7 are not typical of those of the other PIFs, the functional analysis of mutations of these sites (from Ser to Ala) illustrated their critical roles in PIF7 function.</p><p>The expression level and localization of 14-3-3 λ protein remain stable after shading is introduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that 14-3-3 proteins probably exert their cargo function constantly. The activity of PIF7 is mostly determined by its phosphorylation status, which is controlled by a kinase and a phosphatase that are light-dependent. To date, CK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bu et al., 2011</xref>), PPKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ni et al., 2017</xref>) and BIN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernardo-García et al., 2014</xref>) have been reported to be the kinases of PIF1, PIF3 and PIF4, and TOPP4 has been reported to be the phosphatase of PIF5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yue et al., 2016</xref>); however, no specific kinase or phosphatase of PIF7 has yet been identified. The shade-induced localization response of PIF7 varied in the different tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), implying that the phosphorylation of PIF7 is probably regulated by upstream signals that have tissue and/or developmental specificity. One important goal for the future is to identify these upstream kinases, as well as the phosphatase(s) responsible for the de-phosphorylation of Ser 139 and 140, and hence for the disassociation of 14-3-3 proteins in response to shading.</p><p>Our findings offer novel insights into the mechanism through which a key transcription factor is activated by light. We already knew that a high R/FR light ration promotes the nuclear import of phyB, which positively regulates photomorphogenesis. Here, we propose that shade promotes the nuclear import of PIF7, which promotes SAS. Subcellular translocations contribute to the antagonistic action of phyB and PIF7. More detailed cooperation on light-mediated development will be necessary in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p>All of the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> plants used in this study were of the Columbia-0 ecotype.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Christian Hardtke (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Zhi-Yong Wang (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Overall, the reviewers found your manuscript interesting and potentially a good contribution to <italic>eLife</italic>. However, they also raised important issues that must be addressed. Some of the issues require additional experimental evidence. Particularly, the role of 14-3-3s in controlling PIF7 nuclear localization needs more rigorous tests.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) PIF7 is known to mediate shade avoidance syndrome (SAS) in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Unlike other PIFs, PIF7 is not degraded rapidly in response to phytochrome-induce phosphorylation. How phosphorylation affects PIF7 activity has remained an outstanding question. Therefore, your findings that 14-3-3 proteins retain phospho-PIF7 in cytoplasm and shade-induced dephosphorylation causes PIF7 nuclear localization answer an important question in plant biology. While the results are interpreted clearly, the biological implication was not fully elaborated. For example, how such mechanism may contribute to the rapid response to shade, compared to the other light-labile PIFs that would require new protein synthesis to regain activity upon shade inactivation of phytochrome? We suggest you add a discussion of the possible implication of this nuclear localization mechanism in the contexts of the degradation mechanisms of other PIFs as well as your earlier finding that <italic>pif7</italic> lacks an early shade avoidance response (Li et al., 2012).</p><p>2) Two previous studies on GFP/CFP-tagged PIF7 (Leivar et al., 2008 and Kidokoro et al., Plant Physiol., 2009) did not report such cytoplasmic localization. Instead, GFP-PIF7 was shown to be nuclear and in speckles in light-treated tissues. The possible reasons for the discrepancy must be discussed, and ideally the possible reasons should be tested experimentally.</p><p>3) Why are BiFC signals stronger in the nucleus than in cytoplasm? If the interaction causes cytoplasmic retention, BiFC signals should be weaker or absent in the nucleus. Co-expression of a PIF7-RFP would help determine whether the tethering to 14-3-3 by BiFC affects PIF7 localization. Comparing the localization patterns of PIF7/14-3-3 BiFC signal with PIF7-GFP after short time shade treatment will provide further evidence as to whether change of 14-3-3 binding is required for shade-induced nuclear localization.</p><p>4) The R18 peptide treatment and 14-3-3 mutant experiments did not support your model. Unlike mutations of 14-3-3 binding site in PIF7 (PIF7(2A) and PIF7(5A)), both R18 treatment and 14-3-3 mutations had no effects on the PIF7 localization or target gene expression under white light. They only slightly increased the N/C ration after shade treatment. This needs to be resolved. Perhaps a positive control (another protein whose subcellular localization affected by 14-3-3 binding) is required to make sure the R18 treatment is effective, and higher order 14-3-3 mutants might show more dramatic effects. Similarly, the effects of R18 and 14-3-3 mutations on PIF7 phosphorylation status are weak and variable (Figure 4C and 4F), whereas PIF7(2A) had a strong effect on dephosphorylation under white light conditions (Figure 3C). The quantitative change of phosphorylation of PIF7(2A) (Figure 3C) suggests an indirect effect of the mutations on phosphorylation of additional sites, which may contribute to the change of nuclear localization and phenotypes.</p><p>5) The 14-3-3 binding to PIF7(2D) and PIF7(5D) needs to be tested quantitatively in vitro and in vivo, and the phenotypes of plants expressing PIF7(2D) and PIF7(5D) should be analyzed. It has been reported that 14-3-3 binding requires phosphorylation and cannot be mimicked by S-to-D substitution. If PIF7(5D) cannot bind to 14-3-3s, it would suggest that cytoplasmic localization is independent of 14-3-3, though dependent on phosphorylation (negative charge). In this case, it would be important to test whether PIF7(2D) and PIF7(5D) rescue the <italic>pif7</italic> mutant and change localization in response to shade, and you may want to test whether 14-3-3 inhibits PIF7 through other mechanisms such as DNA-binding or transcription activity.</p><p>6) Overexpression from the 35S promoter was used for both subcellular localization and in vivo interaction experiments. Reviewers are concerned that overexpression may contribute to artifacts on both cytoplasmic localization and interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. It is important to repeat these experiments using PIF7 expressed from its native promoter at its normal level.</p><p>7) The interaction between PIF7 and 14-3-3 should be analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation, or quantitative IP-MS (Figure 2—figure supplement 1 was not quantitative), in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> under light and shade conditions.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Shade-induced nuclear localization of PIF7 is regulated by phosphorylation and 14-3-3 proteins in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Christian Hardke (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below. Ordinarily we do not encourage multiple rounds of review. Given the remaining substantial concerns, it will be necessary to limit this to just a single additional review before we make a binding final decision on your manuscript.</p><p>The main issues are raised by your new data showing that the PIF7(2D) mutation abolished the binding to 14-3-3 λ and 14-3-3 κ, but unexpectedly lead to cytoplasmic retention of PIF7.</p><p>1) The Discussion of the role of 14-3-3s must be consistent with the results.

Unlike other PIFs, PIF7 is not degraded rapidly in response to phytochrome-induce phosphorylation. How phosphorylation affects PIF7 activity has remained an outstanding question. Therefore, your findings that 14-3-3 proteins retain phospho-PIF7 in cytoplasm and shade-induced dephosphorylation causes PIF7 nuclear localization answer an important question in plant biology. While the results are interpreted clearly, the biological implication was not fully elaborated. For example, how such mechanism may contribute to the rapid response to shade, compared to the other light-labile PIFs that would require new protein synthesis to regain activity upon shade inactivation of phytochrome? We suggest you add a discussion of the possible implication of this nuclear localization mechanism in the contexts of the degradation mechanisms of other PIFs as well as your earlier finding that pif7 lacks an early shade avoidance response (Li et al., 2012).</p></disp-quote><p>We have followed the reviewer’s suggestion by including the related discussion in our revised manuscript (Discussion, second and fifth paragraphs).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Two previous studies on GFP/CFP-tagged PIF7 (Leivar et al., 2008 and Kidokoro et al., Plant Physiol., 2009) did not report such cytoplasmic localization. Instead, GFP-PIF7 was shown to be nuclear and in speckles in light-treated tissues. The possible reasons for the discrepancy must be discussed, and ideally the possible reasons should be tested experimentally.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer mentioned, GFP/CFP-tagged PIF7 has been published in two previous studies.</p><p>According to the phenotype of loss function of mutants (<italic>pif7-1, pif7-2</italic>) (Leivar et al., 2008, Li et al., 2012), PIF7 is a positive regulator for hypocotyl elongation. In our hand, overexpressing either PIF7-Flash (Li., et al., 2012 and current study) or N-terminated tagged GFP-PIF7 (current study) could rescue the shorter hypocotyl phenotype of <italic>pif7-1</italic> or <italic>pif7-2</italic> under shade. So we believe that the PIF7-Flash or GFP-PIF7 transgenic lines represent its normal function and probable localization. The line reported in literature, PIF7-CFP overexpression lines from Dr. Peter Quail’s lab show a somewhat short hypocotyl phenotype in white light and dark (Leivar et al., 2008), indicating C-terminate fused GFP protein might interfere the normal function of PIF7. It is a possible explanation of the discrepancy of these localization results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Why are BiFC signals stronger in the nucleus than in cytoplasm? If the interaction causes cytoplasmic retention, BiFC signals should be weaker or absent in the nucleus. Co-expression of a PIF7-RFP would help determine whether the tethering to 14-3-3 by BiFC affects PIF7 localization. Comparing the localization patterns of PIF7/14-3-3 BiFC signal with PIF7-GFP after short time shade treatment will provide further evidence as to whether change of 14-3-3 binding is required for shade-induced nuclear localization.</p></disp-quote><p>The seemly stronger nuclear signals in BiFC assay is probably because these intensive signals gathered in a small area in tobacco leaf cells. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, GFP-PIF7 localized in both nucleus and cytoplasm (Figure 1), but 14-3-3 λ mainly localized in cytoplasm (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). To further clarify this question, we quantitated the nuclear/cytoplasmic fluorescence signal ratio in tobacco leaf cells which co-expressed 14-3-3λ-cYFP and nYFP-PIF7 or only expressed GFP-PIF7. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1A</xref>, nuclear/cytoplasmic signal is significant lower in BiFC assay, indicating that the interaction of 14-3-3s and PIF7 occurs mainly in cytoplasm.</p><p>The experiment suggested by the reviewers is to figure out whether change of 14-3-3 binding is required for shade-induced nuclear localization of PIF7. However, the localization of GFP-PIF7 expressed in tobacco leaf cells doesn’t respond to shade treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1B</xref>). The shade response in tobacco leaf cells may not share the same molecular mechanism as that in <italic>Arabidopsis.</italic> Regardless of light response, we could test whether co-expression of 14-3-3s affects the localization of PIF7 in tobacco leaf cells.

Unlike mutations of 14-3-3 binding site in PIF7 (PIF7(2A) and PIF7(5A)), both R18 treatment and 14-3-3 mutations had no effects on the PIF7 localization or target gene expression under white light. They only slightly increased the N/C ration after shade treatment. This needs to be resolved. Perhaps a positive control (another protein whose subcellular localization affected by 14-3-3 binding) is required to make sure the R18 treatment is effective, and higher order 14-3-3 mutants might show more dramatic effects. Similarly, the effects of R18 and 14-3-3 mutations on PIF7 phosphorylation status are weak and variable (Figure 4C and 4F), whereas PIF7(2A) had a strong effect on dephosphorylation under white light conditions (Figure 3C). The quantitative change of phosphorylation of PIF7(2A) (Figure 3C) suggests an indirect effect of the mutations on phosphorylation of additional sites, which may contribute to the change of nuclear localization and phenotypes.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out these issues. Actually, our model proposed that 14-3-3s retain the phosphorylated PIF7 in cytoplasm under shade, possibly through protection from phosphatases. Our results (Figure 5) support 14-3-3s mainly work during the transition from phosphorylated to dephosphorylated PIF7, not under white light. If 14-3-3s’ function is to escort phosphorylated PIF7 to cytoplasm, we should have observed longer hypocotyl in white light in which phosphorylated PIF7 is dominant, and more cytoplasmic localization of PIF7 in 14-3-3s mutant background than that in Col-0 under white light. But in fact, neither of them happens.</p><p>The effect of R18 is significant on shade-induced nuclear-translocation and dephosphorylation of PIF7 (Figure 5). Moreover, the effect of R18 treatment on shade-induced gene expression and hypocotyl elongation reproduces that of 14-3-3 mutations (Figure 6). So we believe that R18 treatment is effective. We also followed the reviewer’s suggestion and tested the effect of R18 on localization of BES1-GFP, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>. The subcellular localization of BES1 is affected by 14-3-3 binding (Dev Cell. 2007 13(2):177-89; Mol.

On the other hand, the double mutant of 14-3-3λκ significantly increased the N/C ratio after shade treatment, supporting our hypothesis of 14-3-3s’ effect on PIF7.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that there are additional sites beside S139 and S141 that may contribute to the change of nuclear localization and phenotypes.</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31636.025</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>The effect of R18 on the localization of BES1-GFP.</title><p>BES1-GFP transgenic plants (a gift from Dr. Xuelu Wang’s lab) grown under white light were treated with R18 or R18(Lys) for 3 hr after 10 min of vacuum.

It has been reported that 14-3-3 binding requires phosphorylation and cannot be mimicked by S-to-D substitution. If PIF7(5D) cannot bind to 14-3-3s, it would suggest that cytoplasmic localization is independent of 14-3-3, though dependent on phosphorylation (negative charge). In this case, it would be important to test whether PIF7(2D) and PIF7(5D) rescue the pif7 mutant and change localization in response to shade, and you may want to test whether 14-3-3 inhibits PIF7 through other mechanisms such as DNA-binding or transcription activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included the data about <italic>PIF7(2D)-Flash</italic> transgenic line in <italic>pif7-1</italic> background.

However, in our BiFC and GST pull-down assay, PIF7(2D) can’t interact with 14-3-3s (Figure 3—figure supplement 3), probably because the interaction of 14-3-3s and PIF7 can’t be mimicked by S-to-D substitution as the reviewer mentioned. So we would like to conclude that the cytoplasmic localization of PIF7 is dependent on the phosphorylation state, not 14-3-3s under white light. But 14-3-3s delay the shade-induced nuclear- translocation and dephosphorylation of PIF7 (Figure 5), possibly through protection from phosphatases during the transition from white light to shade.

We also quantitated the ratio of phosphorylated PIF7 to total PIF7 and presented in Figure 5—figure supplement 2.

Shade-induced nuclear translocation and de-phosphorylation of PIF7 is a fast process, which is correlated with the quick changes of gene expression and the measurable growth after just 30-40 min shade exposure. The effects of R18 and 14-3-3 mutations accelerate this fast process. We have shown the significant effects by individual treatment of R18 or in 14-3-3 mutants.

The title should be changed; the 14-3-3 proteins only slightly affect the PIF7 localization in the very limited condition.</p></disp-quote><p>The major and novel findings in our work include at least 4 points: 1) shade rapidly induce nuclear localization of PIF7; 2) Phosphorylation sites of PIF7 are important for its localization and function; 3) 14-3-3s interact with PIF7; 4) 14-3-3s delay the nuclear translocation and de-phosphorylation of PIF7 and negatively regulate SAS. These findings are supported by experimental evidences and appropriately reflected in title: “Shade-induced nuclear localization of PIF7 is regulated by phosphorylation and 14-3-3 proteins in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, although authors claim the 14-3-3 proteins somehow affect the shade-induced PIF7 localization and dephosphorylation, the effects of R18 and 14-3-3 mutations on the PIF7 localization are very subtle (Figure 4A, D) and their effects on the dephosphorylation of PIF7 are not obvious (Figure 4C, F). Since these are the only effects of 14-3-3 proteins on PIF7 that the authors showed in this manuscript, they should provide more convincing data.</p></disp-quote><p>Shade-induced nuclear translocation and de-phosphorylation of PIF7 is a fast process, which is correlated with the quick changes of gene expression and measurable growth after just 30-40 min shade exposure. The effects of R18 and 14-3-3 mutations accelerate this fast process. Based on Figures 5B, 5E and newly added Figure 5—figure supplement 2, significant effects of R18 and 14-3-3 mutations have been quantified with more experimental repeats.</p></body></sub-article></article>
