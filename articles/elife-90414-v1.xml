intensity, proximity, and context of exposure, and learning about danger-predicting stimuli is critical for survival. However, most Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigms focus only on freezing behavior, obscuring the contributions of associative and non-associative mechanisms to dynamic defensive responses. To thoroughly investigate defensive ethograms, we subjected male and female adult C57BL/6 J mice to a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm that paired footshock with a serial compound stimulus (SCS) consisting of distinct tone and white noise (WN) stimulus periods. To investigate how associative and non-associative mechanisms affect defensive responses, we compared this paired SCS-footshock group with four control groups that were conditioned with either pseudorandom unpaired presentations of SCS and footshock, shock only, or reversed SCS presentations with inverted tone-WN order, with paired or unpaired presentations. On day 2 of conditioning, the paired group exhibited robust freezing during the tone period with switching to explosive jumping and darting behaviors during the WN period. Comparatively, the unpaired and both reverse SCS groups expressed less tone-induced freezing and rarely showed jumping or darting during WN. Following the second day of conditioning, we observed how defensive behavior changed over two extinction sessions. During extinction, the tone-induced freezing decreased in the paired group, and mice rapidly shifted from escape jumping during WN to a combination of freezing and darting. The unpaired, unpaired reverse, and shock-only groups displayed defensive tail rattling and darting during the SCS, with minimal freezing and jumping. Interestingly, the paired reverse group did not jump to WN, and tone-evoked freezing was resistant to extinction. These findings demonstrate that non-associative factors promote some defensive responsiveness, but associative factors are required for robust cue-induced freezing and high-intensity flight expression.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Post-traumatic stress disorder (or PTSD for short) is a condition that can cause people to overreact to harmless cues, vividly re-experience a traumatic event, or freeze in place. To understand why this happens, researchers often study fear responses using an approach called fear conditioning, where laboratory animals learn to associate the sound of a tone with a mild electric shock. This conditioning causes animals to freeze with fear when they hear the tone.</p><p>However, focusing on freezing overlooks the range of defensive actions animals may carry out, such as escaping or fighting. Capturing this complexity in experiments is important for understanding the dynamic nature of fear responses that occur in PTSD. Previous work showed that conditioning mice with a two-part cue, such as a tone followed by white noise, caused mice to freeze during the first cue and jump during the second cue. However, whether the mice learned this behaviour through conditioning or if it was an instinctive response to the cues remained unclear.</p><p>To investigate this phenomenon, Le et al. – including some of the researchers involved in the previous work – conditioned mice with a variety of different cue combinations and monitored how they responded. As before, mice conditioned to associate a tone followed by white noise with an electric shock froze when they heard the tone and transitioned to jumping during the white noise. However, if during conditioning the sounds and shocks occurred at unpredictable times, the mice did not associate the sounds with the shock and therefore they froze less and rarely jumped. Similarly, reversing the order of the sounds so that the white noise happened before the tone also reduced jumping but not freezing.</p><p>To investigate whether the mice could unlearn this fear response, Le et al. exposed the fear-conditioned mice to the cues without an accompanying electric shock. The mice that had been conditioned with a tone followed by white noise showed a weaker response to the cues, only freezing and not jumping. However, the mice with the reversed cues still froze even after this exposure, and the mice with the non-associated cues maintained very little freezing and jumping.</p><p>Taken together, the findings suggest that while fear responses can be influenced by the association between certain noises and an electric shock, other factors such as the timing and the order of the sound cues can also impact the intensity of the fear response. The experiments also showed that this method of fear conditioning can be used for both learning and unlearning fear responses, revealing an approach for future studies into how fear responses change over time. Combining this more complex approach with other experimental techniques could help researchers identify the brain regions that drive fear responses, which may eventually benefit people with PTSD and other fear disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>defensive behavior</kwd><kwd>fear</kwd><kwd>pavlovian conditioning</kwd><kwd>fear extinction</kwd><kwd>associative learning</kwd><kwd>non-associative learning</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH122561</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fadok</surname><given-names>Jonathan P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Associative and non-associative learning mechanisms summate to produce robust and complex conditioned behavior profiles, opening new avenues to in-depth investigations of defensive responses and threat evaluation.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Defensive responses have evolved to maximize survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Adolphs, 2014</xref>), and animals rapidly switch behaviors depending on threat imminence, the context of exposure, and previous experience with stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Perusini and Fanselow, 2015</xref>). Understanding the mechanisms underlying adaptive defensive behavior may grant insight into the pathophysiology of post-traumatic stress and panic disorders, wherein heightened responses to external stimuli are observed, yet neuroscientists need more tractable methods with which to investigate how the nervous system controls complex experience-dependent behavior.</p><p>Pavlovian fear conditioning has been widely used as a model system to understand the neural mechanisms underlying fear-related learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolles, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolles and Collier, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grewe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Roy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bouton et al., 2021</xref>). In standard Pavlovian conditioning paradigms, freezing is the dominant defensive behavior evoked by contexts and learned cues that are paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US), like footshock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blanchard and Blanchard, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolles and Collier, 1976</xref>). Other defensive responses like escape jumping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chu et al., 2024</xref>) and darting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gruene et al., 2015</xref>) are measured less often within conditioning, limiting insight into defensive response dynamics. To address this critical need, we developed a modified Pavlovian conditioning paradigm that elicits both freezing and flight behaviors in response to conditioned stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fadok et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borkar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borkar and Fadok, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Borkar et al., 2024</xref>), findings that have been replicated by others in both mice and rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Totty et al., 2021</xref>). In this paradigm, mice are conditioned with a SCS consisting of a pure tone followed by WN, which terminates with a strong electrical footshock. After conditioning, mice exhibit contextual freezing which significantly increases in response to tone, and mice switch to robust flight responses upon WN presentation. These findings demonstrate that the magnitude and mode of defensive behavior change with the psychological distance of threat, consistent with the predatory imminence continuum theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Perusini and Fanselow, 2015</xref>).</p><p>However, the influence of non-associative elements on this ethological profile has recently been discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fanselow et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hersman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Trott et al., 2022</xref>). It has been suggested that the inherent salience of the WN stimulus contributes more to WN-evoked flight response than its predictive association with the US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hersman et al., 2020</xref>). Others claim that the immediate transition from freezing to flight behavior is a result of the rapid change and relative increase in stimulus intensity from tone to WN that is caused by non-associative sensitization, or by inherent stimulus properties, akin to an acoustic startle response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fanselow et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Trott et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, sensitization and stimulus salience are known to intensify freezing responses to auditory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kamprath and Wotjak, 2004</xref>), and mice show increased reactivity to a WN stimulus after experiencing stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoffman et al., 2022</xref>). These findings highlight the need to better elucidate the associative and non-associative elements of Pavlovian fear conditioning that influence the expression of defensive behavior.</p><p>To address this, we utilized four control groups for the non-associative effects of conditioning. To test the importance of the SCS-shock contingency, we utilized an unpaired control procedure in which the US and the SCS were presented in a separated, pseudorandom, and non-predictive fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rescorla, 1967</xref>). To test the effects of sensitization by the shock, we presented footshock alone during conditioning. To test the impact of stimulus intensity and salience, we conducted paired and unpaired conditioning using a reversed SCS where the WN preceded the tone. We compared these four control groups against a paired SCS-shock conditioning group to determine the effects of associative learning on SCS-evoked fear behavior. All groups went through two extinction sessions with SCS presentations alone to elucidate the extent to which prior associative pairing affects de-escalating response strategies, as well as to identify defensive behaviors that are expressed in the absence of a strict threat-signaling association.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Stimulus-evoked freezing and activity are affected by SCS-shock contingency and stimulus order</title><p>Equal numbers of male and female mice were randomly assigned to either a paired (<bold>PA</bold>), unpaired (<bold>UN</bold>), shock-only (<bold>SO</bold>), paired reverse (<bold>PA-R</bold>), or unpaired reverse (<bold>UN-R</bold>) group for fear conditioning and fear extinction training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

The results signify that associative pairings and a proximal stimulus-threat association during fear conditioning produce maximal expression of cue-induced freezing and flight responses. Non-associative elements such as cue salience, change in stimulus intensity, and shock-induced sensitization elicit stress-associated behaviors like tail rattling and activity bursts, as hypothesized before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Trott et al., 2022</xref>), but the addition of the WN-threat associative pairing contributes significantly to eliciting high-intensity defensive responses like escape jumping. Therefore, these associative and non-associative factors combine to produce distinct behavioral transitions between freezing and flight.</p><p>During conditioning, we observed distinct ethograms for the PA and UN groups in response to the SCS. Freezing to tone and activity to WN were both significantly higher in the PA group compared to the UN group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and K</xref>), highlighting the impact of SCS-shock contingency on the magnitude of defensive responses. Notably, comparable results were previously reported in rats conditioned using similar parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Totty et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally, we found that the PA and PA-R groups showed significant increases in freezing from pre-SCS to tone, while in the UN and UN-R groups, freezing to tone was no greater than contextual freezing, suggesting that the paired groups placed associative value on the tone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). Lastly, the PA group displayed much more intense flight behavior during WN than the PA-R group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>), indicating that the proximity of WN to the footshock threat affects defensive scaling.</p><p>Previous studies have factored jumping behaviors into normalized measures to gauge conditioned flight behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fadok et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hersman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borkar et al., 2020</xref>), but given the increased activity indices in the PA, UN, and UN-R groups, we examined if the escape jumping we observed was associative or non-associative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We found that the PA group exhibited consistent jumping responses to the WN stimulus during conditioning that were not reproduced in the UN, PA-R, or UN-R groups. Others have found that a salient stimulus is sufficient to induce conditioned jumping responses after multiple sessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Furuyama et al., 2023</xref>). Given that the PA-R group did not display consistent jumping behavior to WN or tone, this suggests that a robust jumping response to WN in the SCS paradigm is not due to the non-associative salience of the WN as others have suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hersman et al., 2020</xref>) but is instead due to its association with imminent threat.</p><p>Darting has been reported to be increased in rodents that undergo stress and fear conditioning, and it is more prevalent in female rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gruene et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brzozowska et al., 2017</xref>). Previous studies have measured darting to WN as a darts per minute measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Morena et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoffman et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Trott et al., 2022</xref>) or as part of a composite escape score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hersman et al., 2020</xref>), but our data suggests that examining darting requires a more detailed analysis. We found that the PA group exhibited darting across the entire WN period during conditioning, while the response was virtually nonexistent in the UN, PA-R, and UN-R groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This is consistent with findings where conditioned darting has been shown to occur more often several seconds after a CS, rather than at its onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mitchell et al., 2022</xref>). This indicates that darting during conditioning is not caused by the salience of the tone-WN transition, but from an associative learned response. Additionally, the absence of darting in the PA-R group indicates that the temporal proximity of the WN to the shock also influences darting. Our data show that the control groups engage primarily in simple locomotor behaviors induced by stimulus salience (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). Overall, darting behaviors during conditioning contribute to the higher activity score observed during WN in the PA group, and our data suggests that these contributions are the result of associative learning and threat imminence, rather than non-associative stimulus salience.</p><p>During extinction, the PA and PA-R groups showed the highest level of freezing to tone compared to the non-associative control groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). This indicates that the paired groups had the strongest association between the tone stimulus and threat. This is further reinforced by the larger difference between tone-evoked freezing and pre-SCS freezing in the PA and PA-R groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>). Freezing during tone in the non-associative control groups, on the other hand, is no greater than freezing in the interstimulus intervals. Interestingly, tone-evoked freezing in the PA group underwent within-session extinction, while that of the PA-R group was resistant to extinction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D</xref>). The sustained tone-evoked freezing over multiple extinction sessions in the PA-R group is likely a product of the temporal proximity of the cue to the footshock, which is set at a greater intensity (0.9 mA) in the conditioned flight paradigm than is traditionally used in Pavlovian threat conditioning (typically 0.2–0.6 mA). Because freezing during the tone is not elevated over contextual freezing levels in the unpaired and SO groups, the reductions in freezing during the tone during extinction in these groups can be attributed to reduced freezing overall.</p><p>In response to WN during extinction, the PA group transitioned from explosive circa-strike flight responses containing escape jumps to a combination of anticipatory post-encounter freezing and darting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This likely reflects a larger perceived psychological distance from threat that influences defensive strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Perusini and Fanselow, 2015</xref>). The control groups showed only slight changes in WN-evoked activity over extinction, similar to responses of stressed mice to an unfamiliar WN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoffman et al., 2022</xref>). The lack of decrease in WN-evoked activity over extinction in the PA-R group compared to the PA group, and the lack of the control groups transitioning to freezing behavior, suggests that WN-evoked flight in the PA group is associative and is dependent on the perceived threat value of the WN stimulus.</p><p>An examination of jumping and darting behaviors over the first extinction session reveals a distinct ethogram in the PA group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The presence of jumping during early extinction trials in the PA group indicates that the WN initially signaled imminent threat, resulting in an explosive circa-strike escape response. However, the change from jumping to darting may reflect a change in perceived threat imminence in the same vein as the observed change from flight to freezing. This phenomenon was only observed in the PA group, indicating that this behavioral change is associative and is consistent with the predatory imminence continuum. This jumping behavior to WN is associative and can be extinguished, making it a suitable measure for future studies interested in how the nervous system controls experience-dependent high-intensity fear reactions.</p><p>The elevated activity indices from the UN and SO groups are similar to other studies that report heightened activity to WN after multiple footshocks, or a sudden change in stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoffman et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Trott et al., 2022</xref>). However, given the lack of darting and jumping from the UN group during extinction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>), their increased activity is due to other locomotor behaviors unrelated to flight. The SO group maintained a consistent level of darting throughout the first extinction session, which contributed to their overall increased activity index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and D</xref>). Given that darting can be elicited in stressed mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brzozowska et al., 2017</xref>), it is probable that shock sensitization can prime an animal to dart more readily to an unfamiliar, but highly salient, stimulus upon stimulus transition. Indeed, darting behavior has been shown to change based on multiple parameters, decreasing both with increased shock intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mitchell et al., 2022</xref>) and with prolonged extinction training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Demars et al., 2022</xref>), suggesting that darting is both an associative conditioned response to stimuli associated with threat and a response resulting from non-associative sensitization.</p><p>Within the UN, UN-R, and SO control groups, we observed a higher degree of tail rattling responses during extinction compared to the PA and PA-R groups, and tail rattling was more prominent during the tone period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Tail rattling has been observed in mice when determining hierarchical relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haber and Simmel, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Terranova et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dorofeikova et al., 2023</xref>), anticipating fighting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Miczek et al., 2001</xref>), and encountering looming threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Salay et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, tail rattling may be a behavior elicited in stressed mice in the face of uncertain threat. Previously, we found that tail rattling occurs most often during early trials of fear conditioning, with a prominent decline later in conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borkar et al., 2020</xref>). This is consistent with our results from the UN, UN-R, and SO groups, who displayed greater tail rattling to unpaired (UN, UN-R groups) or novel (SO group) SCS presentations within the conditioning context, with reductions in tail rattling over the course of extinction exposure. Taken together, this suggests that tail rattling is not a behavior exhibited during post-encounter or circa-strike levels of threat, but rather within stressful scenarios where danger is uncertain but anticipated. Future studies that are interested in measuring defensive responses to threat signals such as context, odor, or innately aversive sensory stimuli should consider measuring tail rattling as a marker of non-associative anticipatory fear.</p><p>Current studies are investigating behaviors beyond freezing within classical Pavlovian conditioning paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tryon et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Laine et al., 2022</xref>), but responses like jumping and darting are not always reliably elicited during CS presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Colon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akmese et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biddle and Knox, 2023</xref>). Using the SCS flight conditioning paradigm, we elicit a robust continuum of consistent associative defensive responses during CS presentation that are seldom observed within classical Pavlovian conditioning. While behaviors like darting and tail ratting can occur due to non-associative stimulus-inherent properties, transitions between freezing and jumping are robustly present when associative factors signal threat imminence. Future studies can utilize this paradigm to investigate neuronal mechanisms that contribute to threat association and direct dynamic responses to threat, with important implications for developing new treatments for those who suffer from fear and anxiety disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal subjects</title><p>We used C57BL/6 J mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine, Stock #000664), aged 3–6 mo in this study.

Alternating current footshocks (ENV-414S, Med Associates, Inc) were delivered to the mice during conditioning in Context B.

Behavioral testing took place over 5 d. For all days of the paradigm, PA-R and UN-R mice experienced the reversed SCS at identical presentation timings as their respective PA and UN counterparts. On Day 1 (Pre-Exposure), subjects were placed in Context A for a baseline period of 3 min, followed by four presentations of the SCS with a pseudorandom inter-stimulus interval (ISI) period of 90–100 s and a period of 40 s following the final SCS presentation, totaling 590 s per session. Day 2 and Day 3 (Conditioning) took place in Context B. On each conditioning day (CD1 and CD2), mice were subjected to one of three conditions after a 3- min baseline period. For all groups, each conditioning session lasted 820 s. PA mice (n=16 males, 16 females) and PA-R mice (n=5 males, 5 females) were presented with five pairings of the SCS co-terminating with a 1 s, 0.9 mA footshock, with pseudorandom ISI periods of 90–150 s and a period of 60 s following the final footshock of the session. UN mice (n=10 males, 10 females) and UN-R mice (n=5 males, 5 females) were presented with pseudorandom presentations of SCS and footshocks separate from one another with ISI periods of 40–60 s, with a period of 90 s following the final stimulus of the session. Stimuli were ordered such that the SCS could not reliably predict footshock. PA, PA-R, UN, and UN-R mice all received the same number of SCS and footshock presentations, only differing by SCS-footshock contingency. SO mice (n=10 males, 10 females) did not receive presentations of the SCS during conditioning and were given five footshocks with pseudorandom ISI periods of 120–160 s each session, with a period of 80 s following the final shock of the session. For all groups, stimulus timing and ISI differed between CD1 and CD2 to avoid predictable anticipation of stimuli before presentation. Days 4 and 5 (Extinction) took place in Context B, and each session consisted of 16 presentations of the SCS with pseudorandom ISI periods of 60–120 s, with a period of 50 s following the final SCS of the session. Each Extinction session (Ext1 and Ext2) lasted 1910s. Subjects were sacrificed after the conclusion of behavioral testing. Experiments were conducted in cohorts of 8–10 mice for a total of 10 replicates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Behavioral recording and analysis</title><p>All sessions were recorded to video using a camera (Pike, Allied Vision, Stadtroda, Germany) mounted above the behavioral contexts with stimulus events encoded to the same files using TTL pulses (Omniplex, Plexon, Dallas, Texas). Contour tracking (Cineplex, Plexon) was used to automatically detect freezing based on frame-by-frame changes in pixels. Freezing behavior was defined as a complete cessation of movement for at least 1 s, and results were confirmed with an observer blinded to the condition. By determining a calibration coefficient using the known size of the behavioral context and the camera’s pixel dimensions, speed (cm/s) was extracted using the animal’s center of gravity. An activity index was calculated for each animal using a ratio of its speed during either the tone or WN stimulus (CS) period and its average speed from the combined 10 s periods prior to each SCS presentation (pre-SCS) during the session; the number of jumps performed during that stimulus period was then added to this ratio (Speed<sub>CS</sub>/Speed<sub>avg pre-SCS</sub>+Jumps). Previously we calculated flight scores per trial using speed from each trial’s pre-SCS period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fadok et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borkar et al., 2020</xref>), but here we utilized an average from all pre-SCS periods in our calculations to avoid denominators that were close to or equal to 0, a complication noted by other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hersman et al., 2020</xref>). Reflecting this change, we now refer to this measure of locomotor change as an ‘activity index’ instead of a ‘flight score’ as before. Escape jumps and tail-rattling behaviors were manually classified by an observer blinded to the condition. Jumps were defined as the period where the mouse had all four paws above the chamber floor. Tail rattling was defined as rapid back-and-forth vibrations of the tip and midsection of the tail. Darting behavior was detected and classified using machine learning software as described below and was defined as rapid bursts of movement across the floor of the chamber. Distance traveled over pre-SCS, tone, and WN periods was calculated per mouse by plotting its average speed per 0.5 s intervals and integrating the area under the curve.</p><p>When performing behavioral analyses that reported cumulative frequencies per group, 20 random subjects from the PA group were used to match the population sizes of the UN and SO control groups.

The work adds to ongoing efforts to identify multifaceted behaviors that reflect learning in classic paradigms and will be valuable to others in the field. The reviewers do note areas that would benefit from additional discussion and some minor gaps in data reporting that could be filled by additional analyses or experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers and the editors for their thoughtful and constructive critiques of our manuscript. We have updated our manuscript with data from additional experiments as suggested by the reviewers, and we have significantly edited the text and figures to reflect these additions. Our detailed, point-by-point responses are below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The main goal of the study was to tease apart the associative and non-associative elements of cued fear conditioning that could influence which defensive behaviors are expressed. To do this, the authors compared groups conditioned with paired, unpaired, or shock only procedures followed by extinction of the cue. The cue used in the study was not typical; serial presentation of a tone followed by a white noise was used in order to assess switches in behavior across the transition from tone to white noise.

The authors found changes in behavioral transitions from freezing to flight during conditioning as the tone transitioned into white noise, and a switch in freezing during extinction such that it became high during the white noise as flight behavior decreased. Overall, this was an interesting analysis of transitions in defensive behaviors to a serially presented cue consisting of two auditory stimuli during conditioning and then extinction.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for their supportive insight.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are some concerns regarding the possibility that the white noise is more innately aversive than the tone, inducing more escape-like behaviors compared to a tone, especially since the shock only group also showed increased escape-like behaviors during the white noise versus tone. This issue would have been resolved by adding a control group where the order of the auditory stimuli was reversed (white noise-&gt;tone).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this concern, and we have added two additional groups to address this possibility. We have conducted the same experimental paradigm with 2 reverse-SCS groups (WN—tone), one with paired (new PA-R group), and one with unpaired (new UN-R group), presentations to shock during conditioning. These experiments revealed that during conditioning day 2 in both reverse order groups, WN causes reductions in freezing and increases in locomotor activity (see revised Figure 2D), an effect that is stronger in the UN-R compared to the PA-R group. This locomotor effect is neither darting nor escape jumping in the PA-R group (revised Figure 3G, I; Figure 4G). In the UN-R group, WN induces more activity than the PA-R group (Figure 2D), including some jumping at WN onset (Figure 3H), but no darting (Figure 4G). It is worth noting that WN does not elicit defensive behavior before conditioning at the sound intensity we use (75dB; see Fadok et al. 2017, Borkar et al. 2020, Borkar et al. 2024). Together, these results suggest that WN is an inherently more salient stimulus than tone, and it can elicit defensive behaviors in shock-sensitized mice through non-associative mechanisms. Indeed, stimulus salience is a key factor in this paradigm for inducing activity (see Hersman et al. 2020).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the more complete assessment of defensive behaviors beyond freezing is welcomed, the main conclusions in the discussion are overly focused on the paired group and the associative elements of conditioning, which would likely not be surprising to the field. If the goal, as indicated in the title, was to tease apart the associative and non-associative elements of conditioning and defensive behaviors, there needs to be a more emphasized discussion and explicit identification of the non-associative findings of their study, as this would be more impactful to the field.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rewritten the Discussion to provide a greater emphasis on the findings of the study that are more related to non-associative mechanisms. For example, we argue that cue-salience and changes in stimulus intensity can induce non-associative increases in locomotor behavior and tail rattling in shock-sensitized mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors examined several defensive responses elicited during Pavlovian conditioning using a serial compound stimulus (SCS) as the conditioned stimulus (CS) and a shock unconditioned stimulus (US) in male and female mice.

Then in LINES 113-116, they describe this group as &quot;unpaired&quot; where the &quot;SCS could not reliably predict footshock&quot;. Combined, it is unclear if this group is random or unpaired. The &quot;truly random procedure&quot; is defined, by the cited Rescorla paper, as &quot;the two events are programmed entirely randomly and independently in such a way that some &quot;pairings&quot; of CS and US may occur by chance alone&quot;. So, truly random would indicate that the shock may occur during the cue, while unpaired indicates the shock was explicitly unpaired from the cue. If the authors used a random procedure, the groups need to be labeled as random, not unpaired, and the # of cues that happened to coincide with footshock per animal needs to be reported somewhere. If the authors used an unpaired procedure (which appears to be the case based on 40-60s ITI between SCS and footshock being reported), it needs to be clearer and consistent throughout that it was explicitly unpaired, as well as removing the claim in LINE 72-73 that they used a &quot;truly random procedure&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We did indeed use an explicitly unpaired procedure. We have adjusted the text and figures to better reflect this, and we removed any mentions of randomness with regards to the presentations of SCS and footshock.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Despite the lack of significant sex differences, it would still be helpful if data panels with individual data points (e.g. Fig 2E-J), were presented as identifiable by sex (e.g. closed vs open circles for males vs females).</p></disp-quote><p>The revised manuscript now compares four or five groups per figure, making data presentation complicated. Providing the individual data points in each panel reduces figure clarity, therefore, we feel it is best to present the data as box-and-whisker plots without them. However, the source data files for each figure are available to the reader and the data are clearly labeled to be identifiable by sex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is it not odd that all groups showed similar levels of contextual freezing during the 3min baseline? If shocks are unsignaled in the UN and SO groups, one would expect higher levels of contextual freezing compared to a paired group.</p></disp-quote><p>We are not certain why one would expect higher levels of contextual freezing in the UN and SO groups compared to the PA group at the beginning of conditioning day 2. Another study also looked at baseline freezing in a contextual fear group (which is the same as shock only in our study) and in an auditory cued fear conditioning group within the conditioning context, and their data show that freezing during the baseline period is equivalent between groups (Sachella et al., 2022).</p><p>During baseline on Extinction Day 1, it does seem that the unpaired and SO groups tend to have higher freezing levels compared to the paired groups. Author response image 1 shows baseline freezing during the first 3 minutes of extinction day 1.

Or have the authors tested WN followed by tone? Is there a potential issue that the WN may be innately aversive which is then amplified with training? i.e. does a tone preferentially induce freezing while WN induces active behaviors, regardless of which sensory stimulus is temporally closer to the shock? If the change in behavior is really due to the pairing and temporal proximity to shock, then there should be increased jumps, etc to the tone if trained with WN-&gt;tone.</p></disp-quote><p>WN can indeed be used as an aversive stimulus under certain conditions and at sufficiently high decibel levels. In the conditioned flight paradigm, WN is presented at 75dB, which is below the threshold for eliciting an acoustic startle response in a C57BL/6J mouse (Fadok et al. 2009). Also, during pre-exposure, when animals are naïve to the SCS, tone and WN stimuli do not elicit defensive behaviors (see Fadok et al. 2017, Borkar et al. 2020, 2024).</p><p>As suggested by the Reviewer, during revision we have included reverse-SCS paired (PA-R) and unpaired (UN-R) groups to test for the role of stimulus salience and stimulus order on defensive ethograms. During conditioning day 2, the PA-R group exhibited little freezing to the WN, with a slightly elevated activity index, and they exhibited robust freezing during tone (revised Figure 2A-H). The activity during the WN in the PA-R group was significantly lower than that of the PA group (Figure 2L). The PA-R group also did not respond to WN with escape jumps or darting (Figure 3I, 4G). The UN-R group displayed greater activity during the WN than the UN and PA-R groups, but less activity than the PA group (Figure 2D, H). The UN-R group did not dart but this group displayed some jumping at WN onset (Figure 3H), like what was observed in the UN group.</p><p>These data suggest that WN has inherent, salient properties that can induce some non-associative activity after the mouse has been sensitized by shock (see also Hersman et al. 2020 for more detailed analysis of stimulus salience in the conditioned flight paradigm). However, only in the PA group is robust flight behavior (comprised of high numbers of escape jumps and darting) observed. Therefore, both stimulus salience and temporal order are important for eliciting transitions from freezing to flight.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig 3G/4G are hard for me to understand. The figure legends say they're survival graphs but the y-axis labels &quot;Latency to initial jump/dart (% of cohort)&quot; confuses me. What is the purpose of these graphs? Perhaps they are not needed. Or consider presenting them similar to Fig 7C, D as those were more intuitive and faster for me to grasp.</p></disp-quote><p>We had intended these plots to show that a greater proportion of the paired group jumps and darts during WN compared to the unpaired group, and that the percentage of the cohort that jumps and darts increases across conditioning trials. Because these graphs were not clear, we have removed them, and we have replaced them with graphs comparing total cohort percentages that jumped (Figure 3I) or darted (Figure 4G) over the whole CD2 session.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For the extinction data, I did not see within group analyses for within or between session fear extinction to the tone. So, for the paired group, were the last 4 trials of Ext 1 significantly lower than the first 4 trials? If not, then they did not show within-session extinction. Also, for the paired group, were the last 4 trials of Ext 1 significantly different than the first 4 trials of Ext 2? This would test for long-term retention and spontaneous recovery.</p></disp-quote><p>In the original submission and in the revised manuscript, we calculated a delta change score for freezing during tone in the early versus late blocks of 4 trials, and then we statistically compared these differences across groups (Figure 5C, D). This allowed us to assess between-group differences in changes to tone-evoked freezing during extinction. Freezing to tone did decrease significantly over the first extinction session for the paired group (Early Ext1 vs Late Ext1, paired t-test, t(31) = 6.23, p&lt;0.0001), and when comparing late Ext1 and early Ext2, we found that tone-evoked freezing did significantly increase (Late Ext1 vs Early Ext2, paired t-test, t(31) = 5.26, p&lt;0.0001). This increase in cue-induced freezing between days of extinction is characteristic of C57BL/6J mice (Hefner et al., 2008). Our study did not test for more distal timepoints, so we cannot comment on the efficacy of long-term retention or spontaneous recovery.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For the conditioning and extinction data across Figs 2, 5 and 6, what I gather from them is that freezing is high to the tone and low to the WN during conditioning, and then low to the tone, and high to the WN across extinction. Then for activity levels I see they are low to the tone and high to the WN during conditioning, and then low to the WN during extinction. The piece that is missing is what are activity levels like to the tone during extinction. Are they low like in conditioning and remain low in extinction? Or do they increase across extinction as freezing decreases? As I was going through these graphs I drew myself out step function summaries of the freezing and activity levels between tone/WN for conditioning vs extinction; maybe the authors could consider a summary figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for their interest. We found that within the paired group, activity to tone remained low throughout both days of extinction (though increased within each session) and did not return to normal activity levels. We present this data in Author response image 2. We thank the Reviewer for the suggestion of a summary figure, but we feel there are too many axes of classification (between-group, within-group, multiple behaviors, tone/WN, conditioning/extinction) to coherently present our findings in a single figure.</p><fig id="sa3fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Trial-by-trial plot of activity index during the tone period of SCS across both extinction sessions for the PA group.</title><p>SCS, Serial compound stimulus; Ext, extinction; PA, Paired.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-90414-sa3-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the discussion (LINE 592-3), they discuss that shock sensitization in the SO group may prime a stressed animal to dart more readily to WN upon stimulus transition. Should this not also happen during the transition of silence to tone? What is special about a transition between two auditory stimuli that would result in panic like behavior in an animal that only received shock presentations? This also gets back to an earlier concern above regarding the potentially innately aversiveness of the WN.</p></disp-quote><p>After 2 days of shock sensitization, we observe that mice exhibit freezing to the tone during the first three trials of extinction day 1 (Figure 5A). This non-associative freezing response is like that observed in other studies of non-associative fear processing (please see Kamprath and Wotjak, 2004). As trials progress during extinction day 1, mice do become mildly activated during the tone (Author response image 3). The transition to WN in the shock-only group during extinction induces non-associative darting responses, but it does not induce escape jumping behavior (Figure 7). We hypothesize that the innate salience of the WN is a vital factor contributing to these escalated responses. The importance of stimulus salience in conditioned flight was also demonstrated by Hersman et al., 2020 for SCS conditioning, and by Furuyama et al., 2023 for single tone conditioning. Just as with conditional freezing responses (Kamprath and Wotjak, 2004), we believe that conditional flight is controlled by summative components, one being associative and the other non-associative.</p><fig id="sa3fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Trial-by-trial plot of activity index during the tone period of SCS across both extinction sessions for the SO group.</title><p>SCS, Serial compound stimulus; Ext, extinction; SO, Shock Only.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-90414-sa3-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the discussion (LINE 583), they say that the development of explosive defensive behaviors are &quot;not achievable with traditional single-cue Pavlovian conditioning paradigms&quot;.

This statement was meant to highlight that traditional paradigms do not offer an element of signaling the temporal imminence of threat, only its inevitability. It was not our intention to state that defensive escape behaviors were unachievable in single-cue conditioning paradigms, and we regret not making this clear. Indeed, the supplement of Fadok et al. 2017 shows that WN-shock conditioning is capable of inducing flight, Furuyama et al. 2023 shows that tone-shock conditioning is capable of inducing flight under specific parameters, and Gruene et al. 2015 demonstrates that single CS-US pairings induce conditional darting behaviors in female rats. We have adjusted the text to better reflect our intent.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comment to LINE 613-5: Speaking as someone who has done fear conditioning in both mice and rats, tail rattling may be specific to mice (I have seen this often) and likely not observable in rats (never seen it).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this information.

However, there are some issues that can be addressed to improve the overall quality of the study, namely, the reader is left wanting to know more, especially about how neural circuits contribute to these different defensive behaviors during this task. Below are some recommendations for the authors that would greatly improve the impact and significance of this study.</p><p>(1) What are the neural correlates or circuits recruited during these different defensive behaviors across the course of conditioning and extinction? How might they differ between the PA and UN groups? What differences might emerge when an animal is shifting their defensive behavior from freezing to darting, for example? Answering these questions would require intensive additional experiments, therefore more discussion of possible neural mechanisms that might be recruited during this task would be appreciated, given the scope of the subject area.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that understanding the neural circuits recruited during these behaviors and across conditioning and extinction is of vital importance. We are actively working on these questions, and we have published on the role of central amygdala circuits (Fadok et al. 2017) as well as on top-down control of flight by the medial prefrontal cortex (Borkar et al. 2024). Because the current manuscript is focused on learning mechanisms influencing defensive behavior, we would prefer to focus our discussion on that, rather than speculating on possible neural mechanisms. However, we have added a statement in the Discussion (LINES 706-707) emphasizing that future studies should investigate the neuronal mechanisms contributing to threat associations and different defensive behaviors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Were any vocalizations observed during conditioning or extinction phases? If not, could you speculate how type and occurrence of vocalizations might correlate with the different defensive responses observed?</p></disp-quote><p>Audible vocalizations were only observed during footshock presentations (squeaks). Unfortunately, we do not have the proper specialized recording equipment to monitor the full spectrum of mouse vocalizations, especially those in the ultrasonic range. Thus, we cannot speculate on the nuances of vocalizations in mice with respect to this behavioral paradigm. To the best of our knowledge, mice have not been reported to emit specific ultrasonic calls during conditioned threat like those of rats. That said, it would be of interest to determine if mice emit different vocalizations during different defensive behaviors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The transition from freezing to flight during the SCS is thought to be due to the close proximity of threat imminence between the WN CS and shock US. What if you switched the order of the SCS stimuli to WN followed by tone stimuli? If the salience of the WN stimulus is truly driving the jumping behavior, then it would be observed even if the WN stimulus preceded the pure tone stimulus and that would bring additional evidence that it is the associative value of the stimuli rather than its salience that's driving the defensive behaviors. What do you predict you would observe in rodents that were given a WN-tone SCS paired and unpaired in the same design of this study?</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we collected data from reverse-SCS paired and unpaired groups and reported our findings within the manuscript. Our detailed findings are also discussed above. Overall, we find that a combination of stimulus salience and temporal proximity, and a summation of non-associative and associative mechanisms, are necessary to elicit explosive flight behavior (escape jumping and darting).</p><p>References</p><p>Borkar CD, Dorofeikova M, Le QE, Vutukuri R, Vo C, Hereford D, Resendez A, Basavanhalli S, Sifnugel N, Fadok JP (2020) Sex differences in behavioral responses during a conditioned flight paradigm.
