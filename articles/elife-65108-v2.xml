of tissue substrate utilization and systemic insulin sensitivity. Clinical studies have suggested a positive association of circulating adiponectin with healthspan and lifespan. However, the direct effects of adiponectin on promoting healthspan and lifespan remain unexplored. Here, we are using an adiponectin null mouse and a transgenic adiponectin overexpression model. We directly assessed the effects of circulating adiponectin on the aging process and found that adiponectin null mice display exacerbated age-related glucose and lipid metabolism disorders. Moreover, adiponectin null mice have a significantly shortened lifespan on both chow and high-fat diet. In contrast, a transgenic mouse model with elevated circulating adiponectin levels has a dramatically improved systemic insulin sensitivity, reduced age-related tissue inflammation and fibrosis, and a prolonged healthspan and median lifespan. These results support a role of adiponectin as an essential regulator for healthspan and lifespan.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Adiponectin</kwd><kwd>longevity</kwd><kwd>healthspan</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>fat tissue</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01-AG051459</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Horvath</surname><given-names>Tamas L</given-names></name><name><surname>Dixit</surname><given-names>Vishwa Deep</given-names></name><name><surname>Scherer</surname><given-names>Philipp E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K01-DK125447</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>An</surname><given-names>Yu A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Adiponectin is an essential regulator for healthspan and is indispensable for sustaining a normal lifespan.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Healthspan and lifespan are intimately linked. Improving healthspan should help enhance the overall quality of life for an aging population, and possibly even extend lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crimmins, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Piskovatska et al., 2019</xref>). According to current estimates, by 2050, the number of older adults in the USA above the age of 65 years is expected to double, rising from 40.2 million to approximately 88 million (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db106.htm">https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db106.htm</ext-link>). In the USA, the average lifespan is around 79.3 years, while the estimated healthspan is only 67.3 years, indicating that the individuals will on average live up to 20% of their lives in an unhealthy state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Olshansky, 2018</xref>). Moreover, 35–40% of adults aged 65 and above are obese. Given both aging and obesity are independent risk factors for chronic diseases, it is important to further determine how the confluence of adiposity and aging impacts healthspan and lifespan. The primary health problems associated with elderly individuals are obesity and associated metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and many types of cancers. These diseases are global public health problems, significantly accelerating the aging process, and severely decreasing the quality of life and overall life expectancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jura and Kozak, 2016</xref>). Thus, increasing healthspan by prolonging a disease-free period of elderly individuals may be equally important as increasing lifespan. Simple strategies, such as caloric restriction, or pharmacological interventions, such as metformin or rapamycin treatment, can promote both healthspan and lifespan in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhullar and Hubbard, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bitto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Martin-Montalvo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Minor et al., 2010</xref>). However, the effectiveness of such an approach in humans still awaits confirmation. The search for novel and effective strategies to extend these processes is still one of the major goals of geroscience research.</p><p>Adiponectin was one of the earliest adipokines described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Scherer et al., 1995</xref>). Since its discovery, significant efforts have been made to study its regulation, biogenesis, and physiological effects. As an excellent biomarker for mature adipocytes, circulating adiponectin levels are inversely correlated with fat mass, distinguishing it from most of the other adipokines, including leptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu et al., 1996</xref>). Adiponectin exerts pleiotropic effects, including improving glucose tolerance, increasing insulin sensitivity, enhancing lipid clearance, and reducing systemic inflammation and tissue fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Scherer, 2006</xref>). Our previous studies have indicated that a lack of adiponectin in mice leads to glucose intolerance and hyperlipidemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nawrocki et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xia et al., 2018</xref>). Conversely, increasing adiponectin levels in an adiponectin transgenic (ΔGly) mouse model greatly improves metabolic homeostasis and produces a metabolically healthy obese phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Combs et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, chronic administration of adiponectin ameliorates glucose intolerance and enhances insulin sensitivity in both type 1 and 2 diabetic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berg et al., 2001</xref>). These observations fully support the favorable effects of adiponectin in promoting metabolic health.</p><p>Most of the previously published literature focuses on beneficial effects of adiponectin in younger mice or diet-induced obese mice within less than 20 weeks of a high-fat diet (HFD) challenge. Whether similar beneficial effects could be observed in aging mice (older than 100 weeks) remains unexplored. Beyond its possible role in healthspan, some human genetics studies have implicated adiponectin as a longevity gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atzmon et al., 2008</xref>). One potential mechanism of particular interest, with robust effects on elevating circulating adiponectin levels, is the starvation hormone fibroblast growth factor-21. It extends lifespan in both male and female mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holland et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, thiazolidinediones, agonists of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), also significantly increase circulating adiponectin levels and ameliorate aged-related tissue function decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Viljoen and Sinclair, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yu et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, female mice harbor higher circulating adiponectin levels and live longer compared to male mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gehrand et al., 2016</xref>). All these observations point to a positive correlation between high circulating adiponectin and longevity and implicate adiponectin as a novel circulating hormone that may directly promote both healthspan and lifespan in mice. To test this hypothesis, we used our established mouse models of adiponectin overexpression and complete absence of adiponectin and assessed the effect of circulating adiponectin on the aging process. Our results reveal that adiponectin null (APN-KO) mice have a significantly reduced healthspan and lifespan, while ΔGly mice have a significantly prolonged healthspan.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Altered adiponectin levels in APN-KO and adiponectin overexpressing transgenic mice</title><p>Male APN-KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nawrocki et al., 2006</xref>) and ΔGly mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Combs et al., 2004</xref>) were used for this study. The initial number of mice for each group in the study and a detailed scheme of the phenotypic assessments performed are outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>. APN-KO were challenged with chow diet (NCD) or HFD. ΔGly mice were challenged with NCD. Consistent with expectations, serum adiponectin was absent in APN-KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). For ΔGly mice, circulating adiponectin levels were increased by 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). All these observations indicate that our loss and gain of function mouse models indeed alter circulating adiponectin levels effectively as expected.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Deletion of adiponectin in aged mice shortens lifespan on HFD</title><p>Given that the loss of adiponectin leads to impaired glucose tolerance and lipid clearance, we wanted to test whether these mice have a shortened lifespan.

Compared to WT mice, APN-KO mice did not show any striking difference in body weight at middle and advanced age, both on NCD and HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). However, APN-KO mice exhibit a slight reduction in fat mass at advanced age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The reduction of fat mass seems to be due mainly to the loss of subcutaneous fat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We also found that adiponectin-deficient mice have increased bone content and higher bone mineral density during HFD feeding but normal values for NCD cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). We examined glucose homeostasis in aged mice (100 weeks for the HFD cohort and 140 weeks for the NCD cohort). In accordance with previous metabolic studies of young APN-KO mice, differences in glucose tolerance were marginal in mice fed standard NCD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). APN-KO mice fed HFD, in contrast, exhibited significantly higher glucose excursions during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) reflecting impaired glucose tolerance. However, no significant difference in plasma insulin level was observed during the OGTT at the different time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

We collected adipose tissue, kidney, and liver from separate aging cohorts of young (20 weeks) and old (100 weeks for HFD cohort and 140 weeks for NCD cohort) mice. Compared to WT mice, APN-KO mice did not show significant morphological differences in adipocytes in both young and aged mice.

Even during normal aging, the kidney develops age-related structural changes and displays functional declines, including nephrosclerosis, loss of renal mass, or compensatory hypertrophy of the remaining nephrons, with a corresponding decrease in glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Weinstein and Anderson, 2010</xref>). Clinical studies have demonstrated that adiponectin is elevated in patients with chronic kidney disease, suggesting a possible compensatory upregulation to alleviate further renal injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Christou and Kiortsis, 2014</xref>). Morphologically, APN-KO mice fed either the HFD or the NCD show more severe interstitial and periglomerular fibrosis. Compared to aged WT mice, the glomeruli in aged APN-KO mice have collapsed tufts, accompanied by hypertrophic Bowman’s capsules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Meanwhile, aged APN-KO mice exhibited a significant increase in kidney weight as compared with aged WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). To determine the cause of this severe glomerular and tubulointerstitial damage in APN-KO mice, we investigated the glomerular infiltration with macrophages. Immunohistochemical staining with Mac2 antibodies reveals a significant increase in Mac2 positive intraglomerular signal in the old mice which is vastly more abundant in the APN-KO mice fed the HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Markers of kidney inflammation, such as TNFα, IL1β, IL10, F4/80, MCP-1, and CRP, were assessed in total kidney tissues, isolated from both APN-KO and control mice. Across the board, the expression levels of inflammation markers were dramatically increased in adiponectin-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>Aging increases the susceptibility of various liver diseases as well, responsible for a deteriorated quality of life in the elderly and increasing mortality rate. Several studies suggest that hypoadiponectinemia predicts liver fibrosis and accelerates hepatic tumor formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Park et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, we explored whether the lack of adiponectin may exacerbate age-induced dysfunction and dysmorphology of the liver. Unlike other diet-induced obese mouse models, we did not find any enhanced lipid droplet accumulation in the livers of APN-KO mice compared to WT mice upon short-term and long-term exposure to HFD treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). However, we found many inflammatory infiltrates in the livers of APN-KO mice on HFD diet. The expression of inflammatory markers is significantly increased in aged APN-KO mice fed on HFD and NCD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), indicative of increased inflammation in the liver. Meanwhile, we found corticosteroids, key systemic anti-inflammatory factors, were upregulated in APN-KO mice compared to control mice, presumably as a compensatory response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To further assess the origin of these inflammatory markers, we have isolated macrophages from livers of WT and APN-KO mice and sorted out Kupffer cells and monocyte-derived macrophages. We found that the total number of macrophages in APN-KO mice is doubled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Moreover, compared to WT mice, Kupffer cells and monocyte-derived macrophages both increased in APN-KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), and Kupffer cells are the major source of the inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Hepatic stellate cells are the major cell types that produce collagen in response to a liver insult. In the APN-KO mice, significant increases in liver inflammation were observed, in part due to elevated total macrophage numbers and enhanced macrophage activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), thereby imposing a strong insult to the livers, resulting in hepatic stellate cell activation and liver fibrosis. Moreover, trichrome and Picrosirius red stains highlighting ECM components reveal increased hepatic fibrosis in old APN-KO mice on NCD that was even more evident under HFD conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Mirroring these histological findings, the expression levels of liver fibrosis markers, such as Col1α1 and αSMA, are strikingly increased in older HFD and NCD fed APN-KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Liver damage was further confirmed by elevated serum AST and ALT levels in HFD fed APN-KO mice compared with control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Senescent cells increasingly accumulate within tissues over the course of aging. Livers and kidneys of aged APN-KO mice display a higher percentage of senescent cells (as judged by senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining) compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Moreover, Cdkn2a and Glb1, as highly distinctive senescence markers, are also upregulated in kidneys and livers of APN-KO mice, both on NCD and on HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref>). The accumulation of these senescent cells over time may contribute to progressive kidney and liver failure observed. All of these observations support a model that suggests that adiponectin plays an essential role in maintaining normal liver function during the aging process.</p><p>Upon comparing young WT vs. APN-KO mice (20 weeks) that were exposed for 8 weeks to HFD, no genotype-specific differences were observed in the kidney and the liver. This therefore indicates that the pathological changes in older APN-KO mice genuinely reflect age-related chronic changes rather than simple developmental differences that would be apparent in the young mice as well. These findings clearly indicate that the lack of adiponectin during aging exacerbates liver and renal damage, at least in part through pro-inflammatory mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Increasing adiponectin protects mice from aged induced metabolic dysfunction</title><p>Clinically, adiponectin levels are significantly higher in centenarians and in some of their offspring, suggesting that adiponectin may be a key driver to promote healthspan and lifespan.

A large cohort of WT and ΔGly mice was placed on NCD to assess their lifespan. After calculation, a median lifespan in control mice was around 117 weeks, while this value in ΔGly mouse has been extended to 128 weeks (9% extension), indicating that increasing circulating adiponectin prolongs median lifespan.

However, whether these beneficial effects of adiponectin carry to older age has not been assessed. When fed with an NCD, ΔGly mice show a similar body weight during lifespan, compared to littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Then, we measured fasting glycemia, insulin, and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Under 16 hr fasted conditions, ΔGly mice have a significantly lower fasting glycemia, accompanied by a robust reduction in plasma insulin. Moreover, a reduction in circulating IGF-1 levels is observed in ΔGly mice. Lower IGF-1 levels are thought to play a key role as a mediator of healthspan and lifespan extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartke et al., 2003</xref>). To test whether the improvements in systemic insulin sensitivity are also associated with improvements at the level of the pancreatic β cell, we performed H&amp;E staining on pancreatic sections. Consistent with the reduced demand on islets to produce and release insulin in a more insulin-sensitive environment, the average islet size was considerably reduced by adiponectin overexpression, with islet structural integrity fully preserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Immunohistochemical analysis of islets exhibits a normal composition with α cells (glucagon) and β cells (insulin) in ΔGly mice. During an OGTT, ΔGly mice displayed a much lower glucose excursion than littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). In addition, insulin levels in ΔGly mice were significantly lower in response to the glucose challenge, which further supports improved insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).

ΔGly mice show a significant increase in insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), which is consistent with our results for the young mice.

The redistribution and ectopic fat deposition with aging appear to accelerate onset of multiple age-related diseases. A histological examination of adipose tissue showed that ΔGly mice harbor much smaller adipocytes in subcutaneous and gonadal fat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) compared to controls at the age of 140 weeks. In agreement with the epididymal adipocyte size and fat mass, inflammation is potently suppressed in visceral fat tissues of ΔGly mice, as demonstrated by a significantly reduced Mac2 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Moreover, it was quite apparent that visceral fat pad weight was reduced in ΔGly mice with a slightly increase in subcutaneous adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

Here, we systematically assessed the impact of adiponectin in the context of aging. Using APN-KO and adiponectin overexpressing mouse models, we have made the following observations: (1) The lack of adiponectin in mice curtails healthspan by impairing glucose and lipid homeostasis, and accelerating fibrogenesis in multiple tissues, resulting in reduced healthspan. (2) The lack of adiponectin in mice shortens lifespan both on NCD and HFD. (3) Increasing adiponectin levels in aged adiponectin overexpressing mice produces a healthy metabolic phenotype, with greatly increased glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, enhanced lipid clearance, lowered visceral fat, and potent protection from inflammation and fibrosis. (4) Adiponectin overexpressing mice on an NCD show a 9% increase in median lifespan. All these observations support that adiponectin is a vastly underestimated player in healthspan and lifespan.</p><p>Regarding the effects of adiponectin on lifespan, it is quite clear that APN-KO mice with no circulating adiponectin significantly shorten their lifespan, while ΔGly mice with an increase in circulating adiponectin only slightly increase their median lifespan, despite the substantial improvement in glucose and insulin tolerance and significant reduction in tissue inflammation and fibrosis. Tissue inflammation and fibrosis are suggested as one of the crucial contributing factors for lifespan. Consistent with this notion, increased liver inflammation and fibrosis in APN-KO mice results in a higher incidence of liver cancer. In HFD-fed aged WT mice, we observed a small number of mice with liver cancer (&lt;10%). However, in HFD-fed aged APN-KO mice, the rate of liver cancer increased up to 60%. Thus, increased rate of liver cancer and its associated cachexia possibly account for the shortened lifespan in APN-KO mice. In addition, this observation also suggests that inflammation or fibrosis itself is not the actual cause of death for the mice, but a precursor to cellular transformation, particularly in the liver. This may help explain the reduced inflammation and fibrosis in ΔGly mice only slightly increases their lifespan, implicating additional factors, in addition to reduced inflammation and fibrosis, may contribute to the natural cause of death of these mice.</p><p>Adiponectin has potent anti-fibrotic effects in the liver by activating PPARγ pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shafiei et al., 2011</xref>), which in turn diminishes the expression of pro-fibrotic genes. Despite having reduced levels of TG accumulation in the liver, the chronic lack of adiponectin dramatically exacerbates age-related liver fibrosis in parallel with disruption of liver function. In contrast, ΔGly mice are completely protected from diet- and aging-induced steatohepatitis and fibrosis, indicating of a crucial role of adiponectin in regulating liver inflammatory reactions and fibrosis. Hepatic stellate cells are the major cell types that produce collagen in response to liver insults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang and Friedman, 2020</xref>). In the APN-KO mice, significant increases in liver inflammation by elevated total macrophage numbers and enhanced macrophage activity impose a strong insult to liver. This results in hepatic stellate cell activation and liver fibrosis. In contrast, higher circulating levels of adiponectin, observed in ΔGly mice, greatly reduce liver inflammation, leading to reduced liver fibrosis. All these results suggest that local inflammation in livers is the major driver of liver fibrosis. Hence, the anti-inflammatory impact and potent anti-fibrotic actions of adiponectin make it a potent novel regulator of enhanced healthspan.</p><p>Obesity-associated chronic inflammation and insulin resistance are regarded as a pivotal risk factors for the development of several age-related pathological sequelae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huffman and Barzilai, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kanneganti and Dixit, 2012</xref>). Improved metabolic homeostasis is positively associated with lifespan in humans and mice. Prolongevity interventions, caloric restriction, and long-lived Ames dwarf mice all have increased adiponectin expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hill et al., 2016</xref>). We found that adiponectin mimics to some extent the impact of caloric restriction on the reduction in inflammation and improved metabolic homeostasis. Reduction in adiposity is considered to be a hallmark of caloric restriction, which is an important component of its beneficial effects on metabolism. After long-term caloric restriction, aged mice display lower adiposity, smaller adipocytes, and improved insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miller et al., 2017</xref>). Strikingly, increases in adiponectin expression are detected in these smaller adipocytes after caloric restriction. Adipocyte hypertrophy is associated with cellular stress and obesity-associated metabolic complications. Due to the limited capacity to expand subcutaneous adipose tissue in aged populations, adipocyte hypertrophy also occurs in visceral fat, which is associated with lipid spillover in multiple tissues in aging and ectopic fat accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tchkonia et al., 2013</xref>). Hypertrophic adipocytes and an impaired redistribution of lipids exert a negative impact on insulin responsiveness, contributing to many metabolic diseases frequently observed in the elderly. Thus, metabolic disorders frequently go hand in hand with aging. Clinical studies have identified a strong inverse relationship between circulating adiponectin and insulin resistance in obese individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Turer et al., 2011</xref>). Our previous data suggested that adiponectin strongly suppresses hepatic gluconeogenesis and enhances fatty acid oxidation, thereby strongly contributing to an overall beneficial metabolic regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang and Scherer, 2016</xref>). Our aged ΔGly mice still have dramatically improved insulin sensitivity in parallel with reduced plasma insulin. All of this happens primarily due to an increase in adipocyte numbers in subcutaneous fat of ΔGly mice. In the absence of the protective effects of adiponectin, aged APN-KO mice exacerbate diet- and aging-induced glucose intolerance and lipid disorders. Moreover, ΔGly mice show improved insulin sensitivity in parallel with lower insulin and IGF-1 levels, and higher IGF-1 in APN-KO mice. Attenuated activation of the growth hormone–IGF-1 axis is also an integral component of the beneficial effects of caloric restriction, leading to prolonged healthspan and lifespan in rodents. Interestingly, elevated adiponectin is detected in all long-live mice: This includes the adipocyte-specific insulin receptor knockout mice, the Ames dwarfs (df/df), and GHRKO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blüher et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Masternak et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). The similarities across all these models suggest that an increase in adiponectin levels may be the common denominator driving longevity in all models mentioned.</p><p>Combined, our studies, along with previous reports, demonstrate that adipose tissue plays a vital role in the aging process. In aging, dysfunctional fat tissue leads to ectopic fat deposition, lipodystrophic adipocytes, and subcutaneous fat loss, thereby contributing to increased systemic inflammation, metabolic disturbances, and functional declines in other organs. However, healthy fat pads have characteristic features not only in terms of the quantity, but more importantly, by the quality of adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kusminski et al., 2012</xref>). Adiponectin is a key player maintaining glucose and lipid homeostasis on the basis of its lipid-storing capacity and its ability to communicate with other organs. Thus, overexpressing adiponectin results in the healthy expansion of subcutaneous adipose tissue, a reduction of visceral fat and an improvement in inflammation and fibrosis in the liver, all of which greatly alleviates metabolic disturbances and protects against tissue functional decline during the aging process. In contrast, adiponectin deficiency increases susceptibility to metabolic diseases in the elderly. Impaired glucose tolerance and lipid clearance, severe inflammation accompanied by dysfunctional liver and kidney all reduce the quality of life and lifespan in the elderly. In addition to the beneficial effects of adiponectin on healthspan and lifespan, this study also provides some insights into the adiponectin paradox and adiponectin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhao et al., 2021</xref>). Some clinical observations imply the possible existence of an ‘adiponectin paradox’ in different disease settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Takamatsu et al., 2021</xref>) (arguing that a paradoxical increase of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality can be observed with increased adiponectin levels), our study in aged mice with either increasing or reducing adiponectin levels should offer a clear answer to the existence of this ‘adiponectin paradox’. If such an adiponectin paradox exists, chronically increasing adiponectin levels would result in a loss of its beneficial effects in aged mice. At least within the physiological range that we are operating on, this is clearly rejected by our current observations. In addition, with the results generated in our APN-KO mice, we would like to suggest that increasing adiponectin levels are always associated with beneficial effects in both young and old mice. Moreover, the chronic elevation of adiponectin levels in our transgenic mice also eliminates the possible existence of adiponectin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Engin, 2017</xref>), as persistent beneficial effects are maintained in aged transgenic adiponectin mice. In addition, the most striking observations relate to the lack of adiponectin in aged mice, as the mice lacking adiponectin display a greatly increased risk of developing liver cancer. This completely contradicts a previous report claiming that adiponectin may be a promoting factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). Considering the robust effects of adiponectin in reducing inflammation and fibrosis in aged mice, we have strong reason to believe that adiponectin is indeed a protective factor to prevent the development of liver cancer. Further studies will be warranted to explore the mechanistic aspects of adiponectin effects leading to preventing liver cancer. Thus, the ability to prolong healthspan by maintaining adiponectin levels provides a promising therapy for aging-related disorders and improving quality of life in older individuals.</p></sec><sec

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Carlos Isales as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Adiponectin is a key adipokine, and much of our knowledge about this molecule has come from the Scherer lab. It is well known that adiponectin promotes improved insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, along with anti-inflammatory effects, which can be followed by decreased fibrosis. In this paper the Authors use loss and gain of function mouse models to explore whether the beneficial effects of adiponectin on metabolism can be translated into greater healthspan or lifespan. They show that lifespan decreases in adiponectin KOs and increases in the transgenic (ΔGly) mice. The expected effects on glucose metabolism, insulin sensitivity, inflammation, and fibrosis are also demonstrated.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Given the known significant effects of adiponectin on metabolic fitness, the effects on healthspan which the Authors observed in their 2 models, was expected. However, while median survival time is definitely less in the APN-KOs and greater in the ΔGly mice, the effects are relatively modest compared to other longevity studies. Any increase in lifespan is a good thing, particularly when accompanied by a corresponding increase in healthspan. We would've hoped for greater effects on lifespan than those observed but even modest effects are worthwhile. The Authors should comment in their discussion on this point. In other words, it would be good to know the Authors' thinking as to why these impressive effects on glucose, insulin, inflammation, fibrosis, etc. do not lead to even greater effects on lifespan. Also, is there any information on the causes of mortality in the WT vs. KOs that might point to why lifespan is decreased?</p><p>2. APN-KO clearly leads to impaired glucose tolerance, but it is a bit surprising why insulin levels aren't increased, which is the typical metabolic response to insulin resistance.</p><p>3. Can the Authors please comment on adipose tissue mass in the KOs, particularly if they have any information on subq fat?</p><p>4. In Figure 3, they show increased staining for ATMs with Mac2 in the KOs. What about the expression of other inflammatory gene markers, such as those shown in Figure 3G for the liver?</p><p>5. With respect to hepatic effects, this paper shows increased inflammation in the liver in APN-KOs. However these gene expression patterns are in total liver tissue, and it would be helpful to understand the origin of these inflammatory markers. Are they from Kupffer cells, monocyte-derived macrophages, etc. In a similar vein, various fibrosis marker genes are increased in total liver from the APN-KOs. Most likely these expression differences reflect stellate cell effects. Do the Authors have any information on the effect of adiponectin on stellate cell function. Although fibrosis-related genes are elevated in the APN-KO, is there histologic evidence of increased fibrosis in the liver sections?</p><p>6. The Authors suggest that the increased inflammation in the liver is the cause of the increased fibrosis. Presumably they think that the immune cells in the liver are signaling to stellate cells to produce this effect. Is this the scenario the Authors propose. If so, it should be made more explicit and corroborated by histologic staining of hepatic fibrosis.</p><p>7. It would be of interest to know the extent of inflammation in the kidneys with APN-KO, beyond Mac2 staining (Figure 3D).</p><p>8. In the results in the ΔGly mice, is the enhanced lifespan statistically significant. Unless we are misreading it, the p value suggests it is not. Also, why have only study chow fed mice and not HFD mice in the transgenics, as they did in KOs?</p><p>9. ITTs are shown in Figure 4G, but the basal glucose values are different between the 2 groups. Can the Authors also present the data normalized to the basal value to determine whether the kinetics of the curve are different?</p><p>10. The resulting changes in tissue fibrosis are clearly important when thinking about healthy tissue function. It would help if the authors could show histologic staining for collagen deposition in the various tissues, particularly liver and kidney. Although it might be asking for too much if the they don't already have this information, it would also be useful to know which cell types within the various tissues are responsible for the changes in inflammatory markers and collagen related genes. This could also be discussed.</p><p>11. From an aesthetic point of view there is a certain lack symmetry in this paper, since some of the measurements made in the KOs are not performed in the transgenics and HFD was not utilized in the transgenics either.</p><p>12. Much of the data could be predicted from studies by them or the other investigators in the field (Nature Med. 8, 731 [2002], J. Biol. Chem. 277, 25863 [2002], J. Biol. Chem. 277, 34658 [2002], J.

IT would be helpful if authors could provide insights into the life-promoting mechanism by adiponectin that has not been clarified so far.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65108.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Tissue inflammation and fibrosis are suggested as one of the crucial contributing factors for lifespan. Consistent with this notion, the increased liver inflammation and fibrosis in APN-KO mice results in a higher incidence of liver cancer. In HFD-fed aged WT mice, we observed a small percentage of mice with liver cancer (&lt;10%). However, in HFD-fed aged APN-KO mice, the rate of liver cancer increased up to 60%. Thus, this increased rate of liver cancer and its associated cachexia possibly account for the shortened lifespan in APN-KO mice. In addition, this observation also suggests that inflammation or fibrosis itself is not the actual cause of death for the mice. This may help explain the reduced inflammation and fibrosis in adiponectin transgenic mice only slightly increases their lifespan, implicating other factors, in addition to reduced inflammation and fibrosis, may contribute to the natural death of these mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. APN-KO clearly leads to impaired glucose tolerance, but it is a bit surprising why insulin levels aren't increased, which is the typical metabolic response to insulin resistance.</p></disp-quote><p>A very interesting question. A typical metabolic response to insulin resistance is to increase circulating insulin levels to overcome the insulin resistance. Thus, impaired glucose tolerance in mice with high degrees of insulin resistance is always associated with higher circulating insulin levels, especially under conditions of high fat diet. However, in our APN-KO mice, while we observed impaired glucose and insulin tolerance, the circulating insulin levels do not increase. This observation can at least be partially explained by the direct effects of adiponectin on β cell function. In one of our previous reports, we have demonstrated that adiponectin is essential to mitigate local lipotoxicity in pancreatic islets and promote reconstitution of β cell mass. The lack of adiponectin in APN-KO mice directly impairs β cell function to compromise the cell’s ability to elevate insulin secretion, resulting in lower insulin levels in response to impaired glucose tolerance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

What about the expression of other inflammatory gene markers, such as those shown in Figure 3G for the liver?</p></disp-quote><p>A new figure (Figure 4A) regarding inflammatory gene markers has been added in the revised version of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. With respect to hepatic effects, this paper shows increased inflammation in the liver in APN-KOs. However these gene expression patterns are in total liver tissue, and it would be helpful to understand the origin of these inflammatory markers. Are they from Kupffer cells, monocyte-derived macrophages, etc. In a similar vein, various fibrosis marker genes are increased in total liver from the APN-KOs. Most likely these expression differences reflect stellate cell effects. Do the Authors have any information on the effect of adiponectin on stellate cell function. Although fibrosis-related genes are elevated in the APN-KO, is there histologic evidence of increased fibrosis in the liver sections?</p></disp-quote><p>An excellenet suggestion! As suggested, in the revised version, we have isolated macrophages from livers of WT and APNKO mice and sorted out Kupffer cells and monocyte-derived macrophages. We Figure 4C found that total macrophages in APNKO mice are increased by a factor of two (Figure 4C). Moreover, relative to WT mice, Kupffer cells and monocyte-derived macrophages both increased in APN-KO mice, and Kupffer cells are the major source of the increased inflammatory response (Figure 4C).</p><p>Regarding the effects of adiponectin on stellate cell function, a new manuscript is under preparation to specifically address this question.</p><p>In order to further corroborate the evidence for enhanced hepatic fibrosis, we have done additional trichrome and picrosirius red stains (Figure 3F), added in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The Authors suggest that the increased inflammation in the liver is the cause of the increased fibrosis. Presumably they think that the immune cells in the liver are signaling to stellate cells to produce this effect. Is this the scenario the Authors propose. If so, it should be made more explicit and corroborated by histologic staining of hepatic fibrosis.</p></disp-quote><p>Another excellent point. We fully agree with this scenario. We have an entire manuscript under preparation dedicated to the effects of adiponectin on hepatic stellate cells which will be submitted soon. In the revised version, we have added one paragraph in the discussion:</p><p>“Hepatic stellate cells are the major cell types that produce collage in response to liver injury. In the APNKO mice, a significant increase in liver inflammation by elevated total macrophage number and enhanced activity provides a strong insult to liver, resulting in hepatic stellate cell activation and liver fibrosis. In contrast, higher circulating levels of adiponectin, observed in adiponectin transgenic mice, greatly reduce liver inflammation, leading to reduced liver fibrosis. All these results suggest that the local inflammation in the liver is the major driver of liver fibrosis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. It would be of interest to know the extent of inflammation in the kidneys with APN-KO, beyond Mac2 staining (Figure 3D).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. In the revised version, we have added gene expression of inflammatory markers in the kidneys with APN-KO mice (Figure 4B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. In the results in the ΔGly mice, is the enhanced lifespan statistically significant. Unless we are misreading it, the p value suggests it is not. Also, why have only study chow fed mice and not HFD mice in the transgenics, as they did in KOs?</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by p value, the maximum lifespan does not reach statistical significance. However, the median lifespan in the ΔGly mice is greatly increased.</p><p>In this experiment, we did not perform HFD study in the ΔGly mice, due to the nature of aging study with large number of mice. For some unknown reasons, ΔGly mice do not breed very well, with fewer resulting offspring. We had a very difficult time to collect enough mice to initiate our aging study. So we decided to only perform a chow study in the ΔGly mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. ITTs are shown in Figure 4G, but the basal glucose values are different between the 2 groups. Can the Authors also present the data normalized to the basal value to determine whether the kinetics of the curve are different?</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, a new figure (Figure 5G) has been added in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. The resulting changes in tissue fibrosis are clearly important when thinking about healthy tissue function. It would help if the authors could show histologic staining for collagen deposition in the various tissues, particularly liver and kidney. Although it might be asking for too much if the they don't already have this information, it would also be useful to know which cell types within the various tissues are responsible for the changes in inflammatory markers and collagen related genes. This could also be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed picrosirius red staining in the kidney and liver, added in the revised version (Figure 4F). In addition, with FACS-sorted Kupffer cells and monocyte-derived macrophages, we found that Kupffer cells are the major sources of the inflammatory response (Figure 4C).</p><p>A new paragraph has been added in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. From an aesthetic point of view there is a certain lack symmetry in this paper, since some of the measurements made in the KOs are not performed in the transgenics and HFD was not utilized in the transgenics either.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand and appreciate this point. We strived to achieve symmetry in our manuscript, as the majority of measurements have been performed both in the KO and transgenic mice. However, due to the nature of aging studies with large number of transgenic mice, we were unable to collect a sufficient number of mice to initiate aging studies on both chow and HFD diets at the same time. This is the major reason for the asymmetries, and we appreciate that as a shortcoming.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. Much of the data could be predicted from studies by them or the other investigators in the field (Nature Med. 8, 731 [2002], J. Biol. Chem. 277, 25863 [2002], J. Biol. Chem. 277, 34658 [2002], J.

IT would be helpful if authors could provide insights into the life-promoting mechanism by adiponectin that has not been clarified so far.</p></disp-quote><p>Predictable – yes. However, these studies have never been performed systematically in an actual aging study. As a response, we have added one more paragraph discussion in the revised version.</p><p>“In addition to the beneficial effects of adiponectin on healthspan and lifespan, this study also provides some insights into the adiponectin paradox and adiponectin resistance (Zhao, Kusminski et al., 2021). […] Further studies will be warranted to explore the mechanistic aspects of adiponectin effects leading to preventing liver cancer”</p></body></sub-article></article>
