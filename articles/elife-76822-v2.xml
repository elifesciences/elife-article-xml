germ lines. Dysregulation of retroelement silencing is associated with male sterility. Although retroelement silencing mechanisms have been extensively studied in mouse germ cells, little progress has been made in humans. Here, we show that the Krüppel-associated box domain zinc finger proteins are associated with DNA methylation of retroelements in human primordial germ cells. Further, we show that the hominoid-specific retroelement SINE-VNTR-<italic>Alus</italic> (SVA) is subjected to transcription-directed de novo DNA methylation during human spermatogenesis. The degree of de novo DNA methylation in SVAs varies among human individuals, which confers significant inter-individual epigenetic variation in sperm. Collectively, our results highlight potential molecular mechanisms for the regulation of retroelements in human male germ cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>retroelements</kwd><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>human male germ cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18H05530</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shinkai</surname><given-names>Yoichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18H03991</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shinkai</surname><given-names>Yoichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006264</institution-id><institution>RIKEN</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SPDR</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fukuda</surname><given-names>Kei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Bioinformatics analyses reveal that the Krüppel-associated box domain zinc finger proteins are associated with DNA methylation of retroelements in human primordial germ cells which highlight potential molecular mechanisms for the regulation of retroelements in human male germ cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transposable elements comprise more than 40% of most extant mammalian genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lander et al., 2001</xref>). Among these, certain types of transposable elements called retroelements, including short/long interspersed elements (SINEs/LINEs) and hominoid-specific retrotransposons SINE-VNTR-<italic>Alus</italic> (SVA) are active in humans and can be transposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maksakova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ostertag et al., 2003</xref>). As retrotransposons cause genome instability, insertional mutagenesis, or transcriptional perturbation and are often deleterious to host species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">O’Donnell and Burns, 2010</xref>), multiple defense mechanisms have evolved against transposition. The first line of defense is transcriptional silencing of integrated retroelements by chromatin modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fukuda and Shinkai, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goodier, 2016</xref>). Most retroelement families are bound by Krüppel-associated box domain zinc finger proteins (KRAB-ZFPs), which coevolved to recognize specific retroelement families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Imbeault et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jacobs et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wolf et al., 2015</xref>). KRAB-ZFPs repress retroelements by recruiting KAP1/TRIM28 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sripathy et al., 2006</xref>) and other repressive epigenetic modifiers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schultz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schultz et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Restricting retroelements is especially important for germ cells, because only germ cells transmit genetic information to the next generation. During embryonic development, primordial germ cells (PGCs) undergo epigenetic reprogramming, characterized by DNA demethylation and global resetting of histone marks in mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gkountela et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kobayashi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Seisenberger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Seki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tang et al., 2015</xref>). A subset of young retroelements resists this global DNA demethylation event in PGCs, which may be required for retroelement silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gkountela et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kobayashi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Seisenberger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Seki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tang et al., 2015</xref>). H3K9 trimethylation mediated by SETDB1 is enriched in DNA demethylation-resistant retroelements in mouse PGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). As SETDB1 regulates DNA methylation of a subset of retroelements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matsui et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rowe et al., 2013</xref>), and it is recruited to the retroelements via interaction with KRAB-ZFPs, it has been hypothesized that SETDB1/KRAB-ZFPs may contribute to DNA demethylation resistance in PGCs.</p><p>In contrast to the extensive DNA hypomethylation in PGCs, the genomic DNA of sperm is highly methylated in both humans and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hammoud et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kobayashi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Molaro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Okae et al., 2014</xref>). Retroelements are also subjected to de novo DNA methylation during spermatogenesis in mice via the PIWI/piRNA pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aravin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Inoue et al., 2017</xref>). Epigenetic alterations in retroelements and dysfunction of retroelement silencing pathways in male germ cells are associated with male sterility linked to azoospermia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aravin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bourc’his and Bestor, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carmell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heyn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Urdinguio et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, epigenetic alterations of retroelements in male germ cells can be potentially transmitted to the next generation with phenotypic consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Daxinger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rakyan et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, deciphering the regulatory mechanisms of retroelements in germ cells contributes to the understanding of sterility and transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. Extensive studies have been conducted to understand DNA methylation mechanisms in mouse spermatogenesis; however, limited progress has been achieved in humans.</p><p>In this study, we aimed to clarify the regulatory mechanisms of DNA methylation of retroelements in human germ cells and performed an integrative analysis using three sets of previously reported data, which included whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data for human PGCs (hPGCs) and sperm, the transcriptome of human male germ cells, and comprehensive human KRAB-ZFPs ChIP-exo data.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transposable elements showing DNA demethylation resistance in hPGCs</title><p>To learn more about the factors that contribute to DNA demethylation resistance in hPGCs, we reanalyzed publicly available WGBS data for male hPGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guo et al., 2015</xref>). The global erasure of DNA methylation is mostly complete at 19 weeks of gestation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), therefore, we analyzed the DNA methylation status of full-length transposable elements (a copy whose length is 90% or more of the length of the consensus sequence of each subtype, listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) in male hPGCs at 19 weeks of gestation to identify retroelements that showed resistance to demethylation. We generally focused on the retroelement types that had been analyzed for the DNA methylation status more than 30 copies. Among the retroelements we analyzed, the primate-specific retroelement families L1PA, SVA, and LTR12 showed high levels of DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In the SVA family, SVA_A, which emerged 13–14 million years ago (Mya) and is the oldest SVA type, showed the highest DNA methylation levels relative to other SVA types. This includes the currently active SVA_E/F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In the L1 family, L1PA3–5, which emerged 12–20 Mya and is moderately young, showed higher methylation levels than the older (L1PA5–8) and younger L1 types, including the currently active L1 (L1HS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). LTR12 (also known as HERV9 LTR) is not currently active and all LTR12 types are highly methylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Therefore, it appears that young but inactive L1PA, SVA, and LTR12 types are resistant to DNA demethylation in hPGCs. Because 100 bp short-read NGS data did not map efficiently onto the currently active L1 transposon, L1HS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and DNA methylation of only about 10% of full-length L1HS copies could be analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), it is possible that a subset of L1HS is resistant to DNA demethylation. Epigenome analysis using long-read sequence technology, such as nanopore sequencing, may provide an answer to this question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ewing et al., 2020</xref>). Even though some retroelement types showed relatively high DNA methylation levels in hPGCs, the DNA methylation levels of each retroelement type were highly variable among full-length copies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>), which prompted us to try to identify potential DNA sequences required for DNA demethylation resistance. To this end, we classified each retroelement copy according to DNA methylation levels as follows: low &lt;20%, 20% ≤ medium &lt; 60%, and high ≥60%. Using this classification, we determined that both the ‘high’ and ‘low’ classes of copies exist in highly methylated retroelement types in hPGCs, such as SVA_A, L1PA3, and LTR12C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–H</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Retroelements showing DNA demethylation resistance.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Violin plots showing DNA methylation levels of each CpG site during human male germ-cell development.

Their activity is mediated by the recruitment of KAP1 and SETDB1, which induces retroelement DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matsui et al., 2010</xref>). To investigate whether KRAB-ZFPs could be involved in the DNA demethylation resistance of SVAs, we reanalyzed the binding peak data of 250 KRAB-ZFPs identified by ChIP-exo using exogenously tagged KRAB-ZFPs in human HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Helleboid et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Imbeault et al., 2017</xref>). We observed that the ZNF257 and ZNF28 peaks overlapped more frequently with highly methylated SVA_A copies than with lowly methylated copies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Because peaks of ZNF611 and ZNF91, which interact with SVAs in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haring et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jacobs et al., 2014</xref>), were observed in both lowly and highly methylated SVA_A copies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), it is unlikely that these two KRAB-ZNPs contribute to the differences in DNA methylation among SVA_A copies. Of the ‘high’ SVA_A elements, 63.8% and 44.7% were bound by ZNF257 or ZNF28, respectively. However, no ‘low’ SVA_A showed binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), and both ‘high’ and ‘medium’ SVA_A copies significantly overlapped with the ZNF257- or ZNF28-binding peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The frequency of overlap with the ZNF257/28 peaks and the enrichment of ZNF257/28 in SVA_A were positively correlated with DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>), and both ZNF257 and ZNF28 showed the highest enrichment of SVA_A when SVA family members were compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Identification of Krüppel-associated box domain zinc finger proteins (KRAB-ZFPs) associated with DNA demethylation resistance in SINE-VNTR-<italic>Alus</italic> (SVAs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scatter plots showing the fraction of low-methylated or highly methylated SVA_A copies which overlaps of KRAB-ZFP peaks.

Therefore, SVAs located in actively transcribed regions in the antisense orientation are efficiently subjected to de novo DNA methylation during spermatogenesis.

Although the DNA methylation profiles between the two donors were highly correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), 2008 regions were identified as DMRs (donor 1 &lt; donor 2: 332, donor 2 &lt; donor 1: 1676). Of the 1676 donor 1-specific methylated DMRs, 772 (46.1%) overlapped with SVAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). We also observed differential DNA methylation among individuals in SVA-associated DMRs in our amplicon-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Therefore, SVAs significantly contribute to inter-individual variations in the sperm epigenome. In contrast to the inter-individual epigenetic variation of SVAs in sperm, a reanalysis of WGBS data of adult skeletal muscle from 15 individuals and of helper CD4-positive T cells from 18 individuals, which was deposited in the International Human Epigenome Consortium (IHEC) portal, showed high DNA methylation of SVAs in all individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bujold et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Thus, inter-individual variations in DNA methylation of SVAs in sperm are essentially canceled during development.</p><p>Finally, to investigate whether inter-individual DNA methylation variations are associated with physiological or disease conditions, we reanalyzed publicly available WGBS data from five healthy donors and six oligozoospermic patients (European Nucleotide Archive [ENA] under the accession number PRJEB34432) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leitão et al., 2020</xref>). The disease condition was not associated with inter-individual DNA methylation variations in SVAs, because both healthy donors and oligozoospermic patients showed inter-individual variations of DNA methylation in ‘high and low’ SVA_B–F copies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). On the other hand, a comparison of various physiological conditions between highly methylated individuals and lowly methylated ones (median methylation levels of ‘high and low’ &gt; 50% vs. &lt; 50%) revealed that blood testosterone levels were significantly higher in lowly methylated individuals than in highly methylated ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). However, prolactin, follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone (LH), sex hormone-binding globulin blood levels, and age were not significantly different between the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Although further validation of this correlation is required, DNA methylation of SVAs in sperm may be associated with physiological conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we showed that the binding potential of KRAB-ZFPs correlates with retroelement DNA demethylation resistance in hPGCs. Furthermore, we found that de novo DNA methylation patterns in spermatogenesis vary among the L1, LTR, and SVA retroelements. In addition, we ascertained that the SVAs located in transcription-active regions in the antisense orientation are prone to methylation during spermatogenesis, which implies that the transcription-directed DNA methylation machinery might contribute to de novo DNA methylation of SVAs in male germ cells. Notably, the extent of de novo DNA methylation of SVAs in male germ cells is variable among human individuals, with SVAs being a major source of epigenetic variation in sperms.</p><p>We showed that DNA demethylation resistance in hPGCs frequently occurred in moderately young retroelements such as L1PA, SVA_A, and LTR12, but not in currently active retroelements. Because we targeted full-length transposons, our analysis was biased toward relatively young transposons. Thus, it is possible that some fragmented older transposons may also be resistant to DNA demethylation in hPGCs. A subset of LTR transposons, including LTR12, function as enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deniz et al., 2020</xref>). It was recently reported that LTR5s, which are Hominidae-specific LTR-type transposons and hypomethylated in hPGCs (DNA methylation levels &lt; 10%), can function as enhancers to promote hPGC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xiang et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, in the case of LTR12C, maintaining DNA methylation might be beneficial for hPGC development because it suppresses inappropriate activation of transposon-embedded enhancer function.</p><p>In addition, KRAB-ZFP binding potentially contributed to the DNA demethylation resistance of L1s and SVAs. ZNF257/28, ZNF649/ZNF93, and ZNF850 were associated with the DNA demethylation resistance of SVAs, L1s, and LTR12Cs, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In hPGCs, multiple KRAB-ZNPs were correlated with DNA demethylation resistance in the same retroelements, which may contribute to more robust or cooperative retroelement suppression. Although ZNF91 reportedly binds to the VNTR in SVAs and silences SVA expression in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haring et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jacobs et al., 2014</xref>), the DNA demethylation resistance of SVAs did not correlate with ZNF91 binding, indicating that a different KRAB-ZFP set is used to suppress SVAs in human PGCs and ESCs. Both ZNF257 and ZNF28 bound to VNTR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), and high copy numbers of VNTR1 were correlated with high ZNF257 and ZNF28 enrichment and DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H1</xref>). The reduction in VNTR1 copy number after SVA_B emergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) may have been necessary for SVAs to escape silencing mechanisms in hPGCs. The human genome encodes at least 350 KRAB-ZFPs, and not all KRAB-ZFPs were included in the ChIP-seq dataset used in this study (100 copies remained unmapped). Thus, the involvement of other KRAB-ZFPs in DNA demethylation resistance of retroelements in hPGCs is possible. Although we observed a strong correlation between KRAB-ZFPs and DNA demethylation resistance, direct evidence for this correlation remains elusive because of the limited availability of human fetal gonads and of high-specificity antibodies for KRAB-ZFPs. Because they can function as in vitro derivation systems, PGC-like cells (PGCLCs) may be a promising model for investigating the biology of PGCs. Although successful establishment of human PGCLCs has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sasaki et al., 2015</xref>), sufficient DNA demethylation has not been observed in human PGCLCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">von Meyenn et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the currently available human PGCLCs are not suitable models for investigating the mechanisms of DNA demethylation resistance. Optimizing the derivation conditions for human PGCLCs will aid in our understanding of retroelement silencing in PGCs.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Summary of this study.</title><p>Our data demonstrated an association between KRAB-ZFP-binding motifs and the DNA demethylation resistance of L1, SVA, and LTR12. ZNF649, ZNF257/28, and ZNF850 were associated with DNA demethylation resistance of L1, SVA, and LTR12C, respectively. The dynamics of DNA methylation during spermatogenesis are largely different among retroelement types. The majority of L1 copies acquired DNA methylation during spermatogenesis, whereas the DNA methylation status of LTR12 in human primordial germ cells (hPGCs) tended to be maintained during spermatogenesis. The mode of DNA methylation changes in SINE-VNTR-<italic>Alus</italic> (SVAs) during spermatogenesis largely differs between copies and individuals. SVA copies located in highly transcriptionally active regions acquire DNA methylation during spermatogenesis, while those located in transcriptionally inactive regions maintain a hypomethylated state during spermatogenesis. In contrast, the degree of DNA methylation in sperm in SVA copies located in low transcriptionally active regions was highly variable among the individuals. These results suggest that SVAs may be methylated by transcription-directed DNA methylation mechanisms during spermatogenesis, and their activity varies among individuals.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-76822-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Additionally, we showed that the mode of DNA methylation acquisition during spermatogenesis was very different among retroelement types. The majority of L1 copies acquired DNA methylation during spermatogenesis, whereas LTR12 maintained its DNA methylation status in hPGCs during spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). L1HS, which both ZNF93 and ZNF649 were unable to bind, also acquired DNA methylation during spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), suggesting the involvement of other factors in the de novo DNA methylation of L1 during spermatogenesis. The PIWI-piRNA pathway is responsible for the DNA methylation of L1 transposons in mouse male germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aravin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carmell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kojima-Kita et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Manakov et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shoji et al., 2009</xref>). The PIWI-piRNA pathway may also be functional in humans, because mutations in genes associated with the PIWI-piRNA pathway are linked to human male infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arafat et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gu et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, the majority of putative piRNAs that mapped to transposons at gestational week 20 are derived from L1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Reznik et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, the PIWI-piRNA pathway is a candidate pathway for L1 silencing in human male germ cells.</p><p>Our data showed that the acquisition of DNA methylation of SVAs during spermatogenesis correlated with the inserted regions and not with the nucleotide sequence. SVAs inserted in transcriptionally active regions in the antisense direction are efficiently targeted for de novo DNA methylation during spermatogenesis. In mouse spermatogenesis, MIWI2 binds piRNAs and is recruited to the nascent transcribed regions that are complementary to piRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Watanabe et al., 2018</xref>). Subsequently, MIWI2-interacting protein SPOCD1, which forms a complex with DNMT3A and DNMT3L, and potentially with a rodent-specific DNA methyltransferase DNMT3C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barau et al., 2016</xref>), induces DNA methylation on transposons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zoch et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, one possible mechanism for the de novo DNA methylation of SVAs during spermatogenesis is that the MIWI2/SVA-derived piRNA complex targets nascent transcripts with antisense SVAs and induces DNA methylation. There are also other transcription-directed repetitive element silencing mechanisms, such as those involving the HUSH complex, which repress L1s and SVAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fukuda et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Robbez-Masson et al., 2018</xref>). The HUSH complex targets young full-length L1s located within the introns of actively transcribed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fukuda and Shinkai, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). In addition to the HUSH complex, efficient pericentromeric heterochromatin formation requires the transcription of pericentromeric satellite repeats, which stabilize SUV39H pericentromeric localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Johnson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shirai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Velazquez Camacho et al., 2017</xref>). Because SUV39H is also associated with retroelement silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bulut-Karslioglu et al., 2014</xref>), both the HUSH complex and SUV39H are candidate factors associated with the transcription-directed DNA methylation of SVAs in human male germ cells. In eukaryotes, gene bodies are the most conserved targets of DNA methylation. Gene body DNA methylation levels are often correlated with transcriptional levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Teissandier and Bourc’his, 2017</xref>). This is because of the interaction between the elongating RNA polymerase II and SETD2, which results in H3K36me3. H3K36me3 participates in the de novo methylation of DNA by recruiting DNMT3 enzymes via their chromatin reading PWWP domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baubec et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shirane et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, antisense RNAs embedded within protein-coding genes are selectively silenced by H3K36 methyltransferase SET2 in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Venkatesh et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the machinery for gene body DNA methylation regulated by SETD2 is also a candidate for the de novo DNA methylation of SVAs during spermatogenesis.</p><p>The mechanism underlying inter-individual epigenetic variations in SVA in human sperm is unknown. In addition to genetic differences among individuals, both intrinsic and extrinsic environmental differences may contribute to inter-individual variations in SVAs. Our data indicate that in sperm, the degree of DNA methylation of SVAs located in genomic regions with low transcriptional activity varies among individuals. Thus, the effectiveness of transcription-directed de novo DNA methylation in male human germ cells may vary among individuals. Previous studies have shown that hypermethylation of the <italic>PIWIL2</italic> and <italic>TDRD1</italic> promoter regions, which are involved in the PIWI-piRNA pathway, is associated with abnormal DNA methylation and male infertility in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heyn et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, the effectiveness of the PIWI-piRNA pathway may vary among individuals and contribute to the epigenetic variation of SVAs in male germ cells. SVAs function as enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gianfrancesco et al., 2017</xref>), alter the chromatin state near the insertion site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fukuda et al., 2017</xref>), and are associated with Fukuyama-type congenital muscular dystrophy and Lynch syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ostertag et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Payer and Burns, 2019</xref>). Therefore, differences in SVA regulation among individuals may induce changes in gene regulation in male germ cells, alter the risk of genome instability, and affect the incidence of disease among individuals.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Semen collection</title><p>Ejaculates were provided by patients who visited the Reproduction Center of the Ichikawa General Hospital, Tokyo Dental College.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Transcriptional states of retroelement-inserted regions and specific KRAB zinc finger protein association are correlated with DNA methylation of retroelements in human male germ cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Molly Przeworski as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Michael Imbeault (Reviewer #1); Geoffrey Faulkner (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agreed the study was well conducted and although was initially done on a limited number of available samples, the important observation regarding the inter-individual variability of SVA methylation in sperm was replicated in an additional dataset with more donors and further confirmed by targeted amplicon sequencing. The conclusions regarding the DNA methylation dependency towards specific KZFPs is not novel, although it was extended here to the context of primordial germ cells. The most intriguing conclusion is certainly the description of inter-individual differences in SVA methylation in the sperm of different donors. A link with being positioned inside a highly transcribed gene and in reverse orientation towards the host gene was drawn regarding the propensity of being methylated for an SVA, but the explanation for this is very uncertain. Results appear as preliminary on this matter.</p><p>Please address the following points in a revised version of your manuscript, and answer the individual comments and questions raised by the reviewers in a detailed rebuttal letter, with possible corrections and additional figures to be included in the manuscript.</p><p>1 – Integrate all the KZFP datasets that are available in GSE120539 (but that were not published) in your analysis</p><p>2 – Is it know whether interindividual differences in SVA methylation are also found in somatic tissues, or is it a specific feature of sperm DNA? If this has not been described, please analyze available WGBS datasets focusing on one tissue of several donors, or use your amplicon sequencing strategy. This would be an important addition to the biological meaning of such differences, whether this variability also occurs during embryonic reprogramming, not only germ cell reprogramming.</p><p>3 – Provide more information as to the methodology for full length retroelement analysis and ages of sperm donors</p><p>4 – Please show screen shots of individual loci that follow the stated correlation of DNA methylation and KZFP binding</p><p>5 – Review all sentences with over statements, as outlined by reviewer #1.</p><p>Additionally, please correct the following points:</p><p>– Line 304: &quot;… subsequently, MIWI2-interacting protein SPOCD1 recruits the chromatin remodeling complex DNMT3A and DNMT3L to…&quot;. This sentence is wrong twice: (1) DNMT3A-DNMT3L does not have chromatin remodeling ability per se, it is a de novo DNA methylation complex, and (2) DNMT3C methylates piRNA-targeted retroelements in mice, not DNMT3A (see Barau et al., 2016). Please correct as you are referring here to the process that has been described in mice.</p><p>– The link between intragenic position of SVAs and their ability to undergo methylation by transcriptional readthrough/H3K36 methylation is interesting, as it means it would happen in a piRNA-independent manner. However, it does not explain why only the SVA elements with a reverse orientation to the host gene would be affected. Please report this.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I am a researcher active in the field of KRAB zinc finger proteins for about 12 years. In my opinion, the science in this manuscript is high quality and the findings as novel as they are interesting.</p><p>I have a few small recommendations to improve some sections of the manuscript and would appreciate if they can be implemented before publication.</p><p>Early in the manuscript it is stated that &quot;we focused on full-length copies of retroelements to analyze 85 DNA methylation for at least 30 copies.&quot;. What did you consider as 'full-length', especially for LTR-containing retroviruses? Did you analyze only copies containing the internal part, discarding solo-LTRs? I could not find details describing this in the methods section. Also, this decision is probably biasing the analysis toward younger elements – not a problem in itself, but it should be stated clearly.</p><p>With very young elements (L1Hs) the mappability is probably not very good with 100bp non-paired end reads. Could you provide a supplemental table with average mappability per family of transposons, or as a supplemental figure as a violinplot of mappability per family.</p><p>There's more data of KZFP that is available that was not included – notably at GEO accession GSE120539 from the Trono lab – these are from the same experimental series as the ones published initially but didn't make it through analysis before publication – it would be great if you can include them.</p><p>For figure 2, I would like to see statistics of enrichment (p-value) for overlaps with specific KZFPs / families of transposons and DNA methylation categories.</p><p>Figure 2A – a heatmap is not the best visualization here – it could be a simple sorted barchart of hits zoomed in on the first few members with the highest scores. Same comment for figure 3H.</p><p>Review all sentences that are related to conclusions to avoid overly strong wording, considering that most findings of this manuscript are purely correlative and causation has not been demonstrated. As an example (out of many): &quot;Therefore, SVAs are methylated during spermatogenesis if these are inserted into actively transcribed genes.&quot; – this is too strong, you might want to add 'suggest, might, potentially'.</p><p>Please discuss somewhere in the manuscript the potential for multiple KZFPs binding the same elements having a concerted effect on the elements.</p><p>Finally, I would like to see the age distribution of the sperm donors, and some analysis to see if variability is correlating with age in any way.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>My two major reservations are the claims around inter-individual variability being difficult to distinguish from technical variablity, which I don't have a reasonable suggestion for how to address, and the first specific point above, namely that uniquely mapped WGBS reads are unlikely to measure methylation in the core VNTR region of an SVA (or the L1HS 5'UTR CpG island). The authors could address this point by showing a composite profile of WGBS coverage and methylation levels compared to L1/SVA consensus sequences, showing the inner parts of L1 and SVA. They could also show examples of individual loci that follow the stated patterns of DNA methylation and ZFP binding that supports a correlation between the two. Another option would be to do nanopore long-read sequencing, which obviously would take time and substantial resources, but would provide a comprehensive picture of the situation. Note that this issue affects some of the more high profile mouse retrotransposons, such as IAP, to a much lesser degree because their LTRs are more accessible to WGBS.</p><p>I think the figure legends for Figure 2E and Figure 2F are swapped.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76822.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1 – Integrate all the KZFP datasets that are available in GSE120539 (but that were not published) in your analysis</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestion.

This is also important point.</p><p>To address this issue, we reanalyzed IHEC DNA methylation data from adult skeletal muscle (15 samples) and CD4-positive helper T cells (18 samples). As all SVA groups showed high DNA methylation in all individuals tested, inter-individual variation of SVA DNA methylation in sperm would be cancelled during development (Supplementary Figure S5A, B). We stated this result in the text.</p><p>“In contrast to the inter-individual epigenetic variation of SVAs in sperm, a reanalysis of WGBS data of adult skeletal muscle from 15 individuals and of helper CD4-positive T cells from 18 individuals, which was deposited in the International Human Epigenome Consortium (IHEC) portal, showed high DNA methylation of SVAs in all individuals (Bujold et al., 2016) (Figure 6—figure supplement 1A, B).

The disease condition was not associated with inter-individual DNA methylation variations in SVAs, because both healthy donors and oligozoospermic patients showed inter-individual variations of DNA methylation in “High and Low” SVA_B–F copies (Figure 6—figure supplement 1C).

The authors could address this point by showing a composite profile of WGBS coverage and methylation levels compared to L1/SVA consensus sequences, showing the inner parts of L1 and SVA. They could also show examples of individual loci that follow the stated patterns of DNA methylation and ZFP binding that supports a correlation between the two. Another option would be to do nanopore long-read sequencing, which obviously would take time and substantial resources, but would provide a comprehensive picture of the situation. Note that this issue affects some of the more high profile mouse retrotransposons, such as IAP, to a much lesser degree because their LTRs are more accessible to WGBS.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your valuable comment/suggestion.
