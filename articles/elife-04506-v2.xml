Here, we show that Set1, the catalytic subunit of the highly conserved Set1C/COMPASS complex responsible for histone H3K4 methylation (H3K4me), behaves as a repressor of the transcriptome largely independent of Set1C and H3K4me in the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>. Intriguingly, while Set1 is enriched at highly expressed and repressed loci, Set1 binding levels do not generally correlate with the levels of transcription. We show that Set1 is recruited by the ATF/CREB homolog Atf1 to heterochromatic loci and promoters of stress-response genes. Moreover, we demonstrate that Set1 coordinates with the class II histone deacetylase Clr3 in heterochromatin assembly at prominent chromosomal landmarks and repression of the transcriptome that includes <italic>Tf2</italic> retrotransposons, noncoding RNAs, and regulators of development and stress-responses. Our study delineates a molecular framework for elucidating the functional links between transcriptome control and chromatin organization.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04506.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04506.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04506.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Genes can be turned on or off at different times in an organism's life. In humans, yeast and other eukaryotes, this is mainly controlled by the way DNA is packaged with proteins—known as histones—in a structure called chromatin. Genes that are switched on, or only temporarily switched off, are associated with areas of the genome where the chromatin is loosely packed. In contrast, genes that remain switched off for long periods of time are found in regions—known as heterochromatin—where the chromatin is tightly packed.</p><p>There are many enzymes that can modify histones to change the structure of chromatin. One enzyme—called Set1—adds a methyl tag to chromatin, which is known to be associated with genes being switched on. However, Lorenz et al. found that Set1 also has other roles in modifying chromatin in the yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>.</p><p>The experiments found that Set1 helps to keep genes switched off and that this role is largely independent of its ability to add the methyl tag to chromatin. Set1 is recruited to many sites across the genome by another protein called Atf1, which is involved in the cell's response to environmental stresses. Lorenz et al. believe that this helps to put these genes in a ‘poised’ off state so that they are ready to be switched on rapidly if needed.</p><p>Set1 also works with another protein that removes acetyl tags—which encourage chromatin to be less tightly packed—from histones. Together, both proteins contribute to the assembly of heterochromatin and keep genes involved in development and stress responses switched off when they are not required.</p><p>Collectively, these experiments reveal unexpected and important insights into how Set1—which plays critical roles in many aspects of human health including aging and cancer—works in cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04506.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04506.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>set1</kwd><kwd>heterochromatin</kwd><kwd>transcriptome</kwd><kwd>atf1</kwd><kwd>HDAC</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. pombe</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000912</institution-id><institution>March of Dimes Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cam</surname><given-names>Hugh P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005303</institution-id><institution>Boston College</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cam</surname><given-names>Hugh P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Set1 has roles in chromatin organization and transcriptome control that are largely independent of histone H3 lysine 4 methylation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The packaging of eukaryotic DNA with histones into chromatin provides ample opportunities for chromatin-modifying factors to exert extensive control over many aspects of genome-based processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kouzarides, 2007</xref>). In particular, enzymes catalyzing the covalent posttranslational modifications of histones are increasingly seen as critical regulators of transcription and the assembly of chromatin into various functional domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Henikoff and Shilatifard, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badeaux and Shi, 2013</xref>). Two of the better understood posttranslational modifications of histones are acetylation and methylation. Whereas acetylation of histones by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) is generally associated with gene activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rando and Chang, 2009</xref>), deacetylation of histones by histone deacetylases (HDACs) tends to correlate with gene repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yang and Seto, 2008</xref>). Coordinated activities among HATs result in region-wide hyperacetylated chromatin states, leading to the formation of euchromatin domains supporting active transcription, and conversely, hypoacetylated chromatin states catalyzed by HDACs give rise to heterochromatin domains refractory to transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grunstein, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grewal and Jia, 2007</xref>). In contrast, histone methylation is associated with either transcriptional activation or repression, and hence, with euchromatin or heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huisinga et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Henikoff and Shilatifard, 2011</xref>). Two well-characterized methylation marks occurring on two closely spaced residues near the amino-terminal tail of histone H3 exemplify this pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grewal and Jia, 2007</xref>). Methylation at lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4me) and at lysine 9 (H3K9me) distinguishes euchromatin and heterochromatin, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Litt et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Noma et al., 2001</xref>). However, studies from the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> and other systems show that the euchromatic and heterochromatic landscapes are somewhat fluid, with islands of H3K9me transiently assembled within euchromatin at certain meiotic genes and the 3′ ends of convergent genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cam et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huisinga et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gullerova and Proudfoot, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zofall et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tashiro et al., 2013</xref>). Conversely, the RNA interference (RNAi) and exosome machineries, certain HATs and an active RNA polymerase II (Pol II) have been documented to contribute directly to the assembly of heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Volpe et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Djupedal et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kato et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buhler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xhemalce and Kouzarides, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reyes-Turcu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yamanaka et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>These observations point to the potential roles for other chromatin-modifying factors normally associated with euchromatin in heterochromatin assembly. In particular, the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> homolog of Set1 (KMT2) responsible for H3K4 methylation (H3K4me) has been implicated in transcriptional silencing at a number of genetic elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nislow et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krogan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berretta et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Camblong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim and Buratowski, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van Dijk et al., 2011</xref>). Set1 forms the catalytic engine of a highly conserved chromatin-modifying complex termed Set1C or COMPASS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shilatifard, 2012</xref>). Set1C subunits have been shown to be recruited to active Pol II genes and provide the H3K4me signature for the gene-rich euchromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krogan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ng et al., 2003</xref>). H3K4me can exist in a mono- (H3Kme1), di- (H3K4me2), or tri- (H3K4me3) methylated form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kusch, 2012</xref>). The three forms of H3K4me have different distributions, with H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 enriched at gene promoters and gene bodies, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cam et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pokholok et al., 2005</xref>). H3K4me1 is enriched at the 3′ end of Pol II genes in budding yeast and at enhancers in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pokholok et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heintzman et al., 2007</xref>). Gene expression profiling analyses ascribe the repressor function of Set1C to H3K4me2 and/or H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Margaritis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Weiner et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>We have recently discovered a role for the <italic>S. pombe</italic> Set1 in the transcriptional repression and genome organization of long terminal repeat <italic>Tf2</italic> retrotransposons and heterochromatic repeats that are dependent and independent of the Set1C complex and H3K4 methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lorenz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mikheyeva et al., 2014</xref>). In this study, we investigate the regulatory control of the fission yeast transcriptome by Set1 and its associated Set1C subunits. By systematically analyzing the transcriptomes of H3K4me mutants and mutant strains deficient in each of the Set1C subunits, we find that even though loss of H3K4me generally results in derepression, Set1 exerts its repressive function on most of its targets largely independently of the other Set1C subunits and H3K4me. Intriguingly, genome-binding profiles showed that Set1 localization is not linearly correlated with the levels of transcription at its target loci. In addition to localization at active Pol II genes, Set1 localizes to repetitive elements and repressed loci associated with development and stress-response pathways. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the conserved stress-response ATF/CREB Atf1 transcription factor mediates the recruitment of Set1 and modulates the levels of H3K4me3 at the centromere central cores and ribosomal DNA array. We show that Set1 coordinates with the class II HDAC Clr3 to mediate the assembly of H3K9me-associated heterochromatin and genome-wide repression of diverse transcripts, including <italic>Tf2</italic> retrotransposons, noncoding RNAs, and developmental and stress-response genes. Our study illuminates a surprising cooperation between two histone-modifying enzymes with seemingly opposing activities in imposing genome-wide repression over the transcriptome and organizing the genome into euchromatin and heterochromatin.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Set1 behaves as a general repressor largely independent of its H3K4me function and other Set1C subunits</title><p>Set1 is the catalytic engine of the Set1C complex that includes seven other subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roguev et al., 2003</xref>).

Consistent with its documented recruitment to active Pol II genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ng et al., 2003</xref>), Set1 is enriched at sites that correspond to highly active Pol II promoters, including those of the housekeeping gene <italic>act1</italic> and the ribosomal protein <italic>rps1</italic>02 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Surprisingly, despite little enrichment of Pol II at certain lowly expressed genes (e.g., <italic>scr1</italic>) and repressed developmental genes (e.g., <italic>ste11</italic>), noticeable Set1 binding was detected at the promoters of these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Set1 localization at active and repressed targets was not hampered by the loss of H3K4me or its catalytic activity. Indeed, the inability of the <italic>set1F</italic><sup><italic>H3K4me−</italic></sup> to methylate H3K4 appears to enhance its association with chromatin. To discern the relationship between Set1 binding and the transcriptional status of its targets, we ranked 290 protein-coding genes with significant Set1 binding (chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) fold enrichment ≥2 at three or more adjacent probes) according to their expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, left panel). While transcript abundance generally correlated with Pol II occupancy levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, middle panel) and 80% of promoter regions enriched for Set1 corresponded to actively transcribed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), transcript abundance or Pol II occupancy levels did not linearly correlate with the levels of Set1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, right panel). Functional differences between high-abundance and low-abundance Set1-bound genes were assessed by GO analysis of genes rank-ordered by expression levels into quintiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Whereas highly expressed genes occupied by Set1 were enriched with expected GO terms associated with rapid exponential growth (ribosome, translation, glycolysis), Set1-bound genes with low abundance transcripts (excluding heterochromatic noncoding RNAs due to limited GO annotation) were enriched for terms related to stress response, cell wall and membrane-bound protein biogenesis, and Pol II transcription factor function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Thus, our results suggest that Set1 localization at chromatin is not solely dependent on active Pol II, and that Set1 localization at lowly expressed or repressed loci might be functionally distinct from its canonical role at active Pol II genes.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04506.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Set1 localizes to lowly expressed and repressed loci.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) Enrichment of Set1 and RNA polymerase II (Pol II) determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)–chip displaying significant Set1 enrichment at highly transcribed genes (<bold>A</bold>) and repressed genes (<bold>B</bold>).

For example, Ash2 and Sdc1 are thought to form heterodimers that together with Swd1 and Swd3 constitute the core of the Set1C complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roguev et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dehe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Southall et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). Yet, while their expression profiles are most similar to each other, there are even differences between them, with the <italic>sdc1</italic> mutant displaying stronger derepression for a subset of genes involved in response to oxidative stress than those seen in the <italic>ash2</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These similarities and differences might reflect their association with other chromatin modifiers such as the Lid2 complex, not present in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roguev et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shevchenko et al., 2008</xref>).

Our findings show that unlike the results reported for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, Set1 in <italic>S. pombe</italic> not only exerts more regulatory influence over the transcriptome, but also mediates its repressive function largely independently of the other Set1C subunits and H3K4 methylation—probably, as a consequence of the uncoupling of Set1 protein stability from H3K4me levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mikheyeva et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>S. pombe</italic> Set1 has been reported as a component of at least two complexes: a large ∼1 MDa complex similar in size to that of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Set1C and a smaller complex (∼800 kDa) containing a shorter version of Set1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roguev et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, Set1 might mediate its repressive nonH3K4me function via a distinct form of Set1 different from the form associated with the canonical Set1C complex.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Regulation of repetitive elements, developmental and stress-response loci by Set1 and Atf1</title><p>Our study reveals extensive functional interactions across the genome between Set1 and the stress-response transcription factor Atf1 at stress-response genes and major chromosomal landmarks, including the tandem rDNA array and centromeres.

Other factors associated with active Pol II transcription including components of the Mediator complex have also been shown to contribute to heterochromatin formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Oya et al., 2013</xref>). Our study identifies an important role for Set1 in the assembly of heterochromatin domains such as those present at pericentromeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Set1 represses transcription on both the forward and reverse strands of the pericentromeric repeats and cooperates with Clr3 to assemble H3K9me-associated heterochromatin. Importantly, this heterochromatic activity of Set1 appears to be independent of its canonical H3K4me function associated with the Set1C complex, consistent with previous observations for the general lack of H3K4me within H3K9me heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Noma et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cam et al., 2005</xref>). Set1-mediated heterochromatin assembly might involve Set1 methylating a nonhistone substrate similar to that of SUV39H1/Clr4 methylating Mlo3, an RNA processing and nuclear export factor that also contributes to RNAi-mediated heterochromatin assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>).

Set1 acts in a parallel pathway with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) Clr3 to impose transcriptional repression at these loci. At a heterochromatin domain such as the pericentromeric region, Atf1 and probably other unidentified TFs mediate the recruitment of Set1 to sites enriched for tRNAs known to act as boundary elements. Set1 coordinates with Clr3 in the establishment of SUV39H1/Clr4-mediated H3K9me/HP1 (HP: Swi6 and Chp2) heterochromatin and suppression of bidirectional transcription independently of H3K4me and the other Set1C subunits.

Detection of the siRNA signals was carried out using the Storm 820 molecular imager (Molecular Dynamics; GE Healthcare).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Gene expression profiling</title><p>Transcriptional profiling analysis was done as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lorenz et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, RNA was extracted from batch cultures of mid-exponential phase (OD<sub>595</sub> ∼ 0.3–0.6) from mutant and isogenic wild-type strains, reverse-transcribed into cDNA, and labeled with either Alexa Fluor 555 (wild-type sample) or Alexa Fluor 647 (mutant sample) using Superscript Indirect cDNA labeling system (Life Technologies). Equal amounts of labeled cDNA (200–300 ng) from wild-type and mutant samples were mixed and hybridized on a custom 4 × 44k probe Agilent tiling microarray as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cam et al., 2005</xref>). For hierarchical clustering using the R/Bioconductor <italic>hopach</italic> package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van der Laan and Pollard, 2003</xref>), interarray quantile normalization was performed using the <italic>limma</italic> package, and transcripts with more than one differentially expressed probe were averaged. The cosine angle function was used for the clustering distance metric. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lorenz et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Datasets associated with transcriptional profiling and ChIP–chip experiments in this study can be accessed at the Gene Expression Omnibus under accession number GSE63301.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Grace Kim, Daniel Shams, and Betty Slinger for experimental support, Ke Zhang for the siRNA protocol, Shiv Grewal for the Swi6 antibody, Ee Sin Chen, Irina Mikheyeva, and David Layman for critical reading of the manuscript.

After a full discussion of the study and the reviews, I am happy to report that the reviewers and the BRE member found the study of interest to the journal and therefore we are happy to consider a revised manuscript addressing the following issues:</p><p>1) An essential control in the ChIP-ChIP studies of Set1 is the use <italic>set1</italic> null background in Set1 ChIP-ChIP studies to verify the significance of the low signals observed. Additionally, you and co-authors need to show what percentages of Set1 localize at active and repressed regions, respectively?</p><p>2) Further, the result of ChIP-ChIP studies in the paper need to be verified with manual ChIP, and in all ChIP studies proper controls such as untagged strains need to be used and demonstrated.</p><p>3) Co-localization studies do not represent co-recruitment. Please assess Set1 occupancy in WT and <italic>atf1</italic> null backgrounds and also evaluate H3K4me3 levels genome-wide in the presence and absence of Atf1.</p><p>4) In <italic>S. pombe</italic>, prominent heterochromatin regions include pericentromeres, subtelomeres, rNDA, and the silent mating type locus. Although <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> has tried to classify the roles of Set1 and COMPASS in different classes of genes, it is still difficult to evaluate if any classes of genes are preferentially affected by Set1 only or by COMPASS.

However, due to the expected low signals of Set1 at certain loci, we have now performed additional manual ChIP experiments to verify Set1 localization. Because we performed ChIP-chip experiment of Set1 using a FLAG antibody (Sigma, M2) against an epitope tagged Set1, we now include in our manual ChIP verification of Set1 targets a control ChIP experiment against an untagged strain. These results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>. Our results are consistent with our recent findings that Set1 localization at active and repressed loci is generally not dependent of the status of H3K4 methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> in Mikheyeva et al., PLOS Genetics, 2014).</p><p><italic>Additionally</italic>, <italic>you and co-authors need to show what percentages of Set1 localize at active and repressed regions, respectively?</italic></p><p>We have now included analysis of the percentage of Set1 ChIP targets at active and repressed loci. These results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>. Briefly, of the 290 loci whose promoters are bound by Set1 (ChIP fold enrichment ≥ 2 at 3+ adjacent probes), 80% of those loci are considered as actively transcribed genes whereas 20% correspond to repressed genes (RNA level below the mean expression level for logarithmically growing cells; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rhind et al., 2011</xref>, RNA-seq data).</p><p><italic>2) Further, the result of ChIP-ChIP studies in the paper need to be verified with manual ChIP, and in all ChIP studies proper controls such as untagged strains need to be used and demonstrated</italic>.</p><p>Please see our reply to question 1. In addition, because the Atf1 ChIP-ChIP experiment was performed using a commercial antibody specific for endogenous Atf1, we now include a negative control ChIP experiment using the same antibody in an <italic>atf1</italic> null strain. This result is present in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref> which shows that the enriched signals at Atf1 targets is significantly higher in <italic>atf1</italic>+ compared with <italic>atf1</italic>Δ, suggesting that the antibody binding is specific to Atf1. Moreover, our Atf1 ChIP-ChIP results are in high agreement with recently published ChIP-ChIP data of Atf1 using antibody against an HA epitope of an Atf1-HA tagged strain (Eshaghi et al., PloS One, 2010).</p><p><italic>3) Co-localization studies do not represent co-recruitment. Please assess Set1 occupancy in WT and</italic> atf1 <italic>null backgrounds and also evaluate H3K4me3 levels genome-wide in the presence and absence of Atf1</italic>.</p><p>In addition to showing reduced Set1 enrichment at pericentromeric repeats, the rDNA array, and ste11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), we have included additional statistical analyses of the H3K4me3 microarray data to determine all genomic regions displaying significant changes in H3K4me3 in response to <italic>atf1</italic>Δ. We found that many loci exhibit reduced levels of H3K4me3 in an <italic>atf1</italic>Δ strain. These data are provided in the new <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 3–source data 1</xref>. The Results and Methods sections of the manuscript contain additional text summarizing these results and an explanation of the analytical methods, respectively. Because Set1 is generally enriched at active genes, it complicates our ability to assess the effect of Set1 occupancy at Atf1 repressed loci in an <italic>atf1</italic> null strain compared with wild-type. However, we expect Atf1-mediated repressed loci to exhibit derepression and hence increased H3K4me3 levels in <italic>atf1</italic>Δ strain. We now include it in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3–figure supplement 3</xref>, which illustrates gene promoters corresponding to Atf1-bound genes (<italic>fbp1</italic>, <italic>srk1</italic>) that are known to be upregulated in <italic>atf1</italic>Δ and display increased H3K4me3 levels. A complete list of all such genomic regions are included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 3–source data 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) In</italic> S. pombe<italic>, prominent heterochromatin regions include pericentromeres, subtelomeres, rNDA, and the silent mating type locus. Although</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1C</italic></xref> <italic>has tried to classify the roles of Set1 and COMPASS in different classes of genes, it is still difficult to evaluate if any classes of genes are preferentially affected by Set1 only or by COMPASS. The authors need to re-analyze the expression data based on those Set1-occupied genes/regions</italic>.</p><p>Because most of the upregulated probes are exclusive to individual experiments or groups of experiments (i.e., probes upregulated in <italic>spp1</italic>Δ and <italic>shg1</italic>Δ or <italic>sdc1</italic>Δ and <italic>ash2</italic>Δ differ almost completely with upregulated probes in the <italic>set1</italic>Δ and other experiments), it is not possible to derive a common subset of genes likely affected by the COMPASS only. This is probably due to certain COMPASS subunits (i.e., Set1, Ash2 and Sdc1) having roles outside of the COMPASS complex that could antagonize the function of COMPASS. However, in order to facilitate a clearer comparison between the classes of genes affected in the individual <italic>set1</italic>/COMPASS deletion strains summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, we have reanalyzed the Gene Ontology enrichment in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1–source data 1</xref> to encapsulate GO terms with significant enrichment (p &lt; 0.01) by experiment. This new result is now shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 1–source data 2</xref>. This analysis replicates the more detailed GO analysis in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1–source data 1</xref> into a format more amenable to comparing the functional effects of the various <italic>set1</italic>/COMPASS deletion mutants.</p><p><italic>Also, the GO term analyses on</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2D</italic></xref> <italic>did not reveal any heterochromatin-related terms</italic>.</p><p>The most current Gene Ontology mappings provided by <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pombase.org">pombase.org</ext-link>, the reference genome database for <italic>S. pombe</italic>, is predominantly limited to annotation for protein coding genes. The set of mostly noncoding transcripts located within heterochromatin regions therefore currently has limited GO annotation. Only two <italic>S. pombe</italic> chromatin regulatory proteins are mapped to the “heterochromatin” GO term (GO:0000792), vs. transcripts within heterochromatin regions.

First, consistent with the drastically reduced H3K9me levels in cells null for both <italic>set1</italic> and <italic>clr3</italic>, the double mutant also exhibits severe depletion of the HP1/Swi6 proteins at pericentromeric heterochromatin accompanied by increased levels of Pol II occupancy. These results are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>. We also assessed the levels of siRNAs in the <italic>set1</italic> and <italic>clr3</italic> mutants. We found that whereas loss of either <italic>set1</italic> or <italic>clr3</italic> resulted in increased levels of siRNAs, the siRNA level in the <italic>set1</italic>Δ <italic>clr3</italic>Δ double mutant was dramatically diminished relative to wild-type. This is a likely consequence of the failure of the RNAi machinery requiring H3K9me to act in cis to contribute to heterochromatin assembly (i.e., the RITS complex tethering to H3K9me via Chp1 to generate siRNAs; Noma et al., Nature Genetics, 2005).
