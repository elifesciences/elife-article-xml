The underlying mechanism and its coupling to ATP hydrolysis and actin binding are only partially understood, mostly due to sparse structural data on actin-bound states of myosin. Here, we report 26 high-resolution cryo-EM structures of the actomyosin-V complex in the strong-ADP, rigor, and a previously unseen post-rigor transition state that binds the ATP analog AppNHp. The structures reveal a high flexibility of myosin in each state and provide valuable insights into the structural transitions of myosin-V upon ADP release and binding of AppNHp, as well as the actomyosin interface. In addition, they show how myosin is able to specifically alter the structure of F-actin.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>myosin</kwd><kwd>actin</kwd><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>actomyosin</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>AppNHp</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Rabbit</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raunser</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-2019-SyG 856118</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raunser</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-17-CE11-0029-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Houdusse</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-DC009100</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sweeney</surname><given-names>H Lee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Houdusse</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004350</institution-id><institution>Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pospich</surname><given-names>Sabrina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The cryo-EM structures of actomyosin-V, including a novel strongly bound post-rigor transition state, reveal a pronounced structural heterogeneity of myosin-V and the specific selection of the closed D-loop conformation of F-actin.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The molecular motor myosin is well known for its central role in muscle contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hanson and Huxley, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Szent-Györgyi, 2004</xref>). By using the actin cytoskeleton as tracks, myosin also powers cellular cargo transport processes and can serve as a molecular anchor and force sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hartman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Woolner and Bement, 2009</xref>). Due to its versatility, myosin is key to numerous essential cellular processes including cytokinesis, transcription, signal transduction, cell migration and adhesion, and endo- and exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coluccio, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Krendel and Mooseker, 2005</xref>). While this variety in functions is well reflected by the diversity of the myosin superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Sellers, 2000</xref>), the ATP-dependent force generation mechanism as well as the architecture of the motor domain is shared by all myosins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cope et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>The myosin motor domain consists of four subdomains: the actin-binding upper and lower 50 kDa (U50 and L50) domains, which are separated by the central actin-binding cleft, the N-terminal domain, and the converter domain, containing the long α-helical extension known as the lever arm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Rayment et al., 1993b</xref>). The active site of myosin is located at the interface of the U50 domain and the N-terminal domain and is allosterically coupled to both the actin-binding interface and the lever arm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Sweeney and Houdusse, 2010</xref>). This coupling ultimately enables the amplification of small rearrangements at the active site to large, force-producing conformational changes of the lever arm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Holmes, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Rayment et al., 1993a</xref>).</p><p>The ATP-driven mechanism of myosin force generation relies on several major structural transitions and is described in the myosin motor cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Huxley, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lymn and Taylor, 1971</xref>). Initially, hydrolysis of ATP places myosin in a conformation known as the pre-powerstroke (PPS) state. The mechano-chemical energy stored in this conformation is released by binding to filamentous actin (F-actin), which serves as an activator and initiates a cascade of allosteric structural changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Rosenfeld and Sweeney, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Walker et al., 2000</xref>). These changes eventually result in phosphate release—potentially via a phosphate release (P<sub>i</sub>R) state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Llinas et al., 2015</xref>)—and the major, force-producing lever arm swing known as the powerstroke. Subsequent release of ADP from myosin in a state that binds both F-actin and ADP strongly (strong-ADP state) gives rise to a second, smaller lever arm swing, leaving myosin strongly bound to F-actin in the rigor state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Whittaker et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mentes et al., 2018</xref>). Binding of ATP to the now unoccupied active site causes a transition to the post-rigor state and eventual detachment from F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kühner and Fischer, 2011</xref>). Finally, ATP hydrolysis triggers the repriming of the lever arm through the so-called recovery stroke, thus completing the myosin motor cycle.</p><p>Decades of biochemical studies have brought great insights into the diversity and kinetics of the myosin superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coluccio, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Geeves et al., 2005</xref>). However, detailed structural information is ultimately required to understand the mechanism of force generation. Over the years, X-ray crystallography has revealed the structures of various myosins in the post-rigor state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Rayment et al., 1993b</xref>), the PPS state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Smith and Rayment, 1996</xref>), the rigor-like state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Coureux et al., 2003</xref>), a putative P<sub>i</sub>R state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Llinas et al., 2015</xref>), as well as the intermediate recovery stroke state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blanc et al., 2018</xref>; for a recent review of all available crystal structures, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Sweeney et al., 2020</xref>). Due to the reluctance of F-actin to crystallize, actin-bound states of myosin are not accessible by X-ray crystallography. Instead, cryo electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has proven to be an optimal tool to study filamentous proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Pospich and Raunser, 2018</xref>) such as the actomyosin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Behrmann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">von der Ecken et al., 2016</xref>). To date, the structure of the actomyosin rigor complex has been determined for a variety of myosins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banerjee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Behrmann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Doran et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fujii and Namba, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gong et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gurel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mentes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Risi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Robert-Paganin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Vahokoski et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">von der Ecken et al., 2016</xref>). States other than the nucleotide-free rigor state have proven more difficult to study, mainly due to lower binding affinities and short lifetimes. In fact, the only other state solved to date is the strong-ADP state; and only two (myosin-IB, myosin-XV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gong et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mentes et al., 2018</xref>) of four independent studies (myosin-Va, myosin-VI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gurel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Wulf et al., 2016</xref>) have achieved high resolution (&lt;4 Å). However, the actin-bound states of myosin, in particular weakly bound transition states for which no structure is yet available, are precisely those that are urgently needed to understand important properties of the myosin motor cycle, such as binding to and detachment from F-actin (recently reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Schröder, 2020</xref>). In addition, high-resolution structures of other myosins in the rigor and especially strong-ADP state are required to identify conserved and specific features within the myosin superfamily. Finally, structures of all key states of the motor cycle need to be determined for a single myosin to allow the assembly of a reliable structural model since the structures of different myosins vary considerably within the same state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Merino et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Some myosins, including myosin-IB and the high-duty ratio myosins V and VI, have comparatively high binding affinities for F-actin and long lifetimes of actin-bound states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">De La Cruz and Ostap, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">De La Cruz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">De La Cruz et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Laakso et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, they are best suited to structurally study actin-bound states other than the rigor. Today, class V and VI myosins are probably the best-characterized unconventional myosins, both structurally and biochemically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coluccio, 2020</xref>). Cryo-EM studies of actomyosin-V have further reported structures of the strong-ADP and rigor state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Wulf et al., 2016</xref>), as well as a potential PPS transition state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Volkmann et al., 2005</xref>). However, due to the limited resolution of these structures, atomic details could not be modeled and the structural transition of actin-bound myosin-V during its motor cycle has consequently remained elusive. Interestingly, myosin-V was also shown to be sensitive to the nucleotide state of phalloidin (PHD)-stabilized F-actin, preferring young ATP/ADP-P<sub>i</sub>-bound F-actin over aged (post-P<sub>i</sub> release) ADP-bound F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Zimmermann et al., 2015</xref>). The structural basis and implications of this preference have not yet been uncovered.</p><p>Here, we present high-resolution cryo-EM structures of the actomyosin-V complex in three nucleotide states. Specifically, we have solved the structure of myosin-V in the strong-ADP state (ADP), the rigor state (nucleotide free), and a previously unseen post-rigor transition (PRT) state, which has the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog AppNHp bound to its active site. To investigate the structural effect the nucleotide state of F-actin has on myosin-V, we have also determined the structure of the rigor complex starting from young ADP-P<sub>i</sub>-bound F-actin, rather than from aged ADP-bound F-actin. In addition to these structures and their implications, we report a pronounced conformational heterogeneity of myosin-V in all our data sets and characterize it in detail based on 18 high-resolution subset structures.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>High-resolution cryo-EM structures of the actomyosin-V complex</title><p>To provide insights into the structural transitions of myosin along its motor cycle, we determined the structure of the actomyosin-V complex in three different nucleotide states using single-particle cryo-EM. Specifically, we have decorated aged ADP-bound F-actin (rabbit skeletal α-actin) stabilized by PHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lynen and Wieland, 1938</xref>) with myosin-Va –S1 fragment bound to one essential light chain, hereafter referred to as myosin-V. The complex, referred to as aged actomyosin-V, was either prepared in the absence of a nucleotide or after brief incubation of myosin with Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ADP or Mg<sup>2+</sup>-AppNHp (see Materials and methods for details). AppNHp, also known as AMPPNP, is an ATP analog that has been shown to be non-hydrolyzable by myosin-V (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Yengo et al., 2002</xref>). It is coordinated similarly to ATP in crystal structures of myosin-II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bauer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gulick et al., 1997</xref>) and has also been reported to lead to a mixture of a pre- and post-powerstroke conformations in myosin-V (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Yengo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Volkmann et al., 2005</xref>). These results suggest that AppNHp can potentially mimic both ATP and ADP-P<sub>i</sub> and is thus well suited to capture short-lived actin-bound transition states, such as the weakly bound PPS and post-rigor states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Sweeney and Houdusse, 2010</xref>).</p><p>We collected cryo-EM data sets of the different samples (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) and processed them using the helical processing pipeline implemented in the SPHIRE package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Moriya et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Pospich et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Stabrin et al., 2020</xref>), which applies helical restraints but no symmetry. For each data set, two all-particle density maps were reconstructed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, see Materials and methods for details). In this way, we achieved nominal resolutions of 3.0 Å/3.1 Å (ADP), 3.2 Å/3.3 Å (rigor), and 2.9 Å/2.9 Å (AppNHp), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>), allowing us to reliably model each state and analyze its molecular interactions.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Data collection statistics of F-actin and actomyosin data sets.</title><p>Aged PHD-stabilized F-actin (F-actin-PHD) was decorated with myosin-V in the rigor (no nucleotide), strong-ADP (bound to Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ADP) and post-rigor transition (PRT) state (bound to Mg<sup>2+</sup>-AppNHp).

In addition to the ~9° lever arm rotation described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), the two sequential states differ primarily in their conformation of the central transducer β-sheet and the N-terminal domain, which twist and rotate, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref> for an overview of the myosin domain architecture). Notably, the structural changes are not transmitted to the U50 and L50 domains and thus do not alter the actin-binding interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1A and B</xref>).</p><p>The transducer rearrangements are directly linked to a reorganization of the active site that accounts for the reduced Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ADP affinity of the rigor state. By promoting a piston movement of the HF helix, twisting of the transducer increases the distance between the P-loop and switch I, thereby opening the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1A–C</xref>). The resulting conformation is incompatible with the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-coordinating hydrogen bond between the HF helix and switch II (T170-D437). Loss of Mg<sup>2+</sup> is thought to lead to the weak-ADP state of myosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Coureux et al., 2004</xref>), which is so named due to its low nucleotide affinity that promotes the release of ADP. The subsequent rigor state is stabilized by a new network of hydrogen bonds formed between lysine K169 (HF helix, previously coordinated to the β-phosphate of ADP), and aspartate D437 and isoleucine I438 (switch II).</p><p>Upon Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ADP release, the A-loop also undergoes a small lateral shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1C and D</xref>). In this way, it likely stabilizes the twisting of the transducer and the N-terminal domain rotation. Surprisingly, the role of the A-loop in both the coordination of ADP and the coupling of the active site to the periphery has not been fully appreciated previously, although it is also involved in nucleotide binding in other myosins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bloemink et al., 2020</xref>). Given their central importance for the coordination of Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we propose that the P-loop, the A-loop, and switch I contribute to the sensing of the nucleotide state and its transmission from the nucleotide-binding pocket to the periphery. Their mutual interplay defines the orientation of the N-terminal domain relative to the U50 and L50 subdomains. In this way, small changes in the active site (~1–2 Å) are amplified into significant rotations of the N-terminal and converter domain, eventually leading to a lever arm swing of ~9° upon Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ADP release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref>).</p><p>Our high-resolution structures of the strong-ADP and rigor state are consistent with the sequential release of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and ADP due to the isomerization of myosin to a conformation with reduced nucleotide affinity.

Although most of the details are intriguingly similar, for example, the remodeling of hydrogen bonds due to the piston movement of the HF helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mentes et al., 2018</xref>), we find notable differences in the extent of the lever arm swing associated with Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ADP release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>), as well as the conformation of the relay helix, which partially unwinds in myosin-IB and -VI to allow for the larger lever arm swings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gurel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mentes et al., 2018</xref>).

The details of the interactions, however, differ due to the different sizes of the two nucleotides and their relative positions in the active site, that is, the γ-phosphate of AppNHp almost takes the position of the β-phosphate of ADP relative to the HF helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, and in contrast to a previous low-resolution cryo-EM reconstruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Volkmann et al., 2005</xref>), the overall structure of AppNHp-bound myosin-V is reminiscent of the rigor state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In particular, myosin is strongly bound to F-actin and adopts a post-powerstroke lever arm orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). The active site of AppNHp-bound myosin also closely resembles that of the rigor state, and thereby significantly deviates from the conformation found in the strong-ADP state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>).</p><p>The compatibility of an ATP analog, specifically the presence of a γ-phosphate at the active site, with strong F-actin binding is initially puzzling and seemingly at odds with the reported reciprocal nature of these two processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Coureux et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kühner and Fischer, 2011</xref>). A comparison of our AppNHp-bound structure with a rigor-like crystal structure of myosin-V with ADP weakly bound to its active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Coureux et al., 2004</xref>) resolves this conflict (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The relative position of AppNHp and ADP in these two structures as well as their coordination, which in particular lacks contacts between K169 of the P-loop and the β-phosphate, is almost identical, suggesting that AppNHp is only weakly bound in our structure and therefore compatible with strong F-actin binding. Interestingly, a similar coordination was observed for Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ADP in a putative strong-ADP to rigor transition state cryo-EM structure of myosin-IB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mentes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). These comparisons indicate that AppNHp and ADP can both weakly bind to myosin in a conformation reminiscent of the rigor.</p><p>Our prior kinetic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">De La Cruz et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Yengo et al., 2002</xref>) demonstrated that AppNHp reduces the binding affinity of myosin-V for F-actin by &gt;5000-fold as compared to the rigor state, thus favoring dissociation. A weakened affinity is also supported by the higher concentrations required to achieve decoration of F-actin with myosin in the AppNHp state (see Materials and methods). AppNHp also induces greater structural flexibility in myosin-V (see below) as compared to the rigor state, which may facilitate the transition to a detached state. Based on the presented structural and prior kinetic studies, we propose that our AppNHp-bound myosin-V structure represents a post-rigor transtion (PRT) state that allows to visualize how ATP binds in the rigor state, prior to the transition that involves a switch I movement and promotes detachment of myosin from F-actin. The characteristic weak coordination of AppNHp in the PRT state allows myosin to remain strongly bound to F-actin until a strong coordination of the nucleotide is established. The report of a transition state with weakly bound ADP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mentes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>) suggests that weak nucleotide binding is a common scheme and that the PRT state is therefore not limited to AppNHp. The visualization of an ATP analog bound to a state reminiscent of the rigor shows that ATP mainly binds via its adenine ring, as does ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). It also explains how the γ-phosphate can fit into the relatively small pocket created by the rigor conformation of the P-loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), and how its presence leads to local changes of the active site facilitating a tight coordination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In this way, the PRT state provides new insights on how myosin detaches from F-actin and indicates that the theoretical weakly bound post-rigor state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Sweeney and Houdusse, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Walklate et al., 2016</xref>) is unlikely to be populated within the motor cycle.</p><p>Although we find myosin-V-AppNHp strongly bound to F-actin in the PRT state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), we had to significantly increase the myosin concentration to achieve full decoration of actin filaments (see Materials and methods for details), in agreement with a weaker binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Konrad and Goody, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Yengo et al., 2002</xref>). We therefore conclude that AppNHp can potentially lead to different structural states, similar to ADP in myosin-IB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mentes et al., 2018</xref>). Likely due to large differences in the binding affinity of these states or rapid detachment of myosin from F-actin, we only find myosin bound to F-actin in the PRT state. In line with this assumption, we find a significant amount of unbound myosin in the background of our AppNHp data sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). The 3D reconstruction and thus identification of the structural state of the background myosin were unfortunately impeded by a strong orientational preference of the myosin particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Further studies are therefore required to test the conformation of AppNHp-bound myosin-V in absence of F-actin.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Conservation and specificity of the actomyosin-V interface</title><p>A comparison of the three states of the actomyosin-V complex (strong-ADP, rigor, and PRT state) reveals a striking similarity of the actomyosin interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5—video 1</xref>).

The remarkable similarity suggests that the same set of interactions is maintained during all strongly bound states of the myosin motor cycle, despite their varying F-actin-binding affinities.

While these elements represent a common set of actin-binding elements, most of which have conserved hydrophobic and electrostatic properties, not all myosins utilize all of them. Moreover, the precise nature of individual interactions and the residues involved varies considerably among myosins, largely due to sequence variations known to tune the kinetic properties of myosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mentes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Robert-Paganin et al., 2021</xref>).

The tightest and most conserved contact is formed by the HLH motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Robert-Paganin et al., 2021</xref>). In analogy to other myosins, it relies primarily on extensive hydrophobic contacts with F-actin, complemented by a series of hydrogen bonds (predicted by PDBsum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Laskowski et al., 2018</xref>], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5—video 1E and F</xref>). The comparably short CM loop of myosin-V is also highly conserved, with respect to its hydrophobic nature. However, unlike the CM loop of other myosins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fujii and Namba, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gurel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mentes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Risi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">von der Ecken et al., 2016</xref>), its tip does not engage in complementary electrostatic interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5—video 1C</xref>). The conformation we found for loop 4 differs from all others reported so far. Not only is it more compact, folding in a β-hairpin, but it also localizes closer to the base of the CM loop, where it is stabilized by a non-conserved hydrogen bond between C348 and I391 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5—video 1C</xref>). However, its electrostatic interactions with F-actin are reminiscent of those reported for other myosins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fujii and Namba, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gurel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Risi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">von der Ecken et al., 2016</xref>). Loop 2 is exceptionally long in myosin-V and only partially resolved in our structures (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5—video 1</xref>). While this is also the case for most actomyosin structures resolved so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banerjee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Doran et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gong et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Risi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Robert-Paganin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">von der Ecken et al., 2016</xref>), loop 2 of myosin-V stands out by the unique α-helical fold of its C-terminal part (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5—video 1I</xref>). This fold facilitates a compact packing of basic residues and thereby promotes the electrostatic interactions commonly found at the loop 2 interface. The activation loop is a structural element that does not contribute to F-actin binding in all myosins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gurel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Robert-Paganin et al., 2021</xref>). In myosin-V, it forms primarily electrostatic interactions with the N-terminus of F-actin, but does not lead to its ordering, as has been reported for other myosins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5—video 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banerjee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Behrmann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fujii and Namba, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mentes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Vahokoski et al., 2020</xref>). The last structural element involved in actin binding is loop 3. It forms the so-called Milligan contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Milligan et al., 1990</xref>), which is strong in myosin-V and includes electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions as well as several hydrogen bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5—video 1H</xref>). The contact is furthermore strengthened by hydrogen bonds between K540-N545 and S544-K546 that stabilize the conformation of loop 3. Interestingly, a strong Milligan contact has also been reported for myosin-IB and -VI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gurel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mentes et al., 2018</xref>), whereas no or only weak interactions were found in class II myosins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Doran et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fujii and Namba, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Risi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">von der Ecken et al., 2016</xref>). We therefore speculate that an intimate Milligan contact might be a general feature of myosins with long actin-attachment lifetimes and high binding affinities for F-actin and ADP, allowing them to bind particularly tightly to fulfill their function as cargo transporters or molecular anchors.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrated that myosin-V establishes a maximum of contacts with F-actin, utilizing all six potential binding elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5—video 1E and F</xref>).

We have recently shown that young ATP/ADP-P<sub>i</sub>-bound and aged ADP-bound F-actin primarily differ in their conformation of the D-loop-C-terminus interface and that actin-binding proteins like coronin-IB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cai et al., 2007</xref>) probably recognize the nucleotide state of F-actin from this interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Merino et al., 2018</xref>). We have furthermore shown that the short-lived ATP/ADP-P<sub>i</sub>-bound state of F-actin can be specifically stabilized using either PHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lynen and Wieland, 1938</xref>) or jasplakinolide (JASP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Crews et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Pospich et al., 2020</xref>). To reveal the structural mechanism by which myosin-V senses the nucleotide state of F-actin, we have solved the structure of myosin-V in the rigor state in complex with young JASP-stabilized F-actin (F-actin-JASP) to 3.2 Å (referred to as young actomyosin-V, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6">Table 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The atomic model of myosin in this structure superimposes perfectly with the one bound to aged F-actin-PHD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>), indicating that the nucleotide state of F-actin has no structural effect on myosin-V in the rigor state. Surprisingly, and despite having ADP-P<sub>i</sub> bound to its active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), F-actin adopts the closed D-loop state, which is characteristic for aged ADP-bound F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Merino et al., 2018</xref>). However, a control structure of F-actin-JASP alone (3.1 Å, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6">Table 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) confirms that actin was successfully stabilized in the desired young state, having a characteristic open D-loop conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>) and ADP-P<sub>i</sub> bound to its active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, we conclude that binding of myosin-V to young F-actin-JASP induces structural changes that ultimately result in the closed D-loop conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig8video1">Figure 8—video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>), thereby abolishing the effect of JASP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Pospich et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, our data show that the open D-loop state would not clash with bound myosin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C and D</xref>). The closed conformation may therefore be selected for its superior shape complementarity to myosin, which possibly establishes a strong binding interface between the D-loop and HLH motif and by doing so contributes to the high-binding affinity of the rigor state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Structure of the young actomyosin-V complex in the rigor state.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Atomic model and LAFTER density map of the central myosin-V-LC subunit (red, LC: white) bound to young F-actin-JASP (shades of blue, three subunits shown, A<sub>-1</sub> to A<sub>+1</sub>).

First, myosin-V might be sensitive to the nucleotide state of F-actin only in certain structural states, such as the initially binding PPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Wulf et al., 2016</xref>) and P<sub>i</sub>R states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Llinas et al., 2015</xref>). Second, the structural plasticity of young ATP/ADP-P<sub>i</sub>-bound F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kueh and Mitchison, 2009</xref>), rather than the open D-loop conformation, might be beneficial for myosin binding. Third, the open D-loop conformation might promote the formation of initial contacts with myosin-V. Once these are established, the subsequent transition from a weak- to a strong binding state potentially causes a structural transition of F-actin, eventually locking it in the closed D-loop conformation. In line with these theories, a number of biochemical and biophysical studies suggested that a structural rearrangement of F-actin and its structural plasticity are critical for proper myosin activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anson et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Drummond et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kim et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Nishikawa et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Noguchi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Oztug Durer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Prochniewicz and Thomas, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Prochniewicz et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, the D-loop C-terminus interface was predicted to contribute to the initial binding interface of myosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gurel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lehman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Risi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Robert-Paganin et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Finally, the conformational selection mechanism of myosin-V offers a structural explanation for the quenching of pyrene fluorescence upon myosin binding. Pyrene conjugated to cysteine 374 in the C-terminus of F-actin has been often used to report not only actin kinetics, but also myosin binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kouyama and Mihashi, 1981</xref>). Closure of the actin-binding cleft of myosin is thought to expose pyrene to the solvent and thus cause fluorescence quenching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chou and Pollard, 2020</xref>), but the exact timing and the structural basis are not yet known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Llinas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Robert-Paganin et al., 2020</xref>). A recent cryo-EM structure of pyrene-labeled F-actin has revealed that pyrene wedges itself between the tip of the D-loop and the hydrophobic groove surrounding it, partially pushing the D-loop out of its binding pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chou and Pollard, 2020</xref>). This likely interferes with myosin selecting the closed D-loop state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). We furthermore suggest that myosin quenches the fluorescence of pyrene by pushing it out of its binding pocket when selecting the closed D-loop state during its transition to a strong binding state.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Pronounced structural heterogeneity of myosin-V</title><p>To identify a potential mixture of structural states, we performed 3D classifications of signal-subtracted particles for all our data sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, the results indicate a continuous conformational heterogeneity of myosin-V as opposed to a mixture of several discrete structural states (see Materials and methods for details). Based on the identified 3D classes, we solved and modeled a total of 18 high-resolution (&lt;3.7 Å) structures of actomyosin-V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6">Table 6</xref>).

Primarily, the U50 domain pivots and moves toward or away from the actin interface, resulting in twisting and shifting of the central transducer β-sheet, which is coupled to rotations of the N-terminal and the converter domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). In this way, pivoting of the U50 domain leads to different lever arm positions within the 3D classes of a single data set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig9video1">Figure 9—video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig9video2">Figure 9—video 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig9video3">Figure 9—video 3</xref>).

The motions along the first and second PCs correspond to an almost perpendicular pivoting of the U50 domain, causing a twist and shift of the central transducer β-sheet and ultimately rotations of the N-terminal and converter domain. The third PC maps a rotation of the N-terminal and converter domain around the transducer, which acts as a hinge region. Since all average structures localize close to the origin of PC 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig10video1">Figure 10—video 1E and F</xref>), we suggest that this PC accounts for an inherent flexibility of the transducer β-sheet.</p><p>The rearrangements, especially along the first PC, are reminiscent of the structural transition of myosin-V upon Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ADP release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig10video1">Figure 10—video 1</xref>). In line with this, we find the strong-ADP and rigor average structures to be arranged diagonally within the PC 1–PC 2 space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). This indicates that the conformational heterogeneity of myosin-V as well as the isomerization associated with Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ADP release relies on the same principal coupling mechanism. Furthermore, this suggests that the structural transition of myosin-V along its motor cycle is driven, at least in part, by its conformational flexibility. Based on this, we therefore propose that the active site of myosin-V is not mechanically, and thus rigidly, coupled to the surrounding domains, particularly the lever arm, as previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fischer et al., 2005</xref>). Rather, its coupling seems to be statistical in nature, ultimately leading to a thermodynamic ensemble of conformations within each state. The associated structural flexibility of myosin-V possibly initiates transitions between structural states by giving rise to short-lived intermediate conformations with favorable nucleotide-binding affinities. Interactions with a nucleotide would consequently not trigger the transition, but merely stabilize myosin in its transient conformation, thereby promoting the transition to a new structural ensemble state.</p><p>A non-rigid, stochastic coupling of the active site of myosin-V is in good agreement with the release of Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ADP due to an isomerization as well as the existence of the PRT state. It also provides a good explanation for the different binding affinities of the rigor and strong-ADP state. Specifically, we propose that the extent of conformational heterogeneity tunes the binding affinity rather than changes in the actomyosin interface since these are almost the same in all three nucleotide states studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Restrictions of the conformational space by external forces, that is, load on the lever arm, could account for the load dependence of transitions within the cycle, such as the delay of ADP release under load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mentes et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The conformational flexibility we observe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figures 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>) as well as our conclusions on its role in the motor cycle are in line with more than two decades of molecular spectroscopy experiments, which have primarily, but not exclusively, studied myosin-II. In particular, site-directed labeling has demonstrated that myosin is highly dynamic and that multiple, functionally relevant structural states coexist within a single biochemical state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Forkey et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Nesmelov et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Nesmelov et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Thomas et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, it was shown that neither the active site is tightly coupled to the structural domains of the motor nor are the domains themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Klein et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Korman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Naber et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Sun et al., 2006</xref>). Our results extend the spectroscopic data, which have already elucidated conformational amplitudes and kinetics, by directly visualizing the dynamics of myosin as well as the underlying molecular coupling.</p><p>While the agreement of our results with the spectroscopic data on myosin-II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Thomas et al., 2009</xref>) already suggests that statistical coupling and conformational flexibility are general features of the myosin superfamily, rather than a hallmark of myosin-V, there are additional independent indications. On the one hand, statistical coupling of the active site has also been proposed for myosin-VI based on a recovery stroke intermediate crystal structure, showing that the lever arm can partially re-prime while the active site remains unchanged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blanc et al., 2018</xref>). On the other hand, conformational heterogeneity has also been reported for myosin-IE and -IB based on either crystal structures or cryo-EM data of the actomyosin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Behrmann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kollmar et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mentes et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, a flexibility reminiscent of the one observed for myosin-V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figures 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>) was reported for myosin-IE in the rigor state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Behrmann et al., 2012</xref>). Conversely, no flexibility was described for myosin-IB, which adopts a single state in the absence of a nucleotide and two discrete states when bound to Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ADP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mentes et al., 2018</xref>). Whether these results reflect properties of specific myosins or rather current limitations of data analysis methods, for example, number of particles, low signal-to-noise ratio, robustness of 3D classifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Pospich and Raunser, 2018</xref>), remains to be investigated. In general, there is little structural data on the conformational dynamics of myosin as most structures originate either from small cryo-EM data sets, which have an insufficient number of particles for extensive 3D classifications, or from X-ray crystallography. We therefore believe that the structural characterization of myosin’s dynamic landscape will provide novel insights into the details of force generation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Summary</title><p>The presented high-resolution cryo-EM structures of the actomyosin-V complex in three nucleotide states—nucleotide-free, Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ADP, and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-AppNHp (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>)—provide valuable insights into the structural basis of force generation. First, a comparison of the strong-ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and rigor state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) has revealed the structural transition of myosin-V upon Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ADP-release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), which is reminiscent of the one of myosin-IB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mentes et al., 2018</xref>) and yet differs in its details. Second, the structure of Mg<sup>2+</sup>-AppNHp-bound myosin-V has uncovered a previously unseen post-rigor transition (PRT) state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), which is strongly bound to F-actin and adopts a conformation resembling the rigor state. Because of the weak binding to the active site, AppNHp, and probably ATP, does not directly trigger the detachment from F-actin and thus the transition to the post-rigor state. Instead, strong nucleotide binding likely needs to be established to eventually initiate detachment.</p><p>Interestingly, and despite the differences in the F-actin-binding affinity, we find that the actin-binding interface is basically indistinguishable in all three nucleotide states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), suggesting that strongly bound states utilize a common binding scheme. Furthermore, a comparison of the interface with the one of other myosins has revealed specific features of the myosin-V interface and indicates that a strong Milligan contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Milligan et al., 1990</xref>) is characteristic of myosins with long lifetimes of actin-bound states and high binding affinities for ADP and F-actin, as found in high duty-ratio myosins and myosin-IB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Laakso et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lewis et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Wulf et al., 2016</xref>), our results elucidate that myosin-V hardly alters the structure of aged F-actin-PHD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Conversely, it has a remarkable effect on the structure of young F-actin-JASP, specifically selecting the closed D-loop state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>) and thereby overriding the ‘rejuvenating effect’ of JASP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Merino et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Pospich et al., 2020</xref>). Whilst this result does not reveal the structural basis of myosin-V’s nucleotide sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Zimmermann et al., 2015</xref>), it offers an explanation for pyrene fluorescence quenching upon myosin binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kouyama and Mihashi, 1981</xref>).</p><p>Additional heterogeneity analysis of our data revealed a pronounced structural flexibility of myosin-V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figures 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>), indicating a non-rigid, stochastic coupling of the active site. While the extent of flexibility is altered by the presence of a nucleotide, structural transitions of myosin-V are likely not initiated by binding of a specific nucleotide, but rather by thermodynamic fluctuations, as previously suggested for myosin-VI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blanc et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, we have elucidated many, previously unknown details of the force generation mechanism. The general validity of these results, that is, if they are limited to myosin-V or hold for the complete myosin superfamily, as well as the possible implications of our findings has to be thoroughly tested in future studies.

To create the recombinant virus used for expression, the cDNA coding for chicken myosin-Va was truncated after the codon corresponding to Arg792. This construct encompassed the motor domain and the first light chain/calmodulin-binding site of myosin-Va. A ‘Flag’ tag DNA sequence (encoding GDYKDDDDK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hopp et al., 1988</xref>) was appended to the truncated myosin-V coding sequence to facilitate purification.

An additional 2 mM MgATP was added prior to a clarifying spin at 200,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 40 min. The supernatant was purified using FLAG-affinity chromatography (Sigma). The column was washed with 10 mM imidazole pH 7.4, 0.2 M NaCl, and 1 mM EGTA, and the myosin eluted from the column using the same buffer plus 0.1 mg/ml FLAG peptide. The fractions containing myosin were pooled and concentrated using an Amicon centrifugal filter device (Millipore) and dialyzed overnight against F-actin buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7,5, 100 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mM NaN<sub>3</sub>).

Polymerization was induced by adding 100 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.5 mM ATP. In case of young JASP-stabilized F-actin, actin was polymerized in the presence of a 2× molar excess of JASP (Sigma-Aldrich, freshly solved in DMSO, 1 mM stock). After 2 hr of incubation at room temperature, the sample was transferred to 4°C for further polymerization overnight. Filaments were collected by ultracentrifugation (Beckmann Rotors, TLA 120.1, 100.000 × <italic>g</italic>, 2 hr, 4°C) and pellets rinsed and resuspended in F-actin buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM NaN<sub>3</sub>) supplemented with 0.02 w/v% Tween 20 (to improve spreading of the sample droplet on the cryo-EM grid). No additional ADP or JASP was added. In case of aged PHD-stabilized F-actin, a 2× molar excess of PHD (Sigma-Aldrich, freshly solved in methanol, 1.25 mM stock) was added to resuspended filaments, which have aged, that is, hydrolyzed ATP and released the inorganic phosphate, during the overnight polymerization step. Filaments were stored at 4°C for a few hours before preparation of cryo-EM grids.</p><p>Aliquots of myosin-V-LC were freshly thawed, diluted 1:1 with F-actin buffer, and cleared by centrifugation (Eppendorf centrifuge 5424R, 21,000 × <italic>g</italic>, 5 min, 4°C).

A freshly glow-discharged holey-carbon grid (QF R2/1 300 mesh, Quantifoil) was mounted to a Vitrobot cryoplunger (Thermo Fisher). 3 µl of F-actin (3–4 µM) were applied onto the front of the grid and incubated for 60 s. Excess solution was manually blotted from the side using blotting paper (Whatman No. 4). Immediately, 3 µl of myosin-V-LC (3–13 µM) were applied onto the grid and incubated for 30 s. The grid was automatically blotted for 9 s (blot force –15 or –25, drain time 0–1 s) and plunged into liquid ethane. The temperature was set to 13°C for all samples but the AppNHp sample, where either 4 or 25°C were used (two settings and data sets, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Myosin was kept in F-actin buffer and was only diluted and supplemented with a nucleotide and Tween 20 immediately before application to the grid to avoid any adverse effects. When preparing the strong-ADP state, myosin was diluted 1:1 in a 2× ADP buffer (F-actin buffer with 40 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 mM ADP, and 0.04 w/v% Tween 20). For the rigor samples, myosin was diluted in F-actin buffer supplemented with 0.02 w/v% Tween 20. AppNHp-bound samples were prepared in analogy to rigor samples, but additional 5 mM AppNHp and 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> were added. As AppNHp hydrolyzes spontaneously, only freshly solved (10 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM NaN<sub>3</sub>, and 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) or recently frozen AppNHp was used. Ion-pair reversed-phase chromatography experiments using freshly solved AppNHp indicated a purity of ≥98%, with 1.5% AppNH<sub>2</sub> (hydrolysis product) and no preferential binding of AppNH<sub>2</sub> to myosin. Thus, AppNH<sub>2</sub> does not get enriched in the active site of myosin-V as it is the case for F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cooke and Murdoch, 1973</xref>). To increase the binding affinity of AppNHp-bound myosin to F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Konrad and Goody, 2005</xref>), the concentration of potassium chloride in the myosin sample buffer was reduced to 10–13 mM KCl by dilution with F-actin buffer without KCl. F-actin samples were diluted using F-actin buffer supplemented with 0.02 w/v% Tween 20. After dilution to the final concentration, the PHD-stabilized F-actin samples contained 0.4–0.9% methanol.</p><p>Protein concentrations were adjusted empirically based on the overall concentration on the grid and decoration of actin filaments. The concentration of myosin required to saturate F-actin (3–4 µM) strongly depended on the nucleotide state; while 3–4 µM myosin were sufficient in case of the rigor and strong-ADP state, 10–13 µM myosin were required for the AppNHp sample, even though the salt concentration of the buffer was lowered to increase the binding affinity.</p><p>Grids were screened on a Talos Arctica microscope (Thermo Fisher) operated at 200 kV and equipped with a Falcon III direct detector (Thermo Fisher).</p><p>In total, six different samples were plunged, screened, and imaged; also see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. On the one hand, aged PHD-stabilized F-actin was decorated with myosin-V-LC in three different nucleotide states, that is, in the absence of a nucleotide and bound to either Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ADP or Mg<sup>2+</sup>-AppNHp (aged rigor, ADP, and AppNHp). For the AppNHp-bound sample, two data sets were collected from grids that were plunged using different incubation temperatures, that is, 4°C or 25°C. On the other hand, young JASP-stabilized F-actin was imaged on its own and in complex with myosin-V-LC in the rigor state (young F-actin and rigor). The corresponding grids were prepared in one plunging session, that is, within a short time frame of 1–2 hr, using the same JASP-stabilized F-actin sample.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Cryo-EM data acquisition</title><p>Data sets were acquired on Titan Krios microscopes (FEI Thermo Fisher) operated at 300 kV and equipped with a X-FEG using EPU. Specifically, data sets of the rigor and strong-ADP state were acquired on a standard Krios (Cs 2.7 mm, pixel size 1.06 Å), while a Cs-corrected Krios (pixel size 1.10 Å) was used for the remaining data sets. Equally dosed frames were collected using a K2 Summit (super-resolution mode, Gatan) direct electron detector in combination with a GIF quantum-energy filter (Bioquantum, Gatan) set to a slit width of 20 eV. For every hole, four micrographs consisting of 40 frames were collected close to the carbon edge, resulting in a total electron dose of ~79–82 eÅ<sup>–2</sup> within an exposure time of 15 s. The defocus was varied within a range of ~0.4–3.2 µm.

The latest version of TranSPHIRE, which was used for the processing of the AppNHp data sets, also supported automatic, on-the-fly particle extraction (box size 320 px, filament width 200 px) as well as batch-wise 2D classification (batch size 13k, filament width 200 px, radius 150 px, 60–100 particles per class), 2D class selection, and 3D refinement using software of the SPHIRE package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Moriya et al., 2017</xref>).

Particles that were not accounted during the initial, batch-wise 2D classification, for example, because they represent rare views, were merged and inputted to another round of 2D classification until no more stable classes were found. All micrographs were assessed manually and images sorted based on ice and protein quality, resulting in a removal of 6–36% of the data sets; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> for details. Particles contributing to classes found ‘good’ by either Cinderella or manual inspection and belonging to micrographs of good quality were written to virtual particle stacks for further processing in 3D.</p><p>As an initial 3D refinement and 3D classification revealed no differences in the overall structure of myosin in the two AppNHp data sets, plunged at 4°C and 25°C, corresponding particles were merged for further processing. The final number of particles ranged from 212,660 (young JASP-stabilized F-actin) to 2,446,218 (combined AppNHp data sets); see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6">Table 6</xref> for details. A concise overview of all key processing steps including the number of particles and nominal resolutions can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>All data sets were processed using the helical refinement program sp_meridien_alpha.py implemented in SPHIRE 1.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Moriya et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Stabrin et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast to other helical refinement routines, SPHIRE does not refine or apply any helical symmetry, and thereby avoids possible symmetrization pitfalls. Instead, the software offers the usage of constraints tailored to helical specimen, for example, on the tilt angle and shift along the filament, to guide the refinement (also see Methods section of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Pospich et al., 2021</xref>). For all 3D refinements, the tilt angle was softly restrained to the equator during exhaustive searches (<monospace>--theta_min 90</monospace><monospace> --theta_max 90</monospace> <monospace>--howmany 10</monospace>). The shift along the filament axis was furthermore limited to plus or minus half of the rise (<monospace>--helical_rise 27.5</monospace>) to avoid shifts larger than one subunit. Finally, the smear (number of views considered for the reprojection of each particle) was reduced to a combined weight of 90% (<monospace>--ccfpercentage 90</monospace>). An initial 3D reference was created from the atomic model of a previously published actomyosin complex in the rigor state (PDB:5JLH, without tropomyosin; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">von der Ecken et al., 2016</xref>) and filtered to 25 Å using EMAN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Tang et al., 2007</xref>) and SPHIRE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Moriya et al., 2017</xref>). For the initial 3D refinement, a sampling angle of 3.7°, filament width of 120 px and a radius of 144 px (45% of the box size), but no 3D mask, was used. Based on the resulting 3D density map, a wide mask covering the central 85% of the filament was created. This map and mask were then used to run a fresh, global 3D refinement using the same settings as before. Based on the results of this refinement, particles were CTF refined within SPHIRE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Moriya et al., 2017</xref>) providing the nominal resolution according to the FSC<sub>0.143</sub>-criterion. CTF-refined particles were locally 3D refined using the final map of the previous 3D refinement filtered to 4 Å as reference. The fine angular sampling typically used in local refinements makes helical restraints superfluous as projections parameters can only locally relax anyways. For this reason, particles were locally refined using the non-helical 3D refinement program sp_meridien.py in combination with a sampling angle of 0.9°, a shift range of 2 px, and a shift step size of 0.5 px. In case of the young F-actin and young rigor data sets, the resolution could be further improved by particle polishing in Relion 3.0.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Scheres, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Zivanov et al., 2018</xref>). For this purpose, refinement results were converted to Relion star format using sp_sphire2relion.py. Metadata of the initial motion correction step required for polishing were automatically created by TranSPHIRE and were directly provided. Polished particles were transferred back to SPHIRE and passed through another round of local 3D refinement using the same settings as before.</p><p>To focus the refinement on the central part of the filament, a wide mask containing the central three actin and central two myosin-V-LC subunits including all ligands (subvolume referred to as central 3er/2er map) was created and applied in a subsequent local 3D refinement. Post refinement of the resulting half maps using a central 3er/2er mask yielded maps with average resolutions ranging from 2.9 to 3.2 Å according to the FSC<sub>0.143</sub>-criterion; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6">Table 6</xref> for details.</p><p>With the aim to further improve the density of myosin, the signal of all subunits but the central actomyosin subunit (subvolume referred to as central 1er map) was subtracted from the 2D particle images within SPHIRE 1.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Moriya et al., 2017</xref>). Particles were additionally recentered to bring the center of mass close to the center of the box. Signal-subtracted particles were subjected to another round of local 3D refinement applying a central 1er mask and filtering the centered reference map to 3.5 Å. Although post refinement of the resulting half maps using a central 1er mask did not yield density maps of higher nominal resolution, the map quality of especially myosin could be significantly improved; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6">Table 6</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref> for details.</p><p>The anisotropic quality of the final central 1er maps suggested structural heterogeneity within myosin. For this reason, signal-subtracted particles and corresponding projection parameters were transferred to and 3D classified in Relion 3.0.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Scheres, 2012</xref>). As domain movement was assumed to be small and to reduce the risk of overrefinement, 3D alignment was deactivated (<monospace>--skip_align</monospace>) and the resolution strictly limited to 8 Å (<monospace>--strict_highres_exp 8</monospace>). The final central 1er map filtered to 15 Å was inputted as a reference, while a corresponding wide mask was applied and solvent flattening and CTF correction activated. The regularization parameter T and number of classes K were empirically adjusted. While a parameter of T = 40 (<monospace>--tau2_fudge 40</monospace>) proved well suited for all data sets, finding a suitable number of classes posed a challenge. Running multiple 3D classifications with different numbers of classes resulted in classes of various, related structural states with little overlap, that is, classes of different runs could not be matched as they did generally not superimpose. The same was true when rerunning a 3D classification job using the same settings but a different seed. These results suggest a continuous structural heterogeneity of myosin in contrast to several discrete states. While software tailored to the characterization of cryo-EM data exhibiting continuous structural states has recently been published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Zhong et al., 2021</xref>), it proved unsuitable for the processing of signal-subtracted actomyosin filaments due to the need of 3D masking. To characterize the structural heterogeneity of myosin-V by standard 3D classification in Relion 3.0.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Scheres, 2012</xref>) as good as possible, the number of 3D classes was optimized experimentally to yield the highest number of classes with a resolution and map quality sufficient for atomic modeling (≤3.7 Å). To do so, multiple 3D classifications with varying number of classes, for example, from 2 to 12, were performed and particles split into subsets according to the classification results. Subsets were then transferred to SPHIRE and individually subjected to a local 3D refinement from stack (no reference required, same settings as before). Eventually, each subset was post-refined and the resulting map manually assessed. In the end, the 3D classification that yielded the most maps of high quality was chosen. In this way, a total of 18 high-resolution maps (referred to as 3D class averages or 3D classes) were achieved for the four actomyosin data sets. Corresponding subsets contained 81,757 to 365,722 particles; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6">Table 6</xref> for details. An overview of all refined maps, associated resolutions, and the underlying number of particles is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>To ease the interpretation of maps as well as model building, all final maps, that is, central 3er/2er, central 1er, and 3D class averages, were additionally filtered to local resolution using SPHIRE 1.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Moriya et al., 2017</xref>) and denoized using LAFTER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Ramlaul et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Model building, refinement, and validation</title><p>Previous cryo-EM structures of PHD-stabilized aged F-actin (PDB: 6T20; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Pospich et al., 2020</xref>) and JASP-stabilized young F-actin (PDB: 5OOD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Merino et al., 2018</xref>) were used as starting models for F-actin in the rigor actomyosin complexes (aged and young rigor). The models of PHD and JASP were replaced by single-residue initial models generated from SMILES strings by elBOW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Moriarty et al., 2009</xref>) within Phenix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2011</xref>) using the <monospace>--amber</monospace> option. The corresponding cif constraints libraries were used for all further refinements. A rigor-like crystal structure of the myosin-V-LC complex (PDB: 1OE9; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Coureux et al., 2003</xref>) was used as an initial model for myosin and the bound light chain within the aged rigor structure. Stubs were replaced by full residues, and residues that are missing in the crystal structure, but are resolved in the cryo-EM density map, were added manually in Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Debreczeni and Emsley, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Emsley et al., 2010</xref>). For all other models, that is, of the ADP, AppNHp, and young rigor state, the final refined model of the PHD-stabilized rigor actomyosin complex was used as a starting model. Initial models of nucleotides (ADP and AppNHp) are based on previous cryo-EM and crystal structures of myosin (PDB: 6C1D; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mentes et al., 2018</xref>; and PDB: 1MMN; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gulick et al., 1997</xref>). Starting models were rigid-body fitted into the density map using UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>) and ligands were coarsely refined in Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Debreczeni and Emsley, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Emsley et al., 2010</xref>) prior to model building.</p><p>Atomic models of the central actomyosin subunit, consisting of one F-actin, myosin, LC, and PHD/JASP molecule (central 1er), were refined using ISOLDE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Croll, 2018</xref>) within UCSF ChimeraX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Goddard et al., 2018</xref>). For this purpose, hydrogens were added to the starting model using the addh command in UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>) and manually adjusted when necessary. Custom residue definitions for PHD and JASP were created based on the elBOW output within the ISOLDE shell. To reliably model both high- and medium-resolution features, several maps, for example, filtered to nominal or local resolution and sharpened by different B-factors, were loaded to ISOLDE. Maps filtered by LAFTER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Ramlaul et al., 2019</xref>) were also loaded for visual guidance, but excluded from the refinement (weight set to 0, MDFF deactivated). All density maps were segmented based on the starting model using the color zone tool within UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>) to exclude density not corresponding to the central actomyosin subunit.</p><p>Each refinement in ISOLDE was started with a 2–3 min all atom simulation to reduce the overall energy of the system. Afterward, overlapping stretches of the protein and atoms within close vicinity were successively adjusted and refined. When necessary, rotamer and secondary structure restraints were introduced. After passing through the complete protein complex once, the quality of the model was assessed using the metrics provided by ISOLDE, that is, Ramachandran plot, rotamer outlier, and clash score, and outliers were locally addressed. Residues not resolved by the electron density map, for example, due to flexibility, were not included in the respective atomic model, while incompletely resolved side chains were set to most likely rotamers.</p><p>The density corresponding to the light chain was of insufficient quality for reliable model building. Hence, the model of the light chain was kept fixed during refinements in ISOLDE. Afterward, the reference crystal structure (PDB: 1OE9; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Coureux et al., 2003</xref>) was rotamer-optimized in Coot and rigid-body fitted into the density using UCSF Chimera.</p><p>Finally, atomic models were real-space refined in Phenix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Afonine et al., 2018</xref>) against a sharpened density map filtered to nominal resolution (FSC<sub>0.143</sub>). To only relax and validate the model but prohibit large changes, local grid search, rotamer, and Ramachandran restraints were deactivated and the starting model was used as a reference. Furthermore, NCS and secondary structure restraints were applied and cif libraries provided for PHD and JASP.</p><p>Only models of the central actomyosin subunit (central 1er) were built in ISOLDE. Atomic models of subsets, that is, 3D class averages, were built starting from the average, all-particle model, and the corresponding ISOLDE/UCSF ChimeraX session including restraints. Whereas average models of different states, that is, rigor, ADP, and AppNHp, were built within new sessions to avoid any bias. Atomic models consisting of three actin and two myosin-LC subunits (central 3er/2er) were assembled from the models of the monomeric complex (central 1er) by rigid-body fitting in UCSF Chimera. The filament interface was manually inspected in Coot and side chain orientations adjusted when necessary. Finally, the multimeric model was real-space refinement in Phenix.</p><p>After real-space refinement, the residue assignment of PHD was changed from a single non-standard residue to a hepta-peptide consisting of TRP-EEP-ALA-DTH-CYS-HYP-ALA.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Samara Reck-Peterson as Reviewing Editor and José Faraldo-Gómez as Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: E Michael Ostap (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers generally agreed that this paper will be important to the myosin field as it provides a molecular-level understanding of mechanochemical coupling, and of the structural elements that underlie the mechanical and chemical diversity of cytoskeletal motors. Essential revisions are listed by number below. In addition, several concerns were brought up by the reviewers, which should be addressed in a revision as well.</p><p>1) The authors should acknowledge that molecular spectroscopists have long known that different biochemical states of myosins are dynamic with varying amplitudes and kinetics of flexibility.</p><p>2) There is little experimental support (biochemical experiments) to demonstrate that the AppNHp state is indeed a post-rigor transitional state.

This is an important point, and this statement needs correcting.</p><p>4) Please see additional essential revisions requested by Reviewer #1.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Pospich et al., have used CryoEM and image processing to generate a 3D structure of the motor domain of myosin V bound to F-actin in three different states. These include the Mg.ADP state in which myosin V is strongly bound to actin but has not yet released ADP, the nucleotide free state (also known as the rigor state) which occurs once ADP is released, and a third state in which a non-hydrolysable ATP analogue (AppNHp, also known as AMPPNP) is weakly bound in the nucleotide binding pocket, and may represent the binding of ATP to the rigor state immediately preceding myosin detachment from actin, termed the post-rigor transition state. These structures build on those of Mg.ADP myosin V and nucleotide-free myosin V bound to F-actin at lower resolution (8Å) reported in an earlier paper from Wulf et al., (PNAS, 2016). The data build on previous rigor structures from a wide range of different myosins from multiple laboratories, to which they show strong similarities, such as a closed actin binding cleft in the myosin motor domain and a post-powerstroke lever arm position.</p><p>Structure of Mg.ADP myosin V bound to actin</p><p>The authors first show the details of a new Mg.ADP myosin V state bound to actin (Figure 1 and related supplementary material), which nicely shows how ADP is co-ordinated within the nucleotide binding site, including the identification of important hydrophobic interactions between adenosine and residues 111-116, termed the A-loop.</p><p>Perhaps not surprisingly, they find that this new structure differs from a previous crystal structure of myosin V with Mg.ADP in the nucleotide binding site, which was obtained by soaking in Mg.ADP into a crystal of the rigor myosin motor domain (with a single light chain: Coureaux et al., 2004). One would expect that adding Mg.ADP to a preformed crystal is unlikely to generate large structural changes. In contrast, the cryoEM structure of Mg.ADP myosin bound to actin is more likely to resemble the cryoEM structure of Mg.ADP Myosin-IB bound to actin (Mentes et al., 2018) as the authors report, as the complex is frozen in the presence of Mg.ADP.It would be helpful to include this discussion in the text.</p><p>Structure of nucleotide free myosin V bound to actin</p><p>The authors go on to describe the nucleotide free state of myosin V bound to F-actin (Figure 2 and related supplementary material). The structure of this state is entirely consistent with previous rigor structures of myosin bound to F-actin: the actin binding cleft is closed, and the lever arm is in a post-power stroke conformation. The actin binding interface is highly similar to that in the ADP state for myosin V, but the position of the lever arm is rotated by ~9° as shown in the previous lower resolution structures of myosin V structure bound to actin in the presence and absence of ADP (Wulf et al., 2016). Not surprisingly, the structures are not identical to rigor crystal structures of myosin in the absence of actin.</p><p>Clear changes are demonstrated for the nucleotide binding site, between ADP and rigor states, as expected (Figure 3 and related video), and it is suggested that a shift in the A-loop might stabilise a resulting twist in the transducer and N-terminal domain rotation, revealing an important role for this loop in coupling of the nucleotide binding site to other regions in myosin, helping to result in the amplification of small changes in this site to large lever arm swings. As the authors discuss, similar structural transitions have been reported elsewhere.</p><p>There is then some speculation as to whether this lever arm swing, which is different is size for different myosins, might be related to the mechanosensitivity of myosin. However, it is worth reminding readers that myosin 1B is monomeric, while myosin V is dimeric. In myosin V the lead head is actually trapped in a pre-powerstroke conformation (Walker et al., 2000, Nature), with strain between the two heads 'gating' ADP release, such that its release is slower from the lead head. This is perhaps different to the mechanical load myosin 1B might experience.</p><p>Structure of AppNHp-myosin V bound to actin</p><p>The overall structure of this state (Figure 4) is remarkably similar to that of the rigor state (Figure 4 supplementary figures). The myosin is strongly bound, and the lever is in the post-powerstroke lever arm orientation. The nucleotide binding site is also similar to that found in rigor. The authors speculate that this structure represents a post-rigor transition state and compare it to the myosin V ADP crystal structure, in which ADP was soaked into the rigor crystal. The assertion that this really is a new post-rigor transition (PRT) state appears somewhat tenuous to me. The difficulty is, of course, that as soon as ATP binds strongly, the motor will dissociate from actin, and it wasn't entirely clear how this provided new insights into how myosin detaches from F-actin. There is no clear evidence that this state really is the PRT state.</p><p>Comparison of the actomyosin interface for all three states:</p><p>The authors show that the overall actomyosin-V interface is highly similar in each of the three states (Figure 5), is similar to previous structures of this interface for other myosins bound to actin and demonstrate a few myosin V specific interactions.</p><p>Importantly, it is unlikely that the actomyosin interface would change when ADP is released from myosin. If it did change, then the expectation would be that actin activates ADP release. However, work from Howard White's laboratory has demonstrated that the ADP release rate from myosin V is unchanged between experiments in which actin is either present or absent. It would be helpful to add this discussion to the paper.</p><p>Overall actin structure in unbound and rigor actomyosin states, and in young and old actin (Figures6-8):</p><p>A comparison of the structure of actin in the presence and absence of rigor myosin V demonstrates the importance of the D-loop in actin in this interaction, as found previously for other myosins. However, as expected, actin structure is mostly the same in the presence and absence of myosin V. It is interesting that the authors find no difference between the rigor actomyosin structures for old and young actin, suggesting that the rigor state of myosin is not sensitive to the nucleotide state of F-actin, and that the D-loop is found in the closed conformation, characteristic of 'old' actin. However, the speculation that myosin V specifically selects 'old' actin or could promote phosphate release from actin, and the following discussion about possible structural re-arrangements, is highly speculative and not well supported by experimental data.</p><p>Structural heterogeneity</p><p>The authors use their existing datasets to explore variability or heterogeneity in the structures (Figure 9-10 and supplementary material). It is important to note here that the numbers of particles in the AppNHp dataset is 3 times as large as that in the other two data sets (rigor and ADP). The main source of heterogeneity appears to be in the transducer and lever arm, but not in the actin binding interface, as might be expected.</p><p>There is the possibility that the flexibility or position of the lever might be linked to where it is located in the frozen sample. Thin films of ice have the potential to compress the sample, which could affect the lever, and might explain why the light chain is poorly resolved compared to the rest of the molecule. It would be interesting to know if the flexed molecules are in plane (e.g. uncompressed) or all near the top and bottom of the liquid film, or randomly distributed?</p><p>Actomyosin ATPase cycle</p><p>The authors attempt to place the three structures described here in the context of a complete actomyosin ATPase cycle, adding in previously published structures, many of which are crystal structures of myosin in the absence of actin (Figure 11 and supplementary material). This figure (and the supplementary figures) could have been generated without any of the data presented in this new paper.</p><p>Critically, what we are really missing here is the structure of the pre-power stroke state as myosin first binds to actin. This is a difficult state to capture, due to the weak binding of myosin ATP to actin, and no-one has managed to capture this state yet. It is likely to have a different structure to the PiR and PPS states presented in Figure 11, as its structure will be influence by binding to actin. It is unclear why there is a mix of myosin V and myosin VI structures in this figure, as the sequences of these two myosins are not strongly conserved, and it is unclear if the states found in myosin VI are representative of those in myosin V as shown in this pathway. Overall, it is unclear how this part of the paper adds to our overall knowledge, or how it provides us with an unprecedented insight into force generation as it does not show how myosin attaches to actin and accelerates Pi release.</p><p>Overall, this is a solid paper, with newer higher resolution structures of the rigor and ADP actomyosin V states, which will be interesting to the field, demonstrate that the actomyosin interface is essentially highly similar, and that any structural variability mostly resides in the lever.</p><p>The paper does not 'provide unprecedented insight into force generation' as claimed as we still do not know how myosin attaches to actin and what structural changes occur that accelerate of Pi release. This is still the key missing step. However, the new high-resolution structures of ADP and rigor myosin V bound to actin are a useful contribution to the field.</p><p>There is very little experimental justification (biochemical experiments) that demonstrate the AppNHp state is indeed a post-rigor transitional state. Either more work needs to be performed to show that this is the case, or this claim needs to be scaled back.</p><p>In examining heterogeneity, the data for each actomyosin state could have been divided up into more classes with a lower number in each class, which might be expected to show an increase in heterogeneity. How was the decision made on the number of classes? Did the different number of particles available for the AppNHp class affect this analysis? The authors should explain their reasoning here in the revised paper.</p><p>In Supplementary Figure 2D and E – A comparison of maps constructed from the same particle number would be a fairer and more informative comparison. This would address the question as to whether differences in the resolution of the cryoEM maps from different states are due to heterogeneity or differences in particle number.</p><p>The statement that Pi release requires completion of the power stroke is incorrect, as the lead head of myo5, when bound to actin, can release Pi, but the converter still in a pre-power state conformation (Walker et al., 2000, Nature). This is an important point, and this statement needs correcting.</p><p>Regarding the statement 'Our data indicate that the powerstroke of myosin-V amounts to ~ 77°, in contrast to a previous estimate of only 58° based on medium resolution cryo-EM data (Wulf et al., 2016). It is unclear why this angle changes when everything else seems the same as before. Is it possible that this is due to a change in the way the molecules have been super-posed before looking at global movements? Could the authors clarify this and re-analyse if appropriate.</p><p>Recommendations for improving the writing and presentation.</p><p>The paper is overlong, and there is considerable speculation in places that is not required and which detracts from the paper.</p><p>The authors should revise their discussion of the comparison of the Mg.ADP myosin V structures as indicated in the public review.</p><p>The authors should comment on the data from Howard White, that suggests we would not expect to find a change in actin structure between ADP and rigor states, as indicated in the public review.</p><p>Generally, the writing was clear, but the paper is overly long, and contains quite a bit of speculation that could easily be removed without detracting from the key findings. The authors should shorten and focus the paper. There are a few odd uses of English in places, which would be improved by careful proof reading.</p><p>I recommend removing Figure 11 and associated figures completely, as they do not add to the paper. In fact, I think they somewhat detract from the key findings of the paper concerning the two main ADP and rigor actomyosin states. Moreover, it is unclear how relevant the intermediate states from myosin VI are? They might be on pathway, but the sequence is not strongly conserved, so probably not. Suppl 1 and 2 (for Figure 11) – are mainly just re-summarising figures and are not needed.</p><p>A clearer explanation of the methods for generating the PC plots would be helpful. How was the Bio3D library used?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript presents a detailed structural model of the myosin-V motor cycle by characterizing three actin-bound structural intermediates with different nucleotide states (strong-ADP, nucleotide free (rigor) and non-hydrolyzable ATP (post-rigor transition)) at near atomic resolution. These results supports and expands on details of the myosin-V mechanochemical cycle that could be inferred from previous structural work, including x-ray crystal structures and lower resolution cryo-EM studies of myosin-V. Additionally, a novel conformation is reported of ATP-analog bound, actin bound myosin-V, exhibiting striking structural similarities with the rigor state. Notably, this is the first high-resolution structure of ATP-analog bound myosin on an actin filament that has been reported. This conformation is interpreted by the authors as a post-rigor transition (PRT) state that could rationalize how ATP recognizes the rigor state before promoting detachment from F-actin. Finally, by collecting large datasets the authors were also able to generate an assessment of heterogeneity/mobility of these states which informs structural transitions between these states.</p><p>This manuscript is packed with a lot of details (and structures) but organizes them nicely in the context of existing literature, avoids overinterpretation and overall represents a solid contribution to the field. There are some concerns with two of the stated conclusions that do not seem consistent with the data presented, that need to be addressed. However, overall the manuscript is highly polished. The readability could benefit by trimming or moving to the supplementary material several main figures that are not central to the main findings.</p><p>The following points should be addressed to improve the work:</p><p>1. One conclusion from the manuscript, quoted from the summary is that &quot;Structural transitions of myosin-V are hence likely not initiated by binding of a specific nucleotide, but rather by thermodynamic fluctuations, as previously suggested for myosin-VI&quot;. This statement doesn't seem consistent with the PCA results (Figure 10 A) showing that the ADP conformational space does not strongly overlap with that of rigor. Neither does this statement appear consistent with the authors' proposal that PRT state isomerizes after nucleotide binding to release from actin. Likewise, for page 17 where it is stated that &quot;Our data show that the conformational heterogeneity of myosin-V is not caused by variations of the active site or mixed nucleotide states (Figure 9). Nevertheless, the presence of a nucleotide does affect the extent of flexibility, as ADP and AppNHp lead to a greater change in lever arm position (Figure 9A).&quot; These statements seem contradictory and the authors need to clarify the ambiguity.</p><p>2. Under the &quot;Conservation and specificity of the actomyosin-V interface&quot; section on page 11, the last sentence says &quot;Differences in the affinity might therefore not be linked to altered contacts, but rather to the degree of structural flexibility inherent to each state (see below)&quot;. This is an interesting statement, but the discussion below or in other sections don't address this. The authors need to expand on this.</p><p>3. The atomic model of strong ADP myosin-V is one of the more significant results since only two other myosins have been solved to near atomic resolution in this nucleotide state.

These include the Mg.ADP state in which myosin V is strongly bound to actin but has not yet released ADP, the nucleotide free state (also known as the rigor state) which occurs once ADP is released, and a third state in which a non-hydrolysable ATP analogue (AppNHp, also known as AMPPNP) is weakly bound in the nucleotide binding pocket, and may represent the binding of ATP to the rigor state immediately preceding myosin detachment from actin, termed the post-rigor transition state. These structures build on those of Mg.ADP myosin V and nucleotide-free myosin V bound to F-actin at lower resolution (8Å) reported in an earlier paper from Wulf et al., (PNAS, 2016). The data build on previous rigor structures from a wide range of different myosins from multiple laboratories, to which they show strong similarities, such as a closed actin binding cleft in the myosin motor domain and a post-powerstroke lever arm position.</p><p>Structure of Mg.ADP myosin V bound to actin</p><p>The authors first show the details of a new Mg.ADP myosin V state bound to actin (Figure 1 and related supplementary material), which nicely shows how ADP is co-ordinated within the nucleotide binding site, including the identification of important hydrophobic interactions between adenosine and residues 111-116, termed the A-loop.</p><p>Perhaps not surprisingly, they find that this new structure differs from a previous crystal structure of myosin V with Mg.ADP in the nucleotide binding site, which was obtained by soaking in Mg.ADP into a crystal of the rigor myosin motor domain (with a single light chain: Coureaux et al., 2004). One would expect that adding Mg.ADP to a preformed crystal is unlikely to generate large structural changes. In contrast, the cryoEM structure of Mg.ADP myosin bound to actin is more likely to resemble the cryoEM structure of Mg.ADP Myosin-IB bound to actin (Mentes et al., 2018) as the authors report, as the complex is frozen in the presence of Mg.ADP.It would be helpful to include this discussion in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>To avoid confusion and shorten the paper, we have removed the comment in line 172-174 comparing the cryo-EM strong-ADP state with the weak-ADP rigor-like crystal structure. Based on the recommendation of reviewer #2, we have slightly extended the comparison of the strong-ADP state of different myosins (now describing how differences in the localization of switch I result in varying positions of the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion) and included a new supplementary figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Structure of nucleotide free myosin V bound to actin</p><p>The authors go on to describe the nucleotide free state of myosin V bound to F-actin (Figure 2 and related supplementary material). The structure of this state is entirely consistent with previous rigor structures of myosin bound to F-actin: the actin binding cleft is closed, and the lever arm is in a post-power stroke conformation. The actin binding interface is highly similar to that in the ADP state for myosin V, but the position of the lever arm is rotated by ~9{degree sign} as shown in the previous lower resolution structures of myosin V structure bound to actin in the presence and absence of ADP (Wulf et al., 2016). Not surprisingly, the structures are not identical to rigor crystal structures of myosin in the absence of actin.</p></disp-quote><p>With the aim to focus the paper, we have shortened the comparison with the rigor-like crystal structure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Clear changes are demonstrated for the nucleotide binding site, between ADP and rigor states, as expected (Figure 3 and related video), and it is suggested that a shift in the A-loop might stabilise a resulting twist in the transducer and N-terminal domain rotation, revealing an important role for this loop in coupling of the nucleotide binding site to other regions in myosin, helping to result in the amplification of small changes in this site to large lever arm swings. As the authors discuss, similar structural transitions have been reported elsewhere.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the precise summary of our findings. Yet, we want to emphasize that our work in general is not just a reproduction, extension or support of findings that have been reported elsewhere (as one could easily conclude from the summary). Structures of the strong-ADP and rigor state have been solved before. However, these were either limited in resolution or for other myosins, such as myosin IB and recently myosin XV. As shown by our detailed comparison of available actomyosin structures, significant differences exist within the myosin superfamily and account for the varying motor properties. The structural details that can be transferred from one myosin to the next are hence limited when it comes to understand how myosins are tuned for their diverse functions in the cell. Therefore, high-resolution structures remain critical for understanding not only the conservation and divergence of the myosin superfamily, but also the molecular details of force generation. In addition, we describe many novel aspects of myosin, including the first high-resolution structure of an AppNHp-bound myosin, myosin-V’s pronounced structural heterogeneity (which could only be characterized in detail because of the unprecedented number of high-resolution structures we generated), myosin’s effect on young JAS-stabilized F-actin as well as the role of the A-loop.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is then some speculation as to whether this lever arm swing, which is different is size for different myosins, might be related to the mechanosensitivity of myosin. However, it is worth reminding readers that myosin 1B is monomeric, while myosin V is dimeric. In myosin V the lead head is actually trapped in a pre-powerstroke conformation (Walker et al., 2000, Nature), with strain between the two heads 'gating' ADP release, such that its release is slower from the lead head. This is perhaps different to the mechanical load myosin 1B might experience.</p></disp-quote><p>The point raised by the reviewer is interesting and correct. However, the state of the ADP-bound lead head under strain exerted by the rear head is not directly linked to the data presented here, since our structures correspond to structures of the (monomeric) motor domain without strain. The reference we cite with regard to the force sensitivity of myosin-V (Veigel, Schmitz, Wang, and Sellers, 2005) has also worked with a single myosin head, making their results comparable to the ones for myosin-IB. We therefore do not think that raising the point of a myosin being monomeric or dimeric would help the reader to understand our reasoning. To focus the paper and avoid speculations, we have shortened the discussion on the force-sensitivity in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Structure of AppNHp-myosin V bound to actin</p><p>The overall structure of this state (Figure 4) is remarkably similar to that of the rigor state (Figure 4 supplementary figures). The myosin is strongly bound, and the lever is in the post-powerstroke lever arm orientation. The nucleotide binding site is also similar to that found in rigor. The authors speculate that this structure represents a post-rigor transition state and compare it to the myosin V ADP crystal structure, in which ADP was soaked into the rigor crystal. The assertion that this really is a new post-rigor transition (PRT) state appears somewhat tenuous to me. The difficulty is, of course, that as soon as ATP binds strongly, the motor will dissociate from actin, and it wasn't entirely clear how this provided new insights into how myosin detaches from F-actin. There is no clear evidence that this state really is the PRT state.</p></disp-quote><p>Earlier kinetic data published by Yengo et al., (Biochemistry, 2002) demonstrated that the AppNHp state has a weaker affinity for F-actin than either the strong-ADP or rigor state. Specifically, De la Cruz et al., (PNAS, 1999) measured the Kd for the rigor = 4.9 10<sup>-12</sup> M and ADP = 7.6 10<sup>-9</sup> M states; which are significantly lower than the one of AppNHp-bound myosin-V = 0.3 10<sup>-6</sup> M (Yengo et al., 2002). Thus, the AppNHp-bound myosin-V favors the dissociation from F-actin, as it is also evident from the fact that higher concentrations of myosin were required to achieve decoration of F-actin (10-13 µM instead of 3-4 µM for rigor/ADP). AppNHp is furthermore a well-established ATP-analog in the myosin field, having been used in various crystal structures before. Considering the biochemical data and the similarity of the AppNHp-bound state to the rigor state, our proposal of a post-rigor transition state comes naturally to mind.</p><p>As the biochemical data haven’t been included in our reasoning before, we have adjusted the text as follows</p><p>“Our prior kinetic studies (De La Cruz et al., 1999; Yengo et al., 2002) demonstrated that AppNHp reduces the binding affinity of myosin-V for F-actin by &gt; 5,000 fold as compared to the rigor state, thus favoring dissociation. A weakened affinity is also supported by the higher concentrations required to achieve decoration of F-actin with myosin in the AppNHp state (see Methods). AppNHp also induces greater structural flexibility in myosin-V (see below) as compared to the rigor state, which may facilitate the transition to a detached state. Based on the presented structural and prior kinetic studies, we propose that our AppNHp-bound myosin-V structure represents a post-rigor transition (PRT) state that allows to visualize how ATP binds in the rigor state, prior to the transition that involves a switch I movement and promotes detachment of myosin from F-actin.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comparison of the actomyosin interface for all three states:</p><p>The authors show that the overall actomyosin-V interface is highly similar in each of the three states (Figure 5), is similar to previous structures of this interface for other myosins bound to actin and demonstrate a few myosin V specific interactions.</p><p>Importantly, it is unlikely that the actomyosin interface would change when ADP is released from myosin. If it did change, then the expectation would be that actin activates ADP release. However, work from Howard White's laboratory has demonstrated that the ADP release rate from myosin V is unchanged between experiments in which actin is either present or absent. It would be helpful to add this discussion to the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>It is unclear which study of Howard White the reviewer is quoting for demonstrating that actin does not activate ADP release, as the literature is extensive in showing the opposite, including the initial characterization of Myosin V in the De la Cruz et al., 1999 paper (which used the same myosin-V construct we used for our structures). In addition, we found an NIH grant abstract of Galkin and White, where the authors write: “Despite a detailed knowledge of the kinetics of actomyosin ATP hydrolysis in which actin accelerates the dissociation of Pi and ADP from myosin, our understanding of the molecular mechanism(s) by which the free energy of ATP hydrolysis is coupled to the production of work and movement by myosin motors remains elusive.”</p><p>It is precisely because actin does activate ADP release that we thought that the actin interface could differ between the rigor and strong-ADP state, and that this had not been seen earlier due to lack of sufficient resolution and classification of actomyosin states.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall actin structure in unbound and rigor actomyosin states, and in young and old actin (Figures 6-8):</p><p>A comparison of the structure of actin in the presence and absence of rigor myosin V demonstrates the importance of the D-loop in actin in this interaction, as found previously for other myosins. However, as expected, actin structure is mostly the same in the presence and absence of myosin V. It is interesting that the authors find no difference between the rigor actomyosin structures for old and young actin, suggesting that the rigor state of myosin is not sensitive to the nucleotide state of F-actin, and that the D-loop is found in the closed conformation, characteristic of ‘old’ actin. However, the speculation that myosin V specifically selects ‘old’ actin or could promote phosphate release from actin, and the following discussion about possible structural re-arrangements, is highly speculative and not well supported by experimental data.</p></disp-quote><p>Since our data cannot explain the nucleotide sensitivity of myosin-V previously reported by Zimmermann et al., we think it is helpful to propose possible reasons for the lack of structural differences and therefore prefer to keep this discussion (prev. lines 457-474). However, we have removed the speculation about the role of myosin V on the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton (lines 450-456) in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Structural heterogeneity</p><p>The authors use their existing datasets to explore variability or heterogeneity in the structures (Figure 9-10 and supplementary material). It is important to note here that the numbers of particles in the AppNHp dataset is 3 times as large as that in the other two data sets (rigor and ADP). The main source of heterogeneity appears to be in the transducer and lever arm, but not in the actin binding interface, as might be expected.</p></disp-quote><p>We want to note, that the AppNHp data set is a combination of two data sets (also see methods) and that it was not our aim to generate data with equal numbers of particles. The number of particles also differs for the rigor and ADP data sets – Rigor: 300k, ADP: 870k, AppNHp: 2,446k. As we have experimentally adjusted the number of classes for each data set (see Methods and answer below), we do not see how the size of the data set should affect the significance of our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is the possibility that the flexibility or position of the lever might be linked to where it is located in the frozen sample. Thin films of ice have the potential to compress the sample, which could affect the lever, and might explain why the light chain is poorly resolved compared to the rest of the molecule. It would be interesting to know if the flexed molecules are in plane (e.g. uncompressed) or all near the top and bottom of the liquid film, or randomly distributed?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the thickness of the vitreous ice layer and interactions with the air-water interface could alter the conformation of a protein and thereby cause heterogeneity. It can also result in (partial) denaturation resulting in lower resolutions. However, it is very unlikely that this is the case for our data. First, we have averaged actomyosin particles from continuous, µm long, helical filaments. Because of the helical symmetry, only a small fraction of myosins would be exposed to the air-water interface. Consequently, we would assume to find a single conformation for the majority of myosin heads (which is not the case, instead classes are approx. equally populated). Second, mapping of particles based on their conformation (different 3D classes) onto the original 2D micrographs did not reveal any correlation, but appeared randomly (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Localization of particles within the ice layer, i.e. near the top and bottom as requested by the reviewer, would require tomographic data, which we have not collected. Yet, per-particle defocus values, which depend on the relative position of particles in the ice layer, do not indicate any correlation between particle position within the layer and its conformation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). We are thus convinced that the observed heterogeneity is an intrinsic feature of myosin-V.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-73724-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Actomyosin ATPase cycle</p><p>The authors attempt to place the three structures described here in the context of a complete actomyosin ATPase cycle, adding in previously published structures, many of which are crystal structures of myosin in the absence of actin (Figure 11 and supplementary material). This figure (and the supplementary figures) could have been generated without any of the data presented in this new paper.</p><p>Critically, what we are really missing here is the structure of the pre-power stroke state as myosin first binds to actin. This is a difficult state to capture, due to the weak binding of myosin ATP to actin, and no-one has managed to capture this state yet. It is likely to have a different structure to the PiR and PPS states presented in Figure 11, as its structure will be influence by binding to actin. It is unclear why there is a mix of myosin V and myosin VI structures in this figure, as the sequences of these two myosins are not strongly conserved, and it is unclear if the states found in myosin VI are representative of those in myosin V as shown in this pathway. Overall, it is unclear how this part of the paper adds to our overall knowledge, or how it provides us with an unprecedented insight into force generation as it does not show how myosin attaches to actin and accelerates Pi release.</p></disp-quote><p>We strongly disagree with the reviewer in the points that (a) Figure 11 could have been generated without the data presented in this paper (the PRT state is completely new and no high-resolution structures were available for the strong-ADP and rigor states), and (b) that this part does not add to our overall knowledge. We have indeed not solved the initial binding state of myosin, but also never claimed that we did. Yet, there is much to learn from our structures about the molecular details of the motor cycle (i.e. transition between PPS to strong-ADP and PRT to Post-Rigor), which previously could only be speculated about, as high-resolution structures from the same myosin are required. We also clearly reasoned why we have included the myosin-VI structures (namely because these states were not solved for any other myosin) and point out that the structural similarity is limited. Given that this is the currently most complete structural model of the myosin ATPase cycle at high resolution, we consider it a valuable contribution to the myosin field.</p><p>Yet, we see the reviewer’s points, that the paper is overlong and that the structural model might distract from the original data presented in the paper. We have therefore decided to remove the complete section, including Video 1, Figure 11 and its supplements from the manuscript.

The authors should explain their reasoning here in the revised paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Choosing the number of classes was not straightforward due to the nature of the conformational heterogeneity. In the methods (also referred to in the main text, see line 494 of the original manuscript), we describe our approach and reasoning in detail. In summary, we ran multiple 3D classifications asking for varying numbers of classes e.g. 3-12. First, we tried to find a stable core of classes by comparing the structures and associated particles (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref> for heat map for ADP data). Results showed very little overlap indicating a continuous structural heterogeneity (as opposed to discrete structural states). Continuous changes are in general difficult to analyze (software development currently ongoing in several labs). Aiming for representative results suitable for analysis of motions, we optimized the number of classes experimentally to yield the highest number of classes with a resolution and map quality sufficient for atomic modelling (≤ 3.7 Å).</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-73724-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Supplementary Figure 2D and E – A comparison of maps constructed from the same particle number would be a fairer and more informative comparison.

One conclusion from the manuscript, quoted from the summary is that &quot;Structural transitions of myosin-V are hence likely not initiated by binding of a specific nucleotide, but rather by thermodynamic fluctuations, as previously suggested for myosin-VI&quot;. This statement doesn't seem consistent with the PCA results (Figure 10 A) showing that the ADP conformational space does not strongly overlap with that of rigor. Neither does this statement appear consistent with the authors' proposal that PRT state isomerizes after nucleotide binding to release from actin.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not see an inconsistency here, as we solely refer to the initiation of the transition. The fact, that the conformational spaces of the strong-ADP and rigor do not overlap is not surprising, giving that we have strongly oversaturated myosin with ADP to reach full saturation (mM concentrations). While the transition to the rigor state is initiated by thermodynamic fluctuations – based on the conformational space and the nature of structural changes within-, it cannot progress further as ADP never gets released.</p><p>To clarify this point, we have added the following sentence to the manuscript</p><p>“The fact, that the conformational spaces of the strong-ADP and rigor state do not overlap is anticipated, given that we have over-saturated myosin with Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ADP (see Methods)”</p><p>In case of AppNHp, we believe that thermal fluctuations initiate and promote the transition to a strong nucleotide coordination, which eventually results in large structural changes and detachment from F-actin. The fact, that we find AppNHp-myosin either strongly bound to F-actin (PRT state) or completely detached, suggests that the structural transition causing detachment is too fast to capture by standard cryo-EM (but requires time-resolved experiments). To test this hypothesis and the structural state of the detached AppNHp-bound myosin, we have tried to solve the corresponding structure – unfortunately without success (see Figure 4—figure supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Likewise, for page 17 where it is stated that &quot;Our data show that the conformational heterogeneity of myosin-V is not caused by variations of the active site or mixed nucleotide states (Figure 9). Nevertheless, the presence of a nucleotide does affect the extent of flexibility, as ADP and AppNHp lead to a greater change in lever arm position (Figure 9A).&quot; These statements seem contradictory and the authors need to clarify the ambiguity.</p></disp-quote><p>We find that the statement on page 17 is correct and not confusing. It states that the nucleotide is not the cause of the flexibility, but biases its amount; in other words, the overall extent of flexibility is larger when ADP or AppNHp is bound. The recovery-stroke is a good example of the role of thermodynamic fluctuations in structural transitions, since it occurs while ATP is bound to active-site. Based on our data, thermodynamic fluctuations are also essential for other transitions, but the binding of a specific nucleotide biases the likelihood of these transitions and their kinetics.</p><p>We understand that this point might be difficult to understand and also agree that the statement in the summary (referred to in the paragraph above) might be misleading due to its generalization and simplification. We have therefore changed it as follows</p><p>“While the extent of flexibility is altered by the presence of a nucleotide, structural transitions of myosin-V are likely not initiated by binding of a specific nucleotide, but rather by thermodynamic fluctuations, as previously suggested for myosin-VI (Blanc et al., 2018).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Under the &quot;Conservation and specificity of the actomyosin-V interface&quot; section on page 11, the last sentence says &quot;Differences in the affinity might therefore not be linked to altered contacts, but rather to the degree of structural flexibility inherent to each state (see below)&quot;. This is an interesting statement, but the discussion below or in other sections don't address this. The authors need to expand on this.</p></disp-quote><p>We briefly discuss this point in the ‘Pronounced structural heterogeneity of myosin-V’ section (see below). The key point is that strong flexibility is thought to be detrimental for tight binding. The larger flexibility of the strong-ADP state could therefore account for its lower binding affinity for F-actin.</p><p>“It also provides a good explanation for the different binding affinities of the rigor and strong-ADP state. Specifically, we propose that the extent of conformational heterogeneity tunes the binding affinity, rather than changes in the actomyosin interface since these are almost the same in all three nucleotide states studied (Figure 5).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The atomic model of strong ADP myosin-V is one of the more significant results since only two other myosins have been solved to near atomic resolution in this nucleotide state. It therefore seems important to provide a comparison of active site features (ie., Magnesium coordination etc) for the available ADP actomyosin co-complex structures, at least as a supplementary figure.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript we include a new supplementary figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 2) showing a comparison of the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ADP coordination in myosin-V, myosin-IB, myosin-VI (although the model does not contain a nucleotide) and myosin-XV (paper on BiorXiv, but model already released). We have adjusted the main text as follows</p><p>“The coordination of Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ADP in our structure closely resembles the ones reported for the strong-ADP state of myosin-IB (Mentes et al., 2018), myosin-VI (Gurel et al., 2017) and myosin-XV (Gong et al., 2021) (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). Solely the position of switch I differs appreciably between myosins, ultimately resulting in varying positions of the coordinated Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The paper by Pospich provides important new structural insights into actomyosin-V mechanochemical coupling. The work provides new high-resolution structures of several states of myosin-V, provides new details on the relationship between myosin-binding and actin structure, and gives interesting insights into the structural heterogeneity of myosin-V.</p><p>The paper is written in a way that provides testable predictions of the importance of specific residue-residue interactions to nucleotide binding, and the conformational changes that result in lever arm tilting upon ADP release. A strength of the paper is the thoughtfulness of the supplemental videos that relate to the figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank E.
