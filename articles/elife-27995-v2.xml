The retina and cortex are involved in such behavior, but it remains largely unknown how the thalamus, transferring visual information from the retina to the cortex, processes the periodic temporal patterns. Here we report that the luminance cells in the nucleus dorsolateralis anterior thalami (DLA) of pigeons exhibited oscillatory activities in a temporal pattern identical to the rhythmic luminance changes of repetitive light/dark (LD) stimuli with durations in the seconds-to-minutes range. Particularly, after LD stimulation, the DLA cells retained the entrained oscillatory activities with an interval closely matching the duration of the LD cycle. Furthermore, the post-stimulus oscillatory activities of the DLA cells were sustained without feedback inputs from the pallium (equivalent to the mammalian cortex). Our study suggests that the experience-dependent representation of time interval in the brain might not be confined to the pallial/cortical level, but may occur as early as at the thalamic level.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27995.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Being able to track the passage of time enables animals to predict when events will occur in the future. This in turn helps them optimize their behavior. Hummingbirds, for example, schedule their foraging visits so that they return to each flower after it has had time to replenish its supply of nectar. In the laboratory, rats and monkeys can learn to delay their responses to a cue until a specific period of time has elapsed in order to earn a reward. But how does the brain keep track of time?</p><p>To discover what is happening in the world around us, we rely on our eyes and other sense organs to collect sensory information. These organs send this information to the thalamus, a structure deep below the surface of the brain. The thalamus processes and filters the sensory information, and then forwards it to the cortex located in the brain’s outer layer. Experiments have shown that, after training with events that occur at regular intervals, cells in the cortex and the eye can signal the time at which the next event would occur. But it was not known if cells in the thalamus could do this too.</p><p>To answer this question, Yang, Wang et al. recorded from the thalamus of pigeons while exposing the birds to alternating periods of light and darkness. Pigeons were chosen because they have good eyesight and perform well on time-tracking tasks. A set of cells in the pigeon thalamus changed their activity levels to follow each light/dark switch. The cells tracked switches that occurred every few minutes as accurately as those that occurred every second. Next, Yang, Wang et al. stopped switching the light on and off, and instead left the light either on or off for 2-3 hr. Even in constant light or darkness during the 2-3 hr, some of the cells maintained their previous pattern of firing. In other words, the cells continued to signal the time when the light/dark switches should occur long after the switching had been stopped. Inactivating the pigeon’s equivalent area of the mammalian cortex in the brain had no effect on this response.</p><p>The findings of Yang, Wang et al. suggest that the thalamus – like the cortex and the eye – can track events that occur at regular intervals, at least in pigeons. The next step is to determine whether the thalamus encodes time intervals in other species as well, and how this might help the animals to optimize time-dependent behaviors, such as foraging and navigation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>thalamus</kwd><kwd>time</kwd><kwd>pigeons</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31372206</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiao</surname><given-names>Qian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31371105</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Yi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002367</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>QYZDB-SSW-SMC032</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The experience-dependent representation of time interval in the seconds-to-minutes range occurs as early as at the thalamic level in the brain.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ability to process and sense the temporal information of external stimuli is fundamental for humans and other animals in enabling them to adapt to the environment.

A recent study showed, however, that some retinal ganglion cells in salamander and mouse retinae signal the time at which an omitted stimulus in a sequence of flashes would occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schwartz et al., 2007</xref>). There is also increasing evidence showing that the visual thalamus filters, rather than passively relays, the visual information sensed by the retina as it signals to the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cudeiro and Sillito, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Saalmann and Kastner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sherman, 2016</xref>). Thus, the thalamus may also be involved in coding the temporal information of periodic visual stimuli. However, we have limited knowledge on how the visual thalamus encodes the temporal information from experienced stimuli and represents the time that has elapsed since the previous event.</p><p>To address this question, we used the pigeon as an animal model and the nucleus dorsolateralis anterior thalami (DLA) as the target brain area. The pigeon is a common animal model for behavioral and neurobiological studies of time-dependent cognitive tasks, such as interval timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kalenscher et al., 2006</xref>), sequence learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Helduser et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lissek et al., 2013</xref>), and delayed matching-to-sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Browning et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, to achieve foraging and safe flight successfully in diverse environments, birds have developed a complex visual system that is superior to that of most vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shimizu and Watanabe, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wylie et al., 2015</xref>). The avian DLA receives direct retinal inputs, projects onto the pallial Wulst in both hemispheres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Karten et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bagnoli and Burkhalter, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Miceli et al., 1987</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">, 2008</xref>), and receives feedback inputs from the pallial Wulst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Karten et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Miceli et al., 1987</xref>). The avian retina-DLA-Wulst pathway is comparable to the mammalian retina-lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN)-striate visual pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shimizu and Karten, 1993</xref>).

More importantly, the luminance cells in the pigeon DLA can encode ambient luminance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yang et al., 2005</xref>).

All luminance cells had steady firing rates under constant photic conditions and synchronized their activities with the rhythmic luminance changes of LD stimuli. After LD stimulation, some luminance cells retained the entrained oscillatory activities even when the photic conditions were constant. The post-stimulus replay responses of these cells were dependent on the time interval and number of LD cycles of periodic stimuli applied during LD stimulation. Both Wulst pharmacological inactivation and electrolytic lesions did not affect the post-stimulus oscillatory responses of DLA cells entrained by the periodic LD stimuli, suggesting that the intrinsic circuits in the DLA play the primary role in representing the time interval of periodic events experienced previously.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Photic responses of DLA luminance cells were modified by periodic LD stimuli experienced previously</title><p>We recorded 190 DLA luminance cells from 19 animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These cells encoded ambient luminance and sustained steady activities under constant photic conditions. Their firing rates either increased (light-activated) or decreased (light-suppressed) monotonically when the luminance level of the stimulus was raised in steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). During LD stimulation, all luminance cells synchronized their firing rates with the rhythmic luminance changes of LD stimuli whose temporal frequencies ranged from 0.5 Hz (L/D: 1 s/1 s) to 0.002 Hz (L/D: 240 s/240 s). The oscillation frequencies of the entrained activities of these cells were closely correlated with the temporal frequencies of the luminance changes of LD stimuli (linear regression, slope = 0.99, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.99). After LD stimulation, the light-activated cells were tested under light, whereas the light-suppressed cells were tested in darkness. Neuronal activities of each luminance cell after LD stimulation were continuously recorded for 2–3 hr. We found that 54 cells (54/190 = 28%) retained the entrained oscillatory activities under constant photic conditions after LD stimulation. Thus, these cells were referred to as replay cells, which included 25 light-activated and 29 light-suppressed cells. Before LD stimulation, a typical DLA replay cell exhibited steady spontaneous activity in constant darkness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, top row). During LD stimulation, the firing rates of this typical DLA replay cell oscillated at the same frequency (0.0085 Hz) as the luminance changes of the LD stimulus (L/D: 60 s/60 s) (middle row). As shown in the response histogram, in the first 10 min after 10 LD cycles (bottom row), the neuronal activity of this cell continued to oscillate at almost the same frequency (0.0073 Hz) as the LD stimulus.</p><p>The remaining DLA cells (136/190 = 72%) displayed non-oscillatory response patterns after LD stimulation and were therefore referred to as non-replay cells. For example, a typical DLA non-replay cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) had steady excitatory responses in constant light (200 lux). This cell synchronized its firing rates with the luminance changes of the periodic photic stimulus (L/D: 30 s/30 s). After 25 LD cycles, this cell first had excitatory responses to the light onset and then returned to a steady firing pattern, rather than continuing the oscillatory activity under constant light.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Post-stimulus activities of replay cells were correlated with parameters of periodic stimuli</title><p>The neuronal responses of replay cells after LD stimulation were regulated by both the temporal frequency of luminance changes and the number of LD cycles during LD stimulation. To evaluate the effects of stimulus parameters on the neuronal activities of replay cells after LD stimulation, the temporal frequency of LD stimuli was varied from 0.5 Hz (L/D: 1 s/1 s) to 0.002 Hz (L/D: 240 s/240 s) and the number of LD cycles was varied within a range from 5 to 25 cycles. We found that, first, replay cells did not exhibit oscillatory activities after LD stimulation when the duration of the LD cycle was shorter than 10 s (L/D: 5 s/5 s). The oscillation frequencies of replay cells (n = 54 cells) after LD stimulation were highly correlated with the temporal frequencies of LD stimuli (slope = 0.62, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.99) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Furthermore, once a replay cell returned to its steady non-oscillatory activity under constant photic conditions, it could be re-entrained by visual stimuli of other frequencies (6 cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The duration of the first replay cycle after LD stimulation was also linearly correlated with the duration of the LD cycle (slope = 0.58, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.95, n = 54 cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Second, the increase in the number of LD cycles led to an increase in the oscillation time of replay cells after LD stimulation. When the temporal frequency of the LD stimulus was set to 0.0165 Hz (L/D: 30 s/30 s), the number of replay cycles increased when the number of LD cycles increased (slope = 0.41, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.99, n = 21 cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27995.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Relationship between parameters of the LD stimulus and neuronal responses of the replay cells after LD stimulation in the DLA.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The oscillation frequencies of the responses of DLA replay cells (mean ± SEM, n = 54 cells) in the first 14 min after LD stimulation were linearly correlated with the temporal frequencies of LD stimuli (log-log scale).

Moreover, the post-stimulus replay responses of these cells depended on the temporal frequency and the number of LD cycles applied during LD stimulation. The feedback inputs of the pallial Wulst to the DLA did not contribute to the post-stimulus oscillatory activities of the DLA cells. Our results suggest that thalamic cells not only follow the current changes of periodic stimuli, but also remember the temporal patterns of periodic stimuli experienced previously.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Thalamic cells more reliably follow the temporal patterns of repetitive stimuli than retinal cells</title><p>Previous study has shown that retinal ganglion cells in salamander and mouse retinae respond to an omitted stimulus in a sequence of flashes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schwartz et al., 2007</xref>). However, the retinal response to the omitted stimulus is not observed more than once and it is irrelevant to whether the recorded cells respond to the flashes throughout the flash sequence. Compared to the retinal cells, the pigeon thalamic cells in our experiment not only accurately signaled the time of each luminance change of repetitive stimuli during LD stimulation, but also showed reliable replay responses after the periodic stimulation. The omitted stimulus response in the retina occurs for repetitive stimuli with short intervals (20 ms–100 ms) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schwartz et al., 2007</xref>), but thalamic cells can be entrained by temporal patterns with long intervals (10 s–8 min). Furthermore, the replay responses of thalamic cells can be maintained for more than one cycle. For example, the replay responses of the DLA cell in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> continued for up to 48 min and 16 replay cycles in constant darkness after 20 min of periodic LD stimulation (L/D: 60 s/60 s, 10 cycles). In addition, the number of replay cycles increased with the increase in the number of LD cycles.</p><p>The post-stimulus oscillatory responses of thalamic replay cells entrained by periodic stimuli with the interval in the seconds-to-minutes range are unlikely to originate from the retina. The omitted stimulus potential (OSP) is traditionally regarded as a sign of expectation of a stimulus at the due-time. In human EEG recordings, the OSP has been observed under low (&lt; 2 Hz) and fast (&gt; 5 Hz) stimulus rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bullock et al., 1994</xref>). The fast OSP arises in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bullock et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schwartz et al., 2007</xref>), but it is not clear whether the slow OSP also arises in the retina. When a periodic stimulus with an interval in the order of seconds was presented to zebrafish larvae in vivo, the retinal ganglion cells did not show post-stimulus rhythmic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sumbre et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, during visual conditioning, the responses of retinal ganglion cells evoked by CS (a few seconds of whole-field light) did not change with the training of pigeons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wild and Cohen, 1985</xref>). These studies imply that retinal ganglion cells might not retain the entrained activity after the presentation of repetitive stimuli with the interval in the seconds-to-minutes range.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Experience-dependent representation of time interval is not confined to the pallial/cortical level in the brain</title><p>In addition to the thalamic cells reported in the present study, the post-stimulus replay response has also been observed in the optic tectum of zebrafish larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sumbre et al., 2008</xref>).

Therefore, the experience-dependent representation of time interval might not be confined to the pallial/cortical level, but may occur as early as the subcortical levels in the brain.</p><p>Although repetitive visual stimuli induce similar replay responses in the tectum and thalamus, the temporal information encoded in these two nuclei may contribute to different time-dependent tasks. Through descending outputs to the hindbrain, the vertebrate optic tectum/mammalian superior colliculus can use detected temporal information to accurately control the fast and immediate movements of animals, such as the eye-head coordination of monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Klier et al., 2003</xref>), the prey capture and visuomotor behavior of zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gahtan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sumbre et al., 2008</xref>), and the looming-object detection and avoidance of pigeons, cats, and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shang et al., 2015</xref>). However, the avian DLA/mammalian LGN mainly project to the pallium/cortex, thus it is more likely that the visual thalamus participates in the perceptual and cognitive tasks performed by the pallium/cortex. In the traditional view, the thalamus is thought to passively transfer ongoing visual information from the retina to the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Derrington, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Naito et al., 2013</xref>). By contrast, the thalamic replay cells in the present study not only followed the changes of current stimuli, but also retained a copy of the periodic events exposed previously. Here, these cells acted like a time-adjustable alarm clock. Although the external periodic events were vanished, the replay cells continuously signaled the time of upcoming events that would occur. Given the recent findings that the visual thalamus participates in many dynamic processes in the visual pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cudeiro and Sillito, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guillery and Sherman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Saalmann and Kastner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sherman, 2016</xref>), the timing signal that we observed in the visual thalamus might be recruited by the pallium/cortex in the time-dependent task.</p><p>Given that neither pharmacological inactivation nor electrolytic lesions of the Wulst in both hemispheres affected the post-stimulus oscillatory activities of the DLA cells entrained by external, slow frequency LD periodic stimulation, the time-interval representation of avian thalamic cells in the order of minutes is unlikely to be modulated by the pallium Wulst. Like the mammalian LGN, the avian DLA is involved in far more than the simple transmission of visual information from the retina to the visual pallium. In addition to the retinal and pallial Wulst projections, the DLA also receives afferent supplies from the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and the optic tectum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Miceli et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cantwell and Cassone, 2006</xref>). However, we do not know which cognitive functions of visual thalamus are modulated by the inputs from SCN and tectum in the pigeon. Therefore, further neurophysiological evidence is required to reveal the possible modulating inputs to DLA cells that are needed for time-interval representation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Post-stimulus oscillatory responses of the thalamic replay cells are induced by an intrinsic circuit in the thalamus</title><p>The intrinsic electrical properties of thalamic cells might determine their oscillatory responses to periodic stimuli. In mammals, thalamocortical cells (TC cells) are excitatory and project to the cortex, whereas the local interneurons in the LGN are GABAergic and exert inhibitory influence on TC cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Uhlrich and Cucchiaro, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sherman, 2016</xref>). Previous studies on thalamic slices suggest that TC cells and interneurons exhibit voltage-dependent intrinsic oscillation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Llinás and Steriade, 2006</xref>). In guinea pig thalamic slices, TC cells show voltage-sensitive ionic conductance and can generate two distinct functional states: repetitive spiking and bursting modes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Llinás and Jahnsen, 1982</xref>). By adjusting the membrane potential, the firings of TC cells can be switched from one state to the other. The interplay between low-threshold Ca<sup>2+</sup> (I<sub>Ca</sub>) and Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> current (I<sub>Na+K</sub>) is crucial for the low-frequency oscillation (&lt; 4 Hz) of TC cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McCormick and Pape, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Soltesz et al., 1991</xref>). In comparison with TC cells, the interaction between I<sub>Ca</sub> and the calcium-activated non-selective cation current (I<sub>CAN</sub>) is essential for the oscillatory burst firing of interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bal and McCormick, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhu et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Our experiment provides further evidence that the intrinsic circuit in the DLA, rather than the feedback inputs from the pallial Wulst, plays the primary role in the post-stimulus replay responses of DLA cells. The avian DLA receives direct retinal inputs and has reciprocal connections with the pallial Wulst. The retinal inputs are unlikely to contribute to the entrained post-stimulus activity in the seconds-to-minutes range, as discussed above. Neither pharmacological inactivation nor electrolytic lesions of the Wulst in both hemispheres had any significant effect on the post-stimulus oscillatory activities of DLA replay cells.</p><p>To understand the potential mechanism underlying the post-stimulus replay responses of the DLA cells, we introduced a simplified computational model (see Materials and methods) based on the electrophysiological properties of thalamic cells reported in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Llinás and Steriade, 2006</xref>) and our current results. The simple two-cell system included two model neurons (R-neuron and NR-neuron) that respectively simulated a replay cell and a non-replay cell. The DLA in pigeons has an abundance of GABA<sub>A</sub>, GABA<sub>B</sub>, and benzodiazepine-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Veenman et al., 1994</xref>). In the model, we proposed that the R-neuron received inhibitory synaptic inputs from the NR-neuron (I<sub>syn</sub>), but the NR-neuron did not receive synaptic inputs from the R-neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). By adjusting the model parameters, the model neurons captured most of the response features of the thalamic cells observed in the present experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). During LD stimulation, both the R-neuron and NR-neuron exhibited oscillatory activities synchronous with the periodic LD stimuli. After LD stimulation, the R-neuron continued the entrained oscillatory activity, whereas the NR-neuron returned to the non-oscillatory firing pattern. Further analyses of the post-stimulus activities of the R-neuron (R-neuron [u, I<sub>syn</sub>]) showed that the model neuron had a response pattern consistent with that of the real cell illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, as reflected in the increasing duration and decreasing mean activity of each replay cycle over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>).

In addition to the intrinsic membrane currents applied in the present model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marder et al., 1996</xref>), there are several factors that might affect the persistent responses of thalamic cells in the absence of periodic inputs, such as N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bottjer, 2005</xref>) and short-term synaptic plasticity in the neural network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mongillo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Szatmáry and Izhikevich, 2010</xref>). In addition, interneurons can exert inhibitory influences on neurons projecting to the Wulst in the avian DLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Miceli et al., 2008</xref>). It is plausible that the inhibitory inputs from the NR-neuron to the R-neuron in the model were mediated by inhibitory interneurons. In the present study, the computational model was simplified to include only two cells (R-neuron and NR-neuron). In the real brain, however, the post-stimulus oscillatory responses of replay cells are very likely to be generated by neural networks composed of a population of neurons in the DLA rather than a single R-neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gutnisky and Dragoi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benucci et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Replay responses of thalamic cells are not induced by anesthesia</title><p>As slow wave activity (&lt; 1 Hz) emerges in the thalamic cells of both anesthetized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Steriade et al., 1993</xref>) and awake animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albrecht et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Filippov and Frolov, 2005</xref>), one could assume that the anesthetic state induced the oscillatory activities of thalamic cells observed in the present experiment. However, our results suggest that the post-stimulus replay response of the thalamic cells was evoked by the external stimuli rather than by the anesthetic state for six reasons: (1) both replay and non-replay cells exhibited steady spontaneous activities under constant photic conditions before periodic stimulation; (2) both replay and non-replay cells showed synchronous activities with luminance changes during LD stimulation; and (3) under constant photic conditions after periodic stimulation, replay cells continued the entrained oscillatory activities in contrast to non-replay cells. The post-stimulus replay responses of replay cells were maintained for a long period of time, and then gradually returned to the non-oscillatory responses over time. (4) The replay responses of thalamic cells after LD stimulation were regulated by the temporal frequency and number of LD cycles applied during LD stimulation. (5) The time interval of LD stimuli shorter than 10 s (L/D: 5 s/5 s) could not induce the post-stimulus oscillatory responses of replay cells. (6) During recording, the depth of anesthesia was monitored and additional top-up doses of anesthetic were applied as required. Moreover, animals were also isolated from any other sensory stimuli, such as auditory, olfactory, and taste stimuli in the environment. Taken together, the periodic stimulus was the only factor that induced the photic and replay responses of the thalamic cells. In addition, previous studies have reported that the abilities of thalamic cells to discriminate visual features are less affected by the brain state (alert/non-alert) of animals. Although thalamic cells have higher firing rates when animals are awake than during anesthetic state, their sensitivities to stimuli with different spatial and temporal contrasts are comparable under the two conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cano et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alitto et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Functional significance of the entrained time-interval representation in the avian thalamus</title><p>The present study sheds light on the neural mechanism of translating temporal information from external and variable photic events into internal timing in the brain.

To investigate the possible contributions of the inputs from the pallial Wulst to the post-stimulus oscillatory activities of the DLA cells, the Wulst in both hemispheres was pharmacologically inactivated or electrolytically lesioned. (1) Pharmacological inactivation was achieved via the administration of a 1 μl Hamilton syringe filled with 2% muscimol (Abcam, UK). Multi-unit recordings show that 1 µl of muscimol (2%) can completely inactivate neuronal activities in a 2 mm diameter area around the cannula tip for ~3 hr, and can significantly attenuate the neuronal activities in a 4 mm diameter area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Partsalis et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arikan et al., 2002</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Timothy Behrens as the Senior Editor.

Learning and production of time sequences is an important task that allows animals to plan and perform complex tasks where time keeping is required. While a fair amount of work has been performed at the level of cortical sensory areas, basal ganglia and cerebellum, the authors investigate the possibility that periodic sequences can also be learned at the level of dorsolateralis anterior thalami (DLA), the avian equivalent to the mammalian LGN. The authors uncover a subset of neurons in DLA that, once primed by slow (&lt;&lt;1Hz) periodic changes in full field illumination, persist in expressing oscillatory activity for up to one hour. The main results from electrophysiological experiments are remarkable and certainly deserve attention. Electrophysiological experiments seem to be conducted carefully, raw recordings show that they can detect spikes with high SNR ratio and downstream analyses are fairly well described.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>1) With regard to the frequency range used for the experiments, Intervals from 30 s to 240 s are explored with no strong rationale for that choice. The authors should perform additional experiments to explore a broader range to determine where this phenomenon breaks down at both the high and low frequency ends.</p><p>2) The role of thalamocortical interactions in generating slow oscillatory activity has been subject to a large body of work. As a cortical feedback is excluded in authors' model they have to provide some experimental evidence for the possibility that DLA alone is capable of sustaining periodic activity without feedback from visual Wulst. A way to do that would be by pharmacological inhibition of the visual Wulst. The authors should perform additional experiments to explore this issue.</p><p>3) The model is too speculative. It either should be removed from the main body of the paper (and perhaps incorporated into the Discussion) or evidence should be provided to support its components. Specifically: a) The oscillatory behavior is all captured in the &quot;u&quot; variable that has no clear connection to a biophysical property of calcium channels. Without additional measurements, this parameter ends up being simply a recapitulation of the phenomenon. Measurements of the particular conductances that cause the resonance (if that is even the source – it could be a network property) are beyond the scope of this study. b) While inhibition from non-replay cells is one possible mechanism for the decay back to baseline, there is no experimental evidence for this, and (as the authors acknowledge in the Discussion), there are plenty of alternatives. Overall, the model seems like reasonable speculation for a Discussion section, but not a real result. c) The asymmetric connection between R and NR neurons in the model is somewhat arbitrary. The authors should discuss anatomical justification of this connectivity based on known anatomical data.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Representation of time interval entrained by periodic stimuli in the visual thalamus of pigeons&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

This is thoroughly described in Materials and methods and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>.

The shortest interval of periodic LD stimulus was set to 2 s (L/D: 1 s/1 s, 0.5 Hz). The longest interval of periodic stimuli was set to 480 s (L/D: 240 s/240 s, 0.002 Hz), which was the lowest frequency that we could test under current experimental conditions. Regardless of the recording time before LD stimulation, it took 1 hour and 20 minutes to present 10 LD cycles with duration in 480 s (L/D: 240 s/240 s). Neuronal activities of each luminance cell after LD stimulation were normally continuously recorded for up to 2-3 hours. Therefore, when the stimulus interval was longer than 480 s, it is hard to maintain a cell for a long enough time to collect all experimental results before, during, and after LD stimulation. Therefore, the duration of LD cycle of applied periodic photic stimuli included 1 s/1 s, 2 s/2 s, 5 s/5 s, 10 s/10 s, 15 s/15 s, 30 s/30 s, 60 s/60 s, 120 s/120 s and 240 s/240 s.</p><p>We found that 1) As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B and 1C</xref>, the luminance cells in the present experiment encoded the ambient luminance. The DLA replay cells did not show oscillatory responses after LD stimulation when the interval of periodic stimulus applied during LD stimulation was shorter than 10s (L/D: 5 s/5 s). 2) As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A and 2C</xref>, the post-stimulus oscillatory activities of replay cells fitted better with applied LD stimuli when the temporal frequency of LD stimuli was in the range 0.0167 Hz (L/D: 30 s/30 s) to 0.0042 Hz (L/D: 120 s/120 s). Although we tested LD stimuli with periods up to only 480 s, it is conceivable that these neurons could learn to replay the much longer LD cycle and establish a stable rhythmic firing after entrained with enough number of LD cycles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The role of thalamocortical interactions in generating slow oscillatory activity has been subject to a large body of work. As a cortical feedback is excluded in authors' model they have to provide some experimental evidence for the possibility that DLA alone is capable of sustaining periodic activity without feedback from visual Wulst. A way to do that would be by pharmacological inhibition of the visual Wulst. The authors should perform additional experiments to explore this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>As the thalamocortical inter-connections in the mammalian brain, the avian DLA has reciprocal connections with the pallial Wulst (equivalent to the mammalian cortex) in both hemispheres (Karten et al., 1973; Miceli et al., 1987; Miceli et al., 2008). To address the question whether the feedback inputs from Wulst to DLA contribute to the oscillatory activities observed in the DLA, we designed two experiments to compare the activities of DLA cells before and after the Wulst in both hemispheres was pharmacologically inactivated or damaged by electrolytic lesion, respectively.</p><p>Two types of luminance cells were recorded in the present experiment: replay cells and non-replay cells. Driven by the retinal inputs, both replay and non-replay cells accurately encoded the luminance changes of periodic stimuli during LD stimulation. However, under constant photic conditions after LD stimulation, only replay cells retained the entrained oscillatory activities. Therefore, in the additional experiments, we mainly concerned about whether the response patterns of replay cells after periodic stimulation were affected by pharmacological inactivation or electrolytic lesion of the Wulst in both hemispheres.</p><p>Experiment one:</p><p>The previous studies have carefully measured the effective spread of 1 µl of muscimol (2%) in the brain (Partsalis et al., 1995; Arikan et al., 2002). It is known that 1 µl of muscimol (2%) can completely inactivate neuronal activities within 2 mm in diameter around the cannula tip at roughly 3 hr and significantly attenuate the neuronal activities within 4 mm diameter area. In addition, as shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>, the avian Wulst (A 8.00 to 14.50, 0 to L3.00, 0 to H3.00) in the pallium is a multilaminate structure which contains HA (hyperpallium apicale), HI (hyperpallium intercalatum), and HD (hyperpallium densocellulare). The projections of DLA mainly terminate in the HD and HI of the Wulst (Karten et al., 1973; Bagnoli and Burkhalter, 1983). The HA is the major area of Wulst that sends feedback projections to DLA, and forward projections to other visual and somatosensory/motor areas in the brain (Karten et al., 1973). Considering all these factors, we injected 1 µl muscimol (2%) at each of four different coordinates: (A10, L1.5, H1.5) and (A12, L1.5, H1.5) in the left hemisphere, (A10, L1.5, H1.5) and (A12, L1.5, H1.5) in the right hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The injection sites were also identified to locate within the HA.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, we measured the oscillation frequency, duration of first replay cycle, and number of replay cycles of single replay cells before and after bilateral Wulst inactivation (n = 12 cells). We did not observe significant effects of Wulst inactivation on these parameters. In addition, without the feedback inputs from the pallial Wulst, the entrained oscillatory activities of replay cells sustained after LD stimulation and slowly declined over time. The oscillation frequencies of post-stimulus activities of replay cells linearly correlated with the temporal frequencies of LD stimuli before and after Wulst inactivation.</p><p>Experiment two: We do notice that the pharmacological inactivation of pallial Wulst in the experiment one had no significant effects on the post-stimulus oscillatory activities of DLA replay cells. To exclude the possible impact of incomplete Wulst inactivation, the electrolytic lesions were applied in the Wulst of both hemispheres. The lesion areas were confirmed from the brain slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, DLA replay cells still sustained the entrained oscillatory activities after LD stimulation when the Wulst in both hemispheres was completely lesioned and the response characteristics of their post-stimulus activities were similar to those measured in the animals without Wulst lesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>).</p><p>The results of additional experiments suggest that the feedback inputs from pallial Wulst do not contribute to the oscillatory activities of DLA cells under constant photic conditions after periodic stimulation. In addition to pallial inputs, the avian DLA also receives direct retinal inputs. However, the retinal cells responded to the omitted stimulus in repetitive stimuli with short intervals (20-100 ms) (Schwartz et al., 2007). When the stimuli in the seconds range were applied, the retinal cells did not show rhythmic activities after periodic visual stimulation (Sumbre et al., 2008). Taken these results together, the intrinsic circuits in the DLA rather than the retinal and pallial inputs play the main role in the entrained replay responses of DLA cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The model is too speculative. It either should be removed from the main body of the paper (and perhaps incorporated into the Discussion) or evidence should be provided to support its components.</p></disp-quote><p>Fully agree with the reviewers’ suggestions, we have moved the detailed description of computational model from the Results in the previous manuscript to the Materials and methods in the current version, and the computational model was only discussed in Discussion as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. The values of all parameters in the computational model were also listed in detail in the Materials and methods</p><p>As we stated in the Discussion of the manuscript, due to a variety of reasons, the present computational model was not fully conclusive. The lesion marks of recording sites only confirmed the recording area in the DLA but could not provide further information about the neuronal morphology and synaptic connections of recorded cells. The studies on the intrinsic electrical properties of DLA cells in the avian brain slices are also very few so far. Therefore, the computational model was only used to try to explain the potential neural mechanism underlying the experiment results. Further experiments, especially on the avian brain, are definitely required to fully understand the underlying neural mechanism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specifically: a) The oscillatory behavior is all captured in the &quot;u&quot; variable that has no clear connection to a biophysical property of calcium channels.

By adjusting the parameters of model neuron, the neuron produces repetitive spiking or bursting. For example, the variable ‘S’ of model neuron in the Sherman and Rinzel’s work plays the same role as the variable ‘u’ in the present work. The authors suggested that the variable ‘S’ can be intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> that slowly accumulates and activates a K<sup>+</sup> current (Sherman et al., 1988).</p><p>The thalamocortical cells (TC cells) and interneurons in the mammalian LGN exhibit the voltage-dependent intrinsic oscillation (Zhu et al., 1999; Llinás and Steriade, 2006). In the brain slices, the properties of calcium channels and the contribution of I<sub>Ca</sub> in the intrinsic oscillation of thalamic cells were carefully studied (Llinás and Jahnsen, 1982; McCormick and Pape, 1990; Soltesz et al., 1991). These works show that the interplay between the low-threshold Ca<sup>2+</sup> (I<sub>Ca</sub>) and Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> current (I<sub>Na+K</sub>)/ non-selective cation current (I<sub>CAN</sub>) are crucial to the low-frequency oscillation (&lt; 4 Hz) of TC cells or interneurons in the LGN.</p><p>Based on these studies, we proposed that the dynamic changes of I<sub>Ca</sub> induced the oscillation responses of DLA cells to the periodic LD stimulus, which was reflected in the variable ‘u’ in the model neuron.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) While inhibition from non-replay cells is one possible mechanism for the decay back to baseline, there is no experimental evidence for this, and (as the authors acknowledge in the Discussion), there are plenty of alternatives.

The intrinsic voltage-dependent oscillation of thalamic cells might explain the first question. For the second question, the DLA in pigeons is abundant of GABA<sub>A</sub>, GABA<sub>B</sub> and benzodiazepine binding sites (Veenman et al., 1994). Therefore, we introduced the inter-neuron inhibition into the model. In addition, we had ever tried different inter-neurons connections in the computational model, such as excitatory, inhibitory or combined excitatory and inhibitory. The simulation results with the inhibitory inter-neuron connection were consistent with the experimental results. As we expected, the oscillatory activities of model neuron after periodic stimulation attenuated under constant photic conditions over time. However, we cannot exclude other factors that might affect the persistent responses of thalamic cells in the absence of periodic inputs, such as the NMDA currents (Bottjer, 2005; Wang, 2001) and short-term synaptic plasticity in the neural network (Mongillo et al., 2008; Szatmáry and Izhikevich, 2010). In addition, it is known that interneurons can exert inhibitory influences on neurons projecting to the Wulst in the avian DLA (Miceli et al., 2008). It is plausible that the inhibitory inputs from the NR-neuron to the R-neuron in the model were mediated by inhibitory interneurons. In the present study, the computational model was simplified to only include two cells (R- neuron and NR-neuron). In the real brain, however, the post-stimulus oscillatory responses of replay cells are very likely to be generated by neural networks composed of a population of neurons in the DLA rather than a single cell (Gutnisky and Dragoi 2008; Wang et al., 2011; Benucci et al., 2013).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) The asymmetric connection between R and NR neurons in the model is somewhat arbitrary. The authors should discuss anatomical justification of this connectivity based on known anatomical data.</p></disp-quote><p>By injecting tracer into the retina and Wulst in pigeons respectively, the fine structure of the DLA was analyzed using hodological techniques and GABA-immunocytochemistry (Miceli et al., 2008). As the mammalian LGN, the avian DLA receives direct retinal inputs and has reciprocal connections with the pallial Wulst. There are two types of GABA-immunonegative thalamopallial projection neurons and a single type of strongly GABA-immunoreactive interneurons in the DLA.</p><p>Two types of projection neurons are discriminated on the basis of cytological characters of neuronal somata. Type-1 projection neurons are ovoid in shape with major diameters of 12 μm and minor diameters of 7 μm. Type-2 projection neurons are round to fusiform with a major diameter of 14–16 μm and a minor diameter of 6–8 μm. Relative to type-1 projection neurons, type-2 projection neurons display well-developed Golgi cisterns and large Nissl bodies. In pigeons, 72% of the GABA-immunonegative retinal terminals contact projection neurons and 28% contact interneurons in the DLA. However, the intrinsic electrical properties of DLA projection neurons and their possible inter-neuron connections are unknown. Further experimental evidences are required to prove whether the projection neurons are the DLA replay/non-replay cells (R-/NR-neuron) and the possible relationship between them.</p><p>The retinothalamic and palliothalamic axon terminals are GABA-immunonegative in the DLA. In addition, the interneurons in the DLA exert inhibitory influences on neurons projecting to the Wulst.

Both GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub> binding sites are abundant in the avian Wulst (Veenman et al., 1994). To examine the spatial range and temporal course of muscimol inhibitory effect in Wulst cells, the neuronal activities of Wulst cells were determined by the mean firing rates of eight recording positions. Each recording site was 0.5 mm from the injection site. The electrode accessed each recording site one by one and continuously recorded 10 min of spontaneous activity at each site. It took about 1.5 hr to complete the recordings of all eight positions. We measured the activity changes of Wulst cells surrounding three different injection sites before and after injection. Our results are consistent with the previous works that the muscimol can effectively inhibit the neuronal activities in the brain for the long term (Partsalis et al., 1995; Arikan et al., 2002). The results were presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref> and Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>· Surgical lesion.

To achieve the complete Wulst lesion in both hemispheres, we first tried to use the normal multi-site electrolytic lesions with the electrode by increasing the applied current and duration. However, from the brain slices of Wulst-lesioned animals, we found that this method was ineffective and could not guarantee the complete Wulst lesion. Then, we chose the hand-hold CH-HI Cautery (Advanced Meditech International, USA) to make the lesion. With CH-HI Cautery, the lesion surgery was done quickly and the bleeding in the surgery was effectively reduced. The brain slices of lesioned animals also confirmed the effectiveness of this method.</p><p>During the surgery, the physical conditions of anesthetized animals were strictly monitored, such as the animal’s breath, heart rate, body temperature. After the surgery, the lesion area was covered with the sterilized medical hemostatic sponge. The electrophysiological recordings started at one hour after the surgery.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The finding that both procedures do not have any effect on the ability of some DLA cells to replay periodic luminance stimuli is convincing. However, given the extent of these procedures, especially the electrolytic lesioning, I would expect to see some nonspecific effects such as a global reduction/increase in basal or evoked firing rates. As firing rates are normalized in order to compare peak responses (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5F</xref>) these nonspecific effects cannot be inferred from the data presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We analyzed the basal firing rates and photic responses of single DLA replay cell before and after muscimol injection in the Wulst of both hemispheres. The firing rates of replay cells under constant photic conditions before periodic stimulation were slightly reduced after pharmacological Wulst inactivation. The photic responses of DLA replay cells evoked by periodic LD stimuli were evaluated by a preference index of their photic responses (R) to light (L = 200 lux) and dark stimuli (D = 0 lux) (index = (R<sub>L</sub> – R<sub>D</sub>) / (R<sub>L</sub> + R<sub>D</sub>)). No significant change in response preference for photic stimuli was observed after Wulst inactivation.</p><p>The same method of analysis was also applied to compare the spontaneous activities and photic responses of the DLA replay cells recorded in normal and Wulst-lesioned animals. The Wulst lesion did not affect the spontaneous activities and photic responses of DLA replay cells. Under constant photic conditions before LD stimulation, no significant change in the spontaneous firing rate was observed between the replay cells recorded in the normal animals and those recorded in the Wulst-lesioned animals. Furthermore, the photic responses of DLA replay cells were also not affected by Wulst lesions, which was reflected in no significant change in the preference index for photic stimuli for both light-activated and light-suppressed</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A panel with raw firing rates, like <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref> before and after pharmacological block and/or electrolytic lesions would be helpful in building the argument that periodic replay is selectively resistant to these modifications.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by reviewers, a typical replay cell with the raw firing traces before and after muscimol injection was presented in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In case no nonspecific effects can be observed the authors should provide some additional lines in Discussion explaining that outcome by providing plausible reasons as to why eliminating feedback from the visual Wulst had no impact on DLA activity in their recordings.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the previous and present studies, we briefly discussed the possible reasons why the Wulst had no effect on the post-stimulus replay behavior of DLA cells in Discussion.</p><p>Given that neither pharmacological inactivation nor electrolytic lesions of the Wulst in both hemispheres affected the post-stimulus oscillatory activities of the DLA cells entrained by external, slow frequency LD periodic stimulation, the time-interval representation of avian thalamic cells in the order of minutes is unlikely to be modulated by the pallium Wulst. Like the mammalian LGN, the avian DLA is involved in far more than the simple transmission of visual information from the retina to the visual pallium. In addition to the retinal and pallial Wulst projections, the DLA also receives afferent supplies from the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and the optic tectum (Miceli et al., 2008; Cantwell and Cassone, 2006). However, we do not know which cognitive functions of visual thalamus are modulated by the SCN and tectum in the pigeon. Therefore, further neurophysiological evidence is required to reveal the possible modulating inputs to DLA cells in time-interval representation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
