homeostasis. The mouse neural plate is a cuboidal epithelium that remodels into a columnar pseudostratified epithelium over the course of 24 hr. Here we show that the transition to a columnar epithelium fails in mutant embryos that lack the tumor suppressor PTEN, although proliferation, patterning and apical-basal polarity markers are normal in the mutants. The <italic>Pten</italic> phenotype is mimicked by constitutive activation of PI3 kinase and is rescued by the removal of PDK1 (PDPK1), but does not depend on the downstream kinases AKT and mTORC1. High resolution imaging shows that PTEN is required for stabilization of planar cell packing in the neural plate and for the formation of stable apical-basal microtubule arrays. The data suggest that appropriate levels of membrane-associated PDPK1 are required for stabilization of apical junctions, which promotes cell elongation, during epithelial morphogenesis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12034.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12034.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12034.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In mammals, the brain and spinal cord develop from a flat sheet of cells called the neural plate, which bends around to create a structure known as the neural tube. This bending process occurs through a complex sequence of cell shape changes. The cells in the neural plate are initially short and wide, but transform into long, thin cells as the neural plate forms. Problems that prevent the neural tube from forming correctly are amongst the most common birth defects in humans.</p><p>Many cancer cells contain a mutation that affects a gene that produces a protein called PTEN. This protein normally activates a tumor suppressor pathway, and so cancer cells that lack PTEN divide and grow uncontrollably. Grego-Bessa et al. have now examined mouse embryos that lack this gene, and found that the neural plate in such embryos forms irregular ruffles rather than a closed tube.</p><p>Further investigation revealed that the neural tube defects are not due to the inactivation of the traditional tumor suppressor pathway. Instead, correct neural tube formation relies upon the ability of PTEN to remove phosphate groups from a target lipid, which is important for limiting the activity of an enzyme called PDK1. Unlimited PDK1 activity causes complex changes that prevent the neural plate cells from elongating and packing together correctly. Future work is now needed to investigate the exact molecules targeted by PDK1 and the roles they play in disorders and diseases caused by a lack of the PTEN protein.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12034.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12034.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>epithelial morphogenesis</kwd><kwd>neural tube defect</kwd><kwd>tumor suppressor</kwd><kwd>PI3 kinase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HD03455</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>Kathryn V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS044385</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>Kathryn V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 CA008748</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baselga</surname><given-names>José</given-names></name><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>Kathryn V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In addition to its role in regulating proliferation and cell death, the PTEN tumor suppressor regulates epithelial morphogenesis through the PDK1 kinase.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Phosphoinositides are powerful second messengers in signaling pathways that also control epithelial organization and cell motility, placing them at a unique intersection of signaling and morphogenesis. The lipid phosphatase PTEN, which converts the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>) to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>), is the second most commonly mutated gene in human cancers. PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> and PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> act by recruiting specific sets of pleckstrin homology domain-containing proteins to the plasma membrane (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lietzke et al., 2000</xref>), where they become active.</p><p>The best-studied functions of PTEN are as a negative regulator of proliferation and a positive regulator of apoptosis through the PDPK1-AKT-mTOR pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chalhoub and Baker, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Song et al., 2012</xref>). In addition to its role in tumorigenesis, loss of one copy of the wild-type <italic>PTEN</italic> gene leads to complex human developmental disorders such as Cowden and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndromes, which are characterized by macrocephaly, benign tumors, arteriovenous malformations, and autism spectrum disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blumenthal and Dennis, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhou and Parada, 2012</xref>). Phosphoinositides play important roles in the architecture of epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shewan et al., 2011</xref>), consistent with the high frequency of <italic>PTEN</italic> mutations in carcinomas. Studies on lumen morphogenesis in a three-dimensional culture system showed that PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is enriched in the apical membrane, whereas PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> is enriched in basolateral membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Martin-Belmonte et al., 2007</xref>), and this was proposed to be important in tumor development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shewan et al., 2011</xref>). Mammalian PTEN regulates cellular processes as diverse as collective cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bloomekatz et al., 2012</xref>) and axon regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Park et al., 2008</xref>), and some of the effects of PTEN are independent of the AKT pathway (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vasudevan et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>PTEN is essential for viability and <italic>Pten</italic> null mouse embryos arrest at midgestation with a complex set of morphological defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Suzuki et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bloomekatz et al., 2012</xref>). We showed previously that PTEN is required for the directional collective migration of a population of extraembryonic cells, the anterior visceral endoderm (AVE), which must move from a distal to proximal position to define the anterior-posterior body axis of the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bloomekatz et al., 2012</xref>). PTEN is also required in the cells of the embryo proper: deletion of <italic>Pten</italic> in cells of the epiblast (the embryo proper) using the <italic>Sox2-Cre</italic> transgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hayashi et al., 2002</xref>) (<italic>Pten</italic> △Epi) bypasses the requirement for AVE migration but leads arrest at midgestation (~E9.0) with a syndrome of defects that included cardia bifida, abnormal mesoderm migration, and an abnormal open neural tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bloomekatz et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Mammalian neural tube closure requires more than 100 genes that regulate a sequence of orchestrated morphogenetic processes that transform the neural epithelium into a closed tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Copp and Greene, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harris and Juriloff, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Colas and Schoenwolf, 2001</xref>). Failure of any one of these events can cause neural tube defects, the second most common type of human birth defect after cardiac malformations. Most genetic studies of neural tube closure have focused on the cell rearrangements in the ventral midline mediated by the planar cell polarity pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Murdoch et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ybot-Gonzalez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nishimura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Williams et al., 2014</xref>) or on the actin-mediated apical constriction of neural epithelial cells required for neural tube closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Suzuki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grego-Bessa et al., 2015</xref>). Prior to apical constriction, the neural plate lateral to the midline is transformed from a cuboidal to a tightly packed pseudostratified columnar epithelium, so that by E9.5, up to 8 nuclei are stacked on top of each other, with each cell retaining connections to both the apical surface and the basement membrane of the epithelium.</p><p>Here we define the cellular and biochemical basis of the neural tube closure defect seen in mouse embryos that lack PTEN. The <italic>Pten</italic> neural plate phenotype is not the result of changes in proliferation, apoptosis, cell fate or loss of epithelial polarity. Instead, <italic>Pten</italic> mutants have a novel defect in neural morphogenesis: they fail to form a pseudostratified columnar epithelium. Cells do not elongate along their apical-basal axis; they fail to become compacted along the mediolateral axis of the embryo and they fail to pack into a stable hexagonal array. A combination of genetic and chemical genetic experiments demonstrate that these defects are due to the loss of the lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN and to the activation of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDPK1 (PDK1)), but do not depend on the AKT-mTOR tumor suppressor pathway. The data suggest that PTEN activity is required for stabilization of cell packing in the neural plate, which is in turn required for formation of apical-basal microtubule arrays, apical-to-basal trafficking, and cell elongation in the neural plate. We suggest that the role of PTEN in epithelial morphogenesis contributes to the developmental malformations in <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant syndromes and to the behavior of tumors that lack PTEN.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PTEN is required for formation of the pseudostratified neural epithelium, but not for proliferation, patterning or apical-basal polarity</title><p>The cephalic neural epithelium in <italic>Pten</italic><sup>-/-</sup> or <italic>Pten</italic> △Epi embryos does not close to make a neural tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bloomekatz et al., 2012</xref>).

In <italic>Pten</italic> mutant embryos, a SOX2+ neural epithelium forms, shows normal segregation of apical and basal markers, is patterned by developmental signals, and proliferates normally. However, the mutant cephalic neural epithelium fails to undergo the transition from a cuboidal to a tall, columnar pseudostratified epithelium; instead, the mutant neural plate is thin, wide and irregularly folded, and cephalic neural tube closure fails completely.</p><p>Phosphoinositides have been described as key regulators of apical-basal polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Martin-Belmonte et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shewan et al., 2011</xref>), and indeed the <italic>Pten</italic> mutants have a profound defect in the organization of the third (apical-basal) dimension of the neural epithelium. However, the traditional markers of apical-basal polarity are localized correctly in the <italic>Pten</italic> mutant neural plate: Par3, aPKC, ZO1, P-ERM, N-cadherin and F-actin are apically localized, and laminin is basally localized. Based on the enrichment of pAKT in both apical and basolateral membranes of the <italic>Pten</italic> mutant neural plate, apical-basal polarity markers are localized correctly despite high levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> throughout cell membranes.</p><p>Despite the important roles of phosphoinositides in mTOR signaling, endocytic sorting, recycling and trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Di Paolo and De Camilli, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shewan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dibble and Cantley, 2015</xref>), the genetic and chemical genetic data demonstrate that all the phenotypes in the <italic>Pten</italic> neural plate are mediated by increased activity of PDPK1. Although phosphorylated AKT is enriched in all cellular membranes in the mutant neural plate, inhibition of the downstream kinases AKT or mTor does not modify the <italic>Pten</italic> mutant phenotype, whereas removal of <italic>Pdpk1</italic> rescues all aspects of the <italic>Pten</italic> phenotype. We therefore conclude that it is the inappropriate PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>-stimulated activity of PDPK1, and not changes in levels of other phosphoinositides or in the activity of AKT or mTorc1, that mediates all the morphogenetic defects seen in the <italic>Pten</italic> mutant neural epithelium.</p><p>Perhaps the most striking cellular difference between the <italic>Pten</italic> and wild-type neural plate cells is the absence of stable apical-basal microtubule arrays in the mutant. The formation of noncentrosomal apicobasal microtubule arrays, with apical minus-ends and basal plus-ends, is a hallmark of columnar epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bré et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jaulin and Kreitzer, 2010</xref>). Consistent with a requirement of microtubule arrays for apical-basal trafficking in columnar epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jaulin and Kreitzer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rodriguez-Boulan and Macara, 2014</xref>), basal trafficking of apically endocytosed transferrin fails in the <italic>Pten</italic> neural plate. Recent work showed that PTEN can bind directly to microtubule-associated vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Naguib et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that PTEN could play a direct role in apical-to-basal trafficking in the neural plate. The data show that the PTEN is required for organization of stable arrays of apical-basally oriented microtubules, which may both stabilize the long axis of the cell and promote the redistribution of membrane from the apical to the basolateral domains of neuroepithelial cells, leading to the transition from a cuboidal to a columnar epithelium.</p><p>At the same stage (between E8.0 and E8.5) when wild-type neural cells begin to elongate and form arrays of apical-basal stable microtubules, cells of the neural plate are also reorganizing in the plane of the epithelium to become more hexagonally packed. At E8.0, cell packing in both the wild-type and <italic>Pten</italic> mutant anterior neural plate is irregular and includes the rosette-like arrangements that are a hallmark of dynamic epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blankenship et al., 2006</xref>). By E8.5, wild-type cells have resolved into a more regular packing pattern and fewer rosettes are observed, while the <italic>Pten</italic> neural plate continues to have many rosette-like cell arrangements.</p><p>Pten-dependent, Akt-independent changes in cell packing have also been observed in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing disc, where the effect of <italic>Pten</italic> mutations was attributed to a defects in the remodeling of adherens junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bardet et al., 2013</xref>). Similar to what we observed in the cephalic neural plate of the mouse <italic>Pten</italic> mutant, <italic>Drosophila Pten</italic> mutant wing disc epithelial cells have fewer neighbors than seen in a regular hexagonal array. In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> case, high levels of myosin-II are preferentially seen on short cell edges of <italic>Pten</italic> mutant cells. In contrast, myosin-II is anisotropically distributed in the both the wild-type and mutant E8.0 mouse neural plate, and it can be enriched at either long or short cell edges. The anisotropic distribution of myosin-II persists in the E8.5 <italic>Pten</italic> mutant, while myosin-II becomes enriched at all cell edges in the E8.5 wild-type neural plate, probably in preparation for the next phase of neural tube closure, actomyosin-mediated apical constriction. Thus the loss of PTEN blocks the maturation of cell packing in the neural plate, but there is no simple relationship between the <italic>Pten</italic> phenotype and the distribution of myosin-II.</p><p>The abnormal planar cell packing and the absence of apical-basal microtubule arrays in the <italic>Pten</italic> neural plate appear to be coupled: they occur simultaneously and both depend on regulated activity of PDPK1. The coupling of these two phenotypes is consistent with known links between apical junctions and microtubule arrays. Apical adherens junctions are sites for anchorage of noncentrosomal microtubule arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Meng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gavilan et al., 2015</xref>). Microtubules dynamics, in turn, can regulate the stability of adherens junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Meng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Waterman-Storer et al., 2000</xref>), supporting the existence of a positive feedback loop that couples stable adherens junctions and microtubule arrays. We propose that a target of PDPK1 in the <italic>Pten</italic> mutant neural plate inhibits stabilization of apical junctions, which, in turn, blocks the formation of the noncentrosomal microtubule arrays required for elongation of cells in the neural plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The direct target of PDPK1 in this process is not known; one possibility is that inappropriate activity of PDPK1 promotes dynamic fluctuations in the activity of aPKC and/or PKN. PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>-tethered PDPK1 is sufficient to activate these two classes of kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Balendran et al., 2000</xref>) and aPKC can regulate both apical junctions and microtubule organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harris and Tepass, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harris and Peifer, 2007</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12034.021</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>A model for the role of PTEN in the formation of the pseudostratified columnar epithelium.</title><p>PDPK1 is anchored to the plasma membrane by PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> (PIP3), which is made by PI3 kinase (PI3K) and degraded by PTEN. In the <italic>Pten</italic> mutant, increased PIP3 recruits high levels of PDPK1 to the membrane, where it is activated. Activated membrane-associated PDPK1 has two targets: activated PDPK1 generates high levels of pAKT; in a separate pathway, high levels of membrane-associated PDPK1 inhibit the formation of stable apical junctions. Stable apical junctions are required for the formation of stable apical-basal microtubule arrays, which mediate apical-to-basal trafficking in the neural epithelium, allowing elongation and tight packing of cells in the neural epithelium. In WT, PDPK1 is not required for formation of the pseudostratified neural epithelium, although the delay in neural tube closure in <italic>Pdpk1</italic> mutants may reflect a subtle role for the protein in epithelial organization.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12034.021">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12034.021</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-12034-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>PTEN has many roles in mammalian brain development, including control of cell size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kwon et al., 2001</xref>), neuronal differentiation and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yue et al., 2005</xref>), synapse structure and synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fraser et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sperow et al., 2012</xref>) and axon regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Park et al., 2008</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, one of whom, Joseph Gleeson, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by the Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this elegant paper the authors use a combination of genetic and pharmacological tools to elucidate the mechanism underlying the failure to form a pseudostratified neuroepithelium in <italic>Pten</italic> conditional mutant mice. They demonstrate that loss of <italic>Pten</italic> and the resulting hyperactivation of PDK1 significantly disrupt this morphogenetic process, causing neural cells to remain cuboid instead of elongated, to lose their apical microtubule arrays and the ability to traffic endocytic vesicles. The linearity of the pathway for this phenotype was verified by rescue of the phenotype by conditional removal of Pdk1, a downstream effector, whereas another <italic>Pten</italic> phenotype (cardia bifida) was not rescued. They further demonstrate that, perhaps surprisingly, this pseudostratified phenotype is not dependent on elevated downstream AKT or mTORC1 activity, suggesting that an unknown mechanism downstream of PDK1 is involved. Elevated PDK1 signaling thus likely causes abnormal cell shape, apical junctions and endocytic vesicle trafficking defects in <italic>Pten</italic>-related neurodevelopmental disorders.</p><p>The paper is well written and well executed, with figures fully supporting the conclusions. One of the major strengths is the phenocopy with the gain of function <italic>Pik3ca</italic> mutation, and the rescue with the <italic>Pdk1</italic> mutant.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors show that PI3K and PDK1 are <italic>not</italic> required for the normal formation of the pseudostratified neuroepithelium. Thus, the diagram proposed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> is a bit misleading, as it suggests that PI3K-PDK1 signaling promotes the formation of stable apical junctions, which the authors then argue are causally linked to the formation of the pseudostratified neuroepithelium. The various phosphoinositides regulate multiple aspects of TOR signaling, endocytic sorting, recycling and trafficking. A more critical discussion of the proposed role of PI3K-PDK1 signaling in normal and abnormal morphogenesis is warranted to explain these findings. While the genetic investigations offer strong support, researchers in the phosphoinositide field might question the link to endosomal trafficking and microtubule post-translational modification.</p><p>2) Even though the study focuses on neural plate defects in <italic>Pten</italic> mutant mice there is little mention of <italic>Pten</italic>- or PI3K-associated neurodevelopmental disorders, and more emphasis is placed on cancer in other organs. It would be appropriate to incorporate in the Discussion recent findings on the role of excessive PI3K signaling in brain overgrowth syndromes and cortical malformations (see for example recent reviews by Jansen et al, Brain 138:1613 2015, and Hevner, Sem Perinatol 39: 36 2015).</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> could be improved. Please provide better-matched images and more detailed timing, if necessary, to show time course in more detail.</p><p>4) There are many other anatomical locations with pseudostratified epithelium, raising the question if <italic>Pten</italic> is required for their formation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12034.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The authors show that PI3K and PDK1 are</italic> not <italic>required for the normal formation of the pseudostratified neuroepithelium.

We have revised both the text and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> to better illustrate that our results show that the <italic>Pten/Pik3ca</italic> phenotype is the result elevated or ectopic activity of PDK1, and do not define the normal role of PDK1 in this process.</p><p>We now refer more directly to the other activities of phosphoinositides that might be relevant for the phenotypes we observe. We point out that the genetic experiments argue that, remarkably enough, it is PDK1 activity that is responsible for the observed phenotypes, rather than mTor activity or other PDK1-independent effects of phosphoinositides. We appreciate that the links to endosomal trafficking and microtubule post-translational modification are novel and will require further study, but the data clearly implicate PDK1 in these processes.</p><p><italic>2) Even though the study focuses on neural plate defects in Pten mutant mice there is little mention of Pten- or PI3K-associated neurodevelopmental disorders, and more emphasis is placed on cancer in other organs.

We have included additional panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> to show the time course of tubulin acetylation in the wild-type and mutant neural plate, and we now describe the acetylation of the microtubules in the floor plate. We have also added new panels to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> to show both the time course of tubulin acetylation and the partial colocalization of PTEN protein with acetylated tubulin at E8.5 and E9.5.</p><p><italic>4) There are many other anatomical locations with pseudostratified epithelium, raising the question if Pten is required for their formation.</italic></p><p>This is an interesting point. The epiblast-specific deletion of <italic>Pten</italic> that we have studied causes developmental arrest at approximately E9.0. We were therefore not able to examine other pseudostratified epithelia; analysis of additional pseudostratified epithelia using other Cre lines is interesting topic for the future.</p></body></sub-article></article>
