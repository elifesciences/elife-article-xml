pathway causes Robinow syndrome, brachydactyly B, and metastatic diseases. The domain(s) and mechanisms required for ROR2 function, however, remain unclear. We solved the crystal structure of the extracellular cysteine-rich (CRD) and Kringle (Kr) domains of ROR2 and found that, unlike other CRDs, the ROR2 CRD lacks the signature hydrophobic pocket that binds lipids/lipid-modified proteins, such as WNTs, suggesting a novel mechanism of ligand reception. Functionally, we showed that the ROR2 CRD, but not other domains, is required and minimally sufficient to promote WNT5A signaling, and Robinow mutations in the CRD and the adjacent Kr impair ROR2 secretion and function. Moreover, using function-activating and -perturbing antibodies against the Frizzled (FZ) family of WNT receptors, we demonstrate the involvement of FZ in WNT5A-ROR signaling. Thus, ROR2 acts via its CRD to potentiate the function of a receptor super-complex that includes FZ to transduce WNT5A signals.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>WNT5A</kwd><kwd>ROR2</kwd><kwd>Frizzled</kwd><kwd>cysteine-rich domain</kwd><kwd>Kringle domain</kwd><kwd>receptor tyrosine kinase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R35GM119574</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ho</surname><given-names>Hsin-Yi Henry</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R35GM144341</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ho</surname><given-names>Hsin-Yi Henry</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C20724/A26752</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Siebold</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/203141</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Siebold</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/099675</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Griffiths</surname><given-names>Samuel C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2P30CA093373-19</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ho</surname><given-names>Hsin-Yi Henry</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DRCRPG-May23/100002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Siebold</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S10 OD018223</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ho</surname><given-names>Hsin-Yi Henry</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

Originally identified as orphan receptors based on sequence homology to other RTKs (hence the name <underline>R</underline>eceptor tyrosine kinase-like <underline>O</underline>rphan <underline>R</underline>eceptor), work over the past two decades has elucidated a critical role of the ROR RTK family in mediating noncanonical WNT5A signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Oishi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mikels and Nusse, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ho et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Green et al., 2008</xref>). Unlike canonical WNTs, which signal through β-catenin-dependent transcription to regulate cell proliferation and tissue fate, WNT5A signals noncanonically through β-catenin-independent mechanisms to induce cytoskeletal rearrangements and tissue morphogenetic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Konopelski et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moon et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Veeman et al., 2003</xref>). The pathway is also of clinical significance, as mutations in WNT5A, the ROR family member ROR2, and the downstream signal transducers Dishevelled 1 (DVL1) and DVL3 have been reported to cause Robinow syndrome (RS), a congenital disorder characterized by systemic tissue shortening defects, including dwarfism, mesomelic limb shortening, brachydactyly, genitourinary defects, cleft palate, and other craniofacial dysmorphisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Person et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afzal et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">van Bokhoven et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bunn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">White et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">White et al., 2016</xref>), and a distinct cohort of ROR2 missense mutations cause brachydactyly type B (BDB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Oldridge et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schwabe et al., 2000</xref>). Moreover, elevated expression of ROR1 or ROR2 correlates with increased cancer metastatic potentials, and several anti-ROR therapies are currently in various stages of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rebagay et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kipps, 2022</xref>). The etiological mechanisms of these mutations, however, remain largely uncharacterized. Thus, a greater understanding of ROR receptor function is important from both basic science and medical perspectives.</p><p>ROR receptors are type-I transmembrane (TM) proteins with a single-pass TM helix linking extracellular and intracellular regions. The extracellular region (ECD) of vertebrate ROR proteins consists of an immunoglobulin (Ig) domain, a Frizzled (FZ)-like cysteine-rich domain (CRD), and a Kringle (Kr) domain. The intracellular region includes a tyrosine kinase domain and a serine/threonine/proline-rich domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Minami et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Green et al., 2008</xref>). The specific requirement of these domains in WNT5A signaling remains controversial. Early genetic studies in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> showed that only the CRD and the TM helix are essential for the function of the nematode ROR homolog Cam-1 in cell migration, which raised the possibility that Cam-1 may not act as a typical RTK and may instead regulate the spatial distribution of WNT ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim and Forrester, 2003</xref>). Experiments in vertebrate systems, however, largely suggest that ROR proteins act as bona fide WNT signaling receptors and that this function requires other domains of ROR proteins, including the intracellular domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DeChiara et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Oishi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mikels and Nusse, 2006</xref>). However, due to the historical lack of tractable assays to directly measure ROR activity, the precise requirement of vertebrate ROR proteins in noncanonical WNT5A signaling has not been systematically examined.</p><p>The CRD is of broader interest because it is not only conserved within the ROR family but also among other important receptor classes where the domain mediates ligand and/or co-factor binding through a signature hydrophobic groove or pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bazan and de Sauvage, 2009</xref>). For instance, the CRD of the classical WNT receptor FZ interacts with the palmitoleate moiety of WNT ligands directly through this groove (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Janda et al., 2012</xref>). Free fatty acids have also been observed to interact in the same fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nile et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, the CRD of the Hedgehog signal transducer and GPCR Smoothened (Smo) binds cholesterol through an analogous hydrophobic pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Byrne et al., 2016</xref>). Because the CRD of ROR2 was previously implicated in WNT5A binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Oishi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mikels and Nusse, 2006</xref>), and shares a high degree of amino acid sequence similarity with the FZ CRD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Xu and Nusse, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Saldanha et al., 1998</xref>), it is assumed that it possesses a similar hydrophobic groove via which it interacts with WNT5A. However, this hypothesis remains untested, as the requirement of the vertebrate ROR2 CRD in WNT5A signaling and its atomic structure have not been determined.</p><p>In this study, we determined the crystal structure of the ROR2 CRD and Kr domains. Remarkably, we found that the two domains share an extended interface and that the ROR2 CRD lacks the characteristic hydrophobic groove/pocket for interacting with lipids. The latter observation suggests that the ROR2 CRD cannot mediate high-affinity interaction with the palmitoleate group of WNT5A. To further probe the requirement of the ROR2 CRD in WNT5A signaling, we developed a functional complementation assay in <italic>Ror1/Ror2</italic> double knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and showed that the ROR2 CRD is required and minimally sufficient to mediate WNT5A-ROR signaling. We implicated the FZ family in the pathway by showing that WNT5A directly interacts with the CRD of multiple FZ proteins, and that synthetic Ig that bind the FZ CRDs can potently activate or inhibit WNT5A-ROR signaling depending on their valency. Lastly, we demonstrated that several Robinow patient mutations in the CRD and Kr domains impair ROR2 secretion and function, presumably by disrupting the proper folding of these domains. Collectively, the study provides structural and functional insights into ROR2 function and supports a model in which ROR2 acts through its CRD to promote FZ-dependent WNT5A signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The structure of the ROR2 CRD and Kr domains</title><p>To determine the structure of the ROR2 CRD, we expressed a range of constructs comprising the full-length human ROR2 ECD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

The CRD comprises 5 α-helices (α1–5) and a single β-sheet (strands β1 and β2), while the Kr domain presents a characteristic lack of secondary structure, displaying a single β-sheet (strands β3 and β4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, left-hand panel). The CRD is stabilized by five disulfide bonds: one located between β1 and a loop extending from helix α2 (I), a second linking α2 and the loop preceding longest helix α1 (II), a third between helix α2 and the loop between helices α3/4 (III), a fourth between long loops following helices α2 and α3 (IV), and the fifth between helix α3 itself and the loop extending from α5 (V). The Kr domain is stabilized by two disulfide bonds (VI and VII) that are found within the core of the Kr domain. A structured linker is observed between both domains, containing one additional free cysteine (C316). This is positioned in proximity to the C-terminus of our expression construct, which contains one additional cysteine residue (C394), unresolved in our ROR2 CRD-Kr crystal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>Overall, the CRD and Kr domains form an associated structural unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, right-hand panel). A contact interface is observed between the two domains and is dominated by van der Waals interactions, with two hydrogen bonds present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The domains share a small interfacial area of 559 Å<sup>2</sup>, with a reasonable shape complementarity score (0.7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lawrence and Colman, 1993</xref>). The structure of Kr in the CRD-Kr tandem domain closely resembles that previously described for the isolated human ROR1 and ROR2 Krs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goydel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guarino et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

Interestingly, while the CRD and Kr domains of Nrk also form an associated structural unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shi et al., 2021</xref>), and the secondary structural elements of these domains are highly conserved between human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>), the spatial arrangement of CRD and Kr in ROR2 is substantially different from that in Nrk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>).

We conducted small-angle X-ray scattering experiments with in-line size exclusion chromatography (SEC-SAXS) experiments using the full-length ROR2 ECD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The CRD-Kr arrangement observed in the crystal structure is conserved in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), while the N-terminal Ig domain is flexible relative to the CRD-Kr domain unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), as predicted from the 15-residue linker between domains. Additionally, SAXS does not suggest that the ROR2 ECD forms a dimer in solution; however, we cannot exclude the possibility that the TM helix and/or the intracellular domain could mediate dimerization. Structurally, the ROR2 CRD is evolutionarily related to other FZ-type ‘groove-containing’ CRDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nachtergaele et al., 2013</xref>), such as MuSK and FZ8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Stiegler et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Janda et al., 2012</xref>), as well as the cholesterol-binding Hedgehog signal transducer Smo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Byrne et al., 2016</xref>).

One general characteristic differentiating this subfamily of CRDs from the ‘pocket-type’ subfamily is that grooves are structurally conserved when ligand free (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>), with minimal structural rearrangement occurring upon ligand binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Janda et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nachtergaele et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Byrne et al., 2016</xref>). Despite structural conservation with other FZ-type receptors, the ROR2 CRD does not contain a visible hydrophobic groove pre-formed for ligand recognition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). A structure-based sequence alignment shows that the ROR2 CRD has evolved an additional helical insertion (α5) relative to the FZ8 CRD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Structural superposition of the ROR2 CRD with the FZ8:WNT-palmitoleate binary complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Janda et al., 2012</xref>) shows that this helical insertion blocks exposure of any possible palmitoleate-binding groove (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F–H</xref>). This observation is therefore incompatible with a direct binding event occurring between the ROR2 CRD and the WNT5A palmitoleate moiety, suggesting that the high affinity ‘site 1’ WNT5A interaction must occur either via a different site on the CRD or through a separate co-receptor(s), or require structural rearrangements as-yet not observed for groove-containing FZ-CRDs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Comparison of the ROR2 cysteine-rich domain (CRD) to other Frizzled (FZ)-type CRDs.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) CRDs are shown as surface representation and colored according to hydrophobicity (green: hydrophobic to white: hydrophilic).

To enable long-term genetic manipulations, we immortalized the MEFs (called iMEFs) via Cas9/CRISPR-mediated ablation of the <italic>Tp53</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dirac and Bernards, 2003</xref>). To allow quantitative measurement of WNT5A-ROR signaling, we further engineered a GFP-Pdzrn3 degradation reporter construct into the iMEFs. We previously reported that activation of WNT5A-ROR signaling induces the proteasomal degradation of the downstream effector protein Pdzrn3, and that this regulation could be quantified using the GFP-Pdzrn3 reporter in live cells via flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Konopelski Snavely et al., 2021</xref>).

Lastly, to compare the activity of wildtype (WT) ROR2 versus its mutant derivatives, we developed a lentivirus-based gene replacement strategy that allowed the stable expression of ROR2 ‘rescue’ constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>). WNT5A dose-response analysis comparing ROR conditional KO (cKO) reporter cells versus ROR KO cells (i.e. cKO cells treated with 4OHT) showed that loss of ROR1 and ROR2 expression substantially decreased WNT5A signaling across all WNT5a doses tested, and that this deficit can be fully rescued by the expression of an exogenous WT ROR2 construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Interestingly, ROR KO reporter cells without any ROR2 rescue still retained some basal WNT5A signaling activity, which remained dose-dependent with respect to WNT5A concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

This experiment, taken together with the truncation analysis, established that the ROR2 CRD is required and minimally sufficient to support the function of ROR2 in WNT5A signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Role of FZ receptors in WNT5A-ROR signaling</title><p>Based on our observations that (1) the ROR2 CRD lacks the hydrophobic groove that binds to the lipid modification of WNT5A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and F</xref>), (2) iMEFs lacking both ROR1 and ROR2 still retain some signaling activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), and (3) ROR2 lacking the intracellular region can still signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), we postulated that ROR2 cannot by itself function as the signaling receptor for WNT5A; instead, it likely facilitates the signaling function of another receptor(s). Members of the FZ family, particularly the FZ1, FZ2, and FZ7 subfamily, are plausible candidates, as numerous previous studies have implicated them in aspects of noncanonical WNT5A signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Oishi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bryja et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sato et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grumolato et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Konopelski Snavely et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, a human mutation in FZ2 was recently identified in RS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">White et al., 2018</xref>).

We expressed and purified these CRDs as secreted Ig Fc domain fusion constructs from HEK293T cells, followed by in vitro pulldown assays using purified recombinant WNT5A. The experiment showed that WNT5A can interact with all three CRDs tested, and that the binding affinity appears to be higher for the FZ2 and FZ7 CRDs than for the ROR2 CRD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

We hypothesized that if FZs participate in WNT5A-ROR2 signaling, then treatment with this antibody should block the ability of WNT5A to induce signaling. Surprisingly, we found that F2.A, in its bivalent IgG form and in the absence of any WNT5A, strongly induced GFP-Pdzrn3 reporter degradation, as well as DVL2 phosphorylation, in ROR cKO iMEFs, ROR KO iMEFs, and WT ROR2 rescued iMEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Altogether, these data support a model in which FZs function as the signaling receptors for WNT5A, and ROR2 acts through its CRD to enhance FZ function, possibly by promoting WNT5A-FZ interactions and/or FZ dimerization (Figure 6; see Discussion).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>RS mutations in the ROR2 CRD and Kr domains compromise ROR2 trafficking to the cell surface</title><p>Of all the ROR2 domains, the CRD and Kr domains are most frequently mutated in RS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tufan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afzal et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tamhankar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mehawej et al., 2012</xref>).

Correspondingly, the two mutants with milder signaling defects (R189W and R272C) showed a partial increase in their gel mobility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). To assess the glycosylation state of the mutant constructs, we conducted endoglycosidase H (Endo H) and peptide-<italic>N</italic>-glycosidase F (PNGase F) sensitivity assays. Complex glycan modifications attached in the Golgi are resistant to Endo H, whereas both pre- and post-Golgi glycan modifications are generally sensitive to PNGase F. This analysis shows that C182Y, R184C, C223Y, G326A, and R366W are fully sensitive to both Endo H and PNGase F, indicating that these mutants fail to traffic to and beyond the Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In contrast, R189W and R272C are partially resistant to Endo H but fully sensitive to PNGase F, indicating that some of these proteins can traffic to and past the Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Lastly, we conducted surface staining experiments using the Flag tag fused to the N-terminus of the mutant constructs and found that C182Y, R184C, C223Y, G326A, and R366W all fail to traffic to the plasma membrane, whereas R189W and R272C are expressed on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Further insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of Robinow mutations were obtained from our structural analysis. C182Y and C223Y disrupt conserved cysteines in the CRD. Since our structure showed that all 10 cysteines in the CRD are involved in disulfide bond formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), these mutations likely cause RS by destabilizing the core structure of the CRD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–F</xref>). Two other mutations in the CRD (R184C and R272C) involve amino acid substitution to cysteines. Since both residues are solvent exposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–F</xref>), they may form cryptic intramolecular disulfide bonds that disrupt the protein fold, or alternatively form intermolecular disulfide bonds that cause inappropriate dimerization or oligomerization that results in protein aggregation. Based on our signaling data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), R184C is likely more prone to these perturbations than R272C. R189W showed the least functional deficit in our assay system. It is possible that even a subtle signaling deficit is sufficient to disrupt embryonic development and cause RS. Alternatively, R189W might be involved in other aspects of ROR2 regulation not readily detected in our assay system.</p><p>Interestingly, the two mutations that map to the Kr domain (G326A and R366W) are among the most detrimental (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Both of these mutations are located near the CRD-Kr interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and G</xref>). G326 is situated near the linker between the CRD and Kr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and G</xref>), and therefore, substitution at this position may open up the space between the two domains and expose hydrophobic residues to promote protein aggregation, which in turn prevents trafficking out of the ER. Likewise, R366W may disrupt the overall fold of Kr, or disrupt the interface between the CRD and Kr to destabilize the CRD-Kr structural unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and G</xref>). Together, these functional and structural analyses provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of Robinow pathogenesis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we used an integrated approach of structural biology, genetics, and pharmacology to better understand the mechanism of WNT5A signal reception at the cell surface. We made several key observations that substantially advance our current understanding of WNT5A receptor function.</p><p>First, by solving the crystal structure of the ROR2 CRD, we made the surprising finding that this domain lacks the characteristic hydrophobic groove that binds the acyl moiety of WNTs and is thus incompatible with high-affinity interaction with WNT ligands. Our binding assay showed that the binding affinity between WNT5A and the ROR2 CRD indeed appears to be weaker than that between WNT5A and FZ CRDs. These experimental data agree with the modeling work by Janda and Garcia, which predicted that the ROR2 CRD might not possess the hydrophobic groove to accommodate the lipid modification of WNTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Janda and Garcia, 2015</xref>). This also agrees with the published crystal structure of MuSK, which is related to ROR2 and also lacks a hydrophobic groove in its CRD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Stiegler et al., 2009</xref>). The occlusion of the lipid/small molecule-binding site in ROR2 is unexpected and of general interest because this site was previously shown to play an important role not only for WNT-FZ binding and FZ dimerization during canonical WNT signaling, but also for Smo function during Hedgehog signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Janda et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Byrne et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nachtergaele et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nile et al., 2017</xref>). As there is clear evidence that the mammalian WNT5A is lipidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mikels and Nusse, 2006</xref>), our data raised the question of which co-receptor(s) in the pathway, if not ROR, is (are) responsible for high-affinity WNT5A binding and signal transduction across the membrane. Though the exact identity of this co-receptor remains to be determined, our work points to the FZ receptor family, as experimental dimerization of FZ proteins using a highly specific bivalent IgG that binds the FZ CRDs is sufficient to mimic WNT5A signaling, whereas monovalent Fab of the same antibody inhibits the ability of WNT5A to initiate signaling. We therefore favor a model in which WNT5A interacts with FZ with high affinity to transduce signals across the plasma membrane, either by itself or in conjunction with another as-yet unidentified protein(s). The ROR2 CRD appears to possess a low-affinity WNT5A binding site, possibly analogous to the low-affinity site ‘2’ observed in the WNT8-FZ8 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Janda et al., 2012</xref>). The ROR2 CRD could possibly potentiate WNT5A signaling by enhancing the binding interaction between WNT5A and FZ via the formation of an FZ:WNT:ROR2 super-complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In this scenario, the WNT5A palmitoleate modification engages the FZ groove as previously described (‘site 1’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Janda et al., 2012</xref>), while ROR2 binds at site 2 to further promote WNT5A recruitment to the receptor complex, and/or recruit intracellular effectors of noncanonical WNT signaling. This model further suggests that the high-affinity WNT5A palmitoleate-FZ interaction acts as an indiscriminate anchor to stabilize the overall receptor super-complex and initiate downstream signaling, and that the low-affinity WNT5A-ROR2 CRD interaction contributes to ligand-receptor specificity for noncanonical WNT5A signaling. Lastly, it is also possible that ROR2 CRD can act by inducing an allosteric change in the structure of FZ to enhance FZ function or promote FZ dimerization that in turn increases FZ’s affinity for WNT5A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carron et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nile et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model of ROR2 cysteine-rich domain (CRD) and Frizzled (FZ) action in WNT5A-ROR signaling.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-71980-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Second, we observed that ROR2 mutants lacking the intracellular domain (∆ICD and mini-ROR2) can still support WNT5A signaling. This is in line with the idea that ROR2 itself is unlikely to be the signal-transmitting receptor for WNT5A, and that the cytoplasmic domain of ROR2 might have evolved to play a regulatory role, such as in receptor stability, signal amplification, and/or termination. This idea is further supported by the observation that some residual signaling activity remains in cells lacking both ROR1 and ROR2 when stimulated with exogenously added WNT5A, and that the structure of the ROR2 kinase domain predicts it to be catalytically inactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Artim et al., 2012</xref>). Collectively, these findings firmly established a co-requirement for both ROR and FZ activities in noncanonical WNT5A signal transduction. This model is also consistent with previous in vivo work showing that <italic>Ror1/Ror2</italic> double knockout mice phenocopy the characteristic tissue truncation phenotypes of <italic>Wnt5a</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nomi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Oishi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ho et al., 2012</xref>), and that human mutations in <italic>WNT5A</italic>, <italic>ROR2,</italic> or <italic>FZ2</italic> can all cause RS with similar developmental abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nagasaki et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">White et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Person et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afzal et al., 2000</xref>). Though several previous co-immunoprecipitation experiments have shown binding interactions between WNT5A and ROR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Oishi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mikels and Nusse, 2006</xref>), between WNT5A and FZ family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sato et al., 2010</xref>), and between FZ and ROR proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Oishi et al., 2003</xref>), the biochemical details of these interactions remain to be characterized. In light of our present work, it is crucial to further define these interactions quantitatively in future studies and to understand their functions in the context of a co-receptor super-complex. Nonetheless, our results showing that ROR2 acts through its CRD to sensitize the function of FZs or an FZ-containing receptor complex during WNT5A-ROR signaling form the foundation for future studies.</p><p>Lastly, our work provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of Robinow pathogenesis. Using the gene rescue strategy in iMEFs, we were able to directly assay the function of RS mutant variants under highly physiological conditions. We found that nearly all of the mutants tested exhibited defects in their trafficking to the cell surface and hence WNT5A signaling, and that mutating the cysteines required for disulfide bonds in the CRD was not tolerated. Furthermore, by combining these functional data with our structural analysis, we can classify the mutations based on their locations on the CRD-Kr structure and infer potential underlying mechanisms of structural and signaling perturbation. We envision that the experimental approach described in this study will serve as an important model for interrogating other mutations in the pathway that cause RS, BDB, and cancer metastasis, and more generally, as a paradigm for modeling genetic disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>Constructs of human ROR2 (GenBank ID: 19743898) comprising the ECD (residues 34–403), Ig-CRD (60–307), CRD-Kr (171–396), and CRD (171–307) were cloned into the pHLsec vector in frame with a C-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aricescu et al., 2006</xref>).

The anti-WNT5A antibody shows some cross-reactivity to ROR2 CRD, which explains the higher molecular weight (~65 kD) band seen in the uncropped blot of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources, Validation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources, Validation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing, Resources</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Olga Boudker as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Karl Willert (Reviewer #2); Neil McDonald (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>1. The ROR2 domain deletion analysis in Figure 3 is a critical feature of the paper. The claim that these constructs are expressed at comparable levels is not apparent from the western blot (which is quite dirty). More importantly, the authors need to show cell surface levels (e.g. by flow cytometry) to verify that these mutants are present at comparable surface levels; otherwise interpreting the reporter assay is not feasible. Likewise, the mutants shown in Figure 4A migrate differently than WT, which suggests that the non-signaling mutants are not fully processed.</p><p>2. A key conclusion is that WNT5A signaling requires only a membrane tethered CRD from ROR2 and Fzd. However, it is unclear why expression of ∆FZ-CRD and ∆Fz-CRD-Kr would lower basal signaling activities. The authors propose that basal signaling levels in ROR DKO cells are due to WNT5A's ability to signal solely through FZD. The finding that non-functional ROR2 proteins lower this signal suggest dominant negative activity of these proteins on WNT5A-FZD signaling. These observations need to be highlighted and addressed, for example, using targeted deletion or knockdown of the most highly expressed FZD gene in these cells.</p><p>3. The finding that the FZD-blocking antibody abrogates all WNT5A signaling activity is impressive. However, given the importance of this result to the final conclusion that WNT5A signals through a ROR/FZD receptor complex, there needs to be further validation. For example, does knockdown or knockout of FZD produce the same effect? Targeted deletion or knockdown of the most highly expressed FZD gene in these cells should produce some measurable effect and at least partially lower signaling levels.</p><p>It may also be useful to assess whether the pan-specific FZD antibody blocks WNT5A signaling in wildtype cells, i.e. cells that express endogenous ROR1 and 2? Results in Figure 3F predict the answer to be yes, but this is a rescue experiment where exogenous ROR2 expression levels may exceed endogenous expression levels and produce artifactual levels of signaling activity. To extend this question, what level of reporter activity is observed in iMEF+GFP-Pdzrn3 reporter cells prior to 4OHT treatment? These data could be added as a third line in Figure 3B.</p><p>4. The authors propose that the ROR2 CRD might work by binding Wnt5A and/or an interaction with the Fzd5 CRD. These may be very weak but at least a qualitative assay (e.g. pulldown and western blot) using the recombinant CRD-Kr with tagged Wnt5A and/or the Fzd5 CRD should be feasible, even if a rigorous binding assay is not.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Structure and function of the ROR2 cysteine-rich domain in vertebrate noncanonical WNT5A signaling&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Olga Boudker (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I am seeing this manuscript for the first time, now in its revised form and with the first round reviews and the authors' response to those reviews in hand. My first reaction is that the authors should count themselves lucky that the reviewers did a careful job and asked a series of critical and probing questions. My second reaction is that the authors have candidly described their experimental challenges (including mis-interpreting some of the original data) and have done an enormous amount of work to improve the manuscript – for example, redoing a large number of assays with epitope tagged proteins and more rigorously analyzing the Robinow mutant ROR proteins.</p><p>There are many interesting and important observations in this manuscript. The crystal structure reveals significant differences between mammalian ROR2 and the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Nrk CRD structures – most obviously, absence of a bound lipid in the ROR2 CRD and the absence of a groove that could accommodate a lipid. This observation and the weakness of the observed Wnt-ROR2 binding imply that ROR2 is not likely to be a high affinity Wnt receptor. The structure/function analysis in ROR1/ROR2 double KO cells looks to be technically sound (following improvements based on reviewer comments). Interestingly a minimized version of ROR2, missing almost all of the intracellular domain, appears to be approximately as active as full-length ROR2. The ability of dimerizing anti-FZD antibodies to activate non-canonical signaling in a ROR-dependent manner and the ability of the corresponding Fab to inhibit non-canonical signaling is fascinating. Together with the observation that ROR's ICD is largely or completely dispensable, this suggests that ROR's extracellular domains influence signaling via FZD. Finally, the Robinow point mutations tested, most of which involve loss or gain of a cysteine, mostly affect folding/stability as is the case for many point mutations in human disease.</p><p>This work will likely provide the impetus for much future studies of noncanonical Wnt signaling. I think the manuscript is ready for publication.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #5 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this extensively revised manuscript, the authors have thoroughly addressed the previous critiques and provided some very interesting new data that challenge the current paradigm on the action of Ror receptor in non-canonical Wnt5a signaling. First part of the manuscript validated the finding from recently published studies on fly Ror ortholog, showing that the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of mammalian Ror2 similarly cannot accommodate binding to the palmitoleic chain of Wnt protein based on protein crystallography. The more significant findings in this manuscript, however, are that (1) surface presentation of the CRD appears to be necessary and sufficient for the signaling activity of Ror2 whereas all other domains, including the entire cytoplasmic tail, are dispensable; and (2) bivalent antibodies against Fz-CRD can mimic Wnt5a to activate downstream target, seemingly in an Ror-independent fashion. These findings are thought-provoking on how Wnt5a/Ror signaling occurs. If I interpreted correctly, they would imply that (1) the key function of Wnt5a is to induce Fz dimerization or oligomerization, in direct contrast to canonical Wnt ligand that signals by bridging Fz with the co-receptor Lrp5/6; (2) Ror is unlikely to function as a signal transducer itself; (3) the ROR2 mutations associated with brachydactyly type B (BDB1), which act in an autosomal dominant fashion and often truncate the entire cytoplasmic tail like the ΔICD mutant in the current manuscript (in Figure 4D-F; Human Molecular Genetics, Vol. 18, p4013-4021), are likely active or even hyperactive for non-canonical Wnt signaling. Although the manuscript did not provide a very conclusive model on how Ror and its CRD function, it did provide valuable contribution to the field with compelling evidence that challenge the current assumptions on the action of various domains of Ror2.</p><p>Suggestions to author:</p><p>1) It may be helpful to show the density map, difference map and built model around the lipid binding groove as a supplementary figure. It will strengthen the argument that &quot;no bound lipid, nor an internal space that could potentially accommodate it, was observed in our human ROR2 CRD structure&quot;.</p><p>2) It will help to finalize the model by adding water molecules to the PDB file. Plenty of positive densities appear in the difference map.</p><p>3) Figure 3C: ideally, the concentration of Wnt5a should be expressed as nM instead of ng/ ml so that its signaling activity can be easily compared to those of F2A and F1C in Figure 4. In Figure 3C, the EC50 of WNT5A in wild-type cells (ROR cKO) is ~200ng/ ml, which would be ~2 nM and substantially higher than that of F2A and F1C (0.3 and 7 nM, respectively). If this is true, then the result would imply that the signaling activity of Wnt5a is significantly weaker than that of F2A and F1C.</p><p>4) Figure 3F and 4B. The dosage of Wnt5a, F2A and F1C IgG used for these assays should be indicated.</p><p>5) In Figure 4A (uncropped blot with labels), there is an extra band (~65 kDa) in the Wnt5a pulldown by ROR2 CRD lane, which is not present in all other conditions. What could be the reason for this?</p><p>6) The conclusions of the entire manuscript is based on using only GFP-Pdzrn3 as the readout of Wnt5a signaling activation. Some of the key conclusions, such as the domain requirement for Ror2 function (Figure 3F, I) and Ror2 independent signaling activity of F2A and F1C (Figure 4B), could be strengthened further if a second assay (such as endogenous Dvl2 phosphorylation in the author's previous publication (PNAS vol. 109 (11)) was used to confirm the findings with GFP-Pdzrn3.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71980.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>1.

Regarding the western blots, we have further optimized the experimental conditions, including testing different ROR2 antibody preparations, and acquiring a new departmental Li-Cor infrared scanner to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The endogenous ROR2 protein is expressed at a low level. Despite our best efforts to reduce the expression levels of the ROR2 WT and mutant rescue constructs to approximate that of the endogenous ROR2, going as far as truncating an intron from the EF1 promoter in the lentiviral vector used to drive the transgene, and titrating down the virus titers (see Materials and methods for details), the transgene expression levels are still somewhat higher than the endogenous ROR2. However, we feel it is most important that the expression levels of the mutant proteins are similar to that of the WT ROR2 rescue construct, since interpretation of the mutant signaling data are all based on direct comparison to the WT ROR2 rescue construct, not to the endogenous ROR2. For clarity, we have modified the relevant sentence in the manuscript to “Immunoblotting confirmed that the mutant proteins were expressed at levels comparable to the WT ROR2 rescue construct” (page 10, lines 224 – 225).</p><p>Regarding the need to show cell surface levels of the rescue constructs, we agree with the reviewer that this is critical for interpreting the signaling reporter assay. In the original manuscript, all the rescue cell lines were made using untagged ROR2 constructs. However, none of the currently available anti-ROR2 antibodies are suitable for cell surface staining/flow cytometry of untagged ROR2, making it impossible to perform surface staining of the original cell lines. We therefore re-made all the rescue cell lines in the revised manuscript by introducing rescue constructs that were N-terminally (extracellularly) tagged with the Flag epitope (i.e. all of the WT ROR2, domain truncation mutants, mini-ROR2 and Robinow syndrome mutants shown in Figure 3, 4 and 5 of the revised manuscript). We also repeated all the western blots and signaling assays using these new cell lines (Figure 3B, 3C, 3E, 3F, 3H, 3I, 4B, 4E, 4F, 5A, 5B, 5C of the revised manuscript). Importantly, by conducting anti-Flag cell surface staining of live cells and flow cytometry, we confirmed that all the truncation and mini-ROR2 mutants shown in Figure 3 are expressed on the cell surface (Figure 3 Supplement of the revised manuscript).</p><p>To address the question of the Robinow mutants migrating differently than WT in SDS-PAGE, we have performed Endo H and PNGase F sensitivity assays and demonstrated that five of the seven mutants are indeed not fully processed (Figure 5C of the revised manuscript). Anti-Flag cell surface staining/flow analysis further showed that these mutants are unable to traffic to the cell surface (Figure 5 Supplement of the revised manuscript). These new findings are very interesting and indicate that the majority of Robinow mutations in CRD and Kr impair secretion, likely caused by protein misfolding. We have included new discussions on how each of these mutations might affect protein conformation based on our structural data (page 14-15, lines 314-335).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

In the original experiment, we showed that in the presence of the anti-pan FZ CRD antibody (F2.A), WNT5A could no longer cause degradation the GFP-Pdzrn3 reporter, and we concluded that the antibody inhibited the pathway. However, upon re-examination of the raw flow cytometry data, we found that the antibody itself actually activates the pathway, as it lowers the GFP-Pdzrn3 reporter signal even before addition of WNT5A. This explains why we observed that addition of WNT5A on the F2.A pre-treated cells caused no further degradation of the reporter. This also explains why when we calculated the “percent change” in the reporter signal induced by WNT5A, we found that WNT5A caused zero “percent change” when cells were pre-treated with the antibody, whereas in mock (PBS) pre-treated cells, WNT5A caused a strong “percentage change” in reporter activity. In other words, in F2.A pre-treated cells, WNT5A no longer caused reporter degradation, because the reporter is already degraded by the F2.A antibody, not because the antibody blocks WNT5A-induced signaling, as we originally interpreted. We sincerely apologize for the confusion caused by this oversight.</p><p>To further corroborate the finding that the FZ antibody can activate signaling, we tested another recombinant antibody (F1.C) that is mono-specific to the FZ1 CRD. We found that F1.C also potently activates the pathway (Figure 4B of the revised manuscript). We performed detailed dose-response analyses for both antibodies and observed that at post-saturating concentrations, both antibodies exhibited reduced efficiency, suggesting that the antibodies likely activate the pathway by dimerizing FZ (Figure 4C and Figure 4D of the revised manuscript). To further explore this idea and probe the functional requirement of FZ in WNT5A-induced signaling, we tested the monomeric Fab fragment of F2.A, which should compete with WNT5A for FZD CRD binding, but not dimerize FZ. Consistent with this prediction, we found that the F2.A Fab fragment no longer activates signaling on its own (Figure 4E of the revised manuscript) but instead acts as an antagonist to inhibit the ability of WNT5A to activate signaling (Figure 4F of the revised manuscript). We believe these analyses using the anti-FZ antibodies strongly support a direct role of FZ in WNT5A signaling (the same conclusion that we had in the original submission).</p><p>Regarding genetic deletion of FZ genes in the reporter cells, we agree that this is a direction of great interest.</p><p>However, the experiment is exceedingly challenging for a number of reasons. First, the mouse genome contains 10 FZ genes, and according to publicly available data, at least seven are highly expressed at the developmental stage (E12.5) that our iMEFs were derived from (https://www.tcd.ie/Zoology/research/groups/murphy/WntPathway/fzd.php). We have conducted our own expression analysis by RT-qPCR and found that all six of the FZ isoforms targeted by the F2.A antibody (FZ1, 2, 4, 5, 7 and 8) are expressed in our iMEF reporter cells (Rebuttal Figure 1 below). Specifically, FZ1, 2 and 7 are expressed at levels higher than ROR2, and FZ4 and 8 are expressed at levels similar to ROR1. Therefore, it would be necessary to knock down or knock out most, if not all, of these FZs, which would be a major undertaking. Second, our iMEFs are nonclonal and heterogenous in nature, which complicates genetic analyses. CRISPR/Cas9based gene editing would be the best method to conduct FZ loss-of-function study. However, this would require that our reporter cells were clonal, so we could sequence confirm any candidate FZ KO lines and compare their signaling activity to that of the parent clone. We have another ongoing project in the lab that involves knocking out multiple members of another gene family in iMEFs, and in that project the generation and characterization of the compound KO cells alone took nearly two years. Therefore, we feel that a rigorous genetic analysis of the FZ family deserves the full attention of a follow-up project and is beyond the scope of the current study.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>RT-qPCR analysis to quantify expression levels of the six FZ isoforms that are targeted by the F2.A antibody.</title><p>WT iMEF RNA was used for the analysis.

The authors propose that the ROR2 CRD might work by binding Wnt5A and/or an interaction with the Fzd5 CRD. These may be very weak but at least a qualitative assay (e.g. pulldown and western blot) using the recombinant CRD-Kr with tagged Wnt5A and/or the Fzd5 CRD should be feasible, even if a rigorous binding assay is not.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included in the revised manuscript a new pulldown experiment to directly compare the binding affinities of WNT5A to the CRDs of ROR2, FZ2 and FZ7. We detected robust binding of WNT5A to FZ2 and FZ7 CRDs. Importantly, we also observed that despite lacking the palmitoleate binding site (as seen in our crystal structure), the ROR2 CRD can still bind weakly to WNT5A (Figure 4A of the revised manuscript). This is a very interesting finding. We proposed in the original manuscript that the ROR2 CRD could possibly interact with WNT5A thorough a weak binding site analogous to the “Site 2” observed in the WNT8-FZ8 structure (PDB ID 4F08, PMID: 22653731). Our new WNT5A binding data support this model and further suggest that one molecule of WNT5A could potentially interact with both the ROR2-CRD and FZ-CRD, thereby bringing the two receptors into close proximity (Figure 6 of the revised manuscript).</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Reviewer #5 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In this extensively revised manuscript, the authors have thoroughly addressed the previous critiques and provided some very interesting new data that challenge the current paradigm on the action of Ror receptor in non-canonical Wnt5a signaling. First part of the manuscript validated the finding from recently published studies on fly Ror ortholog, showing that the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of mammalian Ror2 similarly cannot accommodate binding to the palmitoleic chain of Wnt protein based on protein crystallography. The more significant findings in this manuscript, however, are that (1) surface presentation of the CRD appears to be necessary and sufficient for the signaling activity of Ror2 whereas all other domains, including the entire cytoplasmic tail, are dispensable; and (2) bivalent antibodies against Fz-CRD can mimic Wnt5a to activate downstream target, seemingly in an Ror-independent fashion. These findings are thought-provoking on how Wnt5a/Ror signaling occurs. If I interpreted correctly, they would imply that (1) the key function of Wnt5a is to induce Fz dimerization or oligomerization, in direct contrast to canonical Wnt ligand that signals by bridging Fz with the co-receptor Lrp5/6; (2) Ror is unlikely to function as a signal transducer itself; (3) the ROR2 mutations associated with brachydactyly type B (BDB1), which act in an autosomal dominant fashion and often truncate the entire cytoplasmic tail like the ΔICD mutant in the current manuscript (in Figure 4D-F; Human Molecular Genetics, Vol. 18, p4013-4021), are likely active or even hyperactive for non-canonical Wnt signaling. Although the manuscript did not provide a very conclusive model on how Ror and its CRD function, it did provide valuable contribution to the field with compelling evidence that challenge the current assumptions on the action of various domains of Ror2.</p><p>Suggestions to author:</p><p>1) It may be helpful to show the density map, difference map and built model around the lipid binding groove as a supplementary figure.

The final structure refined using PHENIX and corresponding σ-A weighted 2Fo-map (+1σ, blue) and Fo-Fc map (+/- 3.5σ, green/red) calculated at 2.48 Å resolution clearly reveal that the palmitoleate binding pocket on the ROR2 CRD is occluded by a ROR2 loop stretching from M212-T219.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It will help to finalize the model by adding water molecules to the PDB file.

In Figure 3C, the EC50 of WNT5A in wild-type cells (ROR cKO) is ~200ng/ ml, which would be ~2 nM and substantially higher than that of F2A and F1C (0.3 and 7 nM, respectively).

It is correct that the EC<sub>50</sub> of WNT5A appears to be much lower than that of F2.A and F1.C. We believe this is because WNT proteins are notoriously difficult to produce recombinantly, and therefore the specific activity of the WNT5A that we purchased from R&amp;D is likely lower than that of the native protein.
