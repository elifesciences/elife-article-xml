major biological events, including transcriptional control. In the yeast, IPMK and its IP products promote the activity of the chromatin remodeling complex SWI/SNF, which plays a critical role in gene expression by regulating chromatin accessibility. However, the direct link between IPMK and chromatin remodelers remains unclear, raising the question of how IPMK contributes to transcriptional regulation in mammals. By employing unbiased screening approaches and in vivo/in vitro immunoprecipitation, here we demonstrate that mammalian IPMK physically interacts with the SWI/SNF complex by directly binding to SMARCB1, BRG1, and SMARCC1. Furthermore, we identified the specific domains required for IPMK-SMARCB1 binding. Notably, using CUT&amp;RUN and ATAC-seq assays, we discovered that IPMK co-localizes with BRG1 and regulates BRG1 localization as well as BRG1-mediated chromatin accessibility in a genome-wide manner in mouse embryonic stem cells. Together, these findings show that IPMK regulates the promoter targeting of the SWI/SNF complex, thereby contributing to SWI/SNF-meditated chromatin accessibility, transcription, and differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>IPMK</kwd><kwd>BRG1</kwd><kwd>SMARCB1</kwd><kwd>SWI/SNF complex</kwd><kwd>chromatin accessibility</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2020R1A2C3005765</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Seyun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2018R1A5A1024261</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Seyun</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Daeyoup</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Inositol polyphosphate multikinase physically binds to the core subunits of SWI/SNF complex and plays an important role in regulating BRG1 occupancy and BRG-mediated chromatin accessibility in mouse embryonic stem cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Inositol polyphosphates (IPs) are a class of signaling messengers that mediate diverse biological events, such as cellular growth, proliferation, and metabolic homeostasis. Inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK) is an essential enzyme for the synthesis of IPs, including inositol tetrakisphosphates [IP<sub>4</sub>, both Ins(1,3,4,5)P<sub>4</sub> and Ins(1,4,5,6)P<sub>4</sub>] and pentakisphosphates [IP<sub>5</sub>, Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P<sub>5</sub>] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chakraborty et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hatch and York, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Saiardi et al., 1999</xref>). In addition to its role as a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase [thereby producing phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP<sub>3</sub>)], IPMK also non-catalytically controls the activity of various signaling factors, including mTOR, AMPK, and TRAF6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maag et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Resnick et al., 2005</xref>). These findings suggest that IPMK plays a critical role in coordinating major biological events.</p><p>Increasing evidence strongly indicates that nuclear IPMK acts as a key factor in the regulation of gene expression. The gene encoding IPMK was originally cloned from yeast as a gene required for the regulation of arginine metabolism and named <italic>Arg82</italic> (yeast <italic>Ipmk</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bechet et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dubois et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Odom et al., 2000</xref>). The physical interaction between Arg82 and yeast transcription factor MCM1, a yeast homolog of mammalian SRF, is crucial for transcriptional control in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bercy et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Christ and Tye, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Messenguy and Dubois, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Odom et al., 2000</xref>). In mammals, IPMK-SRF binding is a critical event for the SRF-dependent induction of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). Other functions of nuclear IPMK are mediated by its diverse interactions with, for example, p53, steroidogenic factor 1, and CBP/p300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blind, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blind et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Malabanan and Blind, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xu et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xu et al., 2013c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu and Snyder, 2013b</xref>).</p><p>Chromatin remodeling is essential for efficient transcription of eukaryotic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kouzarides, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Trotter and Archer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vignali et al., 2000</xref>). In particular, SWI/SNF is a large family of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes characterized as transcriptional regulators. These complexes enable the transcription machinery or other transcription factors to access target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnaud et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hargreaves and Crabtree, 2011</xref>). In mammalian cells, the canonical SWI/SNF complex contains one of the two mutually exclusive ATPases, BRM (SMARCA2) or BRG1 (SMARCA4), in addition to a core set of subunits consisting of BAF155 (BRG1-associated factor or SMARCC1), SMARCB1 (hSNF5 or INI1), and BAF170 (SMARCC2), as well as four to eight accessory subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Khavari et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 1996a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 1996b</xref>). Importantly, the SWI/SNF complex mediates modifications on the nucleosome structure and regulates nucleosome positioning in an ATP-dependent manner, thereby modulating the accessibility of regulatory proteins. Therefore, this chromatin remodeling complex is critical for various biological processes, including gene transcription, cell-cycle regulation, and cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ho et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ho et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hodges et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim and Roberts, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tolstorukov et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Despite the importance of both IP function and chromatin remodeling in transcriptional regulation, only a few studies have addressed the link between IPs and chromatin remodeling. A previous study in yeast demonstrated that IPs can regulate the nucleosome-sliding activity of chromatin remodeling complexes in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shen et al., 2003</xref>). Specifically, IP<sub>4</sub> and IP<sub>5</sub> stimulate the activity of the SWI/SNF complex, whereas inositol hexakisphosphate (IP<sub>6</sub>) inhibits the activity of the NURF, ISW2, and INO80 complexes. Another study in yeast illustrated that mutation in the yeast IPMK homolog Arg82 impairs IP<sub>4</sub> and IP<sub>5</sub> production and causes inefficient recruitment of the SWI/SNF complex and impaired chromatin remodeling at the promoter of the phosphate-responsive gene <italic>PHO5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Steger et al., 2003</xref>). In mammals, inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 1 (IP6K1) directly interacts with histone demethylase JMJD2C. IP6K1 and its product 5-IP<sub>7</sub> appear to mediate the expression of JMJDC2 target genes in mammalian cells by regulating the chromatin association of JMJDC2 and the levels of trimethyl-histone H3 lysine 9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burton et al., 2013</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that IPs and relevant enzymes play important roles in chromatin remodeling and transcription. However, a direct link between IPMK (which produces IPs) and the chromatin remodeling complex SWI/SNF has not been reported, and whether IPMK contributes to transcriptional regulation in mammals is unclear.</p><p>To address these points, we performed unbiased screening assays and elucidated that the core subunits of the SWI/SNF complex, including SMARCB1 and BRG1, physically interact with IPMK. The physical association between IPMK and the SWI/SNF complex was confirmed via in vitro and in vivo immunoprecipitation assays. The specific binding sites between IPMK and SMARCB1 were also mapped in detail. To investigate the biological role of the interaction between IPMK and the SWI/SNF complex, we performed next-generation sequencing. We also examined the co-localization of IPMK and BRG1, finding that they co-localize at the chromatin, especially at the promoter-transcriptional start site (TSS) and enhancers. Surprisingly, IPMK depletion significantly reduces the genomic occupancy of BRG1 and BRG1-mediated chromatin accessibility, especially at bivalent promoters. IPMK depletion also affects gene transcription, with reduced BRG1 occupancy and chromatin accessibility at the promoter-TSS. Finally, we demonstrate that IPMK depletion significantly impacts endodermal gene expression during differentiation. Taken together, our findings indicate direct linkage between IPMK and the SWI/SNF complex via physical interactions, as well as a crucial role of IPMK in regulating the genomic occupancy of BRG1 and BRG1-associated chromatin accessibility, transcription, and stem cell differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of IPMK-binding/interacting proteins</title><p>To identify IPMK targets, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening with IPMK as the bait and a human brain cDNA library as the prey.

The proteins in the vicinity of the IPMK-APEX2 fusion protein or those of APEX2 alone were biotinylated, enriched using streptavidin beads, and identified via mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

We also detected core histones (histones H2B, H3.1, and H4) as IPMK interactors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), supporting that IPMK interacts with the SWI/SNF complex, which binds to nucleosomes in vivo.

We detected a direct association between endogenous IPMK and SMARCB1 in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>) and in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>). Consistent with our in vitro binding assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>), SMARCB1, BRG1, and BAF155 co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous IPMK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and overexpressed FLAG-IPMK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) in mESC extracts. Intriguingly, we detected SMARCB1, BRG1, and BAF170 in the IPMK immunoprecipitates from MEF extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). To determine the specificity of the physical interaction between IPMK and SMARCB1, <italic>Ipmk</italic> and <italic>Smarcb1</italic> were knocked down (<italic>Ipmk</italic>KD and <italic>Smarcb1</italic>KD, respectively) in mESCs and MEFs. We confirmed the successful knockdown by quantifying the proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D, E</xref>). We observed that <italic>Ipmk</italic>KD did not affect the protein levels of the SWI/SNF complex subunits and <italic>Smarcb1</italic>KD did not affect the IPMK protein levels in mESCs or MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Importantly, a significant reduction in SMARCB1 signals was observed in the IPMK immunoprecipitate from <italic>Ipmk</italic>KD mESCs compared to control (<italic>Egfp</italic>KD) mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). We also found that the SMARCB1 and BRG1 signals in IPMK immunoprecipitate from <italic>Smarcb</italic>KD MEFs were significantly decreased compared to signals in the control (<italic>Egfp</italic>KD) MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Furthermore, in SMARCB1 immunoprecipitate, we detected a significant reduction in IPMK signals in IPMK-null MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that IPMK directly associates with the core subunits of the SWI/SNF complex in vivo: IPMK-SMARCB1/BRG1/BAF155 in mESCs, IPMK-SMARCB1/BRG1/BAF170 in MEFs, and IPMK-SMARCB1 binding is specific and observed in both mESCs and MEFs.</p><p>Considering the above results, it is highly plausible that IPMK physically interacts with the SWI/SNF complex. To confirm this, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation assay by co-expressing IPMK and SMARCB1 in HEK293T cells. Consistent with the above results, we observed a physical interaction between IPMK and SMARCB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Next, we performed GST pull-down assays by overexpressing GST-IPMK or GST alone (negative control) in HEK293T cells. Notably, the core subunits of the SWI/SNF (BAF)/PBAF complexes, namely SMARCB1, BAF155, BAF170, PBRM1, BAF250A, and BRM, were pulled down alongside GST-IPMK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>), which was not seen in the negative control. Lastly, we purified endogenous SWI/SNF (BAF) complexes from cells expressing FLAG-DPF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H</xref>). We co-incubated the purified SWI/SNF complexes with purified GST-IPMK or GST alone and performed GST pull-down assays. As expected, we detected the core subunits of the SWI/SNF complex (SMARCB1, BRG1, BAF155, and BAF170) in GST-IPMK pull-downs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1I</xref>). Collectively, our results strongly imply that IPMK physically interacts with the mammalian SWI/SNF complex by directly binding to SMARCB1, BRG1, and BAF155 (SMARCC1).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Mapping the binding sites between IPMK and SMARCB1</title><p>Among the three IPMK-binding proteins (SMARCB1, BRG1, and BAF155), SMARCB1 exhibited the most robust interaction with IPMK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Therefore, we conducted yeast two-hybrid assays to identify the domains of SMARCB1 that are required for the interaction with IPMK. We constructed various prey vectors encoding different SMARCB1 domains for the two-hybrid analyses. Interestingly, the prey vectors expressing amino acids 99–245, 99–319, and full-length SMARCB1 resulted in positive signals in the two-hybrid system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), indicating that the Rpt1 and Rpt2 domains of SMARCB1 participate in the protein-protein interactions between SMARCB1 and IPMK.</p><p>To further dissect the reciprocal binding sites required for SMARCB1-IPMK binding, various SMARCB1 deletion constructs were designed and overexpressed in HEK293T cells. First, based on the domain map of SMARCB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, top), we deleted the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, middle). We confirmed that the Rpt1 domain of SMARCB1 is essential for the IPMK interaction by immunoprecipitating the overexpressed deletion constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, compare lane 3 with lanes 2, 4, and 5). Next, we generated additional N-terminal deleted SMARCB1 constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, bottom). Consistent with the results of the yeast two-hybrid assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), we observed that the constructs containing the Rpt1 or Rpt2 domains interact with IPMK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, lanes 2, 3, 4, and 5 show positive signals). By independently overexpressing each SMARCB1 domain, we found that both the Rpt1 and Rpt2 domains of SMARCB1 could bind to IPMK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>, see lanes 3, 4, and 6). We also dissected Rpt1 and Rpt2 domains into β-sheets and α-helices based on their structures. In Rpt1, two β-sheets and two α-helices are required for IPMK binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>, compare lane 4 with lanes 2 and 3). In Rpt2, only two β-sheets and no α-helices were bound to IPMK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>, compare lane 2 with lane 3). These observations both sheets and helices of Rpt1 and/or only sheets of Rpt2 are required for IPMK binding were supported by overexpressing combinations of Rpt1 and Rpt2 domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>, lanes 3 and 4 show positive signals). This was further confirmed by the SMARCB1 lacking Rpt1 and Rpt2 not being able to bind IPMK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>, compare lane 2 with lane 3, and F). Thus, we concluded that the sheets/helices of Rpt1 and sheets of Rpt2 are the major IPMK-interacting sites in SMARCB1.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Identification of the distinct domains required for IPMK-SMARCB1 interactions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram showing the human SMARCB1 fragments used for the binding studies (<bold>B and C</bold>).

Accordingly, we speculate that IPMK plays an important role in chromatin regulation. However, the cellular region where this IPMK-SWI/SNF interaction occurs in vivo and the detailed localization and role of IPMK in the chromatin remains elusive. Therefore, we conducted a chromatin fractionation assay using mESCs and MEFs. IPMK was evenly distributed in all the three subcellular fractions (cytoplasm, nucleoplasm, and chromatin), whereas SMARCB1 and BRG1 were primarily found in the chromatin fraction for both mESCs and MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-D</xref>). To further investigate whether the expression of IPMK and SMARCB1 affects the distribution of the other, we conducted RNAi-mediated <italic>Ipmk</italic>KD and <italic>Smarcb1</italic>KD before the chromatin fractionation assay.

In accordance with our results showing the physical association of IPMK and the SWI/SNF complex, we found that IPMK co-localizes with BRG1 on the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Next, we performed peak annotation to analyze the genomic regions (e.g. promoters or intergenic regions) enriched with CUT&amp;RUN peaks. Given that BRG1, a catalytic subunit of the SWI/SNF complex, is known to localize at the promoter-TSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Dieuleveult et al., 2016</xref>), we confirmed that BRG1 is significantly enriched at promoters in the mouse genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>). Notably, IPMK was also significantly enriched at promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>). As the above peak annotation analysis did not specify the enhancers, which show a strong BRG1 enrichment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Dieuleveult et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Laurette et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nakayama et al., 2017</xref>), we employed the previously determined enhancer lists from mESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Whyte et al., 2013</xref>) and aligned them with BRG1 peaks. Consistent with previous findings, highly enriched BRG1 chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) peaks from the previous study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>) and highly enriched BRG1 CUT&amp;RUN peaks from our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>) mostly localized at enhancers (upper part of the heatmap). Furthermore, both BRG1 peaks (ChIP-seq peaks from the previous study and our CUT&amp;RUN peaks) showed similar enrichment patterns in promoters and enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>), validating our CUT&amp;RUN experiments.

To confirm this reduction in BRG1, we established constitutive IPMK-depleted mESCs by shRNA-mediated <italic>Ipmk</italic> silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>) and performed BRG1 CUT&amp;RUN assays upon IPMK depletion (sh<italic>Ipmk1</italic> and sh<italic>Ipmk2</italic>), comparing them to shNT (a non-target control).

Although some differences exist (number of BRG1 peaks and their positions) between BRG1 CUT&amp;RUN of siRNA- and shRNA-mediated <italic>Ipmk</italic> silencing, we confirmed the reduced BRG1 intensity upon IPMK depletion at the Low BRG1 CUT&amp;RUN merged peaks (merged peaks derived by merging BRG1 CUT&amp;RUN peaks of <italic>Egfp</italic>KD and shNT mESCs) in both siRNA and shRNA experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D and E</xref>).

In addition, the genomic distribution of BRG1 CUT&amp;RUN peaks was unaffected by <italic>Ipmk</italic>KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>), suggesting that IPMK depletion does not affect the global distribution (changes in peak positions) of BRG1, but impacts the global occupancy of BRG1, especially at the low-enriched BRG1 peaks (Low), which do not correlate with enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and D</xref>).</p><p>To address whether the enzymatic activity of IPMK is required for regulation of BRG1 occupancy, we performed rescue experiments by transfecting DNA constructs of wild-type (WT) IPMK (+WT) or catalytically dead IPMK (+SA) in <italic>Ipmk</italic>KD mESCs.

To precisely assess the effect of an <italic>Ipmk</italic>KD-induced decrease in BRG1 occupancy on chromatin accessibility, we assigned ATAC peaks to the nearby (within 2 kb) BRG1 peaks and selected these BRG1 peaks for further analysis; we excluded BRG1 peaks without nearby ATAC peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). In addition, BRG1 peaks containing or assigned multiple ATAC peaks were included without de-duplication to match the same ordering as ATAC peaks (the same alignment of heatmap rows was applied for BRG1 and ATAC peaks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). As expected, we observed that the global BRG1 occupancy was reduced upon <italic>Ipmk</italic>KD at BRG1 peaks with low BRG1 intensity (Low; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), consistent with our previous observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Importantly, at Low BRG1 peaks, both BRG1 occupancy and BRG1-mediated chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq signals closest to the BRG1 CUT&amp;RUN peaks) were significantly reduced upon <italic>Ipmk</italic>KD in a genome-wide manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2I</xref>).

Reduced BRG1 and BRG1-associated chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) upon <italic>Ipmk</italic>KD were also detected Low BRG1 peaks residing at promoter-TSS regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>), consistent with the previous study in which BRG1 primarily maintained chromatin accessibility at promoter-TSS regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Dieuleveult et al., 2016</xref>).

To examine the promoter-TSSs that are affected by the <italic>Ipmk</italic>KD-driven global loss of BRG1 occupancy, we initially plotted BRG1, nucleosome, and ATAC-seq signals at the TSS by analyzing BRG1 CUT&amp;RUN, MNase-seq (chromatin digestion with micrococcal nuclease combined with sequencing), and ATAC-seq in <italic>Egfp</italic>KD mESCs. We confirmed that BRG1 is abundant near TSSs and observed two major BRG1 peaks, which were divided by the TSS and coincided with the –1 and +1 nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, left). Furthermore, we observed the nucleosome-depleted/chromatin accessible regions, known as NFRs, which is a hallmark of the TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, left). To quantitatively assess the BRG1 and ATAC-seq signals, we defined three genomic regions and used them for subsequent analysis: Upstream and Downstream regions that coincided with the two major BRG1 peaks and Center regions that coincided with the ATAC-seq peaks (which also coincided with NFRs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Next, using the signal intensity of ChIP-seq against histone H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, we classified promoters into three types: H3K4me3-Low, H3K4me3-Only (high H3K4me3, low H3K27me3), and bivalent (high H3K4me3, high H3K27me3). Consistent with the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Dieuleveult et al., 2016</xref>), both BRG1 intensity and chromatin accessibility were at high levels in H3K4me3-Only, moderate levels in bivalent, and low levels in H3K4me3-Low promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, right), confirming our promoter classification method. To dissect 9,042 TSSs with decreased BRG1 occupancy upon <italic>Ipmk</italic>KD (1.5-fold changes in BRG1 occupancy compared to <italic>Egfp</italic>KD), we categorized them into the three promoter types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and five clusters based on the combinatorial changes in BRG1 levels upon <italic>Ipmk</italic>KD at the previously defined Up and Downstream regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). We excluded the H3K4me3-Low promoters, which exhibited extremely low BRG1 signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, top right). H3K4me3-Only promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>) and Cluster2/3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) occupied a large proportion of promoter-TSSs with decreased BRG1 levels upon <italic>Ipmk</italic>KD.

To elucidate the effect of an <italic>Ipmk</italic>KD-induced decrease in BRG1 occupancy on chromatin accessibility at two promoter types and five clusters, we analyzed two ATAC-seq data sets: ours (<italic>Ipmk</italic>KD) and one that was publicly released (<italic>Brg1</italic>KD, GSE64825). We calculated the differential ATAC-seq signals (KD vs. controls) at predefined Center regions. Consistent with our previous genome-wide results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–I</xref>), ATAC-seq signals were significantly reduced upon <italic>Ipmk</italic>KD at both promoter types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, Total of all clusters) and most clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Notably, the ATAC-seq signals decreased similarly upon <italic>Ipmk</italic>KD and <italic>Brg1</italic>KD at two promoter types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>) and five clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). As the reduced BRG1 occupancy upon <italic>Ipmk</italic>KD partially mimics <italic>Brg1</italic>KD, the similar result upon <italic>Ipmk</italic>KD and <italic>Brg1</italic>KD further supports IPMK playing a vital role in chromatin accessibility at the promoter-TSS by regulating the BRG1 occupancy. Intriguingly, we found that the ATAC-seq signals at bivalent promoters were reduced more upon <italic>Ipmk</italic>KD than those at H3K4me3-Only promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F and G</xref>). Supporting this, we found that shRNA-mediated <italic>Ipmk</italic> silencing significantly reduced the BRG1 intensity only at bivalent promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and observed a close association between a reduced BRG1 level upon IPMK depletion and decreased ATAC-seq signals upon <italic>Ipmk</italic>KD and <italic>Brg1</italic>KD at specific loci of bivalent promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, why <italic>Ipmk</italic>KD shows differential effects on chromatin accessibility at two promoter types is unclear; for example, although IPMK depletion reduced BRG1 occupancy at both promoters in Cluster1, why does it impact the chromatin accessibility of the bivalent promoters more than H3K4me3-Only promoters? To examine this, we compared the BRG1 occupancy in <italic>Ipmk</italic>KD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>, red lines) at Cluster1 in two promoter types. H3K4me3-Only promoters contained more BRG1 occupancy than bivalent promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). In other words, although Cluster1 exhibited total BRG1 loss in <italic>Ipmk</italic>KD cells, some degree of BRG1 occupancy at H3K4me3-Only promoters remained, with higher levels than bivalent promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). For direct comparisons, we plotted BRG1 in <italic>Ipmk</italic>KD cells at two promoter types. H3K4me3-Only promoters had higher BRG1 occupancy compared to bivalent promoters at all clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Thus, the remaining BRG1 at H3K4me3-Only promoters may maintain the chromatin accessibility, causing the differential effect between two promoter types. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Dieuleveult et al., 2016</xref>) previously reported that the majority of chromatin remodelers (BRG1, CHD1, CHD2, CHD4, CHD6, CHD8, CHD9, and EP400) exhibit higher enrichment at H3K4me3-Only promoters compared to bivalent promoters. To test this in our study, we plotted various chromatin remodelers at two promoter types in five clusters using the publicly released data sets (GSE64825). Consistently, we detected higher occupancy at H3K4me3-Only promoters compared to bivalent promoters for all of the chromatin remodelers (CHD1, CHD2, CHD4, CHD6, CHD8, CHD9, and EP400; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Thus, these highly enriched chromatin remodelers at H3K4me3-Only promoters may compensate for the loss of BRG1 upon IPMK depletion, thereby maintaining the chromatin accessibility. BRG1 depletion has also been reported to reduce the ATAC-seq (chromatin accessibility) signals at bivalent promoters in mESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Dieuleveult et al., 2016</xref>); Brg1 depletion, which would cause total BRG1 loss at H3K4me3-Only and bivalent promoters similar to Cluster1 in our study, presented a greater reduction in ATAC-seq signals at bivalent promoters than H3K4me3-Only promoters, consistent with our results. Taken together, these results support differential chromatin accessibility at two promoter types in terms of an <italic>Ipmk</italic>KD-driven reduction in BRG1 occupancy.</p><p>The ATAC-seq signals at Cluster2 of bivalent promoters were reduced more than other clusters upon <italic>Ipmk</italic>KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), which is consistent with the fact that, in bivalent promoters, BRG1 is localized at the –1 nucleosome and maintains chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Dieuleveult et al., 2016</xref>). Although H3K4me3-Only promoters also contain Cluster2, we did not detect a robust decrease in ATAC-seq signals at Cluster2 of H3K4me3-Only promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). This discrepancy between bivalent and H3K4me3-Only promoters may be due to the remaining BRG1 at H3K4me3-Only promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>) or high enrichment of various chromatin remodelers at H3K4me3-Only promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In addition, the different BRG1 occupancy in Upstream (–1 nucleosome) and Downstream ( + 1 nucleosome) regions of Cluster2 in <italic>Egfp</italic>KD mESCs may cause this discrepancy; BRG1 is highly enriched at Upstream regions compared to Downstream regions in bivalent promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, Cluster2, black line), whereas BRG1 levels are relatively similar at both Upstream and Downstream regions in H3K4me3-Only promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, Cluster2, black line). Interestingly, although we applied the same criteria when categorizing the five clusters, H3K4me3-Only and bivalent promoters exhibited different BRG1 localizations in <italic>Egfp</italic>KD mESCs at Cluster2 and Cluster3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>), indicating that BRG1 has distinct localization in these two promoter types in mESCs. Taken together, these results suggest that IPMK plays a pivotal role in maintaining the chromatin accessibility of bivalent promoters, particularly by safeguarding BRG1 occupancy at the –1 nucleosome.</p><p>Collectively, these findings indicate that IPMK regulates BRG1 occupancy and BRG1-mediated chromatin accessibility at promoter-TSS regions and suggest that IPMK depletion causes the most severe impacts on chromatin accessibility at bivalent promoters, which are strongly associated with the <italic>Ipmk</italic>KD-induced decrease in BRG1 occupancy at –1 nucleosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Loss of IPMK partially affects transcription by disrupting BRG1 localization and chromatin accessibility at promoter-TSSs</title><p>To investigate the effect of <italic>Ipmk</italic>KD-driven disruption of BRG1 occupancy and chromatin accessibility on transcription, we performed high-throughput mRNA sequencing (mRNA-seq) using mESCs with <italic>Ipmk</italic>KD.

We harvested the mESCs at various time points during EB formation and analyzed the RNA expression of key marker genes related to pluripotency and three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm). As EB formation progressed, the expression of pluripotency markers (<italic>Esrrb</italic>, <italic>Nanog</italic>, <italic>Pou5f1</italic>, and <italic>Zfp42</italic>) decreased in both shNT and sh<italic>Ipmk</italic> (sh<italic>Ipmk1</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) EBs, with a marginal difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), validating that mESCs successfully differentiated and lost self-renewal capacity. Notably, we detected significantly decreased levels of all endodermal markers (<italic>Foxa1</italic>, <italic>Foxa2</italic>, <italic>Gata6</italic>, and <italic>Sox17</italic>) upon IPMK depletion in undifferentiated EBs at day 0, and these decreased levels were maintained throughout the differentiation process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).

Furthermore, the majority of mesodermal markers (<italic>Brachyury</italic>, <italic>Cd34</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic>, and <italic>Runx1</italic>) exhibited slightly decreased or unchanged expression upon IPMK depletion during EB formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

To understand why endodermal marker genes fail to be properly induced upon IPMK depletion during EB formation, we examined the BRG1 occupancy at their promoters in mESCs. All the reduced endodermal markers (<italic>Foxa1</italic>, <italic>Foxa2</italic>, <italic>Gata6</italic>, and <italic>Sox17</italic>) in sh<italic>Ipmk</italic> EBs had bivalent promoters in mESCs.

Notably, our binary protein interaction assays showed that IPMK can directly and independently bind to the SMARCB1, BRG1, and BAF155 proteins. Furthermore, in vivo and in vitro immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that IPMK physically interacts with the SWI/SNF complex. Detailed mapping studies revealed reciprocal interactions between the Rpt domains (N-terminal β-sheets and C-terminal α-helices of Rpt1 and N-terminal β-sheets of Rpt2) of SMARCB1 and the IP kinase domain (exons 3, 4, and 6) of IPMK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). In accordance with a physical association between IPMK and the SWI/SNF complex, our CUT&amp;RUN analysis showed that IPMK co-localizes with BRG1 globally. Surprisingly, by performing CUT&amp;RUN and ATAC-seq, we discovered that the depletion of IPMK severely perturbed (decreased) the genome-wide BRG1 localization pattern and corresponding BRG1-mediated chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq signals). By categorizing the promoter-TSS, we found that IPMK depletion significantly affected chromatin accessibility at bivalent promoters, which was associated with disrupted BRG1 occupancy, especially at the –1 nucleosome (Cluster2). Using RT-qPCR and mRNA-seq, we found that the IPMK loss also affects the transcription of genes exhibiting disrupted BRG1/ATAC-seq levels at their promoter-TSS. Moreover, our EB assays revealed that IPMK depletion significantly impacts endodermal gene expression during differentiation. The altered endodermal gene expression was associated with disrupted BRG1 occupancy at bivalent promoters in mESCs, suggesting that this <italic>Ipmk</italic>KD-driven reduction in BRG1 occupancy may cause inappropriate induction of endodermal genes in EBs. Despite our findings, the mechanism whereby IPMK modulates the localization of BRG1 (or the SWI/SNF complex) remains unclear. We think that the physical association between IPMK and the SWI/SNF complex is strongly connected with BRG1 localization, but the detailed mechanism is still elusive. IPMK may facilitate recruitment of subunits of the SWI/SNF complex from the cytoplasm to the chromatin. However, our chromatin fractionation assays indicated that IPMK depletion did not affect BRG1 or SMARCB1 occupancy in the cytoplasm or chromatin fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B and D</xref>), excluding the above possibility. Alternatively, it is plausible that IPMK may aid the appropriate conformation of specific subsets of the SWI/SNF complex via physical binding, but further experiments are required to prove this hypothesis. Although IPMK depletion reduced the global BRG1 occupancy, our CUT&amp;RUN results indicated that IPMK depletion has a greater impact at the CUT&amp;RUN peaks with low enrichment of BRG1 in <italic>Egfp</italic> KD (WT-like) mESCs compared to highly enriched BRG1 peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, D, G–I</xref>). Importantly, our ATAC-seq results also corresponded to the region-specific (BRG1 Low) changes in BRG1 occupancy upon <italic>Ipmk</italic>KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, D, G–I</xref>). Supporting this, IPMK depletion exhibited a greater impact on the chromatin accessibility and transcription of bivalent promoters harboring relatively low BRG1 than on H3K4me3-Only promoters, which harbor high BRG1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that IPMK primarily regulates the BRG1 occupancy, which resembles the SWI/SNF-nucleosome interactions, and its downstream effects (i.e., chromatin accessibility and transcription) at the region where the BRG1 level is originally low in mESCs but does not affect the regions with high BRG1 levels. This contextual discrepancy in IPMK-dependent or IPMK-independent BRG1 occupancy may provide key clues to the mechanism whereby IPMK modulates BRG1 localization, but further experiments/analyses are required.</p><p>Our study is the first to elucidate the physical association between IPMK and core subunits of the SWI/SNF complex and the first to define the molecular function of IPMK in coordinating BRG1 localization and BRG1-associated chromatin accessibility in mESCs. Based on our findings, we propose a model in which IPMK physically binds the core subunits of the SWI/SNF complex (SMARCB1, BRG1, and BAF155), maintaining appropriate BRG1 occupancy and BRG1-mediated chromatin accessibility at promoter-TSSs and thereby regulating gene expression in mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Thus, when IPMK is depleted, BRG1 localization is perturbed and chromatin accessibility decreased. Therefore, these results elucidate a critical role of IPMK in regulating BRG1 localization and BRG1-mediated chromatin accessibility through the physical association of IPMK and the core subunits of the SWI/SNF complex. We think that these novel findings will play a pivotal role in future studies on IPMK and in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of mammalian SWI/SNF complexes, especially by providing additional clues about SWI/SNF-mediated generation of NFRs at TSSs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast two-hybrid screening</title><p>Panbionet (Pohang, South Korea) conducted the yeast two-hybrid screening (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://panbionet.com">http://panbionet.com</ext-link>).

Briefly, 50,000 mESCs were harvested, washed with cold PBS, lysed with cold lysis buffer, and immediately centrifuged. The nuclear pellets were resuspended in 25 μl of 2 X tagmentation reaction buffer (10 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10% dimethylformamide), 23 μl of nuclease-free water, and 2 μl of Tn5 transposase (generated in-house), and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The samples were immediately purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (28106, Qiagen). The libraries were pre-enriched for five cycles using the KAPA HiFi Hotstart ready mix (KK2601, Kapa Biosystems), and the threshold cycle (Ct) was monitored using qPCR to determine the additional enrichment cycles, which were then applied. The final libraries were purified again using a QIAquick PCR purification kit and sequenced using an Illumina Novaseq 6,000 platform. The libraries were generated from two sets of biological replicates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>H3K4me3-Only and bivalent promoter-TSSs</title><p>The list of 47,382 mouse genes was obtained from the UCSC Genome Browser [Table browser, mm10, group: Genes and Gene Prediction, track: NCBI RefSeq, table: UCSC RefSeq (refGene), region: genome]. Among these genes, we selected protein-coding genes (gene name starting with NM_) that are longer than 2 kb. To classify the promoter-TSS regions precisely, we removed redundancies by merging the genes with the exact same TSSs into the same group. By doing this, we obtained 23,927 mouse promoter-TSS regions. To categorize the promoter-TSS regions according to their histone modifications status, we calculated the H3K4me3 (accession number: GSM254000 and GSM254001) and H3K27me3 (accession number: GSM254004 and GSM254005) ChIP-seq intensity in a −500/ + 1000 bp window around the promoter-TSS regions. The −500/ + 1000 bp window range was also applied in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Dieuleveult et al., 2016</xref>). Next, we divided the promoter-TSSs into two groups based on the first quartile (Q1) value of the H3K4me3 ChIP-seq intensity in the whole promoter-TSS regions: H3K4me3-Low and H3K4me3-High. Next, we divided the H3K4me3-High promoter-TSSs into two groups based on the third quartile (Q3) value of the H3K27me3 ChIP-seq intensity in the whole promoter-TSS regions: H3K4me3-Only and bivalent. Thus, we categorized three types of promoter-TSSs: 5,982 H3K4me3-Low, 12,305 H3K4me3-Only (high H3K4me3 and low H3K27me3), and 5,640 bivalent (high H3K4me3 and high H3K27me3). We obtained similar results when using the publicly released H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 ChIP-seq data (ENCODE, Ross Hardison, ENCSR212KGS and ENCSR059MBO). We confirmed that the percentages of three promoter-TSS types are similar to the results obtained in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Dieuleveult et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>mRNA purification, mRNA-seq, and rt-qPCR</title><p>Total RNA was purified from mESCs using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, mESCs cultured in six-well plates were harvested and homogenized with 1 ml of TRIzol reagent. Chloroform (200 μl/sample) was added and the samples vigorously mixed by hand for 15 s and incubated at 25 °C for 2 min. The mixtures were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, and 500 μl of each aqueous phase was transferred to a new Eppendorf tube and mixed with equal volumes of isopropanol. The mixtures were incubated at 25 °C for 10 min to precipitate the total RNA samples. The samples were then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, washed with 75% ethanol, and centrifuged again at 10,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The RNA pellets were dried and dissolved in RNase-free water. For mRNA-seq library preparation, mRNA was isolated from total RNA using a Magnetic mRNA Isolation Kit (S1550S, NEB), and libraries were prepared using a NEXTflex Rapid Directional RNA-seq Kit (5138–08, Bioo Scientific). The libraries were sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 2,500 system. The libraries were generated from two sets of biological replicates. First-strand complementary DNA was synthesized from total RNA using reverse transcriptase (Enzynomics). RT-qPCR analyses was performed using SYBR Green Master Mix (Toyobo) and the StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The expression levels of genes of interest were normalized to those of a housekeeping gene and are presented as fold changes over baseline using the ∆∆C<sub>t</sub> method.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Embryoid body formation</title><p>To induce EB formation, E14Tg2a cells were detached, pelleted by centrifugation, and resuspended in mESC medium in the absence of LIF and β-mercaptoethanol.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Irwin Davidson as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As you can see from the comments below the referees raised several major issues that have to addressed in any revised version.</p><p>1). The referees were concerned that effects are seen only at sites with low BRG1 occupancy. To be sure that this is meaningful the referees propose in their comments below a series of further analyses of the data that should be performed.</p><p>2). SiRNA IPMK depletion is of limited efficiency with several blots showing an incomplete knockdown. This may lead to an under estimation of the possible impact IPMK has on BRG1 function. The authors should perform a full IPMK KO using CRISPR and re-assess the effects on BRG1 occupancy and gene expression. Alternatively, at the very least the authors should use a constitutive shRNA-mediated IPMK silencing to achieve a better reduction in its expression.</p><p>3). A major issue is the lack of a real functional readout on IPMK knockdown in terms of the biology of the ES cells. If as claimed genes regulated by bivalent promoters are the preferred targets this should translate into altered ES cell differentiation. The authors should investigate in detail the impact of IPMK silencing or knockout on ES cell biology to go beyond the analyses of gene expression.</p><p>Any revised version must also address the other issues raised by the referees.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Several issues should be addressed.</p><p>The authors describe the effect of IPMK depletion at transcriptional start sites of bivalent and H3K4me3 only promoters. Can the authors perform the same analyses at enhancers? According to their model, enhancers show higher BRG1 occupancy, and therefore should not be affected by IPMK depletion. However, this may not be true for all enhancers, there may be a subset with lower occupancy where IPMK depletion would have a comparable effect to that seen at the TSS. The authors must also take into account that the siRNA mediated depletion is of limited efficiency, several blots showing an incomplete knockdown. Perhaps if a full IPMK KO was made using CRISPR, even sites with stronger BRG1 occupancy would now be affected. Is this possible? See below.</p><p>As IPMK depletion affects sites with lower BRG1 occupancy, it is important to exclude the possibility that IPMK depletion results in reduced expression of BRG1 or another limiting subunit leading to reduced SWI/SNF levels.</p><p>The authors show that IPMK depletion leads to a more pronounced effect on expression of genes with bivalent promoters compared to H3K4me3 only promoters. As bivalent promoters are those that are destined to be activated or repressed upon ES differentiation, this would suggest that IPMK depletion should impact ES differentiation. The authors should test this idea and ask whether IPMK depletion by siRNA or, even better shRNA to achieve stable depletion, affects ES cell differentiation. Also, the authors make no comments on how IPMK siRNA and de-regulation of around 500 genes affects ES cell physiology or proliferation. This is relevant if a CRISPR KO was to be made, are the ES cells viable or not. If yes, a KO would be a useful complement as mentioned above to assess the full effect of IPMK on SWI/SNF function and subsequent ES differentiation. These data would strongly strengthen the paper and provide a functional readout for the how IPMK affects SWI/SNF beyond gene expression assays.</p><p>Can the authors address whether the IPMK effects on SWI/SNF genome occupancy and gene expression require its enzymatic activity or whether the effects are independent of enzymatic activity?</p><p>The manuscript requires thorough re-writing and proofing by a native English speaker as the text is often difficult to follow. The study could be written in a much clearer manner.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. There is only one concern about the immunoprecipitations. The BAF155 co-IP in Figure 2C is not very convincing. There is a band in the IgG control that is stronger than the band in the IP lane.</p><p>2. Details on analysis of peaks for cut and run and ATAC-seq are missing. How were the changes in peak height quantified and determined to be statistically significant.</p><p>3. The rationale and method for defining clusters and then re-clustering should be clarified.</p><p>4. RNA-seq profiles with IPMK knockdown showed that some genes occupied by BRG1 and regulated at the chromatin level are also regulated by IPMK. However, there is no information about whether the effects of IPMK depletion on gene expression results from suppression of BRG1 occupancy. Experiments to address whether BRG1 depletion affects the expression of Phactr3, Nmra1l or any of the IPMK-regulated genes determined by RNA-seq should be conducted.</p><p>5. The manuscript loses focus by conducting RNA-seq in cells with Smarcb1 depletion. These data should be integrated with the data on BRG1 occupancy and chromatin accessibility. A key question to address is whether any of the overlapping Smarcb1/IPMK regulated genes can be associated with changes in BRG1 occupancy and chromatin accessibility upon IPMK and BRG1 knockdown.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>To test the quality of the BRG1 CUT&amp;RUN experiments, the authors could use the lists of typical enhancers and super-enhancers published in Whyte et al., 2013 (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2013.03.035) and generate heat maps of BRG1 distribution showing separately each replicate of BRG1 CUT&amp;RUN, as well as the non-specific IgG CUT&amp;RUN control. For the comparison, they could use the previously validated GSM1581286 BRG1 ChIP-seq data.</p><p>To verify that their interpretation of low amplitude changes in ChIP-seq or CUT&amp;RUN signal is correct, the authors should generate heat-maps as in Figure 4C and 4G showing individual replicates of both BRG1 CUT&amp;RUN and ATAC-seq.</p><p>Similarly, the authors should also produce heat-maps of the five clusters of promoters shown in figure 5D, showing each BRG1 CUT&amp;RUN replicate experiment, as well as non-specific IgG CUT&amp;RUN control.</p><p>These figures will be determinant to test the validity of the differences in BRG1 enrichment observed in IPMK-depleted cells.</p><p>The description of the results of the ATAC-seq experiments at promoter elements is difficult to follow: multiple analysis are presented using different series of clusters of TSS. The authors should try to simplify this part of manuscript.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Inositol polyphosphate multikinase physically binds to the SWI/SNF complex and modulates BRG1 occupancy in mouse embryonic stem cells&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Jessica Tyler (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>In this revised version, the authors have performed a number of important experiments to address previous concerns. These new data have strengthened the study and the conclusions. Specifically, they have used stable shRNA-mediated IPMK knockdown in addition to the siRNA and observed analogous effects on BRG1 occupancy. They have performed rescue experiments that show that the enzymatic activity of IPMK is not required for BRG1 occupancy and they have differentiated the shIPMK cells as embryoid bodies and provide evidence for downregulated expression of several endodermal markers. They have incorporated in their analyses BRG1 occupancy at previous lists of mESC enhancers. This new data addressed many of the major issues raised in the previous version.</p><p>Nevertheless, the authors should perform some additional revisions as several sections of the manuscript are rather difficult to follow.</p><p>1). As previously suggested, the authors should remove the data on siSMARCB1 in Figure 6 and Figure 6-supplement. This data interrupts the flow of the paper and dilutes the message. There are no analyses of how siSMARCB1 affects BRG1 or IPMK occupancy or chromatin accessibility by ATAC-seq and therefore these results cannot be properly interpreted. Also, there is no relevance in this paper for 3T3 cells. Removing this data does not affect the major conclusions of the paper and will make the paper easier to read.</p><p>2). The description of the data in Figure 5 and the Figure 5 supplements is extremely difficult to follow. All of this section needs careful attention and should be rewritten. For example, it is difficult to understand why total BRG1 loss at cluster 1 has a differential effect at bivalent and K4me3-only promoters. Why does it not impact the accessibility of the K4me3-only promoters. Figures 5F and G are particularly difficult to understand. Can this data be represented in another manner, or at least the description in the text should be improved?</p><p>3). The new experiments show reduced expression of endodermal markers in embryoid bodies generated from the shIPMK cells. The authors should comment on whether the genes that are not properly induced in the embryoid bodies displayed bivalent promoters in the ESCs and if yes, did they belong to a specific cluster as defined in Figure 5. In other words is there a relationship between altered BRG1 occupancy at the promoters in ESCs and failure to be properly induced in embryoid bodies.</p><p>4). In the discussion, the authors should avoid unnecessary speculation about how IPMK may affect SWI/SNF structure (lines 510-550). The discussion should be simplified and shortened to specifically address the results of this study (see lines 574-605).</p><p>5). Figure 4 supplement 2D should be brightened.</p><p>6). I would suggest that Figure 7B be transferred to the Figure supplement and that panels A and D of the Figure 7 supplement be transferred to the main Figure 7.</p><p>7). In general, the manuscript still requires a thorough revision by a native speaker as there are still many errors with many difficult to understand sentences.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73523.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1).

To prove that this effect is meaningful, we performed a series of further analyses suggested by the reviewers. Most importantly, we established two types of stable IPMK-depleted mESCs via shRNA-mediated <italic>Ipmk</italic> silencing (Figure 4C and Figure 4—figure supplement 2C, sh<italic>Ipmk1</italic> and sh<italic>Ipmk2</italic>) and performed BRG1 CUT&amp;RUN assays. Consistent with the results from the siRNA-mediated Ipmk silencing (Figure 4B), shRNA-mediated Ipmk silencing significantly reduced the BRG1 intensity at the lowly-enriched BRG1 peaks but had no effect at the highly-enriched BRG1 peaks (Figure 4D). The reproducible results observed both in siRNA-mediated and shRNA-mediated silencing indicate that the decrease in the BRG1 intensity majorly at low BRG1 occupancy upon IPMK depletion is not an artifact. Instead, IPMK has a significant role in modulating BRG1 occupancy particularly for lowly-enriched BRG1 peaks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2).

As expected, highly-enriched BRG1 peaks (both ChIP-seq and CUT&amp;RUN peaks) were primarily localized at enhancers (Figures 4B, D, and Figure 4—figure supplement 1E, upper part of the heatmap termed as “High”). Notably, IPMK depletion (both siRNA- and shRNA-mediated silencing) did not exhibit significant changes in BRG1 occupancy at these BRG1-enriched enhancers (Figures 4B, D, and Figure 4—figure supplement 1F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As IPMK depletion affects sites with lower BRG1 occupancy, it is important to exclude the possibility that IPMK depletion results in reduced expression of BRG1 or another limiting subunit leading to reduced SWI/SNF levels.</p></disp-quote><p>The observed reduction in BRG1 intensity at the low BRG1 peaks (Figures 4B and D, bottom part of the heatmap termed as “Low”) were not derived from any changes in the expression of BRG1 or other subunits of the SWI/SNF complex (Figure 2—figure supplement 1D, Figure 4—figure supplement 1B, 2B and C), excluding the possibility that IPMK depletion results in reduced expression of BRG1 or another SWI/SNF complex subunit leading to the reduced BRG1 occupancy at the low BRG1 peaks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors show that IPMK depletion leads to a more pronounced effect on expression of genes with bivalent promoters compared to H3K4me3 only promoters.

These results support that IPMK depletion causes more pronounced effects on bivalent promoters (compared to H3K4me3-ONLY promoters).</p><p>2) To investigate whether IPMK depletion (which impacts the BRG1 occupancy and chromatin accessibility at bivalent promoters) impacts ES differentiation, we measured the RNA levels of key marker genes related to pluripotency and three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) at various time points during embryoid body (EBs) formation. Notably, endodermal marker genes were dramatically downregulated in IPMK-depleted EBs (Figure 7A). By integrating the expression profiles of three types of marker genes, we found that IPMK depletion caused the most severe impact on the endodermal marker genes by reducing their expression levels (Figure 7B). Collectively, these data show that IPMK depletion impacts ES differentiation (especially affecting endodermal marker gene expression), thereby validating the above comments of reviewer #1.</p><p>3) Lastly, we observed no significant difference in morphology, proliferation rate, or viability between shNT and sh<italic>Ipmk</italic> mESCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can the authors address whether the IPMK effects on SWI/SNF genome occupancy and gene expression require its enzymatic activity or whether the effects are independent of enzymatic activity?</p></disp-quote><p>To address whether the enzymatic activity of IPMK is required for regulating BRG1 occupancy, we performed rescue experiments by transfecting <italic>Ipmk</italic>KD mESCs with DNA constructs of wild-type IPMK (+WT) or catalytically dead IPMK (+SA). We first confirmed the stable expression of the constructs (Figure 4—figure supplement 2F) and then performed BRG1 CUT&amp;RUN assays. Consistent with our previous results (Figures 4B and D), we observed significantly reduced BRG1 intensity at low BRG1 peaks upon <italic>Ipmk</italic>KD (Figure 4—figure supplement 2G and H). Although transfection of WT IPMK (+WT) did not fully restore the BRG1 intensity, we observed significantly increased BRG1 intensity in the <italic>Ipmk</italic>KD+WT mESCs compared with the intensity in the <italic>Ipmk</italic>KD mESCs (Figure 4—figure supplement 2G and H). Interestingly, transfection of catalytically dead IPMK (<italic>Ipmk</italic>KD+SA) also exhibited significantly increased BRG1 intensity compared with the intensity in the <italic>Ipmk</italic>KD mESCs and did not show a large difference in BRG1 intensity compared with that in the <italic>Ipmk</italic>KD+WT mESCs (Figure 4—figure supplement 2G and H). These results indicate that the enzymatic activity of IPMK is not required for regulating BRG1 occupancy in mESCs. Thus, the physical interaction between IPMK and BRG1 is presumably crucial for appropriate BRG1 occupancy (see also the Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript requires thorough re-writing and proofing by a native English speaker as the text is often difficult to follow.

For the ATAC-seq peak analysis, we used the same condition as in the CUT&amp;RUN analysis but without the background (-c) option (since there is no factor to use as a background in ATAC-seq). The intensities at the peaks (or defined regions) were calculated using bwtool (Pohl and Beato, 2014) (matrix 1:1:1 option) with the relevant sequencing data (bigwig files) as the input, and the statistical significance of the genome-wide difference between the samples was assessed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test (see also Figures 4B, D, and G). We also discussed this part both in Materials and methods and figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The rationale and method for defining clusters and then re-clustering should be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>IBRG1 has been reported to differentially regulate chromatin accessibility depending on its binding positions; BRG1 localized at -1 nucleosome in wide NFR (median length 808 bp) of H3K4me3-Only and bivalent promoters enhances the chromatin accessibility of NFR, whereas BRG1 localized at +1 nucleosome in narrow NFR (median length 28 bp) of H3K4me3-only promoters tends to inhibit the chromatin accessibility of NFR in mESCs (de Dieuleveult et al., 2016). Accordingly, we defined the upstream (-400 to -30 bp from the TSS) and downstream (-30 to +300 bp from the TSS) regions, which correspond to -1 and +1 nucleosome, respectively (Figure 5A), and clustered the TSSs into five clusters depending on the differential BRG1 intensity at the up/downstream regions upon IPMK depletion (Figures 5C–E). We removed the re-clustering (previous Figure 5— figure supplement 1) section to clarify our message.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. RNA-seq profiles with IPMK knockdown showed that some genes occupied by BRG1 and regulated at the chromatin level are also regulated by IPMK. However, there is no information about whether the effects of IPMK depletion on gene expression results from suppression of BRG1 occupancy.

In support, we detected that ATAC-seq signals (chromatin accessibility) were decreased similarly upon <italic>Ipmk</italic>KD and <italic>Brg1</italic>KD at two promoters (Figures 5F and G).

Due to the low number of overlapping Smarcb1/IPMK-regulated genes, it is challenging to present “significant” changes in BRG1 occupancy and chromatin accessibility upon IPMK or BRG1 knockdown in a genome-wide manner. Despite these difficulties, most of our representative genes (Figures 6A, B, E, and F) are indeed members of overlapping Smarcb1/IPMK down-regulated genes (Figure 6H-Clusters 5 and 6J) (also see the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="sa2table1">Author response table 1</xref> that were extracted from the mRNA-seq analysis-cufflinks). These representative genes are shown to be 1) decreased in BRG1 occupancy at their TSS upon IPMK knockdown and 2) decreased in ATAC-seq intensity at their TSS upon IPMK or BRG1 knockdown in the same manner (Figures 6A, B, E, and F). Since the reduced BRG1 occupancy upon IPMK knockdown partially mimics BRG1 knockdown, the similar ATAC-seq reduction upon IPMK or BRG1 knockdown further supports that IPMK plays a vital role in regulating the expression of overlapping Smarcb1/IPMK down-regulated genes by maintaining BRG1-mediated chromatin accessibility at promoters-TSSs.</p><table-wrap id="sa2table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><caption><title>Table shows the actual values and calculated significance corresponding to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th><italic>Genes</italic></th><th><italic>Figure 6</italic></th><th><italic>Relative Expression</italic></th><th><italic>Log2 (vs EgfpKD)</italic></th><th><italic>P-value (vs EgfpKD)</italic></th><th/><th/><th/><th/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>EgfpKD</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>lpmkKD</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>Smarcb1KD</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>lpmkKD</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>Smarcb1KD</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>lpmkKD</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>Smarcb1KD</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>Rasl12</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>A</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>1</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>0.272476547</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>0.538887496</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>-1.8758</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>-0.891947</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>0.00145</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>0.08695</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>Phactr3</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>B and E</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>1</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>0.582057348</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>0.480741151</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>-0.780767</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>-1.05667</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>0.05265</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>0.0278</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>Lrrc61</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>F</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>1</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>0.490901076</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>0.604801519</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>-1.0265</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>-0.725463</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>0.00215</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>0.01485</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>Arhgap44</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>F</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>1</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>0.602265871</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>0.491195499</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>-0.731528</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>-1.02563</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>0.03035</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>0.04435</italic></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-73523-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>To test the quality of the BRG1 CUT&amp;RUN experiments, the authors could use the lists of typical enhancers and super-enhancers published in Whyte et al., 2013 (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2013.03.035) and generate heat maps of BRG1 distribution showing separately each replicate of BRG1 CUT&amp;RUN, as well as the non-specific IgG CUT&amp;RUN control.

The major reason that our BRG1 CUT&amp;RUN peak annotation did not detect enhancers was that enhancers were not specified in the peak annotation program (instead, enhancers were just included as intergenic regions). Since the peak enrichment (Figure 4E) and significance (Figure 4F) both depend on the length of genomic annotation (and the intergenic sites are in total much longer than the promoter-TSSs), these may be the reason why intergenic sites (enhancers) showed the lowest and the most insignificance in BRG1 CUT&amp;RUN peaks (Figure 4E and F).</p><p>To resolve this issue, we followed the comments of the reviewer as below:</p><p>Since the peak annotation analysis (Figures 4E and F) did not specify the enhancers, which show a strong BRG1 enrichment (de Dieuleveult et al., 2016; Laurette et al., 2015; Nakayama et al., 2017), we used the previously determined enhancer lists of mESCs (Whyte et al., 2013) and aligned with the BRG1 peaks. Consistent with the previous findings, highly enriched BRG1 ChIP-seq peaks from the previous study (Figure 4—figure supplement 1E; these data are equivalent to the GSE64825 or GSM1581286 BRG1 ChIP-seq data that reviewer #3 suggested) and highly enriched BRG1 CUT&amp;RUN peaks from our study (Figures 4B, D, and Figure 4—figure supplement 1F) were mostly localized at enhancers (upper part of the heatmap). Furthermore, both BRG1 peaks (ChIP-seq peaks from the previous study and our CUT&amp;RUN peaks) showed similar enrichment patterns in promoters and enhancers (Figure 4—figure supplement 1G), validating our CUT&amp;RUN experiments. Notably, we observed that IPMK was highly enriched at enhancers (Figure 4B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To verify that their interpretation of low amplitude changes in ChIP-seq or CUT&amp;RUN signal is correct, the authors should generate heat-maps as in Figure 4C and 4G showing individual replicates of both BRG1 CUT&amp;RUN and ATAC-seq.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the comment of the reviewer, we generated heatmaps as in Figure 4D and 4G showing individual replicates of both BRG1 CUT&amp;RUN (Figure 4—figure supplement 2A) and ATAC-seq (Figure 4—figure supplement 2I).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, the authors should also produce heat-maps of the five clusters of promoters shown in figure 5D, showing each BRG1 CUT&amp;RUN replicate experiment, as well as non-specific IgG CUT&amp;RUN control.</p><p>These figures will be determinant to test the validity of the differences in BRG1 enrichment observed in IPMK-depleted cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the comment of the reviewer, we generated BRG1 CUT&amp;RUN heatmaps of the five TSS clusters in H3K4me3-ONLY and bivalent promoters (Figures 5D and E).

We have removed the additional analysis (previous Figure 5—figure supplement 1) section to clarify our message.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1). As previously suggested, the authors should remove the data on siSMARCB1 in Figure 6 and Figure 6-supplement. This data interrupts the flow of the paper and dilutes the message. There are no analyses of how siSMARCB1 affects BRG1 or IPMK occupancy or chromatin accessibility by ATAC-seq and therefore these results cannot be properly interpreted. Also, there is no relevance in this paper for 3T3 cells. Removing this data does not affect the major conclusions of the paper and will make the paper easier to read.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we removed the data on si<italic>Smarcb1</italic> and NIH3T3 cells in Figure 6G-J and Figure 6—figure supplement 1B-F. We also removed the corresponding parts in the manuscript (lines 417-462 in the original manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2). The description of the data in Figure 5 and the Figure 5 supplements is extremely difficult to follow. All of this section needs careful attention and should be rewritten. For example, it is difficult to understand why total BRG1 loss at cluster 1 has a differential effect at bivalent and K4me3-only promoters. Why does it not impact the accessibility of the K4me3-only promoters. Figures 5F and G are particularly difficult to understand. Can this data be represented in another manner, or at least the description in the text should be improved?</p></disp-quote><p>We improved the description in our revised manuscript. Regarding the reviewer’s question (although IPMK depletion reduced BRG1 occupancy at both promoters, why does it impact the chromatin accessibility of the bivalent promoters more than the H3K4me3-Only promoters?), there are three possible answers.</p><p>A) Consistent with our results, de Dieuleveult et al., (2016, http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature16505) showed that Brg1 depletion reduces the ATAC-seq (chromatin accessibility) signals at bivalent promoters in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). The line plots are Extended Data Figure 8 from the previous study (de Dieuleveult et al., 2016). Comparing the ATAC-seq signals between H3K4me3-Only (top-left) and bivalent (bottom-left) promoters, Brg1 depletion (which would cause total BRG1 loss at both promoters, just like Cluster1 in our study) impacts the ATAC-seq signals more at bivalent promoters than H3K4me3-Only promoters.</p><p>B) When comparing the BRG1 occupancy in <italic>Ipmk</italic>KD cells (Figure 5D and E, red lines) at Cluster1 in two promoter types, we observed that H3K4me3-Only promoters contain more BRG1 occupancy than bivalent promoters. In other words, although Cluster1 exhibits total BRG1 loss in <italic>Ipmk</italic>KD cells, there remains some degree of BRG1 occupancy at H3K4me3-Only promoters, which exhibit higher levels than the bivalent promoters (Figure 5D and E). For direct comparisons, we drew line plots comparing the BRG1 occupancy in <italic>Ipmk</italic>KD cells at two promoter types and found that H3K4me3-Only promoters contain higher BRG1 occupancy than bivalent promoters at all clusters (Figure 5—figure supplement 1C). Thus, the remaining BRG1 at H3K4me3-Only promoters may maintain the chromatin accessibility, causing the differential effect between the two promoter types.</p><p>C) Lastly, de Dieuleveult et al., (2016, http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature16505) previously showed that the majority of chromatin remodelers (BRG1, CHD1, CHD2, CHD4, CHD6, CHD8, CHD9, and EP400) exhibit higher enrichment at H3K4me3-Only promoters than bivalent promoters (Extended Data Figure 3 and 5 in de Dieuleveult et al., 2016). To test this in our study, we drew line plots comparing the chromatin remodeler occupancy at two promoter types in five clusters using the data sets from the previous study (GSE64825, de Dieuleveult et al., 2016). Consistent with the previous findings, all of the chromatin remodelers (CHD1, CHD2, CHD4, CHD6, CHD8, CHD9, and EP400) exhibited higher occupancy at H3K4me3-Only promoters than bivalent promoters (Figure 5—figure supplement 1D). Thus, at H3K4me3-Only promoters, these highly enriched chromatin remodelers may compensate for the loss of BRG1 upon IPMK depletion, thereby maintaining the chromatin accessibility.</p><p>Taken together, these three possibilities support the differential chromatin accessibility at two promoter types in terms of <italic>Ipmk</italic>KD-driven reduced BRG1 occupancy. We added the figures and descriptions to our revised manuscript (lines 309-400).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3). The new experiments show reduced expression of endodermal markers in embryoid bodies generated from the shIPMK cells. The authors should comment on whether the genes that are not properly induced in the embryoid bodies displayed bivalent promoters in the ESCs and if yes, did they belong to a specific cluster as defined in Figure 5. In other words is there a relationship between altered BRG1 occupancy at the promoters in ESCs and failure to be properly induced in embryoid bodies.</p></disp-quote><p>All of the reduced endodermal markers (<italic>Foxa1</italic>, <italic>Foxa2</italic>, <italic>Gata6</italic>, and <italic>Sox17</italic>) in sh<italic>Ipmk</italic> embryoid bodies (EBs) displayed bivalent promoters in the mESCs. <italic>Foxa2</italic>, <italic>Gata6</italic>, and <italic>Sox17</italic>, but not <italic>Foxa1</italic>, exhibited decreased BRG1 occupancy at their promoters upon IPMK depletion; <italic>Foxa2</italic> and <italic>Gata6</italic> were included in Cluster2, whereas <italic>Sox17</italic> was included in Cluster3 (Figure 5E). <italic>Foxa1</italic> did not exhibit changes in BRG1 occupancy upon IPMK depletion. Taken together, these results indicate that the <italic>Ipmk</italic>KD-driven reduction in BRG1 occupancy at the bivalent promoters of endodermal markers in mESCs may result in their failure to be appropriately induced in EBs. We added this comment in our revised manuscript (lines 445-457).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4). In the discussion, the authors should avoid unnecessary speculation about how IPMK may affect SWI/SNF structure (lines 510-550).
