In yeast, how metabolic signals control the progressive choreography of structural reorganizations observed in quiescent cells during a natural life cycle remains unclear. We have developed an integrated microfluidic device to address this question, enabling continuous single-cell tracking in a batch culture experiencing unperturbed nutrient exhaustion to unravel the coordination between metabolic and structural transitions within cells. Our technique reveals an abrupt fate divergence in the population, whereby a fraction of cells is unable to transition to respiratory metabolism and undergoes a reversible entry into a quiescence-like state leading to premature cell death. Further observations reveal that nonmonotonous internal pH fluctuations in respiration-competent cells orchestrate the successive waves of protein superassemblies formation that accompany the entry into a <italic>bona fide</italic> quiescent state. This ultimately leads to an abrupt cytosolic glass transition that occurs stochastically long after proliferation cessation. This new experimental framework provides a unique way to track single-cell fate dynamics over a long timescale in a population of cells that continuously modify their ecological niche.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>quiescence</kwd><kwd>microfluidics</kwd><kwd>single-cell dynamics</kwd><kwd>cytosolic pH</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jacquel</surname><given-names>Basile</given-names></name><name><surname>Charvin</surname><given-names>Gilles</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aspert</surname><given-names>Théo</given-names></name><name><surname>Charvin</surname><given-names>Gilles</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A switch-like cell fate divergence revealed by continuous single-cell tracking during entry into quiescence.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Microorganisms have evolved plastic growth control mechanisms that ensure adaptation to dynamical environmental changes, including those that arise from their proliferation (such as nutrients limitations and cellular secretion in the medium). During its natural life cycle, budding yeast may undergo several metabolic transitions from fermentation to respiration, followed by entry into a reversible state of proliferation arrest known as quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Virgilio, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gray et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sun and Gresham, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miles et al., 2021</xref>). Despite quiescence being an essential part of the microorganism life cycle that ensures cell survival over prolonged periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fontana et al., 2010</xref>), it has received little attention compared to the analysis of biological processes in proliferative contexts.</p><p>Quiescent cells strongly differ from proliferating cells in terms of metabolic activity and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gray et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miles et al., 2013</xref>). They also display a large body of structural rearrangements in the cytoskeleton, mitochondria, nuclear organization, and the appearance of protein superassemblies, clusters, and aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sagot and Laporte, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sun and Gresham, 2021</xref>). So far, the complex and entangled regulatory processes controlling this particular state’s establishment remain poorly understood. In particular, the detailed sequence of events describing how the dynamics of metabolic cues during the natural life cycle drive the entry into quiescence is still missing.</p><p>Also, an essential feature of microbial ecosystems in the stationary phase (SP) is the existence of phenotypic variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Campbell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avery, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Holland et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Labhsetwar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackermann, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bagamery et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Solopova et al., 2014</xref>) and history-dependent behaviors that lead to fate divergences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balaban et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cerulus et al., 2018</xref>). In quiescence, the coexistence of heterogeneous cell populations has been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Laporte et al., 2018a</xref>). Nevertheless, how phenotypic diversity emerges in a clonal population during a natural life cycle remains elusive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Bridging this gap requires performing longitudinal tracking of individual cells over time. However, an important technical obstacle is that it must be done in population-scale growth experiments to allow cell proliferation to have a collective impact on the environment.</p><p>Previous work has used an abrupt transition to glucose starvation to study how cells reorganize upon entry into the SP in various biological contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Munder et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bagamery et al., 2020</xref>). While this experimental framework may be helpful for studying standard properties of cells undergoing proliferation arrest, the results cannot be transposed to the context of entering quiescence during an undisturbed life cycle, in which cells undergo a sequence of metabolic transitions and feedback continuously into the composition of their environment. Indeed, an essential condition to reach a <italic>bona fide</italic> quiescence state (i.e., the ability to recover proliferation after prolonged arrest) is that cells must experience a respiration phase (RP) to accumulate carbohydrates, which does not occur upon abrupt glucose starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ocampo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, different nutrient limitations lead to distinct quiescent states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Klosinska et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, it is essential to develop novel methods that capture the true dynamics of cell transitions as they may occur in their ecological niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miles et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report the development of a microfluidic platform for single-cell ecology, allowing continuous tracking of individual cells’ fate during an unperturbed full life cycle (up to 10 days). Using a fluorescent reporter of internal pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mouton et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miesenböck et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dechant et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Munder et al., 2016</xref>), we observe that the diauxic shift (DS) witnesses a cell fate divergence, where a minority of cells experience a metabolic crash similar to that observed upon an abrupt starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bagamery et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, our long-term tracking capabilities further reveal that these cells experience a premature yet reversible induction of cellular reorganizations that coincide with limited survival. In contrast, respiration-competent cells experience fluctuations in internal pH in sync with metabolic transitions that drive successive waves of cellular reorganizations and a stochastic switch to a glass transition of the cytoplasm long after proliferation cessation. Altogether, our analysis reveals how metabolic changes encountered by yeast cells during an unperturbed life cycle coordinate the temporal control of complex cellular reorganizations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To track individual cell behavior during an unperturbed life cycle, we set up a device composed of a 25 ml liquid yeast culture (YPD medium) connected to a microfluidic device for single-cell observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>, 1F). Thanks to a closed recirculation loop, individual cells trapped in the microfluidic device could be imaged over time while experiencing the same environmental changes as the population liquid culture. To prevent clogging in the microfluidic device due to the high cell density in the culture (up to 10<sup>9</sup> cells/ml), we designed a filtration device based on inertial differential migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kuntaegowdanahalli and Papautsky, 2008</xref>). Using this technique, cells were rerouted back to the liquid culture before entering the microfluidic device (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Optical density (OD) and fluorescence measurements revealed a filtration efficiency superior to 99%, reducing the concentration of cells entering the device by two orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1–</xref> S1E), and allowing us to image the cells over up to 10 days.

At the onset of the DS, most cells (88%, <italic>N</italic> = 466) abruptly reached a plateau (pH ~6.9, blue lines on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) followed by a slight pH increase (up to pH ~7.2) that coincided with entry into a respiratory metabolism. In contrast, a minority (12%, <italic>N</italic> = 466) of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and red lines on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) experienced a further drop in pH down to about 5.8 during the DS. In this subpopulation, the fluorescence signal progressively disappeared, precluding monitoring the internal pH for more than 20 hr in a reliable manner.</p><p>In cells with high internal pH during the DS, the pH gradually declined after reaching a local maximum during the R phase. These cells then experienced a sharp pH drop down to about 5.8, which occurred at very heterogeneous times during the SP, unlike the cells with an early pH drop. Altogether, these observations revealed unprecedented dynamics of internal pH during the yeast life cycle: pH variations appeared to be in sync with the sequence of proliferation phases, suggesting that internal pH is a crucial marker of the cells’ metabolic status during their life cycle.</p><p>These continuous pH measurements also unraveled a divergence in cell fate at the DS, leading to the early emergence of heterogeneity within the population, in line with previous observations made upon abrupt starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bagamery et al., 2020</xref>). This phenomenon was also observed in a W303 strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Recent studies have shown that the activation of respiration was a crucial metabolic response to survive glucose deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Weber et al., 2020</xref>), enabling carbohydrate storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ocampo et al., 2012</xref>) and long-term viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Laporte et al., 2018a</xref>). Interestingly, it was shown that a respiration defect was naturally observed in about 10 % of cells upon proliferation cessation following glucose exhaustion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Laporte et al., 2018a</xref>). Hence to further characterize whether differences in metabolic status drove the emergence of divergent cell fates at the DS, first, we quantified cellular proliferation over time using single-cell area measurements. We found that cells with a late pH drop resumed growth and roughly doubled their biomass during the R phase (blue lines on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>) in agreement with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Divergent cell fates induced by a metabolic challenge at the diauxic shift (DS).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Quantification of single-cell growth during F, DS, and R phases, as defined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.

Indeed, these cells did not resume growth when adding lactate (i.e., a nonfermentable carbon source) to the medium neither (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, most of them were still viable after 3 days in SP, even though their survival declined faster than adapting cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>Second, to assess cellular respiratory function, we used the mitochondrial Ilv3-mCherry marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Laporte et al., 2018a</xref>). Whereas the mitochondrial network architecture appeared similar (i.e., tubular) in all cells before the DS, proliferating cells in the R phase displayed a fragmented mitochondria phenotype typical of respiring cells (blue cell, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In contrast, nonproliferating cells underwent a globularization of their mitochondrial network (red cell, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>). We further quantified the mitochondrial network’s reorganization dynamics by computing a custom aggregation index that discriminates globularized versus tubular and fragmented mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>, see Materials and methods for details). Based on the clear distinction in the aggregation index between adapting and nonadapting cells, we measured that about ~10 % of the cells could not transition to a respiratory metabolism (at <italic>t</italic> = 12 hr post-DS, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), in agreement with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Laporte et al., 2018a</xref>). Importantly, this quantification revealed that the mitochondrial globularization in nonadapting cells was temporally closely associated with the DS since it started as early as 1h20 (p &lt; 0.05) after its onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). Altogether, these results demonstrate that proliferating and nonproliferating cells experienced divergent cell fates at the DS based on their ability to switch to respiration; hence, they were referred to as respiration positive (R+) and negative (R−), respectively. Also, these results suggest that the inability of R− cells to activate a respiratory metabolism was either triggered by this metabolic challenge or, alternatively, preexisted the DS, knowing that respiratory deficient cells (i.e., ρ− cells) are common in the BY background (yet less so in W303 strains) due to the genetic instability of mitochondrial DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dimitrov et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>To discriminate between these two hypotheses, we used the mitochondrial localization marker Tom70-GFP (Tom70 is a protein of the outer mitochondrial membrane) and a preCox4-mCherry fusion (preCox4 is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein that is imported only in functional mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Veatch et al., 2009</xref>), to assess the cells’ ability to respire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fehrmann et al., 2013</xref>). Using these markers, we first checked that all R+ cells maintained a functional preCox4-mCherry import from fermentation to respiration (i.e., they were ρ+ cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Then, we observed that among the R− cells, only a minority (i.e., 19%) had a dysfunctional mitochondrial import before the DS, indicating that they had a preexisting respiratory deficiency (see ρ− cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In contrast, the vast majority of R− cells (81%) transitioned from ρ+ to ρ− during the DS. This result demonstrates that the respiration defect observed in R− cells occurred concomitantly with the environmental switch and was therefore not due to a preexisting condition. Also, we showed that the progeny quite faithfully inherited it (inheritance index = 0.52, i.e., is smaller than 1, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref> and Material and methods for details). Altogether, these observations supported a scenario in which a fate divergence occurred early at the onset of the DS, where R+ cells quickly switched to a respiratory metabolism, while R− cells failed to do so.</p><p>As numerous cellular reorganizations occur during entry into quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sagot and Laporte, 2019</xref>), we sought to quantitatively determine how they are coordinated with metabolic transitions during the life cycle. Indeed, the metabolism controls internal cellular pH, which in turn can induce significant physicochemical changes in the proteome, such as protein aggregation and phase transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Munder et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dechant et al., 2010</xref>).

Importantly, we observed that R− cells also experienced a consistent formation of fluorescent foci for the markers that we monitored, yet, unlike R+ cells, they all appeared during the DS.

This finding is compatible with the hypothesis that the drop in internal pH – which reflects a decrease in metabolic activity – actually drives successive waves of body formation and the appearance of quiescence hallmarks. Indeed, upon the DS, a pH decrease down to ~7 would trigger the formation of Gln1 and Dhh1 foci in both R+ and R− cells. In R+ cells, the rerise of the pH associated with proliferation resumption in the R phase would induce the disassembly of these structures until the pH reaches 7 again, after carbon source exhaustion in SP. In both R+ and R−, actin bodies, PSG, and Cdc28 foci would form only when the intracellular pH reaches 6.</p><p>To further check this hypothesis, since energy depletion was shown to induce a global modification of the cytoplasm to a glassy state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Munder et al., 2016</xref>), we sought to observe these transitions by monitoring the frame-to-frame displacement of Gln1-GFP foci over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Munder et al., 2016</xref>). This marker was chosen because foci are already present at the DS. We found that the mobility of Gln1-GFP foci decreased sharply in R− cells during the DS (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref>) and much later in R+ cells, consistently with the differences observed regarding the times of pH drops in both populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). To better establish the links between pH and mobility, we exploited the fact that lipid droplets (LDs) could be conveniently observed using phase-contrast images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heimlicher et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, the time of loss of LDs mobility correlated very well with that of Gln1-GFP foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). By quantifying both the time of loss of LD mobility and the dynamics of pH drop in single cells, we observed that both events were tightly correlated in all cells, despite the large cell-to-cell heterogeneity in the time of pH drop in R+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> , <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata3">Figure 3—source data 3</xref>). Also, after synchronizing all single-cell trajectories from the time of loss of LD mobility, we showed that the mobility loss of the cytoplasm occurred at a similar pH ~6 in both R+ and R− cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, Figure 3—source data 2 and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata3">Figure 3—source data 3</xref>). Therefore, these observations suggest that the internal pH, which displays a very dynamic behavior during the yeast life cycle, induces waves of cellular structural remodeling that ultimately triggers a global transition of the cytoplasm to a gel-like state. This model is further supported by the concomitance between the premature pH drop and the phase transition in respiratory deficient (R−) cells. Altogether, it suggests that, upon nutrient exhaustion, cells undergo stereotypical pH-dependent structural reorganizations, no matter their respiratory status. R− cells’ inability to switch to respiration, which ultimately compromises the long-term viability in this subpopulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ocampo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Weber et al., 2020</xref>), makes this transition precocious, and explains the divergent cell fates in the population at the DS.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we have developed a new microfluidic platform that allows us to monitor a full cell proliferation cycle in liquid culture with single-cell resolution. Individual cell tracking and quantitative fluorescence measurements provide a unique dynamic assessment of the successive metabolic transitions from fermentation to the SP observed in a liquid culture submitted to nutrients exhaustion. In contrast to most previous studies that used abrupt environmental switches to investigate the metabolic response to starvation, our methodology recapitulates the unperturbed dynamics of nutrients experienced by cells during a life cycle in laboratory conditions. We envision that this methodology could be further applied to other contexts in which collective cell behavior impacts the environment, which in turn shapes individual cellular responses – for example, metabolic oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tu et al., 2005</xref>) and cooperative behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dal Co et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Campbell et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Continuous monitoring of cell growth and mitochondrial markers revealed a clear divergence in cell fate, where a minority of them failed to establish a respiratory metabolism, in line with recent observations obtained using an abrupt medium change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bagamery et al., 2020</xref>). The dramatic drop in internal pH upon proliferation cessation in R− cells at the DS suggests that the failure to transition to respiration induces a major loss of energy homeostasis in this subpopulation, that may, in turn, compromise long-term viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ocampo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Weber et al., 2020</xref>). By and large, this phenomenon could not be explained by preexisting phenotypic differences in the population during the FP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bagamery et al., 2020</xref>) but rather appeared to be triggered by the metabolic challenge associated with the exhaustion of glucose.</p><p>Previous studies have unraveled how changes in cytosolic pH – including upon nutrient exhaustion – control protein supramolecular assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Peters et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Petrovska et al., 2014</xref>). Our analysis shows that nonmonotonous fluctuations in pH level occur in sync with metabolic transitions during an unperturbed life cycle. Further, it reveals that successive pH drops are closely temporally related to the formation of many protein bodies and granules, despite the large cell-to-cell temporal variability associated with the onset of these events. Interestingly, since the structural reorganization of many protein complexes is one of the well-described hallmarks of quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sagot and Laporte, 2019</xref>), our observations thus suggest that internal pH acts as a key controller that drives waves of structural changes at well-defined pH levels during entry into quiescence. That R– cells display foci formation similarly as the R+ cells provide further support to a model of stereotypical structural reorganizations driven by energy depletion and transduced by internal pH level.</p><p>In addition to monitoring the superassembly of specific markers, we showed that the transition to SP is accompanied by a transition of the cytoplasm to a glassy-like phase, hence transposing previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Parry et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Joyner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Munder et al., 2016</xref>) to the context of an unperturbed life cycle in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heimlicher et al., 2019</xref>). Importantly, the appearance of the glassy-like state occurs right at the DS in the R– cells and is significantly delayed and variable in time in R+ cells. We propose that the start of respiration upon glucose exhaustion prevents a precocious glass transition, which might be detrimental to cell viability if it occurs in an uncoordinated manner with other cellular reorganizations processes (e.g., energy storage)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ocampo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Weber et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The abrupt and concomitant transition of all cells during the DS shows how the rapid evolution of the environment at this precise moment drives cell behavior in a deterministic manner, in the same way as during abrupt starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bagamery et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Munder et al., 2016</xref>). Conversely, the remarkable cell-to-cell temporal heterogeneity during the transition to a glassy state in R+ cells suggests that the cells have a developmental program whose progression is partly stochastic, that is, not entirely determined by the external environment. This last observation further supports that it is impossible to follow the process of entry into quiescence faithfully by imposing the dynamics of environmental changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miles et al., 2021</xref>) or based on population measurements only. Further studies using our methodology may allow us to discover how the succession of the different key steps of this developmental process contributes to establishing the specific physiological properties of quiescent cells (e.g., long-term survival and stress tolerance).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background(<italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> BY, mat a)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WT</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Euroscarf;

Then, we used a soft bake of 7 min at 95 °C on heating plates (VWR) followed by exposure to 365 nm UVs at 160 mJ/cm² with a mask aligner (UV-KUB3 Kloé, FRANCE).

The chips were punched with a 1 mm biopsy tool (Kai medical, Japan) and covalently bound to a 24 × 50 mm coverslip using plasma surface activation (Diener, Germany). The assembled chips were then baked for 1 hr at 60 °C to consolidate covalent bonds between glass and PDMS. Then, the dust filter chip was connected to the spiral cell filter which was in turn connected to the observation chip. All the connections used 1 mm (outside diameter) Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)tubing (Adtech Polymer Engineering, UK).</p><p>All medium flows were driven using a peristaltic pump (Ismatec, Switzerland) at a 100 µl/min rate. The system was connected to the tank of media and cells described in the previous section. The observation chip was loaded with the cells of interest using a 5 ml syringe and a 23 G needle. Last, we plugged the cell outlet of the spiral and the observation chip outlet into the tank so the system is closed and without loss of media or cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>Microfluidic cell filter and dust filter</title><p>The spiral-shaped microfluidic device (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kuntaegowdanahalli and Papautsky, 2008</xref>) was designed to filter out cells coming from the liquid culture to prevent clogging in the observation device (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The dimensions of the cell filter (i.e., a channel of 100 µm width and 50 µm height, defining a spiral of five loops separated by 900 µm) were set to maximize the separation of haploid yeast cells, that is, ~5 μm particles, according to the following principle: particles in a spiral microfluidic channel with a rectangular section are submitted to several inertial forces that depend on their size and are either directed towards the center of the channel or the walls. Therefore, particles of similar diameters reach an equilibrium position and tend to focus on a single line, allowing their separation from the rest of the fluid by splitting the output channel in two different outlets. A similar filter could be used with other microorganisms by adapting the dimensions.</p><p>We also added a particle filter before the spiral to avoid any clogging of the spiral because of dust particles or debris (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>To measure the filtration efficiency of the cell filter, the cell concentration of the inlet and the two outlets was measured at four different time points (0 , 24 , 48 , and 120 hr) using a turbidity measurement (OD 660 nm, Fisherbrand). Another independent measurement was done using Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) fluorescent yeast cells and measuring the fluorescence along the section of the device (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The filtration efficiency was equal to 99 % in both measurements, independently of the inlet cell concentration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Microscopy</title><p>For all experiments except pH measurements, cells in the observation device were imaged using an inverted widefield microscope (Zeiss Axio Observer Z1).

We have performed population growth curves with a variety of strains to test their ability to switch to respiration after the diauxic shift. For this, we have used both auxotroph (BY and W303) strains, and prototrophs from several related origins (FY, S288C, and BY). Our results indicate that both auxotrophs and prototrophs are able to undergo a bona fide switch to respiration. Even though the BY auxotroph may experience a more pronounced delay in switching to respiration compared to the W303 strains, the final density of cells is identical (new Figure 1—figure supplement 2).</p><p>Importantly, we have checked that all the auxotrophies of the strains used in this assay were correct. In addition, we have used a FY Rho<sup>0</sup> strain (i.e., a strain unable to respire) as a negative control to assess the ability of the other strains to switch to respiration. Last, we have looked for a W303 prototroph in the literature as well as in our own stock but we failed to find one. We have asked Joseph Schacherer (Université of Strasbourg), a renowned expert in <italic>S.cerevisae</italic> phylogenetics, who confirmed that this lab strain was derived from an auxotrophic ancestor.</p><p>Altogether, this new dataset indicates that the single cell analyses performed in our study with a BY prototroph are likely to apply to other backgrounds, whether auxotroph or prototroph. We have included a description of these experiments in the main text, and we have justified these experiments by mentioning the potential concern with the BY strain.</p><p>2. We have performed additional single-cell experiments with a W303 strain that carries the internal pH-marker pHluorin2 to compare the results to those obtained in the BY background. Our results indicate that the W303 cells display the same dynamics as observed in the BY background (new Figure 1—figure supplement 3). In addition, similarly as in BY cells, a small fraction of the W303 cells fail to switch to respiration. We believe that these results further confirm the generality of our observations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)</p><p>These investigators have teamed up to solve a technical problem that has thwarted efforts to get a clear picture of the chronology of events in yeast cultures as they naturally exhaust their nutrient supply. This is a challenge because the time course is long and the density of the culture makes single cell analysis problematic. Previous studies involving abrupt starvation have shown that there is a pH drop when nutrients are eliminated, but abrupt starvation also leads to rapid loss of viability compared to what is observed with cells as they respond and adapt to changes in their environment. This microfluidic devise and an intracellular pH detector allowed them to follow pH change as cells transition from fermentation to respiration and stationary phase. About 15% of the population responds completely differently than the other 85%, making this single cell analysis crucial. It also provides a negative control of sorts, to further substantiate the correlations they draw. This 15% fails to enter the respiratory phase and dies rapidly. The pH also drops rapidly and is correlated with loss of mitochondrial function and aggregation of proteins. The 85% of cells that succeed in shifting to respiration suffer the same pH drop, but it is much slower and is correlated with slower protein aggregation, P Body, actin body, and proteosome storage Granule assembly. They also followed the cytoplasmic transition to a glassy state, based on the mobility of protein foci and lipid droplets. This transition occurs at the same pH in both populations but with completely different timing. This recapitulates the transition observed after abrupt starvation. It shows that the same transition occurs in viable, quiescent cells and provide further evidence that it is correlated with pH changes.</p><p>The only concern I have is that they used only one strain, which reduces the universality of their findings. Moreover, it is ambiguous which strain was used. The strain table says they used S288c which is known to carry a hap1 mutation that compromises respiration and isn't the best choice for studying respiring cells. The text mentions that they are working in the BY background, where most of their GFP studies have been carried out. The BY strains have the same hap1 mutation and several other unknown polymorphisms that prevent</p><p>ethanol utilization and biomass increase after the diauxic shift.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the point raised by reviewer #1, we used a BY strain (from an S288C background), which is one of the most widely used lab strains in yeast genetics. Although a mutation in the HAP1 gene was identified in this strain, it does not compromise the ability of the cells to respire, as shown in our experiments performed in a non-fermentative medium in this manuscript (Figure 2). Similarly, we have already published growth curves, drop tests, and proliferation rates of this strain in glycerol/ethanol or lactate-containing medium (please see Jimenez et al., JCS, 2014). More importantly, detailed respiration parameters have been measured for our BY background by the Daignan-Fornier lab, a long-standing Sagot lab collaborator (please see Gauthier et al., Mol Mic, 2008). Last, we have previously shown that upon quiescence establishment, there is no difference in mitochondrial network reorganization between BY/S288C and W303 or CEN PK background (Laporte et al., <italic>eLife</italic>, 2018, Figure 2 SupFig1 F-G). Altogether, these results indicate that using this particular lab strain background does not detract from the generality of the observations reported in our manuscript. We will include a short discussion on this specific topic in the main text in a full revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Significance (Required)</p><p>This kind of single cell analysis is clearly the way forward and will have many further applications to understanding how cells adapt to their environment. The paper is well written and the figures are well laid out and easy to understand. It is a significant advance for the field and will set the bar for future experiments. However, this work was done with a single strain that is known to be defective in respiration. It would be extremely valuable to know if their results with this strain are generalizable to other lab and wild strains.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors interrogated single cells of yeast as they developed into quiescence after the natural depletion of glucose from the culture medium. To do so, they constructed a microfluidic platform to track individual cells in a batch culture of cells transitioning from a growing phase into stationary phase. They then used a number of assays to monitor the metabolic changes that accompany this transition. They observed that internal pH dropped during development of quiescence, with some cells showing a rapid drop and others showing a delayed and heterogeneous drop. At diauxie, cells transition from fermentation to respiration, and the minority of cells that showed a rapid drop in pH were respiration-deficient (R-) and unable to resume growth, while cells with a delayed pH drop were respiration proficient (R+) and able to resume growth. Using established markers to follow the previously described structural changes that accompany the development of quiescence, they found that the pH changes were temporally related to these structural changes. They suggest that the dynamic changes in intracellular pH promote waves of structural remodeling that eventually leads to a transition of cells to a gel-like state. The early drop in pH in R- cells was proposed to lead to a precocious transition of the cytoplasm, contributing to the inability of these cells to resume growth.</p><p>This study is well done, well-written, and the results are clearly presented and generally convincing. Data accumulation and analysis were well documented and appropriate statistics were used. While the authors provided details of the materials used to construct the microfluidic device, it would be appropriate for them to provide a detailed blueprint (and a video, for example) to other investigators who would like to employ this device in their studies of quiescence once this manuscript has been published.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding reviewer #2’s comments, we are committed to providing all necessary details to fully replicate the microfluidic devices upon a final revision of our manuscript to make it widely accessible to the research community.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Significance (Required)</p><p>The cell fate program that is set in motion as yeast cells transition from fermentation to respiration is still not well understood. The development of the microfluidic platform described in this manuscript could make a significant contribution to our understanding of the succession of metabolic and structural changes occurring during this transition. The Sagot lab has made a series of important contributions in this area, and the application of single cell tracking to monitor the temporal program of these changes represents a major technical advance that will be of general interest to researchers interested in defining the developmental programs that contribute to cellular quiescence and longevity.</p></disp-quote></body></sub-article></article>
