early infection. This raised the question of whether these responses could suppress a subsequent challenge with pathogenic <italic>Leptospira</italic>. We inoculated C3H/HeJ mice with a single or a double dose of <italic>L. biflexa</italic> before challenge with a pathogenic serovar, <italic>Leptospira interrogans</italic> serovar Copenhageni FioCruz (LIC). Pre-challenge exposure to <italic>L. biflexa</italic> did not prevent LIC dissemination and colonization of the kidney. However, it rescued weight loss and mouse survival thereby mitigating disease severity. Unexpectedly, there was correlation between rescue of overall health (weight gain, higher survival, lower kidney fibrosis marker ColA1) and higher shedding of LIC in urine. This stood in contrast to the <italic>L. biflexa</italic> unexposed LIC challenged control. Immune responses were dominated by increased frequency of effector T helper (CD4+) cells in spleen, as well as significant increases in serologic IgG2a. Our findings suggest that exposure to live saprophytic <italic>Leptospira</italic> primes the host to develop Th1 biased immune responses that prevent severe disease induced by a subsequent challenge with a pathogenic species. Thus, mice exposed to live saprophytic <italic>Leptospira</italic> before facing a pathogenic serovar may withstand infection with far better outcomes. Furthermore, a status of homeostasis may have been reached after kidney colonization that helps LIC complete its enzootic cycle.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Leptospira</italic></kwd><kwd>leptospirosis</kwd><kwd>commensalism</kwd><kwd><italic>L. interrogans</italic></kwd><kwd>vaccine</kwd><kwd>kidney</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AI139267</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kundu</surname><given-names>Suman</given-names></name><name><surname>Gomes-Solecki</surname><given-names>Maria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21 AI142129</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kundu</surname><given-names>Suman</given-names></name><name><surname>Shetty</surname><given-names>Advait</given-names></name><name><surname>Gomes-Solecki</surname><given-names>Maria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Potential commensalism between saprophytic and pathogenic <italic>Leptospira</italic> within a vertebrate host protects against severe leptospirosis and improves kidney homeostasis which helps <italic>Leptospira interrogans</italic> complete its enzootic cycle.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Leptospirosis, a neglected re-emerging enzootic spirochetal disease, affects millions of people worldwide causing an overall mortality rate of 65,000 per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Costa et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, it causes serious health problems in animals of agricultural interest which leads to substantial economic losses mostly in tropical and subtropical countries. Assessing the true severity of leptospirosis can be incredibly challenging, especially when early diagnosis is difficult due to nonspecific symptoms that overlap with other illnesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Haake and Levett, 2015</xref>). Recent outbreaks of both human and canine leptospirosis in New York and California in 2020–2022 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">NYC Health, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Health, 2022</xref>) underscores the need for development of effective strategies to control this disease. Although serovar-specific vaccines are available for animals and at least one is available for humans, no broadly effective vaccine is available for either (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barazzone et al., 2021</xref>). The absence of an effective cross-protective vaccine candidate increases the risk of disease re-emergence on a global scale. Efforts to use leptospiral surface antigens in various vaccine formulations have shown limited success in conferring protection against leptospiral dissemination and shedding, as well as severe disease. <italic>Leptospira</italic> immune evasion strategies contribute to the complexities of finding good vaccine candidates.</p><p>The genus <italic>Leptospira</italic> is broadly categorized into two major clades P and S (<underline>P</underline>athogens and <underline>S</underline>aprophytes) and further categorized into four subclades, P1, P2, S1, and S2 based on their virulence properties, growth conditions, and genetic make-up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Vincent et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Picardeau, 2017</xref>). Subclade P1 is further divided in two phylogenetically related groups named P1+ (high-virulence pathogens, established pathogenic species, e.g. <italic>Leptospira interrogans</italic>) and P1- (low-virulence pathogens, phenotypically not well characterized) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Giraud-Gatineau et al., 2024</xref>). <italic>Leptospira</italic> survives in moist conditions and are free-living organisms naturally found in soil and water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Narkkul et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benacer et al., 2013</xref>). The spread of infection occurs through contaminated water contact with breached skin or mucosal surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ko et al., 2009</xref>). Saprophytic strains of <italic>Leptospira,</italic> such as <italic>Leptospira biflexa</italic> (S1), are unable to establish disease due to the lack of certain virulence factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Picardeau, 2017</xref>) and have been found in natural environments around the world alongside pathogenic serovars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Vincent et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ko et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Guglielmini et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, <italic>L. biflexa</italic> exhibits certain niche-specific adaptations that allow them to persist in both environmental and host settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Castiblanco-Valencia et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Shetty et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kundu et al., 2022</xref>) demonstrated that <italic>L. biflexa</italic> triggers a robust innate immune response in mice during the acute phase of infection. This raised the question of whether saprophytic <italic>Leptospira</italic>-induced immune responses could confer any degree of resistance or immune memory that could suppress a subsequent challenge with a pathogenic serovar of <italic>Leptospira</italic>. Answering that question was the main goal of the current study.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Exposure to saprophytic <italic>Leptospira</italic> before infection with a pathogenic serovar prevents disease and increases survival of C3H-HeJ mice</title><p>We inoculated adult C3H-HeJ male mice with a single dose of <italic>L. biflexa</italic> 2 weeks before challenge with <italic>L. interrogans</italic> (LB<sup>1</sup>LIC<sup>1</sup>) at 8 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and measured a significant rescue of weight loss over a period of 15 days as compared to mice infected at 8 weeks that did not receive <italic>L. biflexa</italic> (PBS<sup>1</sup>LIC<sup>1</sup>) (p&lt;0.0001); unchallenged control mice that received <italic>L. biflexa</italic> (LB<sup>1</sup>) or PBS (PBS<sup>1</sup>) gained weight throughout the corresponding 15 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Given their widespread presence in nature, the likelihood of humans or animals getting exposed to non-pathogenic serovars of <italic>Leptospira</italic> is likely high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benacer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ko et al., 2009</xref>). Our previous studies showed innate immunity engagement during saprophytic <italic>L. biflexa</italic> infection in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Shetty et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kundu et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, <italic>L. biflexa</italic> extracts can be used to detect <italic>Leptospira</italic>-specific antibody in up to 67% of serum from patients with clinically confirmed leptospirosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fortes-Gabriel et al., 2022</xref>) which points to a high degree of immunodominant cross-reactive epitopes between <italic>L. biflexa</italic> and pathogenic <italic>Leptospira</italic>. Further, the current hypothesis regarding evolution of <italic>Leptospira</italic> species is that symbiosis of <italic>Leptospira</italic> with eukaryotes emerged from free-living ancestral species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Thibeaux et al., 2018</xref>); in other words, pathogenic <italic>Leptospira</italic> may have evolved from an environmental ancestor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Vincent et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that these highly cross-reactive immunodominant epitopes may also induce cross-protective immune responses. The objective of the current study was to assess whether exposure to a live saprophytic serovar of <italic>Leptospira</italic> provides any heterologous cross-species protection against a subsequent challenge with a pathogenic serovar in a mammalian host (mouse).</p><p>In the initial analysis of pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) we observed that prior exposure to one or two doses of saprophytic <italic>L. biflexa</italic> rescues weight loss in mice challenged with pathogenic <italic>L. interrogans</italic> at 8 weeks (LB<sup>1</sup>LIC<sup>1</sup>) and at 10 weeks (LB<sup>2</sup>LIC<sup>2</sup>), respectively. Weight gain correlated with survival (75% survival in LB<sup>1</sup>LIC<sup>1</sup> vs 0% survival of the PBS<sup>1</sup>LIC<sup>1</sup> group) in the single exposure experiment, where we expected all mice infected at 8 weeks with pathogenic <italic>L. interrogans</italic> (PBS<sup>1</sup>LIC<sup>1</sup>) to irreversibly lose weight and meet endpoint criteria for euthanasia before the 2-week term of the experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fortes-Gabriel et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Shetty et al., 2022</xref>). Loss of mice due to irreversible weight loss is not expected if mice are infected with LIC at 10 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Nair et al., 2020</xref>), as observed in the <italic>L. interrogans</italic> control group in the double exposure experiment (PBS<sup>2</sup>LIC<sup>2</sup>). In both experiments, mice exposed to <italic>L. biflexa</italic> before challenge with LIC produced evidence of <italic>L. interrogans</italic> dissemination in blood, shedding in urine, and kidney colonization.</p><p>Histological inspection of kidney slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) showed that exposure to a saprophytic <italic>Leptospira</italic> before challenge supported normal structural morphology and prevented infiltration of immune cells in both single and double exposure experiments; in addition, it significantly reduced a fibrosis marker (ColA1) in the single exposure experiment. In the double exposure experiment, differences in ColA1 fibrosis marker are not significant between the two LIC infected groups because 10-week-old C3H-HeJ infected with LIC are more resistant to pathology resultant from infection. Our findings are intriguing as they suggest that while prior live saprophytic exposure did not prevent infection or leptospiral dissemination, it may confer protection against kidney fibrosis.</p><p>Our data also shows that prior exposure to non-pathogenic <italic>Leptospira</italic> before pathogenic challenge induced higher antibody titer in the serum, specifically IgG2a antibodies against <italic>L. interrogans</italic> in both single and double exposure experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Increased IgG2a response in serum is associated with induction of a Th1 biased immune response. Others have recently found that saprophytic <italic>L. biflexa</italic> induced Th1 responses, higher T cell proliferation, and IFN-γ producing CD4+ T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Krangvichian et al., 2023</xref>). Persistent IgM and strain-specific IgG responses were observed during a homologous leptospiral challenge in C57BL6/J mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Vernel-Pauillac et al., 2021</xref>). In our study, exposure to a saprophytic <italic>Leptospira</italic> induced antibody responses that may provide heterologous protection against the pathogenic strain of <italic>Leptospira</italic>. This supports a promising broad-spectrum efficacy. Thus, live vaccines derived from a saprophytic strain of <italic>Leptospira</italic> could offer broader protection and overcome the limitation of serovar specificity often observed with killed whole-cell vaccines based on pathogenic strains.</p><p>Differences in antibody titer among the <italic>L. interrogans</italic> infected group pre-exposed to saprophytic <italic>L. biflexa</italic> can be attributed to the robust trafficking and differentiation of B and helper T cells (CD4+) measured in spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Presence of effector helper T (CD4+) cells in the spleen indicate a robust cellular immune response as these cells produce cytokines that play a pivotal role in activating other immune cells, including antibody-producing B cells. Moreover, our findings align with another observation which further reinforces the potential immunostimulatory properties of components (polar lipids) derived from saprophytic <italic>L. biflexa</italic>, indicating that these components could play a crucial role in inducing robust B cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Faisal et al., 2009</xref>). Induction of helper T cell responses along with dynamic transition from naïve to early effector and effector without T helper memory reflects an orchestrated immune response upon pathogenic challenge in the saprophytic pre-exposed group that is typical of effective responses to vaccines. Previous studies have highlighted the significance of activated CD4+ T cells during <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection in providing protective immunity to the host and mitigating the severity of leptospirosis by releasing cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Volz et al., 2015</xref>). Correlating induction of chemo-cytokines by saprophytic <italic>Leptospira</italic> with subsequent adaptive immune responses, such as the activation of CD4+ T cells or the production of specific antibodies, provides insights into how innate immune signals drive the adaptive immune response against a pathogenic threat. It may also aid in identifying key signaling molecules or pathways that could be targeted for therapeutic interventions or vaccine design.</p><p>While other researchers have explored vaccination strategies using live attenuated or mutant strains of pathogenic serovars, our approach was to utilize a live saprophytic bacterial strain which is unique in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wunder et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Potula et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lauretti-Ferreira et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Teixeira et al., 2019</xref>). We previously showed that oral delivery of a probiotic strain, <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic>, reduces the severity of leptospirosis by recruiting myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fortes-Gabriel et al., 2022</xref>) which suggests that a general phenomenon of trained immunity may be involved. Current vaccines based on inactivated pathogenic species provide equivalent protection to the one achieved in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barazzone et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Vernel-Pauillac and Werts, 2018</xref>) with the caveat of being serovar-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Teixeira et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Vernel-Pauillac and Werts, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adler, 2015</xref>). Although our current study conclusively shows protection from severe leptospirosis after heterologous challenge, it remains to be shown if protection extends to multiple pathogenic serovars of <italic>Leptospira</italic>. Using a live saprophytic strain of <italic>Leptospira</italic> as control strategy could pave the way for development of novel broadly effective vaccines against leptospirosis. Such a vaccine could have a substantial economic impact if applied to animals of agricultural interest.</p><p>Another interesting aspect of our current study is that it shows that exposure to a live saprophytic strain of <italic>Leptospira</italic> provides protection against a pathogenic serovar. Thus, in the real-life scenario where individuals or animals may naturally encounter a saprophytic <italic>Leptospira</italic> species, they may develop immune responses that mitigate severe disease outcomes if the host later encounters a pathogenic strain of <italic>Leptospira</italic>. By exploring the immune dynamics during the co-exposure to different <italic>Leptospira</italic> serovars, this study could open avenues of research on strategies that leverage natural exposure to saprophytic species to devise safe control measures against leptospirosis. This concept is important for understanding the epidemiological risk factors of leptospirosis and it should be applicable to other infectious diseases caused by direct contact between the pathogen and mucosal membranes or abraded host skin.</p><p>Importantly, we found that in mice pre-exposed to live saprophytic <italic>Leptospira</italic>, there was a correlation between kidney health after LIC infection (less infiltration of immune cells in kidney and less fibrosis marker ColA1) and higher shedding of live LIC in urine. This suggest that a status of homeostasis was reached after kidney colonization that helps the spirochete complete its enzootic cycle. Additional research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms involved in kidney homeostasis after LIC infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Male C3H/HeJ mice (n=6–8/group) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and were maintained in a pathogen-free environment in the Laboratory Animal Care Unit of the University of Tennessee Health Science Center (UTHSC).

Histopathology was performed at the Histology Department, UT Methodist University Hospital, Memphis, TN. Digital scanning of inflammatory cell infiltration was measured by taking images of ~5 fields per sample under ×20 magnification. Images were captured after digitally scanning the H&amp;E slides using Panoramic 350 Flash III (3D Histech, Hungary) and CaseViewer software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>ELISA</title><p>Leptospiral extract for <italic>L. biflexa</italic> and <italic>L. interrogans</italic> were prepared as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fortes-Gabriel et al., 2022</xref>). Briefly, <italic>Leptospira</italic> was cultured in EMJH media and once confluency was observed, cells were centrifuged to obtain a pellet. This pellet was then incubated with BugBuster solution (1 mL) at room temperature (RT) in a shaker incubator (100 rpm) for 20 min and homogenized by vortexing. Stocks were stored at –20°C. This whole-cell extract of <italic>Leptospira</italic> was then diluted in 1× sodium carbonate coating buffer. Nunc MaxiSorp flat-bottom 96-well plates (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) were coated with extracts prepared from 10<sup>7</sup> to 10<sup>8</sup> bacteria per well and incubated at 4°C overnight. Cells were washed using 1× PBST the following day and blocked for 1 hr using 1% BSA solution, followed by another wash with 1× PBST. Serum samples (1:100) were added to the antigen-coated wells and incubated at 37°C for 1 hr, washed twice with 1× PBST, followed by HRP conjugate secondary anti-mouse- IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG3 (1:10,000) which was incubated for 30 min. After washing the plate three times with 1× PBST the color was developed using TMB SureBlue followed by Stop solution before the absorbance was measured at OD 450 nm using an ELISA plate reader (Molecular Devices Spetramax).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>Spleens were chopped into small pieces and macerated to prepare single-cell suspensions on the same day of euthanasia to avoid loss of cell viability. RBC lysis was performed using ACK lysis buffer (Gibco). AO/PI dual staining was used to count live/dead cells on a Luna counter (Logos Biosystems, South Korea). 10<sup>6</sup> cells were seeded in a 96-well microtiter plate after washing with 1× PBS twice. Blocking was performed with anti-mouse CD16/32 antibody (1:100), followed by 20 min incubation on ice. Fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) were used to stain specific cell surface markers after 30 min incubation in the dark at 4°C. Freshly prepared flow staining buffer was used for washing stained cells. Cells were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde for 10–15 min at room temperature. Beads were stained using specific fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies and used for compensation, while FMO prepared with spleen cells simultaneously were used for gating controls. Cells were resuspended in flow staining buffer and the Bio-Rad ZE5 cell analyzer was used for data acquisition. Data analysis was done using FlowJo software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test and unpaired t-test with Welch’s correction were used to analyze differences between experimental groups.

The study is well-conceived, addressing an innovative hypothesis with potentially high impact. However, to fully realize its contribution to the field, the manuscript would benefit greatly from a more detailed elucidation of immune mechanisms at play, including specific cytokine profiles, antigen specificity of the antibody responses, and long-term immunity. Additionally, expanding on the methodological details, such as immunophenotyping panels, qPCR normalization methods, and the rationale behind animal model choice, would enhance the manuscript's clarity and reproducibility. Implementing functional assays to characterize effector T-cell responses and possibly investigating the microbiota's role could offer novel insights into the protective immunity mechanisms. These revisions would not only bolster the current findings but also provide a more comprehensive understanding of the potential for saprophytic Leptospira exposure in leptospirosis vaccine development. Given these considerations, I believe that after substantial revisions, this manuscript could represent a valuable addition to the literature and potentially inform future research and vaccine strategy development in the field of infectious diseases.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors try to achieve a method of protection against pathogenic strains using saprophytic species. It is undeniable that the saprophytic species, despite not causing the disease, activates an immune response. However, based on these results, using the saprophytic species does not significantly impact the animal's infection by a virulent species.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Exposure to the saprophytic strain before the virulent strain reduces animal weight loss, reduces tissue kidney damage, and increases cellular response in mice.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Even after the challenge with the saprophyte strain, kidney colonization and the release of bacteria through urine continue. Moreover, the authors need to determine the impact on survival if the experiment ends on the 15th.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Kundu et al. investigated the effects of pre-exposure to a non-pathogenic Leptospira strain in the prevention of severe disease following subsequent infection by a pathogenic strain.

However, they state the graphs only represent one of two independent experiments. Each experiment utilized 3-4 mice per group. In order to be confident in the conclusions, a power analysis needs to be done to show that there is sufficient power with 3-4 mice per group. In addition, it would be important to show both experiments in one graph which would inherently increase the power by doubling the group size, while also providing evidence that this is a reproducible phenotype between experiments. Overall, this weakens the strength of the conclusions drawn and would require additional statistical analysis or additional replicates to provide confidence in these conclusions.</p><p>A direct comparison between single and double exposure to the non-pathogen is not able to be determined. The ages of mice infected were different between the single (8 weeks) and double (10 weeks) exposure methods, thus the phenotypes associated with LIC infection are different at these two ages. The authors state that this is expected, but do not provide a reasoning for this drastic difference in phenotypes. It is therefore difficult to compare the two exposure methods, and thus determine if one approach provides advantages over the other. An experiment directly comparing the two exposure methods while infecting mice at the same age would be of great relevance to and strengthen this work.</p><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Major Comments</p><p>(1) Elucidation of Immune Mechanisms: The manuscript intriguingly suggests that exposure to saprophytic Leptospira primes the host for a Th1-biased immune response, contributing to survival and mitigation of disease severity upon subsequent pathogenic challenge. However, the underlying mechanisms remain broadly defined. A more detailed investigation into the cytokine profiles, particularly the levels of IFN-γ, IL-12, and other Th1-associated cytokines, could clarify the mechanism of Th1 bias. Moreover, exploring the role of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in priming T cells towards a Th1 phenotype would add valuable insights.</p></disp-quote><p>In this study we continue to elucidate the immune mechanisms engaged by pathogenic and non-pathogenic Leptospira as a follow up to our previous work (Shetty et al, 2021 PMID: 34249775, and Kundu et al 2022 PMID 35392072). We, and others, have shown that saprophytic <italic>L. biflexa</italic> and pathogenic <italic>L. interrogans</italic> induce major chemo-cytokines associated with Th1 biased immune responses (Shetty et al. 2021; Cagliero et al. 2022; Krangvichian et al. 2023) and engage myeloid immune cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells. The role of antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells in priming T cells and activating adaptive response is a separate question and can be addressed in the future. To further address this question, a recent mechanistic study (Krangvichian et al. 2023) showed that non-pathogenic leptospires (<italic>L. biflexa</italic>) promote MoDC maturation and stimulate the proliferation of IFN-γ-producing CD4+ T cells and potentially elicit a Th1-type response in mice, which also supports our current claim and it is referenced in our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Quantitative Analysis of Kidney Colonization: The manuscript reports that pre-exposure to L. biflexa did not prevent the colonization of kidneys by L. interrogans but led to a more regulated immune response and reduced fibrosis. A more nuanced quantification of bacterial loads in the kidneys, using techniques such as CFU counting or more sensitive qPCR methods, could provide a clearer picture of how saprophytic exposure affects the ability of pathogenic Leptospira to establish infection. Additionally, a time-course study showing the kinetics of bacterial colonization and clearance post-infection would be informative.</p></disp-quote><p>We are currently validating digital PCR to use in the future and plan to do time course studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Characterization of B Cell and T Cell Responses: While the manuscript mentions increased B cell frequencies and effector T helper cell responses, specifics regarding the nature of these responses are lacking. For instance, detailing the isotype and specificity of antibodies produced, the proliferation rates of specific B and T cell subsets, and their functional capabilities (e.g., cytotoxicity, help for B cells) would significantly enrich the understanding of the immune response elicited by pre-exposure to saprophytic Leptospira.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, additional experiments need to be conducted to flush out the immune responses engaged after pre-exposure to saprophytic <italic>Leptospira</italic> followed by LIC challenge.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Comparative Analysis with Other Models of Pre-exposure: The study primarily focuses on pre-exposure to a live saprophytic Leptospira. Including a comparison with pre-exposure to killed saprophytic bacteria, or even to other non-pathogenic microbes, could help discern whether the observed protective effect is unique to live saprophytic Leptospira exposure or if it represents a more general phenomenon of trained immunity.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the use of other non-pathogenic microbes, our lab has shown in the past that oral use of probiotic strain <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> (Potula et al 2017) also reduces the severity of Leptospirosis by recruiting myeloid cells. Thus, there may be a general phenomenon of trained immunity involved. We added this to the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Assessment of Long-term Immunity: The study provides valuable insights into the short-term outcomes following saprophytic Leptospira exposure and subsequent pathogenic challenge. Extending these observations to assess long-term immunity, including memory B and T cell responses several months post-infection, would be crucial for understanding the potential of saprophytic Leptospira exposure in providing lasting protection against leptospirosis.</p></disp-quote><p>Long term immunity is a complex and separate question that we plan to address later.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Comments</p><p>(1) Technical Specifics of Flow Cytometry Analysis: The manuscript could benefit from including more details on the flow cytometry gating strategy and the specific markers used to identify different immune cell subsets. This addition would aid in the reproducibility of the results and allow for a clearer interpretation of the immune profiling data.</p></disp-quote><p>We included the technical specifics of the flow-cytometry analysis in the materials and methods section. The gating strategy (Fig S1) and the specific markers (TableS1) used to identify different immune cell subsets were incorporated in the supplementary datasheet. The cell specific markers were incorporated in the figures (Fig 5 and 6) under each representative cell subset which facilitates clarity and reproducibility of immune profiling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Statistical Methodology for IgG Subtyping: The analysis of IgG subtypes in response to Leptospira exposure is intriguing but would be strengthened by specifying the statistical tests used to compare IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG3 levels between groups. Additionally, discussing the biological significance of the observed differences in IgG subtype levels would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the immune response.</p></disp-quote><p>We applied the ordinary One-way ANOVA test to compare the IgG subtypes between groups followed by a Tukey’s multiple comparison correction analysis (included in the figure legend of Fig 4). We addressed the biological relevance of the observed differences in IgG subtype levels in the discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Details on Animal Welfare and Ethical Approval: While the manuscript mentions compliance with institutional animal care and use committee protocols, providing the specific ethical guidelines followed, such as the 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction, Refinement), would reinforce the commitment to ethical research practices.</p></disp-quote><p>This is addressed in our institutional IACUC which is approved and listed in Methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Clarification of Figure Legends: Some figure legends are brief and could be expanded to more thoroughly describe what the figures show, including details on what specific data points, error bars, and statistical symbols represent.</p></disp-quote><p>We updated and expanded the figure legends (Fig 1-4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Revision of Introduction and Background: The introduction provides a good overview of leptospirosis and the rationale behind the study. However, it could be further improved by briefly summarizing current challenges in vaccine development against leptospirosis and how understanding the immune response to saprophytic Leptospira could address these challenges.</p></disp-quote><p>We revised the introduction keeping this comment in mind.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>- Perform the same challenge experiment with a hamster.</p></disp-quote><p>We clarified throughout the manuscript that all the work was done using the C3H-HeJ mouse model which was developed in our lab for the purpose of measuring differences in sublethal and lethal LIC infections. We leave the experiments using hamster to the investigators that have thoroughly validated the hamster model of lethal Leptospira infection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Review the written part where it is understood that the challenge with saprophyte strain before virulence prevents the disease.</p></disp-quote><p>We reviewed the manuscript to be understood that inoculation of mice with a saprophyte <italic>Leptospira</italic> before pathogenic challenge prevents severe leptospirosis and promotes kidney homeostasis and increased shedding of <italic>Leptospira</italic> in urine which is interesting. The last 2 sentences of the abstract read: “Thus, mice exposed to live saprophytic <italic>Leptospira</italic> before facing a pathogenic serovar may withstand infection with far better outcomes. Furthermore, a status of homeostasis may have been reached after kidney colonization that helps LIC complete its enzootic cycle.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Line 83: The authors refer to the classification of Leptospira by old nomenclature.

For Fig 3 it would be redundant to show HE images of two experiments. Regarding Figs 5 and 6, the flow-cytometry equipment acquires data at different voltage every single time and biological samples vary between experiments even if all the markers and procedures are the same. So, we reproduce the experiment and show results from one experiment after confirming that the trend between individual experiments are the same.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(b) If ANOVA was used, were all columns compared to each other?
