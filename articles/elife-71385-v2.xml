Whilst intrinsic properties are key regulators of motoneuron recruitment, the underlying currents involved are not well defined. Whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology was deployed to study intrinsic properties, and the underlying currents, that contribute to the differential activation of delayed and immediate firing motoneuron subtypes. Motoneurons were studied during the first three postnatal weeks in mice to identify key properties that contribute to rheobase and may be important to establish orderly recruitment. We find that delayed and immediate firing motoneurons are functionally homogeneous during the first postnatal week and are activated based on size, irrespective of subtype. The rheobase of motoneuron subtypes becomes staggered during the second postnatal week, which coincides with the differential maturation of passive and active properties, particularly persistent inward currents. Rheobase of delayed firing motoneurons increases further in the third postnatal week due to the development of a prominent resting hyperpolarization-activated inward current. Our results suggest that motoneuron recruitment is multifactorial, with recruitment order established during postnatal development through the differential maturation of passive properties and sequential integration of persistent and hyperpolarization-activated inward currents.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>motoneuron</kwd><kwd>recruitment</kwd><kwd>size principle</kwd><kwd>postnatal development</kwd><kwd>spinal cord</kwd><kwd>intrinsic properties</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIF/R1/180091</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sharples</surname><given-names>Simon A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NSERC-PDF-517295-2018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sharples</surname><given-names>Simon A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Electrophysiological recordings from mouse spinal motoneurons reveal key roles for ion channels in establishing the differential activation of motoneuron subtypes during postnatal development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fine control of muscle force is a prerequisite for the generation of complex movement. This fine control relies on the orderly recruitment of ‘motor units’; the smallest functional unit of the motor system, consisting of alpha motoneurons and the muscle fibres they innervate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Liddell and Sherrington, 1924</xref>). Motor units can be subdivided based on the twitch kinetics of their muscle fibres. Different motor units are recruited in order of their force-generating capacity and susceptibility to fatigue, with slow fatigue resistant, fast fatigue resistant, and fast fatigable motor units recruited in sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Burke et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Henneman, 1957</xref>). This orderly recruitment of motor units has been accounted for by the size principle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Burke et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Henneman, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Somjen et al., 1965</xref>), with smaller motor units recruited prior to larger motor units. Although motoneurons that make up different subtypes of motor units exist on a size-based continuum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Burke et al., 1982</xref>), there is considerable overlap in geometrical and physiological measures of size between motoneuron subtypes, such that motoneuron size appears to be a poor predictor of recruitment order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Gustafsson and Pinter, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Zengel et al., 1985</xref>). It has therefore been argued that recruitment order is more heavily influenced by the functional subtype of a given motor unit and not strictly dependent on physical size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Burke et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Cope and Clark, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Cope and Pinter, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Zajac and Faden, 1985</xref>). Here we address whether motoneuron recruitment is purely dependent on the size principle or whether functional classes of spinal motoneurons possess distinct electrophysiological properties that help ensure orderly recruitment of motoneuron subtypes.</p><p>The intrinsic excitability of neurons is influenced by their compartmental, geometric structures, which are endowed with specialized complements of ion channels that support flexible output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Brocard, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Deardorff et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Heckman et al., 2008</xref>). For example, nonlinearities in the input-output relationship of motoneurons are produced by persistent inward currents (PICs) generated by persistent sodium and L-type calcium channels located on the axon initial segment (AIS) and distal dendrites, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Brocard et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Chatelier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Hounsgaard et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Hounsgaard and Kiehn, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Lee and Heckman, 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Li and Bennett, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Quinlan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Schwindt and Crill, 1980</xref>). Variations in the complement of ion channels expressed by subtypes of spinal motoneurons have been demonstrated and their roles in producing nonlinear firing behaviours described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Brocard, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Heckman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Soulard et al., 2020</xref>). Many of these currents are activated below the spike threshold, meaning their differential expression is also likely to contribute to orderly recruitment across motoneuron subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Zhang and Dai, 2020</xref>).</p><p>To address the role of specific ion channels in motoneuron subtype recruitment, we studied differences in the intrinsic properties and underlying currents that contribute to the activation of putative fast and slow motoneurons, which were identified based on delayed and immediate firing profiles during whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiological recordings in lumbar spinal cord slices of postnatal mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bhumbra and Beato, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Durand et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Leroy et al., 2015</xref>). Activation currents, otherwise known as rheobase currents, were measured as a proxy for motoneuron recruitment. We used postnatal development as a model to dissect the relative importance of the intrinsic properties of motoneurons to the differential activation of motoneuron subtypes, which contributes to the orderly recruitment of motoneurons required for the gradation of muscle force and fine motor control. Postnatal development in the rodent provides an opportune system to address this issue given that animals are largely sessile during the first postnatal week, produce rudimentary weight-bearing, hindlimb-based locomotion during week 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brocard et al., 1999</xref>), and complex locomotor behaviours consistent with adult animals by week 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altman and Sudarshan, 1975</xref>). It would therefore be expected that key properties that establish orderly recruitment of functionally defined motoneuron subtypes would manifest in parallel with the emergence of complex motor behaviour during postnatal development.</p><p>We identify key properties and underlying currents of motoneuron subtypes and pinpoint when these properties contribute to the functional differentiation of motoneuron subtypes, particularly with respect to their rheobase currents, during postnatal development. We find that during the first postnatal week lumbar motoneurons are activated according to passive properties predictive of size; however, delayed and immediate firing subtypes are functionally homogeneous, leading to overlap in rheobase currents across motoneuron subtypes. Rheobase current of delayed and immediate firing motoneurons then becomes staggered by the second postnatal week, which coincides with an increase in the size of delayed firing motoneurons and a more depolarized activation of sodium PICs in delayed firing motoneurons. Rheobase current becomes staggered further during week 3 as delayed firing motoneurons develop a prominent hyperpolarization-activated inward current (Ih) that is active at resting membrane potential and further increases rheobase, possibly by providing a depolarizing shunt. Taken together, our data demonstrate that motoneuron recruitment is multifactorial and support the notion that fast motoneurons are not simply scaled-up versions of slow motoneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Kernell and Zwaagstra, 1981</xref>). Whilst recruitment is influenced by size, activation properties of inward currents, which are differentially expressed in motoneuron subtypes, ensure orderly recruitment of functionally defined subtypes of spinal motoneurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Motoneuron subtypes diversify functionally during postnatal development</title><p>We used whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology to define the intrinsic properties that differentiate motoneuron subtypes and support orderly recruitment. We adopted an established electrophysiological approach to identify two motoneuron subtypes in vitro based on their repetitive firing profiles in response to the injection of a 5 s depolarizing square current pulse at rheobase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bhumbra and Beato, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Durand et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Leroy et al., 2015</xref>).

We identified delayed and immediate firing motoneurons at all ages studied (P1–20) with intrinsic properties that are consistent with those of fast and slow motoneurons, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Gardiner, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Gustafsson and Pinter, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Leroy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Martínez-Silva et al., 2018</xref>). Our measurements of intrinsic properties are in line with previous reports from mouse lumbar motoneurons at similar postnatal stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Leroy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Nakanishi and Whelan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Quinlan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Smith and Brownstone, 2020</xref>). Postnatal development in mice is highly stereotyped, with hindlimb weight-bearing emerging during the second postnatal week and complex locomotor behaviours emerging after the start of the third (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altman and Sudarshan, 1975</xref>). We therefore grouped motoneurons by week to explore broad changes in intrinsic properties of motoneuron subtypes between behaviourally defined milestones across motor development. Principal component analysis (PCA) was first deployed to identify global changes in intrinsic properties of motoneuron subtypes during development given the high dimensionality (25 variables) and large sample size (N = 261 motoneurons, 95 animals) of our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This allowed us to focus subsequent analyses on variables that covary across motoneuron type during postnatal development.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Delayed and immediate firing motoneurons exhibit intrinsic properties consistent with fast- and slow-type motoneurons, respectively.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were obtained from motoneurons identified in the ventrolateral horn of the lumbar spinal cord with a subset retrogradely labelled with Fluoro-Gold injected intraperitoneally.

Analysis of PC scores for PC1 revealed differential maturation in delayed and immediate firing motoneurons whereby PC1 scores increased in delayed but did not change in immediate firing motoneurons, with differences between delayed and immediate firing motoneurons revealed at weeks 2 and 3, but not week 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; F<sub>(2,187)</sub> = 14.1, p=2.1e-6).

PC2 scores were larger in slow motoneurons in week 1, decreasing in both subtypes, but to a greater extent in immediate firing motoneurons, such that PC2 scores were more negative in immediate compared to delayed firing motoneurons in week 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; F<sub>(2,228)</sub> = 8.6, p=2.5e-4).

Depolarizing sag potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>; F<sub>(6,103)</sub> = 28.4, p&lt;1.0e-15) and underlying Ih amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F and G</xref>; F<sub>(1,61)</sub> = 6.1, p=0.01) were larger in delayed compared to immediate firing motoneurons during week 3. Notably, we find a prominent Ih in delayed firing motoneurons at –70 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>; F<sub>(1,61)</sub> = 13.4, p=0.005), which is near the resting potential of delayed firing motoneurons (Ih –70 mV W3: –119 ± 103 pA; RMP W3: –66.8 ± 3.6 mV), and could also be blocked by ZD7288 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>; F<sub>(1,17)</sub> = 8.7, p=0.009).

This nonuniform modulation of rheobase currents across motoneuron subtypes led to a 50% reduction in the rheobase current range across the sample of motoneurons studied (BL: 3,227 pA; ZD7288: 1624 pA) and an increase in the recruitment gain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>).

We used postnatal development of the mouse as a model to dissect the relative importance of motoneuron intrinsic properties to the establishment of orderly recruitment during the emergence of fine motor control. The rate at which motoneurons within a motor pool are recruited is important because it defines the recruitment gain and influences the relative degree of precision or vigour of movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Cope and Pinter, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Kernell and Hultborn, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Nielsen et al., 2019</xref>).

This approach has been previously validated using the molecular markers chondrolectin and matrix metalloproteinase-9 for fast motoneurons, and estrogen-related receptor beta (ERRβ) for slow-type motoneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Enjin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Kaplan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Leroy et al., 2014</xref>). In line with the initial studies using this approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Leroy et al., 2014</xref>), we find that at similar ages (P7–14) delayed firing motoneurons have a lower input resistance, higher rheobase, more depolarized spike threshold, shorter action potentials, and shorter mAHPs compared to immediate firing motoneurons. Given the consistencies between the electrophysiological properties of motoneuron subtypes in our study and those previously reported and validated by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Leroy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Martínez-Silva et al., 2018</xref>), it is likely that the two subtypes that we studied represent fast and slow motoneurons. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that gamma motoneurons were included in our samples given the lack of clear physiological markers to identify this subtype. A table comparing motoneuron intrinsic properties across studies can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>.</p><p>Our results suggest that motoneuron recruitment is multifaceted, with multiple layers that establish orderly recruitment of functionally defined spinal motoneuron subtypes. The size principle forms a foundation with recruitment directed by physical properties of neurons. We find that the rheobase current is driven primarily by the physical properties of neurons during the first postnatal week, as would be predicted by the size principle, but rheobase is not linked to the functional subtypes of motoneurons. A steep recruitment gain within a motor pool, with no differentiation between the recruitment of motoneuron subtypes, may be important to facilitate the rapid, ballistic movements, which are typically observed in newborn mice prior to the onset of finer motor control. These findings are consistent with those in human babies where rapid movements are supported by synchronized recruitment of motor unit subtypes to accommodate for the slower and more homogenous muscle twitch properties at early postnatal stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Del Vecchio et al., 2020</xref>), which have also been reported in neonatal rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Close, 1964</xref>). Synchronized motoneuron recruitment may also support ongoing maturation of spinal circuits and neuromuscular junctions during early postnatal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hanson and Landmesser, 2004</xref>) when poly-neuronal innervation of muscle fibres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bennett et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Brown et al., 1976</xref>), in addition to gap junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Chang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Personius et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Walton and Navarrete, 1991</xref>) and glutamatergic coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bhumbra and Beato, 2018</xref>) between motoneurons, remains prevalent.</p><p>Rheobase currents of motoneuron subtypes become staggered during the second postnatal week, when finer motor control develops, such as hindlimb weight-bearing during stepping. This separation of rheobase coincided with the diversification of motoneuron subtypes as revealed by our PCA and is supported by previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Nakanishi and Whelan, 2010</xref>). A portion of this staggered rheobase current relates to differential maturation of passive properties, with delayed firing motoneurons increasing in size, as indexed by whole-cell capacitance, leading to a decrease in input resistance. This finding is in line with previous reports demonstrating increases in motoneuron physical size during the first two postnatal weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Carrascal et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Li et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Vinay et al., 2000b</xref>). However, previous work in adult cat motoneurons suggests that variation in cell size or input resistance cannot account for the full range of rheobase currents across a motor pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Fleshman et al., 1981</xref>). Similarly, work in rat oculomotor neurons has demonstrated changes in rheobase during development that are linked to maturation of spike threshold and not changes in input resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Carrascal et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that such observations are not species-specific. In addition to passive properties related to size, we found that active properties, determined by specific ion channels, differed between motoneuron subtypes and changed during development. This observation suggested that changes in active properties may also contribute to the rheobase separation of motoneuron subtypes from the second postnatal week onwards. These active properties produce nonlinearities in the input-output functions of motoneurons, based on distinct activation and inactivation properties of voltage-sensitive ion channels. The developmental emergence of a role for active properties in motoneuron recruitment may provide more flexible motor output than would be possible if recruitment was based on a fixed set of physical parameters such as motoneuron size. The integration of active properties may permit for more adaptable schemes of motoneuron recruitment as more complex motor behaviours emerge during later stages of postnatal development.</p><p>We first found that PICs differentially influence rheobase of motoneuron subtypes from the second postnatal week. PICs are well described in motoneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Heckman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Hounsgaard et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Hounsgaard and Kiehn, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Li and Bennett, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Quinlan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Schwindt and Crill, 1980</xref>) where they amplify synaptic inputs to distal dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Carlin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Carlin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Heckman et al., 2008</xref>) and are critical for the generation of repetitive firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bouhadfane et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Kuo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Miles et al., 2005</xref>). In some cases, PICs also produce plateau potentials and lead to bistability, which can sustain repetitive firing following the termination of excitatory synaptic input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Lee and Heckman, 1998b</xref>). We expected to find larger PICs in slow motoneurons given their lower rheobase currents and greater tendency for bistability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Lee and Heckman, 1998a</xref>), which is thought to be important for the maintenance of posture. However, we found that PIC amplitude was larger in delayed compared to immediate firing motoneurons, although when correcting for cell size we found no difference in PIC density between subtypes. Further analyses revealed a difference in the activation voltages of PICs across motoneuron subtypes, with PICs activating at more depolarized potentials in delayed firing motoneurons. These data support that variations in the activation voltage of PICs help drive differential recruitment across motoneuron subtypes. Our findings are also consistent with work in adult cats, which show that a more hyperpolarized PIC activation voltage in smaller motoneurons is a better predictor of bistability than PIC amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Lee and Heckman, 1998a</xref>). While we rarely observed bistability or self-sustained firing, it is possible that the population of immediate firing motoneurons in our study may be more prone to bistability in the presence of neuromodulation, such as is included in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Hounsgaard et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Hounsgaard and Kiehn, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Lee and Heckman, 1998a</xref>).</p><p>PICs are produced by a complement of ion channels that conduct sodium and calcium currents. Our pharmacological analysis demonstrated that Nav1.6 channels contribute to the PICs in both motoneuron subtypes, with an additional contribution of L-type calcium channels in delayed firing motoneurons. Although it is important to note that additional ion channels and their differential expression may contribute to the differences in properties of PICs in motoneuron subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bouhadfane et al., 2013</xref>). Notably, we find that blockade of Nav1.6 and L-type calcium channels only produced a combined 53% reduction in PIC amplitude in delayed firing motoneurons, and blockade of Nav1.6 produced a 60% reduction in PIC amplitude in immediate firing motoneurons. We found that Nav1.6, rather than L-type calcium channels, determines the PIC activation voltage and shapes rheobase of delayed firing motoneurons by controlling the voltage trajectory up to and including spike threshold. This is in line with previous experimental (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Kuo et al., 2006</xref>) and computational work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Zhang and Dai, 2020</xref>). Nav1.6 channels are well-placed to control rheobase, given their dense expression at the AIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Brocard et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Jørgensen et al., 2021</xref>), a specialized structure that is critical for the generation of action potentials and support of repetitive firing. Physical properties of the AIS may also contribute to differential recruitment of motoneuron subtypes, given that the AIS is further from the soma in fast compared to slow motoneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Rotterman et al., 2021</xref>). If so, one might predict that the distance between soma and AIS may increase in fast motoneurons during the first two postnatal weeks and contribute to functional specification of motoneuron subtypes.</p><p>Interestingly, while blocking Nav1.6 reduced the overall PIC amplitude and depolarized spike threshold in immediate firing motoneurons, it did not alter the onset voltage of the PIC or change their rheobase, which is supportive of PIC onset voltage being more important for shaping rheobase. One possibility is that PIC onset and rheobase in immediate firing motoneurons are controlled by other ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bouhadfane et al., 2013</xref>). However, roles for calcium PICs in shaping motoneuron recruitment cannot be excluded in either motoneuron subtype and may have been underestimated in our transverse slice preparations due to a loss of key neuromodulatory sources that increase calcium PICs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Conway et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Hounsgaard et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Hounsgaard and Kiehn, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Li et al., 2007</xref>), loss of dendrites in our slice preparations where L-type calcium channels are clustered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Carlin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Elbasiouny et al., 2005</xref>), and the nature of the approaches where recruitment was assessed; with current injected at the soma being more likely to activate Nav1.6 channels on the AIS before calcium channels of the dendrites.</p><p>Other channels, including Kv1.2 channels, which underlie the characteristic delayed firing behaviour of fast motoneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Leroy et al., 2015</xref>), are also clustered at the AIS and may dynamically interact with Nav1.6 channels to shape rheobase. We found delayed firing motoneurons at all ages studied; however, changes in the expression of the underlying Kv1.2 channels that produce this firing behaviour, and the compartmental distribution of these channels, may contribute to changes in recruitment of motoneuron subtypes. Furthermore, Nav1.6-conducting sodium PICs are opposed by outward-conducting M-type potassium currents mediated by Kv7 channels that are located on the AIS of excitatory spinal interneurons. Given that M-type currents can influence measurements of PICs in voltage-clamp mode and oppose the physiological roles of sodium PICs in the generation of locomotor rhythmogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Verneuil et al., 2020</xref>), they could also influence motoneuron recruitment. Thus, we cannot rule out potential roles for potassium channels in the differential maturation of motoneuron subtype recruitment, given that these conductances were not blocked in our study.</p><p>We found that rheobase of delayed firing motoneurons increased further from the third postnatal week, paralleling the emergence of more complex locomotor behaviours, similar to those seen in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altman and Sudarshan, 1975</xref>). However, this increase in delayed firing motoneuron rheobase could not be accounted for by changes in passive properties or PICs. Instead, we found subtype-specific changes in a hyperpolarization-activated inward current (Ih) that we hypothesized may contribute to this further refinement of delayed firing motoneuron rheobase. Ih is a nonspecific inward current conducted by HCN channels, which are located on the somata and proximal dendrites of larger motoneurons in the rodent spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Milligan et al., 2006</xref>). Although depolarizing sag potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Delestrée et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Gustafsson and Pinter, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ito and Oshima, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Kiehn et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Manuel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Meehan et al., 2010</xref>) and developmental changes in Ih have been reported previously in motoneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bayliss et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Russier et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Tsuzuki et al., 1995</xref>), the functional significance of these findings was unclear. We found a prominent increase in Ih density, measured at voltages near resting membrane potential (–70 mV), in delayed but not immediate firing motoneurons and evidence of a significant h-current measured at the resting potential of delayed firing motoneurons at week 3. Blocking HCN channels with ZD7288 or ivabradine led to a decrease in rheobase of delayed but not immediate firing motoneurons when depolarizing ramps were initiated from a membrane potential of –70 mV. A high conductance state produced by a significant h-current that is active at resting potential could diminish the influence of excitatory synaptic input and delay the recruitment of fast motoneurons by acting as a shunting conductance. Recruitment may be further delayed due to the progressive loss of inward h-current during depolarization of the membrane potential. Importantly, the resting membrane potential is dynamic, and the influence of Ih on fast motoneuron recruitment will become diminished at more depolarized potentials. However, motoneurons are also often hyperpolarized below –70 mV during periods of inhibition, with fast motoneurons receiving a higher density of inhibitory synaptic inputs compared to slow motoneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allodi et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, the differential weighting of synaptic and intrinsic properties may be a key feature that contributes to the differential recruitment of motoneuron subtypes.</p><p>In addition to decreasing the rheobase of delayed firing motoneurons, both ZD7288 and ivabradine also hyperpolarized the resting membrane potential of both motoneuron subtypes, albeit to a much smaller extent in immediate compared to delayed firing motoneurons. These data suggest that Ih may contribute to the resting membrane potential of both motoneuron subtypes. However, hyperpolarization of the resting potential of immediate firing motoneurons by the two HCN channel blockers was perhaps unexpected given that we found no detectable h-current at voltages near resting membrane potential in this motoneuron subtype. It is possible that other currents that oppose Ih may occlude its clear measurement in immediate firing motoneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Buskila et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Kjaerulff and Kiehn, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">MacLean et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Picton et al., 2018</xref>) and that the contribution of Ih is only revealed following application of ZD7288 or ivabradine. In support of this possibility, we observed a slow hyperpolarization of the membrane potential during negative current steps in both immediate firing motoneurons at baseline and in delayed firing motoneurons in the presence of ZD7288 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Alternatively, space clamp issues due to the large surface area and dendritic arbor of motoneurons may have led to the underestimation of h-currents. While it is expected that this error would have been greatest in the larger, delayed firing motoneurons, it is possible that this error might have been sufficient to mask the small but significant h-current in immediate firing motoneurons.</p><p>Overall, this further refinement of motoneuron subtype recruitment due to changes in Ih during the third postnatal week may not only support orderly recruitment but may also be important for decreasing the recruitment gain of the motoneuron pool to support complex motor behaviours that require a higher degree of precision compared to earlier developmental stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Schematic summarizing changes in the physical properties, recruitment, and underlying currents in motoneuron subtypes that shape the orderly recruitment and recruitment gain of motoneurons during postnatal development as complex locomotor behaviours emerge.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Illustrates the time course over which locomotor behaviours mature during the first three weeks of postnatal development (adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Jean-Xavier et al., 2018</xref>).

Motoneuron subtypes also differ in synaptic properties including the circuit of origin, synaptic weight, and neurotransmitter release dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Binder et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Gabriel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">McLean et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Song et al., 2020</xref>). For example, synaptic inputs originating from a variety of premotor sources may terminate on different motoneuron compartments that are associated with clusters of specific ion channels. Therefore, synapses that terminate on distal dendrites compared to more proximal loci, such as the proximal dendrites, soma, or AIS, may engage different voltage-sensitive ion channels leading to differential recruitment. It is likely that functionally specified motor pools may rely on varying degrees of synaptic and intrinsic properties to tune recruitment gain. Furthermore, differential control of intrinsic and synaptic properties of motoneuron subtypes by neuromodulators likely also adjusts recruitment gain within or across motor pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bertuzzi and Ampatzis, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Jha and Thirumalai, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Given the new roles that we show here for PICs and Ih in the differential control of motoneuron subtypes, it is possible that neuromodulation of these currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Conway et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Harvey et al., 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Hounsgaard et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Kjaerulff and Kiehn, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Revill et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Sirois and Bayliss, 2002</xref>), as descending sources of neuromodulators reach the lumbar spinal cord during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bregman, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Commissiong, 1983</xref>), may not only shape the emergence of orderly recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Pflieger et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Smith and Brownstone, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Vinay et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Vinay et al., 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Vinay et al., 2002</xref>), but also provide a means to dynamically modulate recruitment gain.</p><p>We set out to identify key intrinsic properties, and the underlying currents, that shape motoneuron rheobase and aimed to determine when these currents are integrated during postnatal development to establish recruitment order amongst motoneuron subtypes.

While passive properties linked to motoneuron size (i.e., capacitance, input resistance) do help to stagger the recruitment of fast and slow motoneurons, we also reveal a key role for active properties, produced by PICs and Ih, which are sequentially integrated during the first three weeks of postnatal development in parallel with the emergence of increasingly complex motor behaviours. Our work will inform future studies aimed toward understanding mechanisms that enable the balance of motor control to shift between the generation of vigorous movements versus precision movements, as is needed during development and when adapting to different motor tasks.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Experiments were performed on tissue obtained from 133 (male: n = 68; and female: n = 65) wild-type C57Bl/6J mice at postnatal days (P) 1–20.

The time constant was measured as the time it took to reach 2/3 of the peak voltage change. Capacitance was calculated by dividing the time constant by the input resistance (C = T/R). Resting membrane potential was measured 10 min after obtaining a whole-cell configuration and at the end of recordings from the MultiClamp Commander.</p><p>Rheobase and repetitive firing properties were assessed during slow (100 pA/s) depolarizing current ramps, which allowed us to measure the rheobase current and voltage threshold of the first action potential. Rheobase was also measured during long (5 s) depolarizing current steps that were used to determine the motoneuron firing type (delayed or immediate) and defined as the first current step to produce at least three action potentials. Recruitment gain was qualitatively illustrated by generating cumulative proportion histograms of recruitment current values across respective motoneuron samples at developmental time points or before and after drug application. The voltage threshold of the first action potential was defined as when the change in voltage reached 10 mV/ms. Firing rates were measured at rheobase, 2× rheobase, and derecruitment (maximum firing rate). As previously reported, motoneurons displayed sub-primary and primary regions of the FI relationship. Sub-primary range gain was measured from the slope of a linear function fitted to the initial section of the FI relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Jensen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Manuel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Meehan et al., 2010</xref>).

The onset of the active, exponential component of the membrane depolarization was defined as the point at which the membrane potential deviated by more than 1 mV from the linear function of the passive phase. The current and voltage values at the onset of the voltage acceleration were compared to the rheobase current and voltage threshold measured from the first action potential elicited on the depolarizing current ramp. A hypothetical ‘passive rheobase’ current was then estimated by extrapolating the line applied to the passive depolarizing phase and measuring its intersection with the voltage threshold of the first spike. The difference between this hypothetical passive rheobase current and the measured rheobase current was calculated to quantify the influence that active conductances (presumably PIC) have on recruitment.</p><p>The influence that PICs exert on motoneuron excitability was also estimated in current-clamp mode using the injection of a triangular, depolarizing current ramp with 5 s rise and fall times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Durand et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Leroy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Li and Bennett, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Steele et al., 2020</xref>).

The influence of PICs on motoneuron excitability was estimated by calculating the difference (Delta I) between the current at firing onset on the ascending component of the ramp and the current at derecruitment on the descending component of the ramp. A negative Delta I is suggestive of a PIC. Firing hysteresis was also assessed on the ascending and descending components of the ramp.

Presented are the acceleration onset voltage, acceleration amplitude, passive recruitment current estimated based on the initial linear trajectory of the membrane potential, actual measured recruitment current, and an estimate of the underlying persistent inward current (ePIC) that produces the membrane potential acceleration. Delta I reflects the difference in derecruitment and recruitment currents on triangular depolarizing current ramps and provides an additional estimate of PIC. PICs were measured in voltage clamp during weeks 2–3 with the onset voltage, peak voltage, current amplitude, and densities measured. Sag conductance was estimated during weeks 1–3 and underlying h current (Ih) measured with amplitude and density at –70 mV and –110 mV presented. Time constant (tau) of Ih. Statistics: data were analysed using two-factor ANOVA with MN type (delayed and immediate) and developmental week (weeks 1–3) as factors. Statistical analyses addressed three core questions: (1) Was there a difference between subtypes? (2) Did it change during development? (3) Do the subtypes mature differentially during development?

fundamental aspect of movement: motoneuron recruitment. The authors use spinal cord slices to provide a comprehensive analysis of motoneuron intrinsic properties, passive and active, that mature in the early postnatal period in mice and coincide with their differentiation into ‘slow’ and ‘fast’ phenotypes. They argue that these properties together shape motoneuron recruitment, suggesting that textbook views of orderly recruitment may be oversimplifications.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71385.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Brownstone</surname><given-names>Robert M</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>University College London</institution><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Brownstone</surname><given-names>Robert M</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution>University College London</institution><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Meehan</surname><given-names>Claire</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution>University of Copenhagen</institution><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.06.16.448644">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.16.448644v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 4 peer reviewers, including Rob Brownstone as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Huguenard as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Claire Meehan (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All four reviewers agree that this work is very well done and that an impressive amount of data has been presented. The work will be of interest to a broad range of neuroscientists, including those studying the neuroscience of movement and also those studying how populations of neurons with variable properties may be recruited in circuits. However, a few important points have been raised by the reviewers that should help the authors to revise their manuscript. As written, we are concerned about over-interpretation of the data.</p><p>1. Motoneuron typing. The authors relay on surrogate markers of motoneuron type – delayed vs immediate firing. They then use ramp currents (e.g. Figure 3A) rather than the established rectangular pulses to differentiate the two. But the slow ramp depolarisation used to measure rheobase may lead to inactivation of some currents. Furthermore, motoneuron types are based on the type of muscle fibre that motor neuron innervates, and this has not been directly established for the recorded motoneurons. Given the above, it would be prudent to primarily use the terms delayed and immediate firing rather than fast and slow until the Discussion.</p><p>2. The term &quot;recruitment&quot; is interesting. The authors are using intracellular current injection to study rheobase. The degree to which this reflects recruitment during behaviour or even via &quot;evenly&quot; spread inputs (such as Ia afferents) across the motor pool is not clear. For example, dendritic inputs may recruit active currents that are not as readily recruited during somatic current injection. While the findings have implications for considering recruitment, the focus on recruitment per se should be toned down as the relation is only possible, not definite. On this note, we would suggest that even the title be changed, e.g. to &quot;activation&quot; or &quot;activation properties,&quot; for example.</p><p>3. PICs. The authors suggest that recruitment of PICs is related to motoneuron recruitment, but the pharmacological experiments are reported in only delayed firing motoneurons. These experiments should be extended to immediate firing motoneurons.</p><p>4. There seem to be some discrepancies in the Ih data as outlined in the reviews. For example, the voltage clamp data do not show Ih above -70mV, yet ZD seems to have an effect at resting potential in current clamp experiments.

The work will be of interest to a broad range of neuroscientists, including those studying the neuroscience of movement and also those studying how populations of neurons with variable properties may be recruited in circuits. However, a few important points have been raised by the reviewers that should help the authors to revise their manuscript. As written, we are concerned about over-interpretation of the data.</p><p>1. Motoneuron typing. The authors relay on surrogate markers of motoneuron type – delayed vs immediate firing. They then use ramp currents (e.g. Figure 3A) rather than the established rectangular pulses to differentiate the two. But the slow ramp depolarisation used to measure rheobase may lead to inactivation of some currents. Furthermore, motoneuron types are based on the type of muscle fibre that motor neuron innervates, and this has not been directly established for the recorded motoneurons. Given the above, it would be prudent to primarily use the terms delayed and immediate firing rather than fast and slow until the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed all reference to fast and slow motoneurons within the methods and Results sections to delayed and immediate firing motoneurons and included a section in our discussion highlighting the merits of this approach and linking these surrogate electrophysiological markers to those of different motor unit types in the second paragraph of the discussion (Page 16 Line 516-528).</p><p>Perhaps we were not fully clear in our description of protocols used to identify motoneuron subtype and those used to measure rheobase. Motoneuron subtype was always determined using the established 5 second square depolarizing current steps. Depolarizing current ramps were only used to measure rheobase and not to identify motoneuron subtypes.</p><p>We used slow depolarizing current ramps to determine rheobase and spike threshold, for two reasons. First, the continuous nature of the ramp provides a high degree of resolution to measure rheobase, whereas traditional square steps are limited to the current intervals deployed by the experimenter, which for studies of motoneurons are often 50-100 pA apart. Second, we also chose to use current ramps to resemble those used to study recruitment of human motor units, where recruitment and rate coding of motor units have been extensively studied during ramp-stype muscle contraction paradigms (for examples, see Deluca et al., 1981; Oya et al., 2009; Del Vecchio et al., 2019). Indeed, as highlighted by the reviewers, voltage responses to square and ramp current injections likely involve disparate conductances due to temporal and voltage inactivation (or activation) properties of the ion channels involved, which could lead to differences in measured rheobase between protocols or across development. This is an interesting point, and likely speaks to the task dependence of motoneuron and motor unit recruitment. We agree that the cellular mechanisms that underlie task-dependence of recruitment is an interesting and exciting direction for future study.</p><p>We have now included additional analysis on rheobase currents during the 5s square depolarizing current step to supplement our data using the slow depolarizing ramp currents. Interestingly, and consistent with that reported by Leroy et al., (2014), the rheobase assessed on depolarizing ramps and that assessed with a 5 second square step to determine motoneuron subtype are strongly correlated at all ages studied (W1: r = 0.87 p &lt; 1.0 e-15; W2: r = 0.95 p &lt; 1.0 e-15; W3: r = 0.92 p &lt; 1.0 e-15). Further, similar developmental changes in the rheobase of subtypes were found when assessed with a current step as those found with depolarizing current ramps. We have included these data as an additional Supplementary Figure (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1) and this result included in the Results section on Page 6, Line 173-178.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The term &quot;recruitment&quot; is interesting. The authors are using intracellular current injection to study rheobase. The degree to which this reflects recruitment during behaviour or even via &quot;evenly&quot; spread inputs (such as Ia afferents) across the motor pool is not clear. For example, dendritic inputs may recruit active currents that are not as readily recruited during somatic current injection. While the findings have implications for considering recruitment, the focus on recruitment per se should be toned down as the relation is only possible, not definite. On this note, we would suggest that even the title be changed, e.g. to &quot;activation&quot; or &quot;activation properties,&quot; for example.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed all references to recruitment within our methods and results to ‘rheobase’. We have also changed the title to ‘activation properties’ and included a section in our introduction (Line 68), results (Line 173-176) and discussion (Line 501) to better define the link between our measures of rheobase/activation current and reference to recruitment. Limitations on activation of motoneurons through somatic injection of current compared to more physiological activation are further discussed, with particular reference to potential roles for calcium PIC mediated by dendritic calcium channels. This discussion can be found on Page 19, Lines 620-626.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. PICs. The authors suggest that recruitment of PICs is related to motoneuron recruitment, but the pharmacological experiments are reported in only delayed firing motoneurons. These experiments should be extended to immediate firing motoneurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We initially focused on the roles of PICs in shaping recruitment of delayed firing motoneurons during weeks 2 and 3 because we were trying to account for changes in rheobase that occur within delayed firing motoneurons during this period of postnatal development. However, our results cannot rule out a role for PICs in shaping immediate firing motoneuron rheobase as well. As suggested, we have therefore now performed an additional series of experiments with NaV1.6 and L-type calcium channel blockers on immediate firing motoneurons. These new data have been integrated into Figure 4 (Page 9, Lines 295-318), and results discussed (Page 19, Lines 616-620).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. There seem to be some discrepancies in the Ih data as outlined in the reviews. For example, the voltage clamp data do not show Ih above -70mV, yet ZD seems to have an effect at resting potential in current clamp experiments. If Ih is not active at rest, how does it contribute to rheobase/recruitment? These points should be clarified, possibly through additional data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their careful assessment of these data. Our measurements of Ih in voltage clamp were initiated from holding potential of -60 mV, with the first step coming down to -70 mV. We have revised Figure 5 to better highlight the magnitude of the h-currents that we measured at -70 mV, which may have not been fully realized in the previous version of the figure that presented currents from the full IV that measured Ih at voltages ranging from -70 mV to -110 mV, with Ih increasing almost 10-fold when comparing currents measured at -70 mV and those measured at -110 mV. However, we recognize the resting potential of many of the neurons we studied is slightly more depolarized than -70 mV, and this was a key gap in our measurement of Ih. To address this issue, we have performed an additional set of recordings in delayed (n = 13) and immediate (n = 11) firing motoneurons from animals during week 3, taking measurements of Ih from a holding potential of -50 mV, stepping down to the respective resting membrane potential for each motoneuron studied. In line with previous measurements of Ih at -70 mV, we find a prominent Ih measured at resting potential in delayed but not immediate firing motoneurons. These data have been included in the Results section on Page 13, Line 429-437.</p><p>As pointed out by Reviewer 4, it is interesting that blocking HCN channels led to a hyperpolarization of the resting potential of the immediate firing motoneurons, even though we did not detect a measurable Ih at voltages near resting potential in this subtype. We have performed an additional set of experiments with a second blocker of HCN channels (Ivabradine), which also produced a hyperpolarization of the RMP in both delayed and immediate firing motoneurons. Given that there are many currents that oppose Ih and its effects on membrane potential (eg. Kjaerulff and Kiehn, 2001; MacLean et al., 2003; 2005; Picton et al., 2018; Buskila et al., 2019), it is possible that these opposing currents might have masked a small, albeit significant, Ih in immediate firing motoneurons that was revealed following blockade of HCN channels with ZD7288 or ivabradine. In support of this notion, we also find a slow hyperpolarization of the membrane potential during negative current steps in immediate firing motoneurons at baseline and in delayed firing motoneurons in the presence of ZD7288. A trace illustrating this feature has been included in the revised Figure 6 and highlighted in the discussion on Page 20, Lines 673-675.</p><p>Alternatively, it is possible that space clamp issues, due to the large surface area, and extensive dendritic tree of motoneurons, may have led to an underestimate of the true magnitude of Ih currents measured in voltage clamp. While it is expected that this error might have been greatest in the larger, delayed firing motoneurons, it is possible that these Ih currents were sufficiently large in delayed firing motoneurons to be detected, whereas in the immediate firing motoneurons it was not. We have highlighted these caveats and possibilities in our discussion and can be found on Lines 675-679.</p><p>We have also expanded our discussion to highlight potential roles for Ih in shaping recruitment of delayed firing motoneurons during periods of inhibition, such as during rhythmic activity, where the membrane potential often dips below -70 mV. Fast fatigable (MMP9+) motoneurons have been shown to receive a greater density of inhibitory synaptic inputs, particularly those derived from V1 interneurons, compared to slow (ERRB+) motoneurons (Allodi et al., 2021), and this differential synaptic weighting may create greater opportunity for Ih to be engaged and contribute to staggering recruitment as our pharmacology data suggests. This discussion can be found on Lines 657-663.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– Significant digits are generally good, but should be checked: e.g. 14.02% on p.3.</p></disp-quote><p>Significant digits have been checked and corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– ePIC abbreviation – why the abbreviation, which is also unclear?</p></disp-quote><p>ePIC corresponds to estimated PIC, a phrase that is commonly used by those studying roles of PICs in the control of human motor units.

Furthermore, as the reviewer points out, one could only target muscles that are primarily composed of fast or slow twitch fibres, precluding the definitive identification of either motoneuron subtype. As recommended in earlier reviewer comments, we have now toned down our definition of motoneuron subtypes to refer to delayed and immediate firing motoneurons, rather than fast and slow motoneurons. We have also included more discussion regarding the previously established relationship between delayed and immediate firing and putative fast and slow motoneuron subtypes (Page 16 Lines 516-528). In addition, we have included a supplementary table (Supplementary File 3) to highlight the similarities in intrinsic properties of the motoneurons included in our study with those reported in previous studies that have utilised molecular makers for fast and slow motoneurons (MMP9, Chondrolectin, and ERRB).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Considering that PICs are sensitive to neuromodulators, is there any possibility that the lack of neuromodulators in your patch-clamp experiments could account for the differences in PICs between the cell types that you observed?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point; differential neuromodulation of PICs could represent an important additional factor that differentiates motoneuron subtypes. We have now acknowledged this limitation in our discussion on roles for PICs in motoneuron recruitment. A discussion of such caveats can be found on Page 19, Line 620-626.
