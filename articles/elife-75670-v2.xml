How the C1/C2 dimorphism affects T cell recognition is unknown. Using HLA-C allotypes that differ only by the C1/C2-defining residues, we found that KRAS-G12D neoantigen-specific T cell receptors (TCRs) discriminated between C1 and C2 presenting the same KRAS-G12D peptides. Structural and functional experiments, and immunopeptidomics analysis revealed that Ser77 in C1 and Asn77 in C2 influence amino acid preference near the peptide C-terminus (pΩ), including the pΩ-1 position, in which C1 favors small and C2 prefers large residues. This resulted in weaker TCR affinity for KRAS-G12D-bound C2-HLA-C despite conserved TCR contacts. Thus, the C1/C2 dimorphism on its own impacts peptide presentation and HLA-C-restricted T cell responses, with implications in disease, including adoptive T cell therapy targeting KRAS-G12D-induced cancers.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>HLA-C</kwd><kwd>TCR</kwd><kwd>KRAS-G12D</kwd><kwd>C1/C2</kwd><kwd>neoantigen</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NIAID Division of Intramural Research Funding</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI000697</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Peter D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NIAID Division of Intramural Research Funding</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI000525</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Long</surname><given-names>Eric O</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Peter D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006224</institution-id><institution>Argonne National Laboratory</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Long</surname><given-names>Eric O</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An amino acid dimorphism in HLA-C with an established impact on natural killer cell receptors plays an unexpected and significant role in T cell receptor recognition of HLA-C with relevance for tumor immunity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The classical class I human leukocyte antigens (HLA-I; HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C) are the most polymorphic genes across human populations and are associated with a myriad of human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dendrou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Robinson et al., 2017</xref>). HLA-I molecules present short peptides on the cell surface of nucleated cells where they form ligands for receptors of the immune system including T cell receptors (TCRs) and natural killer (NK) cell receptors. HLA-I-bound peptides are collectively known as the immunopeptidome, which defines the subset of the proteome bound as peptides to a particular HLA-I allotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Istrail et al., 2004</xref>). Immunopeptidomes can be highly diverse, consisting of hundreds to thousands of different sequences as they are shaped by polymorphic amino acid residues that form pockets (A to F) in the HLA-I peptide-binding groove (PBG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Di Marco et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Madden, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sarkizova et al., 2020</xref>). These pockets restrict the peptide repertoire to those peptides with certain amino acid side chains at particular positions, which form anchor residues that define allotype-specific motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Di Marco et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Falk et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sarkizova et al., 2020</xref>). The ‘anchor’ residues are often position 2 (p2) or p3 (B and C pockets) and the C-terminus (pΩ; F pocket), while residues outside the anchors can vary extensively allowing immunopeptidome diversification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Di Marco et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Falk et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Madden, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sarkizova et al., 2020</xref>). HLA-I allotypes with similar PBGs bind similar peptides, but subtle amino acid differences can modify the side-chain orientation impacting interactions with TCRs and NK cell receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Illing et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Illing et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Saunders et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stewart-Jones et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tynan et al., 2005</xref>). Understanding how HLA-I polymorphism impacts the immunopeptidome and interactions with immunoreceptors is critical for constructing molecular mechanisms that underpin disease risk associated with specific HLA-I alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dendrou et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>HLA-C is thought to play a lesser role in T cell responses compared to that of HLA-A and HLA-B due to its lower cell surface expression level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Apps et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McCutcheon et al., 1995</xref>). However, HLA-C-restricted T cells are implicated in several disease settings. In HIV infection, HLA-C allotypes with a high expression were associated with increased T cell responses and slower progression to AIDS, while higher HLA-C expression was also linked with susceptibility to Crohn’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Apps et al., 2013</xref>). In psoriasis, the strongest genetic association is with <italic>HLA-C*06:02</italic>, thought to be mediated by HLA-C*06:02-restricted T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen and Tsai, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lande et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, recent efforts to define the specificities of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) readily identified HLA-C-restricted T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Murata et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tran et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tran et al., 2016</xref>). Most notably, multiple HLA-C*08:02-restricted TCRs specific for the oncogenic hotspot mutation KRAS-G12D were identified in several cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tran et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tran et al., 2016</xref>). Adoptive transfer of expanded KRAS-G12D-specific TILs successfully treated a patient with metastatic colorectal cancer, leading to complete regression of all but one metastatic lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tran et al., 2016</xref>). The remaining lesion lost <italic>HLA-C*08:02</italic> from its genome demonstrating conclusively that HLA-C-restricted T cells can mediate effective antitumor responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tran et al., 2016</xref>). Despite the clinical relevance of HLA-C-restricted T cells, few studies have examined TCR-HLA-C interactions with a molecular and structural focus. Indeed, our recent study on HLA-C*08:02-restricted KRAS-G12D-specific TCRs was the first to present crystal structures of any TCR in complex with HLA-C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sim et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p><italic>HLA-C</italic> is the most recently evolved classical HLA-I gene, present in only humans and other apes, and has several unique features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Parham, 2001</xref>). HLA-C, not HLA-A or HLA-B, is expressed on fetal extravillous trophoblast cells, making it the most polymorphic molecule expressed at the maternal–fetal interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">King et al., 2000</xref>). In addition, all HLA-C allotypes serve as ligands for the killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR), whereas only a subset of HLA-A and HLA-B allotypes bind KIRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hilton and Parham, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moesta et al., 2008</xref>). The KIR are a family of activating and inhibitory receptors expressed primarily on NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hilton and Parham, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Saunders et al., 2015</xref>). HLA-C allotypes form two groups, C1 and C2, based on two dimorphic amino acid residues at positions 77 and 80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Biassoni et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Parham et al., 2012</xref>). C1 HLA-C allotypes carry Ser77 and Asn80 and are ligands for the inhibitory receptors KIR2DL2/3. The inhibitory receptor KIR2DL1 binds C2 HLA-C allotypes, which carry Asn77 and Lys80. The KIR discriminate C1 and C2 HLA-C largely via position 44 in the KIR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Winter and Long, 1997</xref>) and direct interactions with HLA-C position 80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boyington et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boyington and Sun, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fan et al., 2001</xref>). Genetic association studies link C1/C2 status and the presence or absence of specific KIR-HLA combinations with risk of multiple human diseases, including cancer, infectious diseases, autoimmunity, and disorders of pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hiby et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khakoo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kulkarni et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Littera et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Parham and Moffett, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rajagopalan and Long, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Venstrom et al., 2012</xref>). Whether the C1/C2 dimorphism impacts HLA-C interactions with other immunoreceptors is unknown.</p><p>Given the clinical relevance of HLA-C-restricted T cells and that all HLA-C allotypes are either C1 or C2, it is important to ask whether this dimorphism impacts T cell recognition. It was hitherto assumed that the C1/C2 dimorphism would not directly affect T cell recognition as it lies outside the general TCR footprint. To answer this question, we studied two HLA-C*08:02 (C1)-restricted TCRs specific for different KRAS-G12D neoantigens. TCR9a is specific for G12D-9mer (GA<bold>D</bold>GVGKSA), while TCR10 is specific for G12D-10mer (GA<bold>D</bold>GVGKSAL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sim et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tran et al., 2016</xref>). TCR9a and TCR10 do not share TCR V genes and recognize their peptide antigens in different ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sim et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tran et al., 2016</xref>). We compared TCR9a and TCR10 recognition of HLA-C*08:02 (C1) with that of HLA-C*05:01, a C2 allotype that is identical in sequence to HLA-C*08:02 apart from the C1/C2 defining residues at positions 77 and 80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sim et al., 2017</xref>). In a previous study, we showed that 28 different ‘self’ peptides eluted from HLA-C*05:01 bound to both HLA-C*05:01 (C2) and HLA-C*08:02 (C1), suggesting a minimal impact of the C1/C2 dimorphism on peptide binding to HLA-C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sim et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we found that T cells discriminate between C1 and C2 HLA-C due to differences in peptide binding to HLA-C and in peptide presentation to TCR, which revealed unsuspected features of the C1/C2 dimorphism governing interactions of HLA-C with immunoreceptors. Further, our data suggest that HLA-C*05:01-positive individuals may be eligible for immunotherapies targeting KRAS-G12D-10mer.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Impact of the C1/C2 dimorphism to T cell recognition of KRAS neoantigens</title><p>HLA-C*05:01 (C*05) and HLA-C*08:02 (C*08) differ only by the C1/C2 dimorphism defined by positions 77 and 80, which are located on the α1 helix, near the peptide C-terminal amino acid (pΩ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). We expressed C*08 and C*05 to similar levels in 721.221 cells, which are otherwise deficient in classical HLA-I, HLA-A, -B and -C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These cells displayed canonical dimorphic recognition by KIR, with KIR2DL2/3 demonstrating strong binding to C*08, and KIR2DL1 demonstrating exclusive binding to C*05 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We next used these cells as targets in functional experiments with Jurkat-T cells expressing C*08-restricted KRAS-G12D-specific TCRs, TCR9a, or TCR10. As expected, both the 9mer and 10mer G12D but not their WT KRAS peptides activated their respective TCR9a and TCR10 expressing T cells in the presence of C*08 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sim et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, we observed no activation of TCR9a and only weak activation of TCR10 when the 9mer and 10mer G12D KRAS peptides were presented by C*05, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). To confirm this was not due to inefficient peptide loading, we utilized C*08 and C*05-expressing cell lines deficient in transporter associated with antigen presentation (TAP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These experiments yielded similar results using a different functional readout (expression of CD69), as G12D-9mer loaded on C*05 did not activate Jurkat-TCR9a cells, while G12D-10mer loaded on C*05 did stimulate Jurkat-TCR10 cells but required higher peptide concentrations than when loaded on C*08 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Thus, the HLA-C1/C2 dimorphism impacts T cell recognition of KRAS-G12D neoantigen even though neither residue 77 nor 80 is in contact with the TCR. We next explored if the differences in T cell recognition of C*08 and C*05 were due to differences in the binding of peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) or TCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) to HLA-C.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>HLA-C C1/C2 dimorphism impacts T cell recognition of KRAS-G12D neoantigen.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sequence of C1/C2 dimorphism in HLA-C*08:02 and HLA-C*05:01 at positions 77 and 80.

Similar to C*08, C*05 was not stabilized by WT-KRAS peptides likely due to the absence of Asp/Glu at p3, a critical anchor for C*08 and C*05 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). However, G12D-9mer only stabilized C*08 and not C*05, while G12D-10mer stabilized both allotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). An unusual feature of the G12D-9mer was pΩ Ala as its short side chain does not fill the pΩ pocket (F pocket), in contrast to G12D-10mer with pΩ Leu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sim et al., 2020</xref>). We previously demonstrated that substitution of pΩ Ala to Leu in G12D-9mer (A18L-9mer: <sup>10</sup>GA<bold>D</bold>GVGKS<bold>L</bold>) improved binding to HLA-C*08:02, and T cell recognition by Jurkat-TCR9a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sim et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, A18L-9mer bound C*05 well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>) and stimulated Jurkat-TCR9a cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Thus, the inability of G12D-9mer to bind C*05 accounts for its lack of activation of Jurkat-TCR9a cells. Further, these data suggest that the C1/C2 dimorphism selectively impacts peptide binding to HLA-C in a sequence-dependent manner.</p><p>To explore if pΩ Ala is a general feature of peptides that bind C1 allotypes (like C*08) and not C2 allotypes (like C*05), we examined C-terminal amino acid usage in the immunopeptidomes of HLA-C allotypes using two publicly available datasets (see Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Di Marco et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sarkizova et al., 2020</xref>). We initially analyzed both datasets independently and observed similar amino acid frequencies, thus we present a combined analysis of a merged dataset with duplicate sequences removed. However, we cannot rule out that differences in cell line origin, data acquisition, false discovery rates, or analytical pipelines may have influenced our analysis. In addition, our analysis was limited to that of amino acid frequency and did not incorporate peptide abundance. We first compared the immunopeptidomes of C*08 and C*05 as the residues that form the pΩ binding pocket of C*08 and C*05 are identical and accordingly the five most abundant pΩ residues (Leu, Val, Ile, Phe, and Met) were the same in both allotypes, accounting for 97% of C*08% and 98% of C*05 sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Leucine was the most common pΩ in both allotypes but had a higher frequency in C*08 peptides than C*05 (C*08 = 73%, C*05 = 37%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The significance of this difference is unknown; however, peptides with pΩ Leu, Val, Ile, Phe, and Met bind well to both C*08 and C*05 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sim et al., 2017</xref>). Among 9mer peptides, the frequency of Ala at pΩ position was 1.5% (30 out of 1986) in C*08, significantly higher (p=0.0016 Fisher’s exact test) than that of 0.13% (1 out of 732) in C*05-bound peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Similar results were observed for 10mers, where pΩ Ala was more common among C*08 peptides (5/349, 1.4%) than C*05 peptides (0/152, 0%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We next analyzed the pΩ amino acid frequency amongst 9mer sequences eluted from 14 C1 allotypes and 7 C2 allotypes and looked for amino acids with the greatest difference in frequency between C1 and C2 eluted peptides. In concordance with the comparison of C*05 and C*08 immunopeptidomes, pΩ Ala was the one most enriched in C1 allotypes, with a frequency of 1.45% ± 1.4% in C1 allotypes compared to 0.27% ± 0.19% in C2 allotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>). In addition, Gln and Ser were significantly enriched at pΩ of C1 allotypes, but at lower frequencies than Ala. Thus, C1 allotypes bind peptides with pΩ Ala to a greater extent than C2 allotypes, consistent with the ability of G12D-9mer to bind C*08 and not C*05.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Impact of C1/C2 dimorphism on TCR binding to HLA-C</title><p>We next explored the impact of the C1/C2 dimorphism on TCR binding to HLA-C using recombinant HLA-C refolded with individual peptides. The solution-binding affinities of the two neoantigen-specific TCRs, TCR9a and TCR10, to their cognate peptides presented by C*08 or C*05 were determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) using recombinant TCRs as analytes. As G12D-9mer with pΩ Ala does not bind C*05 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), we chose the Leu anchor variant A18L-9mer as the peptide for C*05 to ensure HLA-C stability. While TCR9a bound to the C1 allotype HLA-C*08 in the presence of G12D-9mer peptide with 16 nM affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sim et al., 2020</xref>), it displayed a binding affinity of 108 nM for the C2 allotype HLA-C*05 in the presence of Leu anchor variant of G12D-9mer, an approximately sevenfold affinity reduction compared to the C1 allotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Consistent with their solution-binding affinities, the C*08-G12D-9mer tetramers bound TCR9a-expressing Jurkat cells with lower EC<sub>50</sub> than C*05-A18L-9mer tetramers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). This reduced binding affinity and avidity may explain the reduced sensitivity of Jurkat-TCR9a cells for A18L-9mer loaded on C*05 compared to C*08 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In solution, TCR10 bound both the C1 and C2 allotypes with similar μM affinities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref>), though slightly weaker affinity was observed with C*05. By steady-state kinetics, TCR10 binding was less than twofold weaker to C*05:01-G12D-10mer (K<sub>D</sub> = 13 ± 6 μM) than C*08:02-G12D-10mer (K<sub>D</sub> = 8 ± 5 μM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). However, by kinetic analysis of the binding curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), TCR10 had almost 20-fold slower on rate with C*05:01-G12D-10mer (K<sub>on</sub> = 6.2 ± 1.2 × 10<sup>3</sup> M<sup>–1</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>) than with C*08:02-G12D-10mer (K<sub>on</sub> = 1.2 ± 0.9 × 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>–1</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>). Consistently, C*08-G12D-10mer exhibited better binding to TCR10-expressing Jurkat T cells than C*05-G12D-10mer, which failed to reach binding saturation at the highest concentration of tetramer tested (40 μg/ml) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). Thus, both TCR9a and TCR10 exhibited better binding to the C1 allotype than C2.</p><p>Neither TCR9a nor TCR10 make direct contacts to HLA-C positions Ser 77 and Asn 80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sim et al., 2020</xref>). To understand the impact of C2 residues Asn 77 and Lys 80 on T cell recognition, we determined the crystal structure of TCR9a in complex with C*05-A18L-9mer to a high resolution of 1.9 Å (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). TCR9a adopted the same binding mode when in complex with C*05, as in the C*08 complex structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). TCR9a recognition of C*05-A18L-9mer was via CDR3α Q98 that forms hydrogen (h) bonds with Arg 156 and Gln 155 of HLA-C and the peptide backbone of peptide p5 Val (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). TCR9a CDR2β Tyr48 and Glu49 coordinated peptide p7 Lys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), while CDR3β of TCR9a E95 formed a salt bridge with C*05 Arg 69 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). All these contacts observed between TCR9a and the C2 HLA-C*05 are conserved in the structure of TCR9a complexed with C*08 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Like the C1 HLA-C*08, the dimorphic residues 77 and 80 on the C2 HLA-C*05 also do not interact with TCR9a. The closest TCR residue to HLA-C position 77 or 80 is Glu 49 of the TCRβ chain that interacts with Lys p7 of the peptide but is greater than 7 Å away from HLA-C position 80. Docking TCR10 onto a structure of C*05:01-G12D-10mer using our TCR10-C*08:02-G12D-10mer complex revealed no obvious impact on TCR contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sim et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting the dimorphic positions on C*05 do not directly contact TCR.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Minimal impact of C1/C2 dimorphism on TCR:HLA-C complex structure.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Side view of TCR9a in complex with HLA-C*05:01-G12D-A18L (left) and HLA-C*08:02-G12D-9mer (right<italic>;</italic> PDB:6ULR).

The position 77 side chain is orientated directly into the PBG, while position 80 sits atop the α1-helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Position 77 is Ser in C*08 (C1) and Asn in C*05 (C2) and both form an h-bond of the same distance with the amide of the terminal peptide bond between pΩ and p8 (pΩ-1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Comparing the structures of C*05 and C*08, the HLA-C α<sub>1</sub>-helices were displaced relative to each other and peptide p8 was higher out of the PBG in C*05 compared to C*08 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref>). This displacement was measured by comparing the distance between the Cα of peptide p8 (Ser) with that of the Cβ of HLA-C position 77 (the first carbon of the position 77 side chain). This distance was 4.7 Å and 5.7 Å in the C*08 and C*05 structures, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>). We next examined the same distance in 10 additional published HLA-C structures, 4 C1 (HLA-C*03:04, PDB:1EFX, HLA-C*07:02, PDB:5VGE, HLA-C*08:01, PDB:4NT6, HLA-C*08:02-G12D-10mer, PDB: 6ULK) and 6 C2 (HLA-C*04:01, PDB:1QQD, HLA-C*05:01-G12D-10mer, PDB: 6JTO, HLA-C*05:01, PDB: 5VGD, HLA-C*06:02, PDB:5W6A, 5W69, 5W67). We observed that the difference between the Cα of peptide p8 and HLA-C 77 Cβ was maintained between C1 and C2 HLA-C structures (C1 = 4.6 ± 0.11 Å, C2 = 5.7 ± 0.22 Å) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). In contrast, a conserved contact with the peptide N terminus and Tyr171 Oγ was the same between C1 and C2 HLA-C structures (2.70 Å vs. 2.76 Å) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F and G</xref>). A consequence of this displacement is the proximity of the p8 side chain to the HLA-C α<sub>1</sub> helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). We compared the distance between the p8 side chain and HLA-C Val 76 in the 10 HLA-C structures. In all five C1 allotype structures, the p8 side chain was within van der Waals range of Val 76 (3.3–4.0 Å). In contrast, the p8 side chain was out of contact range with Val 76 in all but one C2 HLA-C structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H and I</xref>). This appears to be due in part to the torsion angle of the terminal peptide bond that orientates p8 towards the α<sub>1</sub> helix in C1 allotypes and out of the groove in C2 allotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). Thus, the C1/C2 dimorphism impacts the position and orientation of the peptide at pΩ-1, suggesting that position 77 is the major determinant of the difference between C*05 and C*08. To interrogate the role of positions 77 and 80 individually, each one was substituted in C*05 with the corresponding residue in C*08 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Cells expressing C*05, C*05 Asn77Ser (N77S), C*05 Lys80Asn (K80N), and C*08 loaded with G12D-9mer or G12D-10mer were used as targets for Jurkat-TCR9a and Jurkat-TCR10 cells, respectively. The lack of stimulation of Jurkat-TCR9a by C*05 was minimally impacted by C*05-K80N, while C*05-N77S recovered Jurkat-TCR9a responses, though not completely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>). In contrast, stimulation of Jurkat-TCR10 cells by HLA-C*05:01 was not improved by single substitutions at positions 77 and 80, suggesting a synergistic effect of positions 77 and 80 on recognition of HLA-C*08:02 by TCR10.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>C1/C2 dimorphism determines the distance between peptide p8 and HLA-C.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Hydrogen bond between HLA-C position 77 and amide in terminal peptide bond in C*08:02-G12D-9mer and C*05:01-A18L-9mer structures.

The C1/C2 dimorphism in HLA-C plays a critical role in innate immunity by forming ligands for the NK cell receptors KIR2DL1 and KIR2DL2/3. By comparing T cell recognition of two HLA-C allotypes identical in sequence except for the C1/C2 dimorphism, we assessed how this dimorphism affects adaptive immunity. We examined two clinically relevant, HLA-C*08:02 restricted neoantigens, G12D-9mer and G12D-10mer derived from the oncogenic hotspot mutation KRAS-G12D. We reject the null hypothesis that the C1/C2 dimorphism exhibits no effect on T cell recognition as C*05 was a poor ligand for TCR9a+ and TCR10+ T cells. Our study identified a clear and underestimated role for the C1/C2 dimorphism on peptide binding to HLA-C; specifically, as G12D-9mer bound only C*08 and not C*05. Further, we found that the C1/C2 dimorphism shapes the HLA-C immunopeptidome, exerting a size preference at pΩ-1 with C1 allotypes favoring smaller residues. Additionally, we identified an impact of the C1/C2 dimorphism on TCR binding as TCR9a and TCR10 binding to C*05 was weaker than binding to C*08 in the presence of the same peptides.</p><p>By investigating the exclusive restriction of TCR9a to C*08, we uncovered a novel role for the C1/C2 dimorphism in peptide presentation. Specifically, the C1/C2 dimorphism defines two distinct PBG structures that impose size constraints at pΩ-1 and allow C1 but not C2 allotypes to bind peptides with shorter pΩ anchors, like Ala in G12D-9mer. The primary cause of these distinct PBGs is likely the size of position 77, which forms a conserved h-bond with the amide of pΩ in both C1 and C2 HLA-C. As Asn (C2) is larger than Ser (C1), it results in peptide pΩ-1 protruding out of the groove, thus permitting larger amino acids at pΩ-1 in C2 allotypes compared to C1. In C1, pΩ-1 sits lower in the groove, restricting pΩ-1 side chains to smaller residues to avoid clashing with HLA-C position Val 76. Consistently, substitutions at p8 in G12D-9mer to the larger Leu, Lys, or Arg substantially reduced C1 recognition by TCR9a, while substitution to Gly had only a minor decrease. Further, the penalty imposed for large residues at p8 was diminished with A18L-9mer, suggesting a canonical pΩ anchor can accommodate unfavorable p8 residues, likely via orientating p8 side chain out of the groove like peptides in C2 allotypes. In C1 allotypes, the additional contacts between Val 76 and p8 may explain the ability of C*08:02 to bind peptides with short, suboptimal pΩ anchors. In contrast, pΩ-1 in C2, which is higher in the PBG and orientated away from the α1 helix, is unable to contact Val 76 and therefore cannot support peptides with pΩ Ala. Consistently, substitution of Asn 77 to Ser in C*05 substantially recovered TCR9a recognition of G12D-9mer.</p><p>In addition to peptide binding to HLA-C, TCR-binding affinity and T cell sensitivity were reduced in the presence of C2 residues. Neither N77S or K80N substitutions improved the sensitivity of TCR10 for C*05 and G12D-10mer, suggesting a synergistic effect of the C2 residues on reducing TCR recognition. TCR10 displayed a much slower on rate in binding C*05-G12D-10mer and even after controlling for a poor pΩ anchor, TCR9a was more sensitive to A18L-9mer with C*08 than C*05. Comparing our TCR9a-C*05:01-A18L-9mer structure with that of TCR9a:C*08:02-G12D-9mer revealed no impact on TCR contacts. Further, modeling TCR10 in complex with a recently solved crystal structure of C*05-G12D-10mer revealed no impact on TCR contacts (6JTO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bai et al., 2021</xref>). The most likely explanation for diminished TCR binding in the presence of C2 residues is that of conformational flexibility. Clearly, TCR9a and TCR10 can bind C*05; however, the ability to make the same contacts with C*08 in C*05 likely requires more energetically unfavorable conformational changes, in either peptide, HLA-C, or both, exemplified by the slow on rate of TCR10 with C*05-G12D-10mer. Indeed, recent evidence suggests that TCR recognition can be optimized by peptide substitutions that allow TCR contacts to form more readily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Devlin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duru et al., 2020</xref>). It is likely that the converse is also true; slight alterations in amino acid side-chain orientations or flexibility may impose a higher energy barrier for efficient TCR recognition.</p><p>The G12D-9mer and G12D-10mer are considered public or shared neoantigens due to the high frequency of cancers with KRAS-G12D mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cox et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pearlman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stephen et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, the small differences between C*08 and C*05 investigated here have clinical implications for mounting an effective antitumor immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tran et al., 2016</xref>). The ability of C*05 to bind G12D-10mer means HLA-C*05:01-positive individuals may be eligible for such therapies; however, identifying a more sensitive receptor than TCR10 would be needed to translate these findings for clinical application.</p><p>The consequences of our findings may have broad implications for T cell recognition of HLA-C beyond the specific example of KRAS-G12D recognition in cancer. For example, in infectious diseases, viral escape mutants may eliminate T cell recognition of C1 allotypes by increasing side chain size at pΩ-1. Similarly, escape mutants that substitute pΩ to smaller residues like Ala may escape T cell recognition of C2 HLA-C but not C1. For peptide vaccines, pΩ-1 size could be optimized depending on whether the peptide targets a C1 or C2 HLA-C allotype. A reasonable prediction from our work is that if a T cell epitope contains a canonical pΩ, it will be immunogenic in individuals carrying either C*08 and C*05. Indeed, there is evidence that HIV-infected individuals can respond to the same epitope (SAEPVPLQL) if they carry HLA-Cw5 or HLA-Cw8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Addo et al., 2001</xref>). However, it is possible that preference for pΩ-1 size could engender differential T cell immunity based on differences in HLA-C and TCR binding. These effects need to be investigated in further experiments of HLA-C-restricted T cells. It is worth noting that the impact of the C1/C2 dimorphism on TCR recognition is intrinsic to the structure of HLA-C and thus may also affect interactions with other immunoreceptors. In particular, the differences in amino acid preferences at pΩ-1 may have enormous consequences for KIR recognition of HLA-C as this residue is central to the KIR binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boyington et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boyington and Sun, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fan et al., 2001</xref>). Our study highlights how small HLA polymorphisms can impact interactions with both peptide and immunoreceptors with implications for immune responses and cancer immunotherapy. Finally, our study establishes that T cells, like NK cells, can discriminate between the dimorphic HLA-C allotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (human)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">721.221 (221)<break/>221C*05:01<break/>221C*08:02<break/>221C*05:01-N77S<break/>221C*05:01-K80N</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Original 221, PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3257565/">3257565</ext-link><break/>221C*05:01 and 221C*08:02, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sim et al., 2017</xref>, PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28352266/">28352266</ext-link><break/>221C*05:01-N77S and 221C*05:01-K80N – this paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Plasmids encoding HLA-C*05:01-N77S and HLA-C*05:01-K80N were generated by QuikChange mutagenesis and expressed in 221 cells via retroviral transduction</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BL21 (DE3)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Novagen</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">70235-4</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">For recombinant protein production</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pet30a-HLA-C*05:01</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Synthesized by GenScript, USA<break/><break/>Residues 1–278<break/><break/>Sequence from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/imgt/hla/">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/imgt/hla/</ext-link><break/><break/>Soluble HLA-C*05:01 heavy chain for production in <italic>E. coli</italic> and in vitro refolding</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pet30a-HLA-C*08:02</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sim et al., 2020</xref>;

These data are found in public depositories; Di Marco et al., PRIDE Project PXD009531, Sarkizova et al., MASSIVE MSV000084172. Both studies used cells transfected with single HLA-I allotypes. Sarkizova et al. used the HLA-A, -B, -C-deficient 721.221 cells, while Di Marco et al. used C1R cells. C1R cells express low levels of HLA-B*35:03 and HLA-C*04:01, and therefore, peptides aligning with motifs for these allotypes were removed from HLA-C allotype-specific sequences. The false discovery rates were 1 and 5% for Sarkizova et al. and Di Marco et al., respectively. For comparing the immunopeptidomes of C1 and C2 HLA-C allotypes, 9mer peptides eluted from 21 different HLA-C allotypes were obtained. The list of allotype-specific sequences from each study was merged and duplicate sequences removed. For some HLA-C allotypes, data was only available from one study and therefore no merging occurred. The C1 HLA-C allotypes were HLA-C*01:02, C*03:02, C*03:03, C*03:04, C*07:01, C*07:02, C*07:04, C*08:01, C*08:02, C*12:02, C*12:03, C*14:02, C*14:03, and C*16:01. The C2 HLA-C allotypes were HLA-C*02:02, C*04:01, C*04:03, C*05:01, C*06:02, C*15:02, and C*17:01. For C*03:02, C*04:03, C*07:04, C*08:01, C*12:02, annd C*14:03, data were only available from one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sarkizova et al., 2020</xref>). A total of 18,275 peptides from C1 allotypes and 8268 peptides from C2 allotypes were studied. The amino acid frequency at positions 8 (pΩ-1) and 9 (pΩ) was determined for each allotype independently and collected to derive an average amino acid frequency for C1 and C2 allotypes. The relative amino acid frequency between C2 and C1 allotypes (C2/C1 fold difference) was determined for each amino acid and significant differences determined by two-sided Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test. For comparing C*08 and C*05 immunopeptidomes, a total of 1928 C*05 and 3182 C*08 nonredundant 9mer sequences were compared of which 1196 sequences were shared between C*05 and C*08 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Protein expression, purification, and crystallization</title><p>HLA-C*05:01 and TCR proteins were produced largely as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clements et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garboczi et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sim et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tikhonova et al., 2012</xref>).

HLA-C was captured by W6/32 at 400–700 RU in PBS. Soluble TCR heterodimers were used as analytes in 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5 and 0.15 M NaCl with a flow rate of 50 μl/min. TCRs were injected for 2 min followed by a dissociation of 10 min. Binding was measured with serial dilutions of TCR from 80 μM to 1.25 μM for TCR10 and 1200 nM to 37.5 nM for TCR9a. Four independent TCR10-binding experiments were carried out with initial concentrations of 10 μM (two experiments), 40 μM (one experiment), and 80 μM (one experiment).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Anthony W Purcell (Reviewer #1); Dirk Zajonc (Reviewer #3).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Points for response buy the authors</p><p>1) Was the pHLA complex stability for the WT and heteroclitic peptide assessed for HLA C*05 and C*08??</p><p>2) Can the authors comment on the expected conformation of the WT 9mer in C*05 to that observed for the heteroclitic variant? A direct comparison of the bound peptides bound to both C-allotypes would be useful.</p><p>3) In Figure 2 the peptidome analysis is shown. In Figure 2G which allotype is the outlier for HLA C1 allotypes? How does this data point impact on the significance? It is important to provide more qualitative information about the data sets used in this analysis = - how do the different data sets compare – some are clearly more comprehensive than others – how many of the datasets are based on monoallelic data vs inferred allotype specificity from other cell lines? Are the two studies performed using similar technology, were the same FDR rates used to report peptides and has this been taken into account in the authors reanalysis? Which databases and search engines were used – it would be most accurate to re-search the raw data together to provide a common analytic workflow to remove biases in the data. At the very least the authors should comment on these influences on the composition of the peptides used for this analysis.</p><p>4) It would be interesting to see the results of peptide stabilization assays (akin to T2 stabilization) of the peptides in the TAP deficient 221 cell lines to address the anticipated density of pHLA used for the various TCR readouts/ Likewise was W6/32 flowed over the SPR chis to show similar levels of conformation pHLA were immobilized prior to the SPR analysis? This would seem a critical control?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Supplementary Figure S1B shows that KIR2DL2 binds quite well to 221-C*05:01, would this be a consideration for any therapies targeting the T cell response?</p><p>2. Why were 2 different functional readouts utilized for assessing responses from the Jurkat cell lines (e.g. Figure 1C vs Figure S1C)?</p><p>3. It was slightly unclear to me why the G12D-A18L peptide was not used for both C*05:01 and C*08:02 for the SPR/tetramer experiments (or as a target for crystallography), given this peptide binds to both alleles and shows improved recognition by TCR9a.</p><p>4. The authors state that TCR10 bound C*05 with slightly weaker affinity but this is difficult to judge with such minor differences and large error values.</p><p>5. The legend indicates Figure 3C is the summary of 2 experiments and shows mean +/- standard error but the error bars appear to be missing. Moreover, the text indicates the highest concentration of peptide tested was 40 ug/ml, yet only up to 20 ug/ml is shown.</p><p>6. The saturation plot in Figure 3F shows a TCR concentration up to 80 μm was used for SPR, yet the highest concentration in 3D and 3E is 40 µM. Was there a reason the highest concentration was not shown on the sensorgrams in Figure 3D and 3E?</p><p>7. For Figure 3, it is unclear if the KDs provided are the average KDs from the independent experiments or if it is the KD derived from the curves shown. Was there any variation between the independent experiments or is the large error due to poor curve fitting? Please clarify.</p><p>8. It would be good to provide the kinetic fit curves overlaid with the raw data for TCR9a binding to C*05:01-KRAS-G12D-A18L (Figure 3A).</p><p>9. What the level of surface expression of the mutant HLA-C*0501-N77S and C*05:01K-80N equivalent to the wild-type?</p><p>10. Given the importance of position 77 and the observation that the C*05:01 N77S at least partially recovered recognition by Jurkat TCR9a, is the mutant C*08:01 S77N no longer recognised by TCR9a (or TCR10)? These are important experiments to confirm the importance of position 77.</p><p>11. Typo line 53: should be Crohn's disease.</p><p>12. Typo line 193: should read Lys (Figure 4C).</p><p>13. Typo in figure legend to Sup Figure 1 221-C805:01.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>There is some discussion/speculation about the impact of the different peptides in KIR2DL1-3 recognition. Especially in the scenario where the large amino acid at P(Omega)-1 would diminish T cell recognition. Would the authors think that this would also impact KIR2DL binding and thereby increase NK cell cytotoxicity? Since Dr. Long is an expert in KIR's, these assays should be easy to perform.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75670.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Points for response buy the authors</p><p>1) Was the pHLA complex stability for the WT and heteroclitic peptide assessed for HLA C*05 and C*08??</p></disp-quote><p>We assessed the ability of KRAS peptides to stabilize C*05 and C*08 using peptide loading assays with TAP-deficient cells expressing C*08 or C*05 (please see Figure 2AandB). WT KRAS peptides were unable to stabilize C*08 or C*05 as they lack a key anchor residue at p3. G12D10mer and A18L-9mer stabilized both C*08 and C*05, while G12D-9mer only stabilized C*08. In addition, G12D-10mer and A18L-9mer successfully refolded recombinant C*05 protein, while in our previous study we found that WT peptides could not refold recombinant C*08 protein (Sim et al., PNAS 2020). Another study also found that WT KRAS peptides and G12D9mer were unable to refold C*05, while G12D-10mer could (Bai et al., Sci China Life, 2021).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Can the authors comment on the expected conformation of the WT 9mer in C*05 to that observed for the heteroclitic variant? A direct comparison of the bound peptides bound to both C-allotypes would be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>The conformations of WT-9mer and G12D-9mer are hypothetical as neither one can stabilize C*05. We would expect the G12D-9mer conformation in C*05 to be very similar to that of A18L9mer, even though it lacks a suitable C-terminal anchor. Our analysis suggests that while Cterminal sequence is essential for conferring HLA-C stability, it is the interaction between HLA-C position 77 and pΩ-1 side chain size that determines the peptide confirmation near the peptide C-terminus (Figure 5A-J). Indeed, the C-terminal residue conformation was the same when comparing G12D-9mer and G12D-10mer bound to C*08 (Sim et al., PNAS 2020). It is difficult to predict the conformation of WT9mer in C*05 as it lacks both a suitable C-terminal anchor and p3 anchor and would therefore be held on the groove at each end only by the conserved interactions with N and C termini. This would lead to considerable conformational flexibility, and binding would likely be unstable. However, if binding occurred, it is likely that the pΩ-1 conformation would follow the pattern observed in other peptides bound to C2 HLA-C allotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 2 the peptidome analysis is shown.

We have updated both the corresponding results and methods sections.</p><p>We chose these datasets as both studies covered a large number of HLA-C allotypes in the same study, as opposed to pooling studies where only one or two HLA-C allotypes were reported. Our initial analysis used the data by Di Marco et al., as it was published first. After publication of the larger dataset by Sarkizova et al., we analysed this data separately and observed similar amino acid frequencies based on C1/C2 status, reaching the same conclusions. Therefore, when preparing our manuscript, we merged the datasets for a combined analysis, rather than displaying the two analyses separately that confirmed each other. In our original manuscript, these details were omitted from our methods. Furthermore, the reviewer is correct that there are differences between the studies that should also be mentioned including cell line origin, data acquisition and data analysis. Another caveat is that our analysis does not account for peptide abundance.</p><p>We have added the following to the corresponding results and methods sections describing our analysis:</p><p>Results: ‘To explore if pΩ Ala is a general feature of peptides that bind C1 allotypes (like C*08) and not C2 allotypes (like C*05), we examined C-terminal amino acid usage in the immunopeptidomes of HLA-C allotypes using two publicly available datasets (see methods) (Di Marco et al., 2017; Sarkizova et al., 2020). We initially analysed both datasets independently and observed similar amino acid frequencies, thus we present a combined analysis of a merged dataset with duplicate sequences removed. However, we cannot rule out that differences in cell line origin, data acquisition, false-discovery rate or analytical pipelines may have influenced our analysis. In addition, our analysis was limited to that of amino acid frequency and did not incorporate peptide abundance. We first compared the immunopeptidomes of C*08 and C*05 as…’</p><p>Methods: HLA-C immunopeptidomics</p><p>For the analysis of HLA-C immunopeptidomes, we used published datasets from two studies (Di Marco et al., 2017; Sarkizova et al., 2020). These data are found in public depositories; Di Marco et al., PRIDE Project PXD009531, Sarkizova et al., MASSIVE MSV000084172. Both studies used cells transfected with single HLA-I allotypes. Sarkizova et al., used the HLA-A, -B, -C deficient 721.221 cells, while Di Marco et al., used C1R cells. C1R cells express low levels of HLA-B*35:03 and HLA-C*04:01 and therefore peptides aligning with motifs for these allotypes were removed from HLA-C allotype specific sequences. The false discovery rate was 1% and 5% for Sarkizova et al., and Di Marco et al., respectively. For comparing the immunopeptidomes of C1 and C2 HLAC allotypes, 9mer peptides eluted from 21 different HLA-C allotypes were obtained. The list of allotype specific sequences from each study were merged and duplicate sequences removed. For some HLA-C allotypes, data was only available from one study and therefore no merging occurred. The C1 HLA-C allotypes were; HLA-C*01:02, C*03:02, C*03:03, C*03:04, C*07:01, C*07:02, C*07:04, C*08:01, C*08:02, C*12:02, C*12:03, C*14:02, C*14:03 and C*16:01. The C2 HLA-C allotypes were; HLA-C*02:02, C*04:01, C*04:03, C*05:01, C*06:02, C*15:02 and C*17:01. For C*03:02, C*04:03, C*07:04 C*08:01, C*12:02, C*14:03, data were only available from one study. A total of 18275 peptides from C1 allotypes and 8268 peptides from C2 allotypes were studied. The amino acid frequency at positions 8 (pΩ-1) and 9 (pΩ) were determined for each allotype independently and collected to derive an average amino acid frequency for C1 and C2 allotypes. The relative amino acid frequency between C2 and C1 allotypes (C2/C1 fold difference) was determined for each amino acid and significant differences determined by two-sided student t-test. For comparing C*08 and C*05 immunopeptidomes, a total of 1928 C*05 and 3182 C*08 non-redundant 9mer sequences were compared of which 1196 sequences were shared between C*05 and C*08 (S Figure 6).’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It would be interesting to see the results of peptide stabilization assays (akin to T2 stabilization) of the peptides in the TAP deficient 221 cell lines to address the anticipated density of pHLA used for the various TCR readouts/ Likewise was W6/32 flowed over the SPR chis to show similar levels of conformation pHLA were immobilized prior to the SPR analysis?

As such, only HLA-C stably bound to W6/32 was analysed for TCR binding and chips were loaded with similar levels of HLA-C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. Supplementary Figure S1B shows that KIR2DL2 binds quite well to 221-C*05:01, would this be a consideration for any therapies targeting the T cell response?</p></disp-quote><p>KIR2DL2 binding to C2 HLA-C has been reported before and is dependent on HLA-C bound peptides (Sim et al., 2017, Front. Imm). Blocking KIR antibodies showed some efficacy in preclinical studies, but this is likely through an impact on NK cells (Romagne et al., 2009, Blood). As KIR can be expressed on T cells, it would be wise to deplete inhibitory KIR+ expressing cells prior to adoptive T cell therapy. There is also evidence that KIR expression correlates with PD-1 expression and that blocking both PD-1 and KIR may be beneficial in immunotherapies (He et al., 2018, Drug Des Devel Ther).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Why were 2 different functional readouts utilized for assessing responses from the Jurkat cell lines (e.g. Figure 1C vs Figure S1C)?</p></disp-quote><p>We used two functional readouts to validate our findings using complementary approaches (flow cytometry and ELISA)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. It was slightly unclear to me why the G12D-A18L peptide was not used for both C*05:01 and C*08:02 for the SPR/tetramer experiments (or as a target for crystallography), given this peptide binds to both alleles and shows improved recognition by TCR9a.</p></disp-quote><p>Our rationale was to prioritise the natural variant (G12D-9mer) as much as possible. This led to the inconsistency identified by the reviewer as we compared A18L-9mer in C*05 with G12D9mer in C*08. However, we believe this inconsistency does not change our conclusion that TCR9a binds HLA-C*08:02 with higher avidity and affinity. For peptide loading experiments, A18L-9mer appeared to stabilise C*05:01 and C*08:02 to similar levels, and was better than G12D-9mer for stabilising C*08:02 (Figure 2AandB). However, G12D-9mer is a good, stable ligand for C*08:02 and in no experiment did C*05:A18L-9mer outperform C*08:02 with G12D-9mer. Hypothetically, if C*05:A18L-9mer was a better ligand for TCR9a than C*08:02-G12D-9mer, then we would agree that the additional experiments with C*08:02-A18L-9mer would be warranted. Our data suggest that peptide stability and C-terminal sequence is not the main source of C*08:02 superiority for TCR9a especially when it also does not appear to explain the superiority of C*08:02 over C*05:01, as a ligand for TCR10.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors state that TCR10 bound C*05 with slightly weaker affinity but this is difficult to judge with such minor differences and large error values.</p></disp-quote><p>The displayed dissociation constants were determined by modelling steady state kinetics and by this analysis, there is only a minor two-fold difference between TCR10 binding to C*08 and C*05. However, by kinetic analysis of association rates, TCR10 had a slower on-rate with C*05:01-G12D-10mer than C*08:02-G12D-10mer. Furthermore, C*05:01-G12D-10mer tetramers had considerably lower avidity for Jurkat-TCR10+ cells than C*08:02-G12D-10mer tetramers. Combining these two results allow us to conclude that the TCR10 interaction with C*05 is weaker than that with C*08 (please see point 7, for more details of TCR10 experiments).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The legend indicates Figure 3C is the summary of 2 experiments and shows mean +/- standard error but the error bars appear to be missing. Moreover, the text indicates the highest concentration of peptide tested was 40 ug/ml, yet only up to 20 ug/ml is shown.</p></disp-quote><p>The error bars are too small to be observed. The reviewer is correct that the highest concentration tested was 40 ug/ml, however we truncated the x-axis for clarity as it allows the lower tetramer concentrations to be more visible. We include the non-truncated graph for the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The saturation plot in Figure 3F shows a TCR concentration up to 80 μm was used for SPR, yet the highest concentration in 3D and 3E is 40 uM. Was there a reason the highest concentration was not shown on the sensorgrams in Figure 3D and 3E?</p></disp-quote><p>The sensorgrams shown in 3D and 3E were from an experiment where 40µM was the highest TCR concentration. This experiment had less ‘buffer jumps’ than the experiment with an 80µM max TCR concentration, making the sensorgrams more suitable for display (see point 7 for more details of TCR10 experiments). We include the sensorgrams from all four independent experiments for the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. For Figure 3, it is unclear if the KDs provided are the average KDs from the independent experiments or if it is the KD derived from the curves shown. Was there any variation between the independent experiments or is the large error due to poor curve fitting? Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>For 3A, the dissociation constant for TCR9a with C*05-A18L-9mer (mean and standard deviation) was derived from 12 curves from two independent experiments where association and dissociation rates were fitted separately. To demonstrate good curve fitting, we reanalysed these binding data by fitting association and dissociation simultaneously. This analysis revealed a good fit for all curves, deriving a similar Kd of 214 nM. These curves are now shown in S Figure 3B.</p><p>For TCR10 experiments (Figure 3D, E, F) 4 independent experiments were carried out with serial dilutions of TCR10 with different starting TCR concentrations. Our initial two experiments used a highest concentration of 10 µM, however this was below the KD of TCR10 for C*05-G12D10mer and therefore to ensure binding saturation, we repeated TCR10 binding with an additional two experiments. The first used a maximum concentration of 40 µM and the second experiment a highest of 80 µM. We reanalysed all binding curves for TCR10 binding experiments to recalculate the dissociation constants. Combining binding data from all four experiments to derive a single dissociation constant gave Kd=7 µM and Kd=14 µM for C*08 and C*05 respectively, but with large confidence intervals. Deriving constants from each binding experiment separately and taking a mean and standard deviation, gave dissociation constants of Kd=8±5 µM and 13±6 µM for C*08 and C*05 respectively. Thus, by both analysis methods TCR10 had weaker binding to C*05 than C*08 but with large overlap in confidence/standard deviation. The variation does not appear to due to poor fitting but due to one experiment (3) where the Kd was higher for both C*08 and C*05. In three of the four experiments, TCR10 binding to C*08 was stronger than with C*05. In the remaining experiment, binding was similar. We include all binding curves for the reviewer.</p><p>We have modified the legend to read</p><p>“(F) Mean, standard deviation and non-linear curve fitting of TCR10 binding to G12D-10mer bound to C*08:02 and C*05:01.
