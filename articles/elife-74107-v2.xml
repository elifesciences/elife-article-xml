hormones and one-third of clinical drugs act on membrane receptors that couple to G proteins to achieve appropriate functional responses. While G protein transducers from literature are annotated in the Guide to Pharmacology database, two recent large-scale datasets now expand the receptor-G protein ‘couplome’. However, these three datasets differ in scope and reported G protein couplings giving different coverage and conclusions on G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-G protein signaling. Here, we report a common coupling map uncovering novel couplings supported by both large-scale studies, the selectivity/promiscuity of GPCRs and G proteins, and how the co-coupling and co-expression of G proteins compare to the families from phylogenetic relationships. The coupling map and insights on GPCR-G protein selectivity will catalyze advances in receptor research and cellular signaling toward the exploitation of G protein signaling bias in design of safer drugs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>GPCR</kwd><kwd>G protein</kwd><kwd>signal transduction</kwd><kwd>pharmacology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent the largest family of proteins involved in signal propagation across biological membranes. They recognize a vast diversity of signals going from photons and odors to neurotransmitters, hormones, and cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armstrong et al., 2020</xref>). Their main signaling modality involves the engagement and activation of G proteins. G proteins are heterotrimeric proteins consisting of α, β, and γ subunits that dissociate to α and βγ upon activation by a GPCR. G proteins are named by their α subunit (16 in human) and are divided into four families which share homology and downstream signaling pathways: G<sub>s</sub> (G<sub>s</sub> and G<sub>olf</sub>), G<sub>i/o</sub> (G<sub>i1</sub>, G<sub>i2</sub>, G<sub>i3</sub>, G<sub>o</sub>, G<sub>z</sub>, G<sub>t1</sub>, G<sub>t2</sub><sup><sub>,</sub></sup> and G<sub>gust</sub>), G<sub>q/11</sub> (G<sub>q</sub>, G<sub>11</sub>, G<sub>14</sub>, and G<sub>15</sub>), and G<sub>12/13</sub> (G<sub>12</sub> and G<sub>13</sub>). A GPCR’s activation of G proteins can be very selective or promiscuous and change upon ligand-dependent biased signaling that alters its profile on the G protein subtype or family levels. The pleiotropic signaling and ligand-dependent bias of GPCRs pose a grand challenge in human biology to map the differential activation of specific G proteins.</p><p>The International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology (IUPHAR)/British Pharmacological Society (BPS) Guide to Pharmacology (GtP) database contains reference data from expert curation of literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armstrong et al., 2020</xref>). GtP couplings cover 253 GPCRs and the 4 G protein families. The G protein families have been classified into ‘primary’ and ‘secondary’ transducers without quantitative values. Recently, the Inoue group determined the first large-scale quantitative coupling profiles of 148 GPCRs to the G<sub>q</sub> wildtype and 10 G protein chimeras employing a transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α) shedding assay (neurotensin 1 [NTS<sub>1</sub>] and thyrotropin-releasing hormone [TRH<sub>1</sub>] added herein making it 150 receptors) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Inoue et al., 2019</xref>). Those chimeras consist of a G<sub>q</sub> backbone in which the six most C-terminal Gα residues – a part of the H5 domain inserting to the intracellular receptor cavity – have been replaced to represent all 16 human G proteins (five of which have identical sequences to other G proteins, see below). In a paper accompanying the present analysis, the Bouvier group quantified the couplings of 100 GPCRs to 12 G proteins: G<sub>s</sub>, G<sub>i1</sub>, G<sub>i2</sub>, G<sub>o</sub> (G<sub>oA</sub> and G<sub>oB</sub> isoforms), G<sub>z</sub>, G<sub>q</sub>, G<sub>11</sub>, G<sub>14</sub>, G<sub>15</sub>, G<sub>12</sub>, and G<sub>13</sub> but not G<sub>olf</sub> (couples mainly to olfactory receptors), G<sub>i3</sub>, and G<sub>t1-2</sub> (transducin, couples to rhodopsin [visual] receptors) and G<sub>gust</sub> (gustducin, couples to taste receptors) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avet et al., 2020</xref>). The authors used novel enhanced bystander bioluminescence resonance energy transfer biosensors that allow to monitor G protein activation (G protein Effector Membrane Translocation assay) without need to modify the G protein subunits (except for G<sub>s</sub>) or the receptors.</p><p>Here, we analyze the GtP, Inoue, and Bouvier coupling datasets to determine confident couplings supported by at least two independent sources, including novel couplings discovered jointly by the two latter sources. We establish a scalable protocol to normalize quantitative G protein couplings, combine E<sub>max</sub> and EC<sub>50</sub> into a common log(E<sub>max</sub>/EC<sub>50</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kenakin, 2017</xref>) value, and aggregate subtypes to allow comparisons across G protein families. On this basis, we develop a unified map of GPCR-G protein couplings that can be filtered or intersected in GproteinDb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pándy-Szekeres et al., 2022</xref>), describe GPCR-G protein selectivity across an unprecedented number of receptors and coupling data points, and reveal correlated co-couplings.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Tools and resources – common coupling map unifying GPCR-G protein data</title><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Systematic profiling doubles the average number of G protein family couplings of GPCRs</title><p>To obtain an overview of the coverages of GPCR-G protein coupling sources, we compared all couplings reported by both the Bouvier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avet et al., 2020</xref>) and Inoue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Inoue et al., 2019</xref>) groups and annotated in the GtP database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armstrong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

[SDs] above basal) that gives the best agreement between the Bouvier and Inoue dataset. We believe that this is the best possible means to estimate what is correct data (rather than false negative/positive couplings), as large-scale information about what G proteins and GPCRs couple physiologically is not available. This cut-off is more stringent than the minimum of 3% signal above basal used in Inoue’s original report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Inoue et al., 2019</xref>). We also aggregated G protein subtype couplings of the families (see Materials and methods). This reveals that while GtP covers the largest number of receptors they have relatively few couplings – only 38% of all GPCR-G protein family pairs are ‘couplers’ compared to 65% in the Bouvier and 75% in the Inoue dataset (average of 1.5, 2.6, and 3.0 G protein families per GPCR, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In particular G<sub>12/13</sub> couplings are underrepresented in GtP where they account for 3% of GPCR-G protein pair datapoints compared to 13% in Bouvier and 17% in Inoue. The Bouvier and Inoue datasets share a more similar overall distribution of couplings, expect for G<sub>s</sub> coupling which is twice as frequent within the latter dataset (16% compared to 8%). This demonstrates that the two first systematic coupling profiling studies have substantially expanded the known GPCR-G protein ‘couplome’ and that their assay platforms are amenable to high-throughput profiling also for the G<sub>12/13</sub> family for which robust activation assays appeared only recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Quoyer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Olsen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maziarz et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Given that the Bouvier and Inoue groups used different biosensors and GtP annotates literature reports from very diverse assays, we sought to determine to which extent they report the same couplings for the same GPCRs, that is, their 70 common receptors (data in tab ‘BIG-QualComp’ in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata3">Source data 3</xref>). We find that all three sources agree on an average of 49% of G protein family couplings/noncouplings (distributed as G<sub>s</sub>: 55%, G<sub>i/o</sub>: 64%, G<sub>q/11</sub>: 50%, and G<sub>12/13</sub>: 25%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). When instead analyzing the quantitative studies alone (excluding GtP), the agreement increases to 70% across G protein families. This agreement is 68% for individual G protein datapoints, which display an even larger span ranging from at least 53% for G<sub>15</sub> up to 81% for G<sub>oA</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These findings define a sizeable reference set of consensus G protein couplings and show that consistent large-scale profiling studies generate more comparable results than literature.</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-2"><title>Common coupling map unifies GPCR-G protein datasets and opens analysis</title><p>To enable quantitative correlation of the Bouvier, Inoue, and future couplings, we established a data processing protocol giving the highest similarity and correlation of coupling measurements across datasets (Materials and methods).

Together, this shows that selective binding of only G<sub>i/o</sub> or G<sub>q/11</sub> is uncommon, but selectivity can be achieved by differential levels of activation. This possibility to achieve selectivity via differential activation is likely important, as many GPCRs, 81 couple to both the G<sub>i/o</sub> and G<sub>q/11</sub> families. Their high difference in activation levels allows for a selective activation, which could shift upon the presentation of alternative endogenous or surrogate ligands with a signaling bias. Furthermore, it should be pointed out that many reported dual couplings to G<sub>i</sub> and G<sub>q</sub> may be because phospholipase c (PLC), a direct effector of G<sub>q</sub>, can also be activated by G<sub>βγ</sub> from G<sub>i</sub> (i.e. sensitive to the G<sub>i</sub> inhibitor pertussis toxin). Thus, the concept of potential scaffolding of PLC by G<sub>q</sub> may be required for G<sub>i</sub>-derived G<sub>βγ</sub> activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pfeil et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-6"><title>Differential tissue expression gives G proteins in the same family large spatial selectivity</title><p>To study how tissue expression may influence G protein selectivity, we analyzed consensus transcript expression levels for 50 tissues and 16 organs (here aggregated into 8) from the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Uhlén et al., 2015</xref>), which also includes data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTeX) project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lonsdale et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

Taken together, this shows that there is no overall clustering of subtypes within the G protein families, which instead exploit differential expression to gain spatial selectivity.

This suggests that the many unique couplings in Inoue’s dataset may be due to high sensitivity rather than the use of chimeric G proteins carrying over of G<sub>q</sub> coupling to the other G proteins.</p><p>To investigate how unique couplings are affected by weak couplings and biosensor sensitivity, we compared their efficacies and potencies (rows 106–110 in tab ‘BIG-QualComp’ in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata3">Source data 3</xref>). We find that the average E<sub>max</sub> values are 18% and 15% lower for unique than for supported couplings in the Bouvier and Inoue datasets, respectively. Furthermore, their average pEC<sub>50</sub> values are 0.4 and 1.5 log units – 2.5-fold and 32-fold, respectively – lower than the supported couplings. This indicates that a part of the differences across datasets is due to weak couplings that can only be detected in the most sensitive assays for the given G proteins and is difficult to distinguish from basal levels (this study used a cut-off of E<sub>max</sub> &gt;1.4 SDs over basal response). However, couplings may also be overrepresented and determining couplings definitely would require further studies employing independent (‘orthogonal’) high-sensitivity biosensors. Until then, we recommend the requirement of two independent studies to support of a GPCR-G protein coupling, as is the criterion used herein for the novel couplings and the default in the online G protein couplings resource (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armstrong et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Given that researchers are now faced with three large G protein coupling datasets varying in coverage and couplings, we established a common normalization protocol making quantified values comparable across data sources and a common coupling map. Previous analyses of GPCR-G protein selectivity have all been based on a single dataset from the GtP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Flock et al., 2017</xref>) database or the Inoue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Inoue et al., 2019</xref>) or Bouvier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avet et al., 2020</xref>) laboratories, whereas the analysis herein combined these datasets to establish couplings supported by two studies (including GtP annotations of multiple literature reports) for a total of 256 GPCRs. This provides a sizeable and reliable reference dataset of supported quantitative couplings suitable for any study.</p><p>By analyzing the common coupling map, we find that 101 novel couplings are supported by both the Bouvier and Inoue datasets but were not known in GtP which annotates coupling from the literature. We also find that very few receptors, 13 (5%) promiscuously couple to all four G protein families whereas the receptor numbers instead increase several-fold along with selectivity: 34 triple-, 83 double-, and 126 single-family coupling receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). As more large coupling datasets become available, this is likely to shift somewhat from less selectivity toward higher promiscuity. Furthermore, the finding that on average only 27% of GPCRs activate only a subset of the G proteins in each family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) opens the possibility that signaling bias on the level of specific subtypes may be much more frequent than currently appreciated. G proteins that belong to the same family can have diverse functional outcomes pertaining to effector engagement selectivity and kinetic profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jiang and Bajpayee, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ho and Wong, 2001</xref>), suggesting that bias within a G protein family may have physiological and/or therapeutic implications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2020</xref>). The observation that many GPCRs can couple to more than one family of G proteins but still can show selectivity between members of a same family, opens important questions concerning the structural determinants of such multifaceted selectivity profiles.</p><p>The GPCR-G protein couplings analyzed herein represent the overall couplings that are possible, but may differ largely physiologically across specific tissues. Our analysis showed a tremendous span in how many tissues that express a given G protein. Some G proteins, including the transducins (G<sub>t1</sub> and G<sub>t2</sub>) and gustducin (G<sub>t3</sub>) have a restricted expression in mainly one tissue (retina and gastrointestinal tract, respectively), whereas the most ubiquitously expressed G proteins, G<sub>s</sub> and G<sub>i2</sub> are highly expressed in all 50 analyzed tissues. Notably, G proteins belonging to the same family differ largely in their tissue profiles, for example, each G protein family has a single or two subtypes that is/are preferentially expressed in the brain. Given that the activity (here log(E<sub>max</sub>/EC<sub>50</sub>) values) can vary substantially across G protein family subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), this provides cells with a mechanism to shift the system bias toward different intracellular signaling pathways. Such system bias can be modulated further through differential expression of also the receptors and multiple downstream intracellular effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kolb et al., 2022</xref>). A recent study found a strong spatial correlation of summed mRNA expression levels for G<sub>s</sub>-, G<sub>i/o</sub>-, and G<sub>q/11</sub>-linked receptors in humans, macaques, and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Treviño and Manjarrez, 2022</xref>). This suggests that the expression patterns of receptors linked to these major G protein families are strongly interdependent and could therefore act together to balance each other in specific tissues. Future studies would be needed to profile the couplings of natively expressed GPCRs and G proteins across different cell types. Meanwhile, a strategy could be to analyze GPCR-G protein selectivity for a subset of G proteins that are selected based on the highest expression in the tissue of interest. For example, analysis of G<sub>i/o</sub>-mediated signaling in the brain could focus on G<sub>o</sub> and G<sub>z</sub> based on their high expression, and the fact that G<sub>o</sub> and G<sub>z</sub> have quicker and slower nucleotide exchange, respectively, than other members of this family. Such separate meta-analysis of G proteins may be facilitated by the filtering options in the coupling maps in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata5">Source data 5</xref> and online in the G protein couplings browser in GproteinDb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pándy-Szekeres et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The Inoue and Bouvier datasets represent the first steps to systematically characterize large G protein coupling profiles. Other laboratories may use other biosensors to expand the coverage of the coupling map, and our study facilitates this by indicating which of the Bouvier and Inoue biosensors that have the highest sensitivity for each G protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). However, future studies should also employ different biosensors and systems, as independent support is critical for validation and for distinguishing novel couplings from false positives among the many unique couplings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata3">Source data 3</xref>). Of note, several biosensors have recently been published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Olsen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maziarz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Masuho et al., 2015</xref>) (Gαβγ sensors first described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Galés et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Galés et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schrage et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Breton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bünemann et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Janetopoulos et al., 2001</xref>).

Of note, most studies annotated in GtP have used downstream measurements, which are amplified, and may therefore differ from those obtained by biosensors that measure G protein activation (further discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avet et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In all, our cross-dataset analysis has established a protocol and reference set aiding GPCR-G protein coupling studies.

To do this, we identified the E<sub>max</sub> SD cut-off, quantitative normalization protocol, and aggregation of G proteins into families giving the best possible agreement between the GPCR-G protein couplings from the Bouvier and Inoue groups. This analysis also involved assessing the agreement of the Bouvier and Inoue group datasets and determining the number of high-confidence novel couplings supported by these two datasets but not reported in the GtP database. Furthermore, it included a benchmarking of techniques to determine which biosensor produces the most reproducible qualitative coupling determination (coupling vs. noncoupling) for each G protein family. To this end, we compared the three datasets to pinpoint, for each dataset and G protein family, the fraction of couplings supported by another dataset. The scientific analyses based on the map feature the most comprehensive analysis to date of GPCR-G protein selectivity. This was done by intersecting the 11 G proteins tested by both Bouvier and Inoue, within and across their families, with respect to the common and unique receptors that they couple to. Finally, the receptor profiles were also used to classify G proteins and to determine any co-correlation between different G protein subtypes and families to GPCRs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Coupling datasets</title><p>Updated spreadsheets containing the pEC<sub>50</sub>, E<sub>max</sub>, basal signals, and SD values were supplied by Asuka Inoue.

To achieve the best possible separation of putative false and real but weak couplings, we identified the threshold value (a number of SDs from basal signal) that gives the best agreement between the Bouvier and Inoue dataset among the common receptors and G proteins tested by both groups. The obtained cut-off, 1.4 SDs, was applied as a filter to exclude all Bouvier and Inoue E<sub>max</sub> and pEC<sub>50</sub> values for couplings below this cut-off (columns with ‘ &gt;1.4 SDs’ in the heading in tabs ‘B-EmEC’ and ‘I-EmEC’ in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>). As a note, while intraday measurement error is small for the TGF-α shedding assay (typically, 1%–2% AP-TGF-α release), interday variability varies widely depending on cell conditions. Since the SD represents interday variability, the basal SD cut-off removes more couplings than the SD cut-off of ligand-induced signal or the significance of individual experiments. As a consequence, some of manually annotated couplings in the Inoue dataset are regarded as noncoupling by the basal SD cut-off criteria, including for P2RY<sub>2</sub> and P2RY<sub>6</sub> that had no couplings above this cut-off.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Generating a subset of comparable GPCR-G protein couplings</title><p>To enable qualitative comparison of corresponding datapoints in the datasets from the Bouvier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avet et al., 2020</xref>) and Inoue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Inoue et al., 2019</xref>) groups, we used the subset of 70 GPCRs present in both datasets and belonging to the same class, A (removed only two receptors from class B1).

To assess the value of normalization, we calculated the average ‘similarity’ (Bouvier/Inoue ratio) of individual values (tabs ending with ‘-sim’ in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata4">Source data 4</xref>) and the ‘linear correlation’ (r<sup>2</sup> value) of each receptor across all G proteins (reported below as averages of individual couplings and G proteins, respectively) (tabs ending with ‘-r<sup>2</sup>’ in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata4">Source data 4</xref>). Linear correlation was only done for receptors with at least three common G proteins/families. Minimum-maximum normalized E<sub>max</sub> values were represented as percentage values while decimal values (0–1) were used for the calculation of log(E<sub>max</sub>/EC<sub>50</sub>) values as recommended in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kenakin, 2017</xref>. For both the Bouvier and Inoue groups, the minimum and maximum represent the signal without (0%) and with (100%) an agonist, respectively, in each experiment replica. The minimum E<sub>max</sub> value was therefore set 0 while the maximum was set to the highest value for the given G protein (first, use normalization) or receptor (second, tested but not used normalization).</p><p>Minimum-maximum normalization of E<sub>max</sub> measurements increased the average from 0.22 to 0.61 and the linear correlation r<sup>2</sup> value from 0.28 to 0.30. In contrast, non-normalized pEC<sub>50</sub> measurements have the most similar values (0.89 compared to 0.66) and an identical linear correlation (0.37). We combined the minimum-maximum normalized E<sub>max</sub> and non-normalized EC<sub>50</sub> values into log(E<sub>max</sub>/EC<sub>50</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kenakin, 2017</xref>). The log(E<sub>max</sub>/EC<sub>50</sub>) values have an average similarity that is nearly as high (0.86 compared to 0.89) and an average linear correlation that is better (0.41 compared to 0.37) than for pEC<sub>50</sub>, the best individual measure. We did not apply a double normalization, that is, also across G proteins after across receptors, as this worsens the E<sub>max</sub>, pEC<sub>50</sub>, and log(E<sub>max</sub>/EC<sub>50</sub>) value similarity (0.61–0.39, 0.89–0.42, and 0.86–0.47, respectively) and linear correlation of each G protein across receptors (0.11–0.05, 0.49–0.20, and 0.46–0.23, respectively).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Dataset integration into a unified coupling map – G protein family aggregation</title><p>Given that G proteins belong to families that are functionally grouped by sharing downstream signaling pathways, we next investigated the best member-to-family aggregation scheme – specifically, whether the most comparable G protein family values are obtained if using the maximum value from any single subtype or the mean of all subtype members. We found that aggregation using max rather than mean values gives a better similarity for E<sub>max</sub> (0.69 vs. 0.65), marginally lower similarities for pEC<sub>50</sub> (0.89 relative 0.90), and identical similarities for log(E<sub>max</sub>/EC<sub>50</sub>) (0.88). However, max performs better overall than mean in the comparisons correlating a receptor across G proteins; E<sub>max</sub> (0.63 and 0.53), pEC<sub>50</sub> (0.56 and 0.56), and log(E<sub>max</sub>/EC<sub>50</sub>) (0.65 and 0.59) or one G protein across receptors; E<sub>max</sub> (0.29 and 0.20), pEC<sub>50</sub> (0.71 and 0.74), and log(E<sub>max</sub>/EC<sub>50</sub>) (0.69 and 0.71). Notably, the correlation of each receptor across max-aggregated G protein families compared to nonaggregated subtypes is much stronger when considering any of the three pharmacological parameters: E<sub>max</sub> (0.63 vs. 0.36), pEC<sub>50</sub> (0.56 vs. 0.30), and log(E<sub>max</sub>/EC<sub>50</sub>) (0.65 vs. 0.41). Altogether, this establishes the highest value (max) as the aggregation that yields the most comparable quantitative value for G protein families.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Tissue expression analysis</title><p>Consensus transcript expression levels were extracted for 50 different tissues aggregated into 16 organs or systems in the HPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Uhlén et al., 2015</xref>), which also includes data from the GTEx project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lonsdale et al., 2013</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor.

By combining 2 (published) large datasets of interactions with the widely-used (literature-based) Guide to Pharmacology database it substantially increases both the amount of GPCR/G protein coupling validated by multiple studies and quantifies the interactions better. The data are well analyzed, but there are several concerns that need to be addressed. The principal concerns are that 1) there is no analysis of distinctions within a G subfamily, and 2) there is no demonstration of the utility of the analysis, i.e. demonstrating an unexplored coupling in a physiologically relevant context.</p><p>Overall, it is a well-written (but not well-edited) manuscript. There are several typographical errors in the manuscript, perhaps as a result of the choice of font size. It was hard enough for the reviewers to carefully read through the text, and apparently for the authors as well.</p><p>1. There are specific properties of some G protein isoforms within each family that need to be considered when making these comparisons. For example, there are vastly different nucleotide exchange properties of Galphao (Gao) from the other Gi isoforms (Gai1, Gai2, Gai3 and Gaz). Moreover, Gao has quite a distinct expression pattern than other isoforms where it is mostly expressed in brain with levels reaching 1%-3% of total membrane protein concentration. These properties are likely related to the capacity of this isoform to exhibit rapid regulation of effectors such as ion channels. Thus, merging the data sets for Gao with other Gai isoforms, particularly when the coupling data are based on recombinant expression in HEK cells, or with Galpha chimeras, should done with caution. One might even consider performing the meta-analysis of Gao separately from the other Gai isoforms.</p><p>2. The authors raise an interesting and important caveat in the Bouvier and Inoue screens regarding the EC50 and efficacy differences compared to the GtP screens. It is fine to point out the differences, but possible explanations for the differences, especially when comparing three different screening platforms, needs to be provided.</p><p>3. The data are described mostly by broad numbers, such as the number of receptors / coupling in a subset, or by percentages. While this is helpful to understand the data, it is hard to follow the mountain of numbers. The suggestion is to add a section where the authors pick selected examples of particular experimental data and show how their combined database can resolve previously unanswered (or wrongly answered) questions of GPCR/G protein coupling.</p><p>4. The paper does not reveal new biological findings, but the authors should be able to do so if they use their new resource for specific examples. For example, while some emphasis is placed on new data on G15, it would be helpful to take the extra step and use this to suggest new biological insights. Looking more deeply into those G proteins that are outliers in their subfamilies, such as Gz, G15, Gt3 would also be useful.</p><p>5. The authors cautiously label couplings supported by only one data set as &quot;unsupported&quot;. It would seem more helpful to grade couplings by a reliability scale, providing users with a wider set of data. Perhaps only couplings that are directly conflicted by negative data should be labeled as unsupported?</p><p>6. Given that this manuscript includes authors from both the Inoue and Bouvier studies, it is somewhat understandable that they are not directly assessing which of the two datasets (in relation to the GtP) might be more accurate. Nevertheless, this assessment should be done and the advantages and disadvantages of the two experimental systems discussed clearly. The authors should use their new resource to assess the weaknesses and strengths of each of their respective experimental methods, especially when there are data in GtP that can be used for comparisons. They briefly mention such a conclusion in line 136-137 or line 142, but this should be done more broadly and more deeply.</p><p>7. Lines 218-219 say &quot;The choice of protein systems and biosensors for such future studies should take into account the relative strengths and limitations of the profiling platforms used&quot;. Please provide such an assessment here, with the data you provide.</p><p>8. The sentence &quot;this shows that G protein family pairs have evolved differing levels of receptor co-coupling or selectivity, which they have achieved by weakening or abolishing the binding to the same GPCRs&quot; in line 209-210 begs a deeper investigation of this using this resource and selected G proteins. This is also potentially confounded by the use of overexpression for many of the examples in the companion paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>To emphasize the last weakness, the authors should use their new resource to assess the weaknesses and strengths of each of their respective experimental methods, esp. when there's data in GtP that can be used for comparisons.

The data normalization protocol (leading to log(Emax/EC50) as a comparable parameter), explanation and overview of the couplings are all tools/resources that are unique to this paper, whereas the resulting coupling map has recently been published as an interactive “G protein couplings” browser in the GproteinDb database (1).

We have clarified the dual nature in the revised manuscript by splitting Results into two subsections named “Tools and Resources – Common coupling map unifying GPCR-G protein data” and “Research Advances – Insights on GPCR-G protein selectivity”. This has also been clarified in the title, which has been updated to “Common coupling map advances GPCR-G protein selectivity”.</p><p>Given this dual content, we would please like to ask for an updated opinion on the most suitable publication format based on the revised manuscript.

GtP is unfortunately not suitable as a stand-alone resource – neither to contradict nor support couplings (on the G protein subtype level). This is because GtP is incomplete (especially for G<sub>12/13</sub>) and does not provide any information on the level of G protein subtypes, only families. The three-way interactions will always use GtP but adds a second dataset on top of this when validating a third dataset. Our manuscript already included a three-way intersection of datasets, allowing readers to conclude which dataset might be more accurate (then Figure 3 and Spreadsheet 3) on a per-G protein basis.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have rewritten this section, which now has the heading “Bouvier’s and Inoue’s biosensors appear more sensitive for G<sub>15</sub> and, G<sub>s</sub> and G<sub>12</sub>, respectively. We have also made a completely new figure, Figure 7, which more clearly illustrates for which G proteins that Bouvier and Inoue may have overrepresented or underrepresented couplings. This section specifically investigates the question of whether differential sensitivity can explain “unique” couplings. However, such unique couplings can either be due to overrepresentation or instead be true positives that are missing in GtP because of incompleteness and in the other biosensor due to lower sensitivity. Unfortunately, we will not be able to distinguish these possibilities until the research community has gained additional datasets from independent biosensors with as high sensitivity.</p><p>Whereas our study compares datasets rather than experimental systems, we have added a paragraph in the Discussion describing which aspects should be considered when choosing a biosensor. There, we reference a review from last year dedicated to biosensors and describing their pros and cons (3), and the accompanying paper by Bouvier et al. (4), comparing several aspects of the experimental system used by Inoue et al. It is also important to note that the most advantageous biosensor may be one of the two for which data is analyzed in our paper. For many studies, researchers may instead be better off with another biosensor, for example those from Lambert/Mamyrbekov (5), Roth (2) (Gαβγ sensors first described in (6-11)) or Inoue (unpublished dissociation assays using wt G proteins fused with LgBit and HiBit). These are all referenced in the Discussion.</p><p>Additionally, the conclusions in lines 136-137, 142 and 218-219 have now been better described as part of a rewriting of the respective section of Results, “Bouvier’s and Inoue’s biosensors appear more sensitive for G<sub>15</sub> and, G<sub>s</sub> and G<sub>12</sub>, respectively”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another improvement would be to look more deeply into those G proteins that are outliers in their subfamilies, such as Gz, G15, Gt3. This ties into my comment above, that the manuscript lacks a biological story, one that I believe the authors can reach if they use their new resource for specific examples.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added an additional biological story describing the expression profiles and co-expression of G proteins. This section describes which G proteins are outliers in terms of expression, including G<sub>z</sub> and G<sub>t3</sub>, which had not been included previously, as there is no coupling data for this G protein. Furthermore, we have increased and clarified the usage of particular examples of G proteins (and GPCRs) within the different sections of the Results subsection “Research Advances – Insights on GPCR-G protein selectivity”.</p><p>With the public data currently available, we feel that this is the best balance when avoiding going to far on a limited data basis versus covering the relevant, supported biological stories of G proteins. It would be advisable to await further independent datasets from high-sensitivity biosensors before looking more deeply are outlier couplings. This is because GtP does not provide subtype data, and the outliers are typically where the Bouvier and Inoue datasets differ largely. Therefore, a more detailed analysis may risk not being reproducible until additional datasets become available.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For me, the sentence &quot;this shows that G protein family pairs have evolved differing levels of receptor co-coupling or selectivity, which they have achieved by weakening or abolishing the binding to the same GPCRs&quot; in line 209-210 begs a deeper investigation of this using this resource and selected G proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>This section has now been rewritten to better investigate and distinguish the contributions of binding/non-binding and weak/strong binding, respectively as mechanisms of GPCR-G protein selectivity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This is a timely review/analysis and will be extremely useful for the GPCR field.

This is revisited in a new paragraph of the Discussion, which includes the text:</p><p>“The best way to address this would be for future studies to profile the couplings of natively expressed GPCRs and G proteins across different cell types. Meanwhile, a strategy could be to analyze GPCR-G protein selectivity for a subset of G proteins that are selected based on the highest expression in the tissue of interest. Such separated meta-analyses of G proteins may be facilitated by the filtering options in the coupling maps in Spreadsheet S5 and online in the G protein couplings browser in GproteinDb (1).“</p><p>The same paragraph also mentions the differential nucleotide exchange of Gao and Gaz relative to other members of the Gi/o family. We did not perform a meta-analysis of Gao or Gao separately from the other Gai isoforms, for consistency, length limitations and because the signaling may be inseparable in some tissues. However, readers that wish to do so could do that by using the G protein couplings browser (https://gproteindb.org/signprot/couplings) in GproteinDb (1) or by modifying Spreadsheet S3 in MS Excel.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors raise an interesting and important caveat in the Bouvier and Inoue screens regarding the EC50 and efficacy differences compared to the GtP screens.
