Here, we identified a population of adipocytes that exhibit persistent activity of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, as revealed by the Tcf/Lef-GFP reporter allele, in embryonic and adult mouse fat depots, named as Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes. We showed that this β-catenin-mediated signaling activation in these cells is Wnt ligand- and receptor-independent but relies on AKT/mTOR pathway and is essential for cell survival. Such adipocytes are distinct from classical ones in transcriptomic and genomic signatures and can be induced from various sources of mesenchymal stromal cells including human cells. Genetic lineage-tracing and targeted cell ablation studies revealed that these adipocytes convert into beige adipocytes directly and are also required for beige fat recruitment under thermal challenge, demonstrating both cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous roles in adaptive thermogenesis. Furthermore, mice bearing targeted ablation of these adipocytes exhibited glucose intolerance, while mice receiving exogenously supplied such cells manifested enhanced glucose utilization. Our studies uncover a unique adipocyte population in regulating beiging in adipose tissues and systemic glucose homeostasis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>adipocyte</kwd><kwd>β-catenin signaling</kwd><kwd>AKT/mTOR signaling</kwd><kwd>beiging</kwd><kwd>glucose homeostasis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007875</institution-id><institution>Tulane University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Carol Lavin Bernick Faculty Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>YiPing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007875</institution-id><institution>Tulane University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>the John L. and Mary Wright Ebaugh Endowed Chair Fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>YiPing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK128907</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>YiPing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20PRE35040002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Tianfang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel population of adipocytes that play essential roles in adaptive thermogenesis via cell autonomous and non-autonomous effects and regulate systemic glucose metabolism in mice.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adipose tissues, consisting of white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT), play a critical role in maintaining whole-body metabolic homeostasis, with WAT serving for energy storage and BAT for energy dissipation to produce heat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cannon and Nedergaard, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rosen and Spiegelman, 2014</xref>). In addition to white and brown fat cells that are differentiated from heterogenous stromal vascular fractions (SVFs) of distinct lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hepler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rosenwald and Wolfrum, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schwalie et al., 2018</xref>), a third type of inducible adipocyte exists known as beige or brite adipocytes that are transiently generated in WAT depots in response to external stimulations such as environmental cold acclimation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boström et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ikeda et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wu et al., 2012</xref>). Like brown adipocytes, activated beige adipocytes through ‘‘beiging’’ or ‘‘browning’’ process of WAT express key thermogenic marker uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and exert adaptive thermogenic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ishibashi and Seale, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Petrovic et al., 2010</xref>). Despite that the capacity for thermogenic fat cells (i.e. brown and beige adipocytes) to protect against diet-induced obesity and metabolic disorders has been recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartelt and Heeren, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crane et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hasegawa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ikeda et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lowell et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tseng et al., 2010</xref>), a comprehensive understanding of developmental origins and regulatory mechanism of beiging is still missing, partially due to the cell-type complexity in adipose tissues. It has been appreciated that beige adipocytes arise by both de novo adipogenic differentiation from progenitor cells and direct conversion/transdifferentiation from existing white adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barbatelli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). While previous profiling studies have identified some specific markers (for example, CD137 and CD81) for progenitors of beige adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Oguri et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wu et al., 2012</xref>), the cellular origin of beige adipocytes derived from direct conversion remained elusive.</p><p>Wnt/β-catenin (canonical) signaling pathway plays a fundamental role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and tissue homeostasis. In the presence of Wnts, ‘destruction complex’ including glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) is inhibited and cytoplasmic β-catenin translocates into the nucleus and interacts with TCF/LEF transcription factors, which is the hallmark of the canonical Wnt signaling activation, to activate downstream target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cadigan and Liu, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dale, 1998</xref>). In addition, β-catenin nuclear translocation can also be triggered by other intracellular factors such as AKT and Gα<sub>s</sub>, leading to the activation of β-catenin-mediated signaling in a ligand- and receptor-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Regard et al., 2011</xref>). Despite the consensus that Wnt/β-catenin signaling imposes negative effects on adipogenesis by inhibiting Pparγ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Regard et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ross et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Waki et al., 2007</xref>), clues have been pointing to potential roles of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in adipogenesis and adipose tissue function. For instance, β-catenin and TCF7L2, two key effectors of canonical Wnt signaling pathway, are expressed by mature adipocytes. Adipocyte-specific mutations in <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> (encoding β-catenin), <italic>Tcf7l2</italic>, or <italic>Wls</italic> (encoding Wntless) led to impaired adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bagchi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). Particularly, loss of <italic>Tcf7l2</italic> in mature adipocytes gave rise to adipocyte hypertrophy, inflammation, as well as systemic glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, implying an important biological role for Wnt/β-catenin signaling in adipose function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geoghegan et al., 2019</xref>). However, direct evidence for active Wnt/β-catenin signaling in adipocytes is lacking.</p><p>In the current studies, we have revealed an unexpected adipocyte population that is marked by active Wnt/β-catenin signaling intracellularly, named as Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes. We found that the Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes are derived from progenitor lineage that is distinct from that of classical adipocytes and emerge at embryonic stage. Using single-cell transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility profiling assays, we showed that these Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes distinguish from other conventional ones with respect to molecular and genomic signatures and are highlighted by thermogenic properties. Cold exposure studies uncovered that the Wnt<sup>+</sup> fat cells play a crucial role in thermogenic response via not only undergoing direct conversion to beige adipocytes but also exerting an indispensable role in beige fat recruitment, representing an important type of thermogenesis-regulatory cells. Finally, gain- and loss-of-function studies further revealed the Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes as a beneficial metabolic determinant in blood glucose control. The fact that this novel population of adipocytes may also exist in humans implicates it as a potential therapeutic target for metabolic diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A unique fraction of murine adipocytes displays Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity</title><p>In an unrelated study on the effect of the canonical Wnt signaling on osteogenic differentiation of murine bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), we used BMSCs from the well-defined Wnt/β-catenin signaling specific reporter mouse line TCF/Lef:H2B-GFP (hereafter T/L-GFP) that allows for real-time monitoring of Wnt/β-catenin activity at single-cell resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ferrer-Vaquer et al., 2010</xref>). Adipogenic differentiation of T/L-GFP BMSCs was conducted in parallel as a negative control for the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Surprisingly, we observed repeatedly (n &gt; 10) the presence of a small population of GFP-positive cells containing lipid droplets (data not shown). This unexpected observation prompted us to conduct a careful survey for the presence of active Wnt/β-catenin signaling in any adipocytes of fat depots from T/L-GFP mice. In addition to those tissues and cells such as muscle and dermal cells known to manifest active Wnt/β-catenin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ferrer-Vaquer et al., 2010</xref>), we virtually observed a subset of Perilipin<sup>+</sup> adipocytes that exhibited Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity interspersed within various fat depots, including interscapular BAT (iBAT), inguinal WAT (iWAT), epididymal WAT (eWAT), and bone marrow (BM) in adult mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Since adipose tissues possess multiple types of non-adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cinti, 2005</xref>), and the nuclei are often squeezed at the edge of mature white adipocytes, it is difficult to determine the exact hosts of the GFP<sup>+</sup> nuclei in white adipose tissues. To confirm that these Wnt/β-catenin-positive cells are indeed adipocytes, we created a Tcf/Lef<sup>CreERT2</sup> transgenic allele in which the CreERT2 cassette was placed under the control of the same regulatory elements as that used in the T/L-GFP allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This Tcf/Lef<sup>CreERT2</sup> allele, upon compounding with <italic>Rosa26R</italic><sup>mTmG</sup> reporter allele followed by tamoxifen administration, indelibly labeled the membrane of a fraction of adipocytes, as seen in freshly isolated cells and in sectioned iWAT and iBAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B, C, E, F</xref>). Moreover, addition of the T/L-GFP allele to Tcf/Lef<sup>CreERT2</sup>;<italic>Rosa26R</italic><sup>mTmG</sup> mice produced adipocytes that were tagged by both membrane-bound and nucleus-localized GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Therefore, we identified a population of adipocytes that displays active Wnt/β-catenin cascade, and accordingly, we referred to these cells as Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The existence of adipocytes exhibiting active Wnt/β-catenin signaling.</title><p>(<bold>A and B</bold>) Immunofluorescent and microscopy images of active Wnt/β-catenin in vivo (<bold>A</bold>) and in vitro (<bold>B</bold>), indicated by GFP expression from the TCF/Lef:H2B-GFP allele, in adipocytes marked by Perilipin or BODIPY (red).

Interestingly, sex and age appeared to have an impact on the amounts of Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes, as the percentage of Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocyte in female fat depots was around half as compared to their male counterparts and was dramatically reduced in aged male mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C-F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes can be derived from multiple cellular sources including human BMSCs</title><p>To characterize Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes, we set out to determine if the resident SVF cells within adipose tissues constitute the source of Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes.

We found that TCF7L2 expression was largely overlapped (~91%) with Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes, whereas other TCF proteins (TCF1, TCF3, and LEF1) were barely detected in Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes (data not shown). To further confirm that the GFP expression by the T/L-GFP allele is indeed β-catenin dependent, we first set to abolish β-catenin signaling function in vivo. We took advantage of the <italic>Ctnnb1</italic><sup>dm</sup> allele that produces truncated β-catenin with abolished transcriptional outputs but retained cell adhesion function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Valenta et al., 2011</xref>) and the floxed <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> allele by creating mice carrying adipocyte-specific elimination of β-catenin-mediated signaling. Such mice (<italic>Adipoq</italic><sup>Cre</sup>;<italic>Ctnnb1</italic><sup>dm/flox</sup>) were crossed to T/L-GFP mice, and the adipose tissues of the resultant mice (<italic>Adipoq</italic><sup>Cre</sup>;<italic>Ctnnb1</italic><sup>dm/flox</sup>;T/L-GFP) were subjected to examination of GFP expression by the T/L-GFP allele. The results showed a complete lack of Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes in the absence of β-catenin-mediated signaling in both iBAT and iWAT, indicating the absolute requirement of β-catenin-mediated signaling for the GFP expression in Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Next, we asked if loss of β-catenin could diminish GFP expression in the Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes by conducting in vitro knockdown experiments using short interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> followed by real-time monitoring. <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> knockdown in differentiated Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes in which GFP expression had been activated virtually quenched the GFP signals, followed by cell shrinkage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). However, surprisingly, we found that DKK1 and IWP-2, both canonical Wnt receptor inhibitors, failed to, but LF3, a molecule that specifically disrupts the interaction between β-catenin and TCF7L2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fang et al., 2016</xref>), did inhibit GFP expression in adipocytes differentiated from T/L-GFP SVFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E-H</xref>). This result indicates that the transcriptional activity of β-catenin-TCF7L2 complex-mediated intracellular Wnt/β-catenin signaling in Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes is ligand- and receptor-independent. Remarkably, pharmacological inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by LF3 also resulted in an overall impaired/delayed adipogenic maturation of SVF-derived adipocytes in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Since most of the SVFs in such culture differentiated into Wnt<sup>-</sup> adipocytes, this observation suggests the potentially functional importance of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in adipogenesis of Wnt<sup>-</sup> adipocytes.</p><p>To further define the specific roles of the intracellular Wnt/β-catenin signaling in Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes, we immortalized SVF cells (mBaSVF) derived from iBAT of T/L-GFP mouse. By serial limited dilutions, we isolated and established two Wnt<sup>+</sup> (GFPpos-1 and GFPpos-2) and two Wnt<sup>-</sup> (GFPneg-1 and GFPneg-2, as controls) adipocyte precursor cell lines from mBaSVF cells, respectively. Of note, LF3 treatment of induced Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes from both GFPpos-1 and GFPpos-2 cell lines quenched GFP expression in the first day of culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), followed by massive cell death in the second day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). By contrast, LF3 administration to induced Wnt<sup>-</sup> adipocytes from precursor cell lines did not affect cell viability but slowed down the maturation of Wnt<sup>-</sup> adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A-D</xref>), similar to that seen in SVF induced adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). However, such LF3-treated Wnt<sup>-</sup> adipocytes, once returned to normal pro-adipogenic medium, resumed full adipogenic capacity compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E, F</xref>), indicating that LF3 treatment does not impair but delays the maturation of Wnt<sup>-</sup> adipocytes.

The KEGG pathway analysis of DEGs (fold change &gt;2, FDR &lt; 0.05) showed that the primarily affected (downregulated) pathways in LF3-treated Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes are ‘PI3K/Akt signaling’, ‘thermogenesis’, ‘insulin signaling’, ‘fatty acid metabolism’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>), indicating that the intracellular Wnt signaling indeed mediates the function of the insulin/PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.</p><p>To further validate the requirement of insulin signaling in Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocyte development in vivo, we employed <italic>Ins2</italic><sup>Akita</sup> mice (the so-called Akita mice) in which insulin secretion is profoundly impaired due to genetic defect in the insulin 2 gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yoshioka et al., 1997</xref>) by crossing them to T/L-GFP mice.

A close examination revealed a close topological association of UCP1<sup>+</sup>/Wnt<sup>-</sup> beige adipocytes with UCP1<sup>+</sup>/Wnt<sup>+</sup> beige cells at this initial beiging stage. Remarkably, as cold exposure was prolonged to 4 days, the number of Wnt<sup>-</sup> beige adipocytes increased dramatically, but the majority of, if not all, UCP1-labeled Wnt<sup>-</sup> beige adipocytes were still found present neighboring to Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

Tamoxifen-treated T/L-DTA mice appeared normal and did not exhibit lipodystrophic phenotype by histological examination under regular chow diet (data not shown). We then challenged Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocyte-ablated mice and littermate controls (Fabp4-Flex-DTA mice) at 6 °C temperature. We first measured the core body temperature of each mouse and found that about 31%T/L-DTA mice (5 of 16 mice) developed hypothermia (below 34.5 °C) within 60 hr under cold conditions, with the rest of the T/L-DTA mice exhibiting comparable core body temperature as the controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). We next examined if the formation of cold-induced beige fat in iWAT of T/L-DTA mice would be blunted. After 4-day cold stress, DTA-induced ablation of Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes led to substantially reduced UCP1-expressing beige adipocytes compared to control littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). This markedly attenuated UCP1 expression persisted even after 2 weeks of cold adaptation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1H</xref>). The compromised beiging process in iWAT was verified by remarkably decreased expression levels of thermogenic genes assessed by qRT-PCR and western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G and H</xref>).

Our current studies expand the conventional dogma conceptually by presenting direct evidence for the existence of a population of adipocytes marked by active intracellular Wnt/β-catenin signaling, revealing the diversity of adipocytes. Despite of a previous study reporting that the canonical Wnt signaling is operative persistently in overall mature adipocytes and plays a role in de novo lipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bagchi et al., 2020</xref>), the activity of such canonical Wnt signaling is apparently below the threshold of the T/L-GFP reporter sensitivity in those so-called Wnt<sup>-</sup> adipocytes. However, we demonstrated that the β-catenin-mediated signaling in the Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes is independent on Wnt ligands and receptors, but is activated intracellularly via signaling crosstalk, in this case, AKT/mTOR signaling. Since β-catenin nuclear translocation and binding to Tcf/Lef1 is regarded as the hallmark of canonical Wnt signaling, we still refer this population of fat cells as Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes. Although if AKT/mTOR signaling cascade can activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling remains contradictory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baryawno et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cabrae et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Palsgaard et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Prossomariti et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>), it appears to be cell-type dependent. This population of Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes was previously neglected, presumably because it is relatively few within fat depots in vivo and most of the prior studies were performed in aggregates of mixed cell types through Wnt ligand- and receptor-dependent manners. Importantly, we showed that the intracellularly AKT/mTOR cascade-dependent β-catenin signaling is required for the survival of Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes in vitro. Such intracellular signaling cascade appears to exert distinct function as compared to the ligand-dependent canonical Wnt signaling that regulates lipogenesis in other mature adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bagchi et al., 2020</xref>). This conclusion is supported by the different responses (cell death v.s. recoverable delayed maturation) of Wnt<sup>+</sup> and Wnt<sup>-</sup> adipocytes under the treatment of LF3 that disrupts β-catenin/TCF-mediated signaling specifically in the current studies.</p><p>Our single-cell sequencing data showed that Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes, as compared to Wnt<sup>-</sup> adipocytes induced from SVF cells of iWAT and iBAT origins, exhibit distinct signatures at molecular and genomic levels, further supporting the Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes as a unique subpopulation of fat cells in mammals. Because FACS-based selection of mature adipocytes presents a huge challenge and the lipid droplets of cultured adipocytes are much smaller, we had to perform sequencing on in vitro cultured cells that were not under their true physiological status. We have attempted to conduct single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on mature adipocytes isolated from adipose tissues. However, unlike the previous successful studies in which adipocyte nuclei were isolated from adipose tissues simply by one-step enzyme digestion prior to snRNA-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rajbhandari et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sarvari et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sun et al., 2020b</xref>), we were not able to obtain desired results due to nuclear membrane breakage after enzyme digestion and following FACS separation of Wnt<sup>+</sup> and Wnt<sup>-</sup> adipocyte nuclei. Nevertheless, under the standard white fat pro-adipogenic induction, SVF-induced Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes, but not Wnt<sup>-</sup> adipocytes, express several brown/beige fat-selective genes, mirroring the thermogenic feature. In addition, pathway analyses indicate highly enriched insulin signaling pathway in Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes, as compared to Wnt<sup>-</sup> fat cells, consistent with the intracellular activation of β-catenin signaling by AKT/mTOR signaling cascade. A recent study using single-nucleus sequencing (sNuc-seq) revealed multiple unique clusters of adipocytes in mouse and human WAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Emont et al., 2022</xref>). By intersecting our scRNA-seq data on Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes with the published sNuc-seq dataset of mouse iWAT, we found that one cluster (mAd3) of the sNuc-seq dataset, which is relatively enriched in <italic>Tcf7l2</italic>, expresses remarkably high levels of <italic>Cyp2e1</italic> and <italic>Cfd</italic>. These genes, regarded as hallmark of mAd3 cluster, are also highly expressed in Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>). Interestingly, the percentage of mAd3 among the total iWAT adipocytes in chow-fed male group is about 5%, which is very close to that of Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes in vivo (~7%). Thus, mAd3 possibly represents Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes in iWAT. Since the activation of Tcf/Lef signaling in the Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes is relied on Akt/mTOR signaling but not the conventional Wnt ligands and receptors, those traditional downstream markers of Wnt signaling such as <italic>Axins</italic> were not found specifically enriched in Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes. Therefore, the Akt/mTOR-dependent Wnt signaling in Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes appears to regulate the expression of genes distinct from that controlled by the conventional Wnt signaling pathway. This conclusion is supported by the results that inhibition of this Akt/mTOR-dependent β-catenin-mediated signaling by LF3 in Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes negatively impact pathways implicated in ‘PI3K/Akt signaling’, ‘insulin signaling’, ‘thermogenesis’, and ‘fatty acid metabolism’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>). While many subpopulations of heterogeneous pre-adipocytes/adipocytes have been identified, the classification of each subset replies mainly on the expression of specific genes such as cell surface markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hepler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Oguri et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schwalie et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wu et al., 2012</xref>). Our current studies, based on the stable feature of an intrinsic cellular signaling identity, provide a new revenue for taxonomy of adipocytes.</p><p>In line with their thermogenic feature, as revealed by gene expression profiling, our studies have further uncovered a key role of Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes in adaptive thermogenesis of adipose tissues. First, Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes represent at least one of the cell populations that can convert into beige adipocytes directly following cold stress. Interestingly, a conversion of mature white adipocyte to reprogrammed beige characteristics has been postulated to occur predominantly in the ‘dormant’ or ‘latent’ beige fat (i.e. thermogenic inactive state of UCP1 lineage adipocytes within WAT depots), which was thought to form initially through de novo beige adipogenesis from progenitors during postnatal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Paulo and Wang, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shao et al., 2019</xref>). Because UCP1 expression within iWAT starts at postnatal day 14 independent of environmental temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wu et al., 2020</xref>), dormant beige adipocytes appear much later in development than Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes that can be found at embryonic stage. Our recent lineage-tracing studies also revealed non-overlapped Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes and UCP1<sup>+</sup> dormant beige cells in iWAT of 4-week-old mice (unpublished data). Therefore, together with the observations that Wnt<sup>+</sup> and Wnt<sup>-</sup> adipocytes do not convert mutually in cell culture, our findings demonstrate that Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes differ from dormant beige cells and represent a population of adipocytes that retain the cellular plasticity and are capable of converting to beige adipocytes directly. Second, Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes do not just simply function in cell autonomous manner in beiging response, but also exert paracrine effect on and are required for beige fat recruitment. Upon cold exposure, UCP1<sup>+</sup>/Wnt<sup>-</sup> beige fat emerges largely surrounding Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes, implicating that Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes serve as a beiging initiator in a paracrine manner. Remarkably, using targeted cell ablation systems, we showed that depletion of Wnt<sup>+</sup> fat cells in mice leads to severely impaired beige biogenesis in iWAT in response to cold stress. Similarly impaired beiging response was also seen in iWAT of Akita mice that lack Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes. These observations underscore the functional importance of Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes in triggering adaptive thermogenic program of adipose tissue. Despite that the critical factors produced by Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes to trigger beige adipogenesis remain completely unknown, we conclude that Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes act as a key regulator of beige biogenesis through both cell autonomous (direct conversion) and non-cell autonomous (recruitment) manners, which is thus far only seen in such adipocyte population. However, it is worth noting that even Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes exhibit a thermogenic character, whether the intracellular β-catenin signaling plays a direct role in regulating thermogenic function in adipocytes warrants future investigation.</p><p>The significant contributions of beige adipocytes to improving whole-body metabolism such as glucose homeostasis and countering diet-induced obesity have been well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartelt and Heeren, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crane et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harms and Seale, 2013</xref>). GWAS has also linked genetic variations in <italic>TCF7L2</italic>, a key component of canonical Wnt pathway, to type 2 diabetes in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Voight et al., 2010</xref>). We thus speculated that Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes, driven by insulin/AKT signaling and functioning as a key regulator of beiging in mice, represent a population of beneficial adipocytes and hold the therapeutic potential for metabolic diseases. Accordingly, our results demonstrate whole-body glucose intolerance in mice with targeted ablation of Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes but notably enhanced glucose utilization in mice receiving implantation of exogenously induced Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes, highlighting Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes as a therapeutically appealing candidate of cell source to restore systemic glucose homeostasis. Consistence with the beneficial function of Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes in regulating glucose metabolism is the finding of highly enriched expression of Adipsin coding gene <italic>Cfd</italic> in Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes. The evidence that Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes could be induced from human primary BMSCs opens a door for future translational research.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Animal studies were performed according to procedures approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Tulane University.

To isolate nuclei, cells were lysed for 4 min on ice according to 10 x genomics protocol (CG000169 Rev D). ScATAC-seq libraries were prepared using the 10 x Genomics platform with the Chromium Single Cell ATAC Library &amp; Gel Bead Kit as recommended by the manufacturer and sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq 550 Sequencing System as 150 bp paired-end reads. Peak matrixes and metadata were generated by Cell Ranger ATAC v.1.1.0 pipeline with default parameters and aligned to the mm10 mouse reference genome. Overall, scATAC-seq datasets containing 3,284 iBAT GFP<sup>+</sup> cell (17,706 median fragments per cell), 4650 iBAT GFP<sup>-</sup> cells (9,994 median fragments per cell), 766 iWAT GFP<sup>+</sup> cells (35,731 median fragments per cell), and 1034 iWAT GFP<sup>-</sup> cells (42,083 median fragments per cell) were obtained. Further data analysis was performed using the Signac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>) v.1.0.0 package. In brief, outlier cells with &lt;2000 or &gt; 40,000 peaks (iWAT GFP<sup>+</sup> &gt; 60,000 peaks, iWAT GFP<sup>-</sup> &gt; 90,000 peaks), &lt; 20% reads in peaks, &gt; 0.025 blacklist ratio, &gt; 4 nucleosome signal or TSS-enrichment &lt;2, were considered as low-quality cells or doublets and were removed from downstream analyses. Data of each experiment based on the 95% most common feature were then normalized and scaled through the <italic>FindTopFeatures</italic> and <italic>RunSVD</italic> functions. UMAP and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) were applied to perform non-linear dimension reduction using latent semantic indexing (LSI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cusanovich et al., 2018</xref>) and clustering analysis with the parameter of “resolution = 0.7”. To exclude potential non-adipocytes, gene activity matrix for each experiment was generated by summarizing the accessibility in promoter (TSS and up to 2 kb upstream) and cells with high activity of adipocyte specific marker <italic>Adipoq</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lara-Castro et al., 2007</xref>) were retained for further analysis.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Kosaku Shinoda (Reviewer #1); David Merrick (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The data presented for the beiging effect are insufficient to support the conclusions and would require major revision or could be simply removed as these findings do not significantly enhance the main conclusion that Wnt+ adipocytes exist.</p><p>2) It is necessary to address the issues raised by reviewer 2 regarding the apparent absence of Wnt+ non-adipocyte cells in the tissue. The existing single-nuclei RNA-Seq can be reanalyzed to determine if there are mature adipocytes in vivo with active Tcf/Lef signaling.

Below are suggestions for the authors to help strengthen the conclusion.</p><p>(1) The authors differentiated SVF into mature adipocytes before performing scRNA-seq.

These cells types make up a large portion of the total nuclei in adipose tissues. Thus is it unclear why there are no GFP+ nuclei between the adipocytes (i.e. it appears that almost all GFP+ labeled has disappeared in this mouse model).</p><p>Figure 2E/F: The authors should attempt to provide some explanation as to why LF3 causes such a dramatic inhibition of differentiation in the Wnt-negative adipocytes. If the inhibitor is specific to disrupting Tcf7l1-β-catenin interaction, why does it have such a profound effect on these Wnt-negative cells in which that interaction should not be occurring?</p><p>Figure 4 E/G, 5S<sup>-1</sup>: It is not possible (especially in the iBAT/beige) to confidently assign the GFP+ nuclei to adipocytes based on the images presented. The only conclusion2`````` that can be drawn from these experiments is that Wnt+ cells (both stromal and adipocyte) are decreased with the interventions.</p><p>Figure 5 A/B/D: The proximity data are not convincing given the presence of GFP+ nuclei within regions of high membrane potential (to the left and below the yellow box), and in regions without beiging. Thus the conclusions that Wnt+ cells (again they cannot be confidently identified as adipocyte nuclei) regulate beiging is not supported by these data.</p><p>Figure 5 E: Cold exposure and tamoxifen administration are both well-documented stimuli for de novo adipogenesis from precursor cells.</p><p>Figure S1-1 E shows robust labeling of Wnt+ progenitor cells intercalated between the mature adipocytes in iWAT. Thus is it plausible that the lineage-traced beige adipocytes are derived from Wnt+ precursor cells? The authors' conclusion that the T/L-CreER lineage tracing shows &quot;unambiguous evidence&quot; that these adipocytes are derived from Wnt+ mature adipocytes is overstated and should be removed.</p><p>Figure S5-1: Fabp4 is expressed in adipocyte progenitor cells, which are also Wnt+, thus these cell populations will likely be depleted with diphtheria toxin injection and could account for the loss of GFP+ nuclei in the tissues. Depletion of these progenitors could impair de-novo beige adipogenesis leading to the observed phenotype.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– The involvement of TCF7L2 is also probed using a specific inhibitor of the β-catenin/TCF7L2 interactions, LF3, which inhibited reporter expression. Inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling was without effect. The use of additional activators and inhibitors of the destruction pathway would broaden the comparability of this study to previous literature on the role of Wnt in adipose differentiation.</p><p>– It is not clear why scRNASeq was chosen over RNASeq on the population, since the fat content of adipocytes may preclude full characterization of the most differentiated cells. RNASeq of a set of independently derived Wnt+ and Wnt- adipocytes may be more informative.</p><p>– An additional concern is that diphtheria toxin-induced cell death will lead to tissue inflammation, with potential functional effects on thermogenesis. The degree of cell death and inflammation should be measured and reported.</p><p>– The impaired beiging in the Akita mouse should be strengthened by RT-PCR and western blotting for UCP1 in the entire fat pads of a cohort of independent control and Akita mice. These results, as well as measurements of whether the mice are able to defend their body temperature in response to a cold challenge, would be required to unambiguously conclude that Akita mice display impaired beiging.</p><p>– Implantation experiments need measurement of the volume of the tissues formed from implanted cells and some basic histological metrics including the degree of vascularization.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77740.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The data presented for the beiging effect are insufficient to support the conclusions and would require major revision or could be simply removed as these findings do not significantly enhance the main conclusion that Wnt+ adipocytes exist.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that the effect of Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes on beiging response is a critical function of such adipocytes and an important part of this paper, we thus would like to keep the results in the paper. To support this conclusion, we now present additional evidence with two different mouse lines that exhibit similarly compromised beiging response upon cold challenge: 1) to avoid potential side effects of tamoxifen in triggering low level of adipocyte apoptosis and inducing non-physiological beiging, we created a Tcf/Lef-rtTA mouse line and used it to ablate Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes upon compounding with TRE-Cre and Fabp4-Flex-DTA mice; 2) to avoid potential side effects of DTA-induced cell death on adipose tissues, we compounded the Tcf/Lef-rtTA allele with TRE-Cre and floxed <italic>Pparg</italic> alleles (<italic>Pparg</italic><sup>F/F</sup>) to prevent the differentiation of Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes. These new results are included in the revision as supplemental results (Figure 5—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is necessary to address the issues raised by reviewer 2 regarding the apparent absence of Wnt+ non-adipocyte cells in the tissue. The existing single-nuclei RNA-Seq can be reanalyzed to determine if there are mature adipocytes in vivo with active Tcf/Lef signaling. This could eliminate the possibility that GFP signaling is a nonspecific signal from stromal cells, and would be necessary to validate the hypothesis that the fluorescent Wnt reporter is representative of physiologically relevant Tcf7l2 signaling.</p></disp-quote><p>We have never seen any GFP-positive cells in freshly isolated SVFs by FACS in many experiments. A piece of representative FACS results is now included in the revision (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A). GFP expression was also never seen in plated SVFs (Figure 2A). We therefore believe that although some stromal cells may possess basal Wnt signaling activity, the lack of Wnt<sup>+</sup> non-adipocyte cells in adipose tissues could be attributed to the relatively low level of canonical Wnt signaling activity, which is below the threshold for activating Tcf/Lef-GFP reporter. This assumption is supported by 1) while Wnt<sup>-</sup> adipocytes do not express the Tcf/Lef-GFP reporter, LF3 administration still delays maturation of Wnt<sup>-</sup> adipocytes, suggesting that Wnt<sup>-</sup> adipocytes have functional basal Wnt signaling activity (Figure 2—figure supplement 1E). This conclusion is in line with several previous reports that showed the presence of basal Wnt signaling activity in overall mature adipocytes and its role in controlling de novo lipogenesis (Bagchi et al., 2020; Geoghegan et al., 2019; Mori et al., 2012); 2) shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 3B, human stromal cells infected with Tcf/Lef-GFP reporter exhibited GFP expression in almost all cells under pro-osteogenic induction that stimulates hyperactivation of Wnt canonical signaling. In addition, other well-known Wnt<sup>+</sup> cells in the T/L-GFP mice we used in the current studies such as muscle cells and dermal cells express GFP signals specifically, validating the specificity of the reporter allele.</p><p>We took the advice by Reviewer 2 and intersected our scRNA-seq data on Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes with the published single-nucleus sequencing (sNuc-seq) dataset of mouse iWAT (Emont et al., 2022). Because the activation of Tcf/Lef signaling in the Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes is relied on AKT/mTOR signaling but not the conventional Wnt ligands and receptors, those traditional downstream markers of Wnt signaling such <italic>Axins</italic> were not found specifically enriched in Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes. Therefore, the AKT/mTOR-dependent Wnt signaling in Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes appears to regulate the expression of genes distinct from that controlled by the conventional Wnt signaling pathway. This conclusion is supported by our recent studies that inhibition of this AKT/mTOR-dependent Wnt signaling by LF3 in Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes negatively impact pathways implicated in “PI3K/Akt signaling”, “insulin signaling”, “thermogenesis”, and “fatty acid metabolism” et al. (see below for details). However, we found that one cluster (mAd3) of sNuc-seq dataset, which is relatively enriched in <italic>Tcf7l2</italic>, expresses remarkably high levels of <italic>Cyp2e1</italic> as well as <italic>Cfd</italic> that encodes Adipsin. These genes, regarded as hallmark of mAd3 cluster, are also uniquely or highly expressed in Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes. Interestingly, the percentage of mAd3 among the total iWAT adipocytes in chow-fed male group is about 5%, which is very close to that of Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes in vivo (~7%). Thus, mAd3 possibly represents Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes in iWAT. These analyses are included in the revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is desirable to strengthen the characterization of what Wnt signaling pathway is involved, and of its interaction with the insulin/PI3K/AKT/MTOR pathway, as outlined by Reviewer 3.</p></disp-quote><p>To explore the downstream targets of the intracellular Wnt signaling in Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes, we have performed RNA-seq on Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes with and without LF3 treatment. The KEGG pathway analysis of DEGs (fold change &gt; 2, FDR &lt; 0.05) showed that the primarily affected (downregulated) pathways in LF3-treated Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes are “PI3K/Akt signaling”, “thermogenesis”, “insulin signaling”, “fatty acid metabolism” et al. These results indicate that the intracellular Wnt signaling indeed mediates the function of the insulin/PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. The results are now included in the revision (Figure 4—figure supplement 1F, G).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I found no major flaws in the method – this is a very impressive and innovative finding, worthy of publication in eLife.

Our new results using TRE-Cre;Tcf/Lef-rtTA;Fabp4-Flex-DTA mice as well as TRE-Cre;Tcf/Lef-rtTA;<italic>Pparg</italic><sup>F/F</sup> mice showed similar compromised beiging response upon cold challenge.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5 E: Cold exposure and tamoxifen administration are both well-documented stimuli for de novo adipogenesis from precursor cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this reviewer. To avoid potential side effects of tamoxifen, we created a Tcf/Lef-rtTA mouse line and used it to ablate Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes upon compounding with TRE-Cre and Fabp4-Flex-DTA mice. These results are included in the revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure S1-1 E shows robust labeling of Wnt+ progenitor cells intercalated between the mature adipocytes in iWAT. Thus is it plausible that the lineage-traced beige adipocytes are derived from Wnt+ precursor cells? The authors' conclusion that the T/L-CreER lineage tracing shows &quot;unambiguous evidence&quot; that these adipocytes are derived from Wnt+ mature adipocytes is overstated and should be removed.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, GFP reporter is not activated in freshly isolated SVFs including Wnt<sup>+</sup> precursor cells. This point is further supported by the evidence that the percentage of Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes did not increase after cold and CL316,243 stimulations (Figure 5-figurte supplement 1E). In addition, the T/L-GFP reporter is never activated until adipogenic differentiation in the immortalized precursor cell lines (GFPpos<sup>-1</sup>, and -2) of Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure S5-1: Fabp4 is expressed in adipocyte progenitor cells, which are also Wnt+, thus these cell populations will likely be depleted with diphtheria toxin injection and could account for the loss of GFP+ nuclei in the tissues. Depletion of these progenitors could impair de-novo beige adipogenesis leading to the observed phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>As above discussed, the T/L-GFP allele is not activated in SVFs, thus it would not cause ablation of precursor cells of Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes in T/L-DTA mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– The involvement of TCF7L2 is also probed using a specific inhibitor of the β-catenin/TCF7L2 interactions, LF3, which inhibited reporter expression. Inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling was without effect. The use of additional activators and inhibitors of the destruction pathway would broaden the comparability of this study to previous literature on the role of Wnt in adipose differentiation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It is not clear why scRNASeq was chosen over RNASeq on the population, since the fat content of adipocytes may preclude full characterization of the most differentiated cells. RNASeq of a set of independently derived Wnt+ and Wnt- adipocytes may be more informative.</p></disp-quote><p>With scRNA-seq, it would be more convincing to identify specific subpopulation of cells, as adipocytes are well known to be heterogenous. In addition, the cell lines are immortalized and biasedly selected. Thus, they may not best reflect the overall true gene expression signature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– An additional concern is that diphtheria toxin-induced cell death will lead to tissue inflammation, with potential functional effects on thermogenesis. The degree of cell death and inflammation should be measured and reported.</p></disp-quote><p>To avoid potential side effects of DTA-induced cell death on adipose tissues, we compounded the Tcf/Lef-rtTA allele with TRE-Cre and floxed <italic>Pparg</italic> alleles (<italic>Pparg</italic><sup>F/F</sup>) to prevent the differentiation of Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes. These new results are included in the revision as supplemental results (Figure 5—figure supplement 2G).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The impaired beiging in the Akita mouse should be strengthened by RT-PCR and western blotting for UCP1 in the entire fat pads of a cohort of independent control and Akita mice. These results, as well as measurements of whether the mice are able to defend their body temperature in response to a cold challenge, would be required to unambiguously conclude that Akita mice display impaired beiging.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, RT-PCR and Western blotting results for UCP1 expression are included.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Implantation experiments need measurement of the volume of the tissues formed from implanted cells and some basic histological metrics including the degree of vascularization.</p></disp-quote><p>We used the same number (1.3 x 10<sup>6</sup>) of both control and Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes for each implantation in our studies. However, the size of fat pads varied due to different compaction and distribution, which makes it very difficult to measure the degree of vascularization.</p><p>Reference</p><p>Bagchi, D.P., Li, Z., Corsa, C.A., Hardij, J., Mori, H., Learman, B.S., Lewis, K.T., Schill, R.L., Romanelli, S.M., and MacDougald, O.A.
