In response to environmental change, some aspects of development adjust to generate plastic phenotypes. Other aspects of development, however, are buffered against environmental change to produce robust phenotypes. How organ development is coordinated to accommodate both plastic and robust developmental responses is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the steroid hormone ecdysone coordinates both plasticity of organ size and robustness of organ pattern in the developing wings of the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Using fed and starved larvae that lack prothoracic glands, which synthesize ecdysone, we show that nutrition regulates growth both via ecdysone and via an ecdysone-independent mechanism, while nutrition regulates patterning only via ecdysone. We then demonstrate that growth shows a graded response to ecdysone concentration, while patterning shows a threshold response. Collectively, these data support a model where nutritionally regulated ecdysone fluctuations confer plasticity by regulating disc growth in response to basal ecdysone levels and confer robustness by initiating patterning only once ecdysone peaks exceed a threshold concentration. This could represent a generalizable mechanism through which hormones coordinate plastic growth with robust patterning in the face of environmental change.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>phenotypic plasticity</kwd><kwd>developmental robustness</kwd><kwd>growth rates</kwd><kwd>patterning rates</kwd><kwd>wing disc</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FT170100259</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mirth</surname><given-names>Christen K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS-0919855</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shingleton</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS-1557638</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shingleton</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS-1952385</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shingleton</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Wings achieve plasticity in size while maintaining robust pattern via ecdysone, which elicits graded responses for growth rates and threshold responses for patterning rates, in the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Developing animals respond to changes in their environment in a multitude of ways, for example, altering how long and how fast they grow, the time it takes them to mature, and their reproductive output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nylin and Gotthard, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">West-Eberhard, 1989</xref>). Other aspects of their phenotype, however, must be unresponsive to environmental change to ensure that they function correctly regardless of environmental conditions. This presents a particular problem for morphological traits of developing animals. For any given trait, some aspects, such as final organ size, vary with changes in the environment, a phenomenon termed plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beldade et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Koyama et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shingleton, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mirth and Shingleton, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nijhout et al., 2017</xref>). Other aspects, like patterning the cell types within an organ necessary for it to function, remain constant across environmental conditions and are thus termed robust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mirth and Shingleton, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nijhout et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Félix and Barkoulas, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Félix and Wagner, 2008</xref>). For many organs, growth and patterning occur at the same time during development, and may even be regulated by the same hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mirth and Shingleton, 2019</xref>). How then do organs achieve plasticity in size while maintaining the robustness of pattern?</p><p>If we want to extract general principles of how organisms regulate their development in variable environments, we need to understand how developmental processes unfold over time. Several recent studies that have applied systems approaches to development offer excellent examples, frequently employing methods to quantify how gene expression patterns change over time. These studies have used the dynamic changes in expression patterns to uncover the rules governing how insects build their segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Surkova et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Surkova et al., 2009b</xref>), how the gene regulatory network underlying segmentation evolves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clark, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clark and Akam, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clark and Peel, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crombach et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Verd et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wotton et al., 2015</xref>), how morphogen gradients scale across organs and bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almuedo-Castillo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schwank et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wartlick et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hamaratoglu et al., 2011</xref>), how sensory organs are positioned within epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Corson et al., 2017</xref>), and how somites and digits form in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Raspopovic et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dubrulle et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2006</xref>). The power of these approaches is that they provide a framework for understanding how genes interact within a network to generate a pattern that can be applied across a variety of contexts.</p><p>The success of these studies is, in part, due to the fact that the gene regulatory networks underlying each of these processes have been well described in their respective developmental contexts. In contrast, the gene regulatory networks governing growth and patterning at later stages of development, even at later stages of embryonic development, are not as well resolved. If we further complicate this by comparing development across environmental conditions and even across traits, approaches that rely on understanding the configuration of gene regulatory networks become much more difficult to implement.</p><p>Nevertheless, we can still use the principle of comparing the dynamics of developmental processes across environments to gain useful insights into the relationship between plasticity and robustness. Many types of environmental conditions impact organ development to induce changes in body and organ size. Malnutrition or starvation reduces growth rates in all animals, resulting in smaller body and organ sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nijhout, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nijhout et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mirth and Shingleton, 2012</xref>). Similarly, changing temperature can alter animal growth. In insect species, rearing animals in warmer conditions results in smaller adult body sizes when compared to animals reared under cooler conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azevedo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">David et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">French et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">James et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Partridge et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Grunert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Reynolds and Nottingham, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Thomas, 1993</xref>). Other factors like oxygen availability and the presence of toxic or noxious compounds also act to alter animal sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Callier and Nijhout, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Callier et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Glendinning, 2003</xref>). Examining how organ growth and patterning progress across these environmental conditions helps us to understand how these two processes are coordinated.</p><p>We already have some understanding of the mechanisms that regulate growth and patterning in response to changing environmental conditions. The genetic mechanisms underlying plasticity in growth are best elucidated in insects. In insects, changes in available nutrition affect the synthesis and secretion of the conserved insulin-like peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wu and Brown, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brogiolo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ikeya et al., 2002</xref>). Insulin-like peptides bind to the insulin receptor in target tissues and activate the insulin signalling cascade, ultimately leading to increased growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brogiolo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yenush et al., 1996</xref>). Starvation reduces the concentration of insulin-like peptides in the hemolymph, or insect blood, and the resulting decrease in insulin signalling causes organs to grow more slowly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ikeya et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Géminard et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>While changes in insulin signalling are known to affect organ size, they have little effect on organ pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Weinkove and Leevers, 2000</xref>). However, studies in the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> have shown that, at least in this insect, insulin acts to control the synthesis of a second developmental hormone, the steroid hormone ecdysone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caldwell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Colombani et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mirth et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Koyama et al., 2014</xref>). Most of the body and organ growth in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> occurs in the third, and final, larval instar, after which the animal initiates metamorphosis at pupariation. Either starving or reducing insulin signalling early in the third instar delays the timing of ecdysone synthesis, thereby prolonging the length of the third instar and the time it takes to metamorphose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caldwell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Colombani et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mirth et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Koyama et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shingleton et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>In addition to its effects on developmental time, ecdysone controls the growth of the developing adult organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stieper et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Herboso et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gokhale et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dye et al., 2017</xref>). In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> larvae, many of the adult organs form and grow inside the larvae as pouches of cells called imaginal discs. If ecdysone synthesis is reduced or if the glands that produce ecdysone, the prothoracic glands (PG), are ablated, these imaginal discs grow at greatly reduced rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Herboso et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mirth et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Ecdysone signalling also regulates organ patterning. Reducing ecdysone signalling in either the wing imaginal disc or the developing ovary causes substantial delays in their patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Herboso et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mirth et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mendes and Mirth, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gancz et al., 2011</xref>). In the wing disc, reducing ecdysone signalling stalls the progression of patterning of sensory bristles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Herboso et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mirth et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, in the ovary terminal filament cell specification and the rate of terminal filament addition both require ecdysone to progress normally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mendes and Mirth, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gancz et al., 2011</xref>). Given its role in both the patterning and the growth of imaginal discs and ovaries, ecdysone is potentially a key coordinator of plastic growth and robust pattern.</p><p>Characterizing organ growth rates is experimentally straightforward, requiring only accurate measurement of changes in organ size over time. To quantify the progression of organ patterning, however, requires developing a staging scheme. We previously developed such a scheme for the wing imaginal disc in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. This scheme makes use of the dynamic changes in expression from the moult to the third instar to pupariation of up to seven patterning-gene products in the developing wing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Oliveira et al., 2014</xref>). Two of these patterning-gene products, Achaete and Senseless, can be classed into seven different stages throughout third-instar development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Oliveira et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), providing us with the ability to quantify the progression of wing disc pattern over a variety of conditions. In short, by describing patterning on a near-continuous scale, our scheme not only allows us to determine under what conditions patterning is initiated, but also the rate at which it progresses.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Quantitative assessments of the progression of patterning allow us to test hypotheses about the relationship between the size and patterning stage of the developing wing.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The staging scheme developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Oliveira et al., 2014</xref> to quantify the progression of Achaete and Senseless pattern. The pattern elements shown in orange are diagnostic for each stage, which is indicated by the number beside the disc.

One hypothesis is that growth and patterning occur at different times, with ecdysone driving growth first then pattern later, or vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mirth and Shingleton, 2019</xref>). If this were true, we would expect to identify an interval where ecdysone concentrations primarily affected growth and a second interval where they affected mostly pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). There is some precedence for this idea; most of the patterning in the wing discs and ovaries of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> occurs 15 hr after the moult to the third larval instar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mendes and Mirth, 2016</xref>). Similarly, wing discs are known to grow faster in the early part of the third instar and slow their growth in the mid-to-late third instar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shingleton et al., 2008</xref>). As a second hypothesis, ecdysone could coordinate plastic growth with robust pattern if the impacts of ecdysone on one of these processes depended on its effects on the other. For example, morphogens are known to regulate both growth and patterning of the wing. If ecdysone controlled the action of morphogens, we would expect the progression of patterning to be tightly coupled to growth over time, with different aspects of patterning being initiated at different disc sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Finally, a third hypothesis is that ecdysone regulates the growth and patterning of the wing discs independently, and that each process responds in a qualitatively and quantitatively different manner to ecdysone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mirth and Shingleton, 2019</xref>). As an example of this, we might see that growth rates increase in a graded response to increasing ecdysone while patterning shows threshold responses, or vice versa.

However, to do so it must lie downstream of the physiological mechanisms that sense and respond to environmental change. As discussed above, ecdysone synthesis is regulated by the activity of the insulin-signalling pathway, which is in turn regulated by nutrition. Starving larvae of yeast early in the third instar both suppress insulin signalling and inhibit growth and patterning of organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mirth et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mendes and Mirth, 2016</xref>). We explored whether ecdysone was able to rescue some of this inhibition by transferring larvae immediately after the moult to 1% sucrose food that contained either 20E or ethanol and comparing their growth and patterning after 24 hr to wing discs from larvae fed on normal food.

This suggests that nutrition can drive growth through mechanisms independent of ecdysone, and vice versa. In contrast, nutrition alone only marginally promoted Achaete and Senseless patterning in starved PGX larvae, while 20E alone completely restored patterning. Further, even early patterning did not progress in PGX larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Thus, the effect of nutrition on patterning appears to be wholly mediated by ecdysone, while the effect of nutrition on growth appears to be partially mediated by ecdysone and partially through another independent mechanism. Ecdysone-independent growth appears to occur early in the third larval instar, however, since disc growth in PGX and control larvae is more or less the same in the first 12 hr after ecdysis to L3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Ecdysone drives growth and patterning independently</title><p>The data above suggest a model of growth and patterning, where both ecdysone and nutrition can drive growth, but where patterning is driven by ecdysone. We next focused on exploring how ecdysone regulates both growth and patterning. Patterning genes, particularly morphogens, are known to regulate growth, so one hypothesis is that ecdysone promotes patterning, which in turn promotes the ecdysone-driven component of disc growth. A second related hypothesis is that ecdysone-driven growth is necessary to promote patterning. Under either of these hypotheses, because the mechanisms regulating patterning and growth are interdependent, we would expect that changes in ecdysone levels would not change the relationship between disc size and disc pattern. An alternative hypothesis, therefore, is that ecdysone promotes growth and patterning through at least partially independent mechanisms. Under this hypothesis, the relationship between size and patterning may change at different levels of ecdysone.</p><p>To distinguish between these two hypotheses, we increased or decreased the activity of the insulin-signalling pathway in the PG, which is known to increase or decrease the level of circulating ecdysone, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caldwell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Koyama et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Colombani et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mirth et al., 2005</xref>). We then looked at how these manipulations affected the relationship between disc size and disc pattern, again focusing on Achaete and Senseless patterning.

Changing ecdysone levels, however, significantly changed the parameters of the linear model and altered the relationship between disc size and Achaete pattern.

Further, growth is also regulated by an ecdysone-independent mechanism, enabling similar progressions of pattern across discs of different sizes. An added nuance, however, is that ecdysone levels are not constant throughout development. Rather, the ecdysone titre fluctuates through a series of peaks throughout the third larval instar and the dynamics of these fluctuations are environmentally sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Warren et al., 2006</xref>). To gain further insight into how ecdysone co-regulates plasticity and robustness, we therefore explored which aspects of ecdysone dynamics regulate growth and patterning.</p><p>Two characteristics of ecdysone fluctuations appear to be important with respect to growth and patterning. First, the timing of the ecdysone peaks set the pace of development, initiating key developmental transitions such as larval wandering and pupariation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Koyama et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mirth et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Warren et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Riddiford, 1993</xref>). Second, the basal levels of ecdysone appear to regulate the rate of body growth, with an increase in basal level leading to a reduction in body growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caldwell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Herboso et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Colombani et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mirth et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mirth et al., 2014</xref>). While several studies, including this one, have established that disc growth is positively regulated by ecdysone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Herboso et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dye et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Parker and Shingleton, 2011</xref>), whether disc growth is driven by basal levels or peaks of ecdysone is unknown.</p><p>There are a number of hypotheses as to how ecdysone levels may drive patterning and growth. One hypothesis is that patterning and ecdysone-regulated disc growth show threshold responses, which are initiated once ecdysone rises above a certain level. This would manifest as low patterning and growth rates when ecdysteroid titres were sub-threshold, and a sharp, switch-like increase in patterning and growth rates after threshold ecdysone concentrations was reached. Alternatively, both may show a graded response, with patterning and growth rates increasing continuously with increasing ecdysteroid titres. Finally, disc patterning may show one type of response to ecdysone, while disc growth may show another. Separating these hypotheses requires the ability to titrate levels of ecdysone.</p><p>To do this, we reared PGX larvae on standard food supplemented with a range of 20E concentrations (0, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 ng of ecdysone/mg of food).

For both control genotypes and PGX larvae, increasing the concentration of 20E in the food increased ecdysteroids titres in the larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>h).</p><p>To quantify the effects of 20E concentration in the wing disc growth, we dissected discs at 5 hr intervals starting immediately after the moult to the third instar (0 hr AL3E) to 20 hr AL3E.

While this might seem a simple feat when growth and patterning occur at separate times or are regulated by different hormones, it is considerably less simple if both growth and patterning occur at the same time and are regulated by the same endocrine signal. In this work, we explored how the wing discs of developing <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> use the same hormonal signal to coordinate both their growth and progression of pattern. We found that ecdysone simultaneously regulates the plastic growth and robust patterning of the wing disc through independent mechanisms: plastic growth responds to ecdysone with a graded response, while robust patterning responds with a single threshold response. We propose that these differences in response represent a potentially general mechanism through which high levels of variation in one organ characteristic, for example, size, could be coordinated with low levels of variation in another characteristic of the same organ, for example, pattern.</p><p>These data make an important contribution to our understanding of how environmental factors, specifically nutrition, affect growth and patterning in developing organs in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. During normal development, circulating ecdysone levels are low during the first 8 hr of the third larval instar until attainment of a critical size initiates a hormonal cascade that causes ecdysone to fluctuate through a series of characteristic peaks. Each of these peaks is associated with key developmental transitions and prepares the larva for metamorphosis. Low nutrition delays attainment of critical size and the initiation of these peaks, but also appears to raise basal levels of circulating ecdysone between these peaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al., 2018</xref>), which slows the growth of the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). At the same time, low nutrition also lowers the levels of circulating insulin-like peptides, further slowing the growth of the body. While low levels of insulin signalling will suppress imaginal disc growth, the increase in ecdysone concentrations resulting from starvation opposes some of these effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Herboso et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dye et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Parker and Shingleton, 2011</xref>) by promoting imaginal disc growth.</p><p>Our data suggest that these opposing effects are critical to robust patterning of the wing under different nutritional conditions. At low nutritional conditions, low insulin signalling at the beginning of the third larval instar slows the growth of the body and the imaginal discs. At this stage, growth of the wing imaginal discs is less dependent on ecdysone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shingleton et al., 2008</xref>), evident from the more moderate effects on growth of the wing discs during this period in fed PGX larvae. In the middle of the third larval instar, however, low nutritional conditions elevate basal levels of ecdysone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). This drives disc growth independent of insulin signalling to ensure the discs are of sufficient size to generate viable adult appendages, even as elevated ecdysone suppresses the growth of the body as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caldwell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Colombani et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mirth et al., 2005</xref>;). At the same time, changes in the tempo of the ecdysone fluctuations may ensure that patterning is initiated at the appropriate developmental time, when discs are sufficient size to generate a viable adult appendage. Three factors therefore appear necessary to achieve variable size but robust patterning under a range of nutritional conditions: (1) a graded growth response to ecdysone, (2) nutritionally sensitive growth that is independent of ecdysone, and (3) a threshold patterning response to ecdysone.</p><p>There is some evidence that our findings apply to patterning and growth of the wings in other insect species. In the tobacco hornworm <italic>Manduca sexta</italic> and the buckeye butterfly <italic>Junonia coenia</italic>, wing disc growth is regulated by both ecdysone and insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Strassburger et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Parker and Struhl, 2015</xref>). In the butterfly <italic>J. coenia,</italic> the patterning stage of wing discs can be quantified by the extent of tracheal invasion, resulting in wing vein patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Miner et al., 2000</xref>). In this species<italic>,</italic> wing vein patterning progresses independently of wing size in starved versus fed caterpillars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Miner et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, the independent regulation of growth and patterning, with growth regulated by both insulin and ecdysone signalling, may be a general mechanism to achieve robust patterning across a range of wing sizes.</p><p>While ecdysone and insulin signalling provide systemic cues that tune organ growth to the environmental conditions, morphogens like Wingless and Decapentaplegic (Dpp) act to regulate growth in an organ-autonomous manner. The extent to which morphogen gradients respond to these systemic cues is unclear, although the activity of morphogens is known to interact with those of systemic signals at the level of the target genes. For example, insulin/TOR signalling regulates the activity of Yorkie, a downstream effector of patterning morphogens, including Wingless and Dpp, which controls the rate of cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Parker and Struhl, 2015</xref>). Similarly, reducing ecdysone signalling in the wing reduces the expression of Wingless and reduces Dpp signalling, measured by the levels of phosphorylated Mothers against Dpp expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Herboso et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dye et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mirth et al., 2009</xref>). Taken together, the signalling pathways that regulate organ growth in response to environmental conditions interact in complex ways with those that regulate organ-autonomous growth, suggesting that these two growth-regulating mechanisms are not as independent as previously thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mirth and Shingleton, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Although the growth of the disc relies on insulin and ecdysone signalling, the progression of patterning for Achaete and Senseless in the wing disc appears to be driven by threshold responses to ecdysone. This is not to say that the progression of patterning does not depend on environmental conditions. Indeed, starvation early in the third instar impedes patterning in both the wing and ovary of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mirth et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mendes and Mirth, 2016</xref>). However, rather than resulting from a direct effect of insulin signalling on patterning, the block in the progression of pattern occurs because insulin signalling controls the timing of the first ecdysone pulse in the third larval instar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Koyama et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ohhara et al., 2017</xref>). Our results here confirm that patterning requires suprathreshold concentrations of ecdysone to be initiated. Further, the manner in which ecdysone regulates the progression of patterning ensures that it remains robust against further environmental perturbation. By switching on pattern above threshold ecdysone concentrations, the disc can continue to pattern across a range of environmental conditions, even while growth retains sensitivity to those conditions.</p><p>A similar threshold mechanism appears to regulate patterning in the wing discs of other insects. As for <italic>Drosophila,</italic> the earliest stages of wing patterning depend on nutrition in <italic>J. coenia</italic>. If caterpillars are starved before the wing discs begin to pattern, then their discs remain small and their veins unpatterned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Miner et al., 2000</xref>). In caterpillars starved at later stages after disc patterning has been initiated, the wing discs are small but reach the same vein patterning stage as those of fed control animals. Whether or not the initiation of patterning in <italic>J. coenia</italic> also depends on ecdysone has yet to be determined.</p><p>At first glance, the observation that patterning shows a threshold response to ecdysone may not be surprising. In any given cell, patterning is inherently regulated by threshold responses because the expression of the patterning gene product is either on or off in that cell. However, our patterning scheme considers the progression of patterning across the entire field of cells that make up the wing disc. Cells across the wing disc turn on Achaete and Senseless expression at different times, resulting in a continuous progression of pattern with time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Oliveira et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, like growth, the progression of pattern can vary in rate depending on environmental and hormonal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Oliveira et al., 2014</xref>). Consequently, the progression of patterning could, in principle, also show a graded response to ecdysone levels. The observation that once ecdysone concentrations are above threshold, the rate of patterning for Achaete and Senseless is independent of ecdysone provides evidence that the rate of patterning across an entire organ can also show a threshold response: an assumption that, hitherto, has not been tested.</p><p>What determines how progression of pattering unfolds through time is unclear. We did not observe discs progressing from stage 1 immediately to stage 7 within a single 5 hr time interval even at the highest 20E concentrations. This suggests that there are additional temporal factors that regulate the order of patterning progression. Almost certainly, interactions between the gene regulatory networks that regulate patterning control how patterning progresses across regions of the wing disc. We have very little understanding if/how the different regions of the wing communicate with each other to achieve this. In principle, differences between when cells turn on Achaete and Senseless across the disc could arise in response to other developmental signals, such as from the Dpp, Wingless, or Hedgehog morphogen gradients responsible for correctly scaling and patterning the wing.</p><p>Part of this temporal signature might arise from ecdysone itself. In this study, we exposed animals to tonic concentrations of ecdysone. Developing larvae, however, secrete four pulses of ecdysteroids between the moult to the third instar and pupariation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Warren et al., 2006</xref>). We have little understanding of how developmental information is encoded within these pulses. In principle, individual pulses could either prime tissues to become responsive to hormones or could alter their sensitivity – as the early ecdysone pulse does for wing disc growth and patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mirth et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mendes and Mirth, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shingleton et al., 2008</xref>). Future studies comparing the difference between tonic and phasic exposure to hormone would help clarify the roles of the ecdysone pulses.</p><p>While our study has focussed on contrasting the robustness of patterning with plasticity of growth, depending on what is being measured there are instances where we expect patterning to also show plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mirth et al., 2021</xref>). For example, although the specification of cell types in the correct location within an organ may show little variation across environmental conditions, the number of structures specified can vary. The total number of abdominal and sternopleural bristles varies with temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Moreteau and David, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Moreteau et al., 2003</xref>), as does the number of terminal filament stacks that are specified in the ovary, which is also affected by nutrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">David, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Delpuech et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Green and Extavour, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hodin and Riddiford, 2000</xref>). Plasticity in the number of bristle cells or terminal filament stacks presumably occurs because the mechanisms that specify the number of each structure do not scale with organ size. In other cases, the location of specific cell types may also be plastic. For example, there is extensive literature exploring how the relative positions of veins in the wings of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and other insects are affected by environmental factors such as nutrition and temperature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Debat et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Debat et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Outomuro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bitner-Mathé and Klaczko, 1999</xref>). Plasticity in wing shape is likely to be more complex and may involve a process that acts at many different points during wing development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Matamoro-Vidal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cobham and Mirth, 2020</xref>). Future studies targeting how the mechanisms that establish the position of cell types differ from those that determine the number of cells of a given type would allow us to further define what makes traits either sensitive or robust towards changes in environmental conditions, and at what level.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks and rearing conditions</title><p>We manipulated growth rates and developmental timing by altering the rates of ecdysone synthesis in developing <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> larvae.

We then transferred them onto either sucrose food or SYA food that did not contain ecdysone but was dyed blue. They were left to feed for 2 hr until their guts were filled with blue food. This extra step was taken so that we could be sure that our hemolymph ecdysone titres were not contaminated with ecdysone from the food. 30–40 larvae were then weighed as a group and transferred to five times their weight in volume of ice-cold methanol.

Lines 918 – 931 now read:</p><p>“At first glance, the observation that patterning shows a threshold response to ecdysone may not be surprising. In any given cell, patterning is inherently regulated by threshold responses because the expression of the patterning gene product is either on or off in that cell. However, our patterning scheme considers the progression of patterning across the entire field of cells that make up the wing disc. Cells across the wing disc turn on Achaete and Senseless expression at different times, resulting in a continuous progression of pattern with time [42]. Furthermore, like growth, the progression of pattern can vary in rate depending on environmental and hormonal conditions [42]. Consequently, the progression of patterning could, in principle, also show a graded response to ecdysone levels. The observation that once ecdysone concentrations are above threshold, the rate of patterning for Achaete and Senseless is independent of ecdysone provides evidence that the rate of patterning across an entire organ can also show a threshold response: an assumption that, hitherto, has not been tested.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Be consistent in formatting the references.

To clarify this point, we have now plotted the linear growth rate for each 20E concentration, and fit this data with a Michaelis Menten model (Figure 7B). This model shows that as 20E concentrations increase, the linear growth rate also increases, although the rate of increase slows down at concentrations greater than 25 ng/ml. In contrast, Achaete and Senseless patterning rates of increase show switch -like responses that are best fit with a log-logistic models (please see the new figure panels Figure 7B, Figure 8B and D, Figure 9B and D, and accompanying text lines 522-807).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– A related comment, the authors state that 6.25mg/mL of 20E was insufficient to rescue Ac patterning, whereas 25mg/mL of 20E and above rescued Ac patterning, and from these data, they conclude that there is a threshold response to ecdysone. However, the authors also state that 12.5mg/mL showed intermediate levels of patterning. It would be helpful to explain how an intermediate level of patterning is distinct from a graded response.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, the way this was originally phrased was confusing. We have addressed this by altering our analysis to focus on the key point highlighted above: does ecdysone after rates of growth and patterning as a graded or threshold response? By extracting the linear rates of increase from the growth and patterning dataset, we show that growth rates increase gradually with 20E concentration (Figure 7B). In contrast, Achaete and Senseless patterning rates are best fit with a threshold response function (Figure 8B and D, Figure 9B and D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It is unclear why the authors focused on the first 20-hours after 3rd larval ecdysis for the experiments with defined concentrations of supplemental 20E, especially when they state elsewhere in the manuscript that wing disc growth seems to be independent of ecdysone at early 3rd instar stages. Would there be a more pronounced difference between 20E concentrations on wing disc growth at later stages of development?</p></disp-quote><p>The reason for we focused on the first 20 hours of the third instar is that wing disc patterning becomes ecdysone independent around 10-15 hours. It is important to note that wing disc growth does depend on ecdysone in starved larvae in the first 20 hours, but the effects are not as strong in fed larvae.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– While the data suggest that wing disc growth exhibits a graded response to 20E, these data remain correlative. There is no demonstration that plasticity of wing disc growth is caused by a graded response to ecdysone.

Interestingly, Figure 5A suggests that the PG secretes an inhibitory growth signal because starved larvae supplemented with 20E have smaller discs than PGX starved larvae supplemented with 20E. It is possible that ecdysone-independent nutritional signaling could determine plasticity of wing growth.</p></disp-quote><p>If we have understood the reviewer’s comments correctly, they state that the relationship between wing disc growth and 20E concentration is correlative. If we had measured ecdysteroid titres in the hemolymph and related these to wing disc growth rates, we would agree that the data is correlative. However, we experimentally manipulated 20E concentration and demonstrated that this had a graded response on wing disc growth rates in starved PGX larvae. Thus, we conclude that the effect of 20E on wing disc growth is causal.</p><p>To clarify this point, we have extracted the linear rate coefficients for wing disc growth, Achaete patterning, and Senseless patterning. We have then modelled the relationship between linear rates and 20E concentration for wing disc growth (new Figure 7B), Achaete patterning rate (new Figure 8B and D) and Senseless patterning rate (new Figure 9B and D). This is now discussed in Lines 522-807of the revised manuscript.</p><p>We agree that ecdysone-independent signals are also important for regulating plasticity of the wing disc, and make the point that nutrition is important for growth via ecdysone independent mechanisms throughout the manuscript. However, this manuscript focusses on how plasticity and robustness can be achieved through the action of the same developmental hormone, in this case ecdysone. The potential growth-inhibitory factor from the PG is very interesting, and is a topic of future research in the lab.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>p9, Hypothesis 1 is Figure 1B not 1C.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, you are correct.
