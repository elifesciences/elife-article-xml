The development of efficient reproductive technologies to conserve and regenerate chicken breeds safeguards existing biodiversity and secures poultry genetic resources for climate resilience, biosecurity, and future food production. The majority of the over 1600 breeds of chicken are raised in low and lower to middle income countries under resource-limited, small-scale production systems, which necessitates a low-tech, cost-effective means of conserving diversity is needed. Here, we validate a simple biobanking technique using cryopreserved embryonic chicken gonads. The gonads are quickly isolated, visually sexed, pooled by sex, and cryopreserved. Subsequently, the stored material is thawed and dissociated before injection into sterile host chicken embryos. By using pooled GFP and RFP-labelled donor gonadal cells and Sire Dam Surrogate mating, we demonstrate that chicks deriving entirely from male and female donor germ cells are hatched. This technology will enable ongoing efforts to conserve chicken genetic diversity for both commercial and smallholder farmers, and to preserve existing genetic resources at poultry research facilities.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>germ cell</kwd><kwd>biobank</kwd><kwd>avian</kwd><kwd>chicken</kwd><kwd>gametogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/P0.13732/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Tuanjun</given-names></name><name><surname>Taylor</surname><given-names>Lorna</given-names></name><name><surname>Sherman</surname><given-names>Adrian</given-names></name><name><surname>Whitelaw</surname><given-names>Bruce</given-names></name><name><surname>McGrew</surname><given-names>Michael J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/P013759/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Tuanjun</given-names></name><name><surname>Taylor</surname><given-names>Lorna</given-names></name><name><surname>Sherman</surname><given-names>Adrian</given-names></name><name><surname>Whitelaw</surname><given-names>Bruce</given-names></name><name><surname>McGrew</surname><given-names>Michael J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NC3Rs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C/V001124/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Tuanjun</given-names></name><name><surname>McGrew</surname><given-names>Michael J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000865</institution-id><institution>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OPP1127286</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Tuanjun</given-names></name><name><surname>Keambou Tiambo</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name><name><surname>Kemp</surname><given-names>Steven J</given-names></name><name><surname>Djikeng</surname><given-names>Appolinaire</given-names></name><name><surname>McGrew</surname><given-names>Michael J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OPP1127286</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Tuanjun</given-names></name><name><surname>Keambou Tiambo</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name><name><surname>Kemp</surname><given-names>Steven J</given-names></name><name><surname>Djikeng</surname><given-names>Appolinaire</given-names></name><name><surname>McGrew</surname><given-names>Michael J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A simple cryopreservation method using chicken eggs will be a valuable tool to safeguard genetic diversity and conserve the 1600 local breeds of chicken on the planet.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chickens, with a global population of over 60 billion, are the most populous bird species on the planet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ritchie and Roser, 2021</xref>). Regionally adapted chickens (considered as indigenous breeds or local ecotypes) are found in every country and are genetically diverse and well adapted to scavenging feeding, environmental challenges, and climatic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DAD-IS, 2021</xref>). As rural farming practices become replaced by centralised commercial poultry breeding, local chicken breeds are at risk of becoming extinct. This loss of local ecotypes with their unique genetic diversity jeopardises future improvements in livestock climate adaptation and sustainable farming practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alders and Pym, 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Melesse, 2019</xref>). A conservation programme integrating both DNA sequencing and reproductive biobanking of local chicken breeds and ecotypes would provide a platform for protecting and conserving the genetic diversity of chicken and also serve as an exemplar for other domestic poultry species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Woelders et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Whyte et al., 2016</xref>). Chickens are also a model system to study development, avian immunology, and diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davey et al., 2018</xref>). The hundreds of research chicken lines kept at avian facilities are also at risk of loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fulton and Delany, 2003</xref>).</p><p>The reproductive cells of an animal, the germ cells, contain the genetic information that is transferred from one generation to subsequent ones. The differentiated germ cells, the highly specialised sperm and egg, each carry a haploid genome and recombine to form the diploid fertilised egg. Cryopreservation of adult germ cells in ruminant livestock is now routine; however, in avian species, cryopreservation of the mature gametes is problematic. The large yolk-filled bird egg cannot be cryopreserved. Cryopreservation of chicken semen is used extensively in poultry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blesbois et al., 2007</xref>). However, cryopreserved chicken semen has poor fertilisation rates for many chicken breeds when used in artificial insemination and is rarely used in commercial poultry production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">ThÃ©lie et al., 2019</xref>). This may be due in part to the length of the avian oviduct and the prolonged storage of semen in specialised glands of the oviduct, the deleterious effects of the cryopreservation and thawing process, and the contraceptive effects of the cryoprotectants (e.g. glycerol) in the freezing media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blesbois et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Matsuzaki et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Avian embryonic germ cells, in contrast, can be efficiently cryopreserved. The avian germ cell lineage originally consists of ~30â80 diploid cells in the laid egg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">KaragenÃ§ et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tsunekawa et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). These cells, the primordial germ cells (PGCs), migrate through the vascular system of the developing embryo and colonise the forming gonads. The gonadal germ cells develop into the terminally differentiated oocytes numbering over 100,000 meiotic follicles in the hatched female chick and the proliferative spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) population of the male testis. We, and others, have demonstrated that PGCs can be isolated from individual embryos and propagated in vitro in a defined cell culture medium to produce several 100,000 cells in 3â4 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">van de Lavoir et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Whyte et al., 2015</xref>). This population of PGCs can then be cryopreserved in multiple aliquots. The cryopreserved PGCs are later injected into the vascular system of surrogate host embryos (~3000 PGCs/embryo). The gonads of the host embryos are colonised by the exogenous germ cells and, when mature, will produce functional donor PGC-derived gametes. Chemical or genetic ablation of the host embryoâs endogenous germ cells will increase the frequency of offspring formed by the exogenous germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nakamura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Macdonald et al., 2010</xref>). When hens genetically modified to disrupt the germ cell determinant, <italic>DDX4</italic>, were injected with donor cryopreserved female PGCs from a different breed of chicken, they laid eggs that were solely derived from donor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Woodcock et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, transgenic chickens expressing an inducible Caspase9 transgene in the germ cell lineage were treated with the dimerisation chemical, AP20187 (B/B), to ablate the endogenous germ cells. iCaspase9 surrogate hosts of both sexes produced gametes and offspring only deriving from donor PGCs. Direct mating of the surrogate hosts (Sire Dam Surrogate [SDS] mating) produced genetically pure breed offspring entirely derived from the exogenous PGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ballantyne et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ballantyne et al., 2021b</xref>).</p><p>The in vitro propagation of PGCs is technically demanding, expensive, and requires a complex cell culture medium and specialised cell culture facilities. The in vitro propagation of PGCs leads to epigenetic modifications and reduced germline transmission with the increased period of in vitro culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Woodcock et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ballantyne et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Soler et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, a biobanking methodology that did not depend on culture of germ cells would be preferable for poultry conservation. To address these current limitations, we investigated the use of directly cryopreserved embryonic gonadal germ cells for the cryoconservation of chicken breeds. The initial PGC population rapidly increases after colonising the gonadal anlagen and numbers many tens of thousands of mitotically active cells by the middle of the incubation period. This proliferative phase is followed by the mitotic quiescence of male germ cells until hatch and the meiotic entry of female gonadal germ cells at embryonic day (ED) 15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hughes, 1963</xref>). Male and female gonadal germ cells reintroduced into migratory stage embryos will remigrate and colonise the host gonad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tajima et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Naito et al., 2007</xref>). In fact, researchers have previously demonstrated that gonadal germ cells will colonise a host gonad and form both functional gametes and offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tajima et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mozdziak et al., 2006</xref>). The gonadal germ cells should therefore be adequate for biobanking and re-establishing a chicken breed if combined with a sterile host bird.</p><p>Here, using fluorescently labelled reporter lines of chicken, we confirm that the chicken gonad between ED 9 and 12 contains over 10,000 germ cells and that gonadal germ cells up to ED 10 of incubation are capable of efficient re-migration to the gonad when injected into the vascular system of an ED 2.5 host embryo. The ED 9 chicken gonad (stage 35 HH) can be visually sexed, pooled, and directly cryopreserved using a simple freezing medium before long-term storage in liquid nitrogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Subsequently, the cryopreserved gonads are thawed and dissociated before introduction into iCaspase9 host embryos. Male gonadal cells are directly injected into male sterile surrogate host embryos. Female gonadal cells are magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) purified to enrich for the germ cell population then injected into female surrogate host embryos. Using GFP- and RFP-labelled gonadal cells, we show that multiple donor genotypes are transmitted through the male and female hosts and âhomozygousâ donor-derived offspring can be directly generated through SDS mating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Application of this technology and future variations should enable economical and efficient biobanking of indigenous poultry breeds in lower to middle income countries (LMICs) and be an exemplar for avian species cryoconservation.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Isolation and cryopreservation of embryonic gonads followed by transmission through sterile surrogate hosts.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Embryonic day (ED) 9 gonads are isolated from embryos, pooled by sex, and cryopreserved in liquid N<sub>2</sub>.

We demonstrated that this GFP reporter construct was expressed exclusively in all germ cells of the developing embryo. We used this iCaspase9 GFP reporter gene to quantitate the germ cell population in the chicken gonad from ED 9 to ED 12 of development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We chose ED 9 as the starting point as it is the earliest developmental stage that the sex of male and female gonads can be clearly distinguished by visual inspection. Between ED 9 and ED 12, total cell number in the female gonad increased eightfold. The population of female germ cells in the gonad increased more than 40-fold during this period, and the percentage of female germ cells rose from 1.9% to 10.6%. In contrast, in the male gonad the total gonadal cell number increased 3.6-fold between ED 9 and ED 12 and the germ cell number rose 3.1-fold. The proportion of male germ cells remained between 2.4 and 2.9% during this period. These observations are similar to those previously reported using a different quantitation technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yang et al., 2018</xref>).

Gonadal cell viability was severely reduced after the cryopreservation of dissociated gonadal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In comparison, cryopreservation of whole gonads followed by thawing and subsequent cell dissociation did not significantly reduce gonadal cell viability when compared to the viability of directly dissociated cells from freshly isolated gonads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We next assayed the capacity of cryopreserved gonadal cells to recolonise the gonad of surrogate host embryos using GFP<sup>+</sup> and RFP<sup>+</sup> labelled gonads from ED 8 to ED 11 transgenic embryos as donors. The migration of donor gonadal germ cells to a host gonad can be easily quantified by counting the fluorescent cells in the host gonads. Whole donor gonads were cryopreserved and subsequently dissociated cells prepared from these frozen gonads were injected into wildtype host embryos. We injected 10,000â15,000 female gonadal cells (~150 germ cells) into the host embryos and observed germ cell colonisation 5â6 days (ED 8â9) post injection. Gonadal cells from ED 8â10 donor female embryos achieved repeatable colonisation of host gonads, while injection of ED 11 donor resulted in much fewer fluorescent cells present in the host embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Male gonadal germ cells form the SSC population of the testes that proliferates and differentiates into spermatozoa for the entire life of the cockerel. In contrast, female gonadal germ cells enter into meiosis starting at ED 15 and reach a final population of 480,000 post-replicative germ cells in the hatched chick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hughes, 1963</xref>). We postulated that the number of fluorescent cells observed colonising the host female gonad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>) would not be sufficient to form an appropriate oocyte hierarchy in the mature ovary and a continuous egg-laying cycle lasting the 10â12-month period of a typical layer hen. The cell surface stem cell marker, SSEA-1, is highly expressed on the surface of migratory and post-migratory gonadal germ cells until ED 9â10 of incubation after which expression of SSEA-1 is rapidly lost from the germ cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Urven et al., 1988</xref>). Selective enrichment of gonadal germ cells using SSEA-1 antibody was shown to increase the colonisation of the host gonad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kim et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mozdziak et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mozdziak et al., 2006</xref>). We used MACS to purify SSEA-1-expressing cells from the ED 9â10 (stage 35 HH) female gonads. We first determined that SSEA-1 expression on female gonadal germ cells decreased after ED 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Cryopreserved iCaspase9 gonadal tissues were thawed and dissociated, and MACS using SSEA-1 antibody was used to enrich for female PGCs. We observed that the SSEA-1 antibody captured and enriched &gt;40-fold GFP<sup>+</sup> gonadal germ cells (1.17% increased to 46%). The MACS-purified cells were 94% viable and as expected coexpressed SSEA-1 antigen on their surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The yield of germ cells from the female ED 9 gonad by MACS was approximately 5000 putative germ cells per pair of gonads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>We next tested the colonisation of male dissociated gonadal cells and MACS-enriched female gonadal cells using iCaspase9 host embryos treated with B/B compound. We used GFP<sup>+</sup> and RFP<sup>+</sup> gonad pairs mixed in a ratio of 5:1 to identify multiple colonisation events. A cell suspension of male gonadal cells or MACS-purified female gonadal cells was mixed with B/B dimerisation chemical and injected into the vascular system of ED 2.5 (stage 16 HH) iCaspase9 embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Whole tissue imaging and cryosections of surrogate host ED 14 gonads indicated that the donor PGCs from frozen gonadal tissues colonised the iCaspase9 host embryos of the same sex. The majority of cells were GFP<sup>+</sup> and fewer RFP<sup>+</sup> PGCs were also present in the host gonads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). An analysis of cryosections of adult male testes indicated that the majority of putative germ cells in the seminiferous tubules were GFP<sup>+</sup> and a minority of cells were RFP<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Generation of iCaspase9 surrogate host chicken</title><p>Based on these preliminary results, we proceeded with hatching of iCapase9 surrogate host chicken injected with donor cryopreserved gonadal cells in order to measure germline transmission rates of the donor material. Male dissociated gonadal cells were mixed with B/B compound and injected directly into ED 2.5 iCaspase9 embryos. B/B compound activates the iCaspase9 transgene, leading to the selective ablation of the endogenous germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ballantyne et al., 2021b</xref>). Female embryonic gonads were thawed, dissociated, and MACS-purified using an anti SSEA-1 antibody before injection. We mixed GFP<sup>+</sup> and RFP<sup>+</sup> donor gonadal material in a 5:1 or 5:2 ratio in order to identify the transmission of multiple donor genotypes from individual surrogate host chickens. In our first experiment (CRYO-1M), the survival of injected embryos was &gt;60% and the hatchability was &gt;40% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In subsequent experiments, the incubation conditions were altered (see Materials and methods) and hatchability increased to 58â83%. From these injection experiments, we estimate that cryopreserved gonads from 6 ED 10 embryos would provide sufficient cryopreserved material to inject 25 host embryos from which 10 host chicks (five males and five females) could be hatched. Furthermore, the mating of iCaspase9 homozygous cockerels mated to wildtype hens produced 100% heterozygote iCaspase9 host eggs for injections (CRYO1-4). In contrast, mating a heterozygote DDX4 Z<sup>+</sup>Z<sup>-</sup> heterozygote cockerel to wildtype hens (CRYO-5F) produce eggs of which 25% were of the correct Z<sup>-</sup>W host genotype.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Injection and hatching of surrogate hosts.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Injection set</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Duration of storage (days)</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Sex of donor cells</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Enriched by MACS</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">No. of gonad pairs</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Total cell yield</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">No. of donor cells injected per host embryo</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">No. of potential injections</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Surrogate host genotype</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">ED 14 survival rate (% injected embryos)</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">No. and sex of hatchlings(% hatch rate)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">CRYO-1M</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">108</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">M</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">No</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">10 GFP + 2 RFP</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">2,500,000</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">50,000</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">50</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">iCaspase9</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">17/26 (65%)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">4F + 3M (41%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">CRYO-2F</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">80</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">F</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Yes</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">10 GFP + 4 RFP</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">42,000</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1000</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">42</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">iCaspase9</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">12/18 (67%)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">6F + 4M (83%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">CRYO-3F</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">103</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">F</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Yes</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">17 GFP + 6 RFP</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">100,000</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1500</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">66</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">iCaspase9</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">17/27 (63%)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">6F + 8M (82%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">CRYO-4M</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">121</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">M</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">No</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">15 GFP + 3 RFP</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">4,400,000</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">60,000</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">73</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">iCaspase9</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">15/22 (68%)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">4F + 7M (73%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">CRYO-5F</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">128</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">F</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Yes</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">15 GFP + 3 RFP</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">120,000</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1500</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">80</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DDX4</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">19/23 (82%)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">4F* + 7M (58%)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>*Two females were wildtype (ZW) and two were <italic>DDX4</italic> ZW<sup>-</sup> knockouts (ZW<sup>-</sup>).</p></fn><fn><p>MACS: magnetic-activated cell sorting; ED: embryonic day; M: male; F: female.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Transmission of donor gonadal germ cells through sterile surrogate hosts</title><p>We established breeding groups of individual surrogate host cockerels mated to a cohort of wildtype hens and two cohorts of surrogate host hens mated to a wildtype male cockerel.

The RFP<sup>+</sup> donor gonads were from a heterozygote RFP<sup>+</sup> male mated to heterozygote RFP<sup>+</sup> females. Using this information, we calculated the expected number of RFP<sup>+</sup> offspring if all donor genotypes were transmitted equally to the offspring (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6">Table 6</xref>). For the first male surrogate host cohort, the donor gonadal material contained 10 GFP<sup>+</sup>:2 RFP<sup>+</sup> gonad pairs. From this donor material, we expected 11.1% of the offspring to be RFP<sup>+</sup> if each donor germ cell generated equal numbers of functional spermatozoa. For individual iCaspase9 males from one injection cohort (CRYO-1M), we observed 3, 6, and 28% of the embryos were RFP<sup>+</sup>; overall 14% of the embryos were RFP<sup>+</sup>. We then calculated if the transmission rates varied significantly from the expected values. RFP transmission of two of the three males differed significantly from the expected value; however, the male cohort collectively did not vary significantly from the expected transmission rate. For the second cohort of males (CRYO-4M), the donor gonadal material contained 15 GFP<sup>+</sup>:3 RFP<sup>+</sup> gonad pairs. From this donor material, we again expected 11.1% of the offspring to be RFP<sup>+</sup>. For individual iCaspase9 males from this cohort, we observed that 5, 5, 12, and 21% of the embryos were RFP<sup>+</sup> and overall 11% of the embryos were RFP<sup>+</sup>. Three of the four males diverged significantly from the expected transmission rate but again the male cohort considered collectively did not vary significantly from the expected transmission rate. These data indicate that individual males transmitted donor germ cell genotypes at varying frequencies. However, combined data from multiple host iCaspase9 males from a single injection cohort suggested that all donor genotypes were transmitted proportionally to the offspring.</p><table-wrap id="table6" position="float"><label>Table 6.</label><caption><title>RFP transmission rates identify multiple transmission events.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Bird ID</th><th align="left" valign="top">Total eggs set</th><th align="left" valign="top">Fertile eggs<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table6fn2">*</xref> (%)</th><th align="left" valign="top">No. of GFP(%)</th><th align="left" valign="top">No. of RFP(%)</th><th align="left" valign="top">No. of WT(%)</th><th align="left" valign="top">No. of iCaspase9(%)</th><th align="left" valign="top">No. of gonad pairs</th><th align="left" valign="top">Expected RFP (%)</th><th align="left" valign="top">p-Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">CRYO-1M: wb1181</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">147</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">14196%</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">10172%</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">43%</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">3626%</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0</td><td align="left" valign="top">10 GFP+ 2 RFP</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">11.1</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top"><bold>&lt;

Multiple samples can be quickly dissected, visually sexed, pooled, and cryopreserved to provide a frozen genetic resource for chicken breeds. This cryopreservation method will allow biobanking of poultry breeds to be carried out in localities lacking extensive infrastructure and equipment. We, unexpectedly, observed that freezing the entire gonad led to better germ cell survival and colonisation of the host gonad than freezing dissociated gonadal cells. This may be due to the enzymatic treatment used to dissociate the gonads having an adverse effect on PGC cryopreservation.</p><p>Re-establishing poultry breeds from the frozen material remains technically demanding. Breed regeneration, however, can be separated spatially and temporally from the storage facilities, that is, the biobank. We chose to purify female germ cells using MACS in place of fluorescent-activated cell sorter (FACS), as MACS will be more applicable in LMICs. It remains to be tested if MACS enrichment is necessary to achieve germline transmission from female gonadal cells. We expect that MACS enrichment of male gonadal cells would achieve functional gametogenesis in female iCapase9 hosts as we observed that several eggs were laid when using male dissociated gonadal cells. Germline transmission from gonadal cells in opposite sex hosts may be useful for increasing overall genetic diversity of the regenerated flock as long as inbreeding is avoided. This technology can also be applied immediately at chicken research facilities in most high-income countries (HICs). Our GFP and RFP chicken lines used in this demonstration contain a single transgene insert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">McGrew et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ho et al., 2019</xref>). Robust numbers of offspring were generated from frozen gonadal material for both sexes. For cryopreserving transgenic reporter lines of chicken, it may be simpler and more efficient to freeze multiple vials of male gonads for future injections. Local indigenous breeds commonly consist of small populations with low egg production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dessie and Ogle, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Melesse, 2019</xref>). Here, we used 12â23 donor embryos per injection experiment, but 6â7 donor embryo gonads should be sufficient to generate an injection cohort of surrogate hosts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). This number of eggs could be obtained from small flocks of indigenous chicken.</p><p>Our data show that mixing GFP:RFP donor gonadal cells at a 5:1 ratio maintained this ratio, on average, in the offspring of the iCapase9 host birds, but most birds differed significantly from the expected transmission rate. Thus, some genotypes may compete more poorly in the gonadal niche and be transmitted at lower frequencies to the offspring. Further research is needed to determine if donor germ cell genotypes are transmitted equally to the offspring or if some genotypes are underrepresented or overrepresented in the offspring. In our experiments, however, the genetics of the donor gonadal material (commercial brown layer) matched the genetics of the iCaspase9 and <italic>DDX4</italic> surrogate host birds (commercial brown layer). It remains to be shown if donor gonadal material from rare breeds and indigenous (local) chicken ecotypes â many with poor laying and smaller populations â will transmit donor genotypes equally in the iCaspase9 brown layer host and if âlocalâ eggs laid by the iCaspase9 hosts will have robust fertility and hatchability. These questions can be addressed by genotyping both the donor material and the surrogate host offspring to measure the transmission frequencies of multiple genotypes for several local breeds of chicken. In animal species, it is hypothesised that sperm competition occurs when multiple males mate individual females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Birkhead and Montgomerie, 2020</xref>). In this case, we may observe that donor germ cells of different genotypes do not compete equally during gametogenesis in the gonad of an individual host cockerel.</p><p>Chicken flocks are highly susceptible to loss of fitness from inbreeding which leads to poor gamete quality, resulting in low fertilising potential, reduced egg laying, and diminished hatchability. Regenerated chicken flocks must therefore consist of numerous genotypes in order to avoid genetic bottlenecks and the accompanying reductions in reproductive fitness of the flock. FAO advises that to maintain rare and local livestock breed populations that suffer from minimal inbreeding (no greater than 1%), a population of 13 unrelated males bred to 13 unrelated females (from independent family groups) would be needed to revive a population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 1998</xref>). Here, in our exemplar, we mated single surrogate host males carrying 12 donor genotypes to a cohort of surrogate host females carrying 14 donor genotypes. This number of genotypes would theoretically regenerate a genetically diverse population with an inbreeding coefficient less than 1% and meet FAO guidelines.</p><p>The methodology presented here relies on sterile surrogate hosts for efficient breed regeneration. For the <italic>DDX4</italic> line, a heterozygote Z<sup>+</sup>Z<sup>-</sup> male mated to wildtype ZW hens generates embryos of four genotypes, Z<sup>+</sup>Z<sup>+</sup>, Z<sup>+</sup>Z<sup>-</sup>, Z<sup>+</sup>W, Z<sup>-</sup>W, with only the Z<sup>-</sup>W female embryos as suitable hosts. For the iCaspase9 line, a homozygous iCaspase9 male is mated to wildtype females to generate iCaspase9 heterozygote male and female embryos. The iCaspase9 line proved superior to the DDX4 line. We generated greater numbers of donor/host sex-matched chimeras using the iCapsase9 transgenic chicken line than the <italic>DDX4</italic> chicken line. The <italic>DDX4</italic> Z<sup>-</sup>W female host, however, cannot transmit the endogenous targeted allele to its offspring and produce any host-derived offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Taylor et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Woodcock et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, a poorly injected iCaspase9 host embryo will transmit the endogenous transgene to its offspring. In our experiments, using the iCaspase9 host, 1 out of 7 males and 0 out of 12 female hosts generated some iCaspase9 transgenic offspring derived from endogenous host germ cells. Further genetic modifications of the iCapsase9 transgene may improve the induced sterility by B/B compound of surrogate host embryos and eliminate this problem.</p><p>The use of a genetically modified or genome-edited surrogate host chicken for biobanking platforms will require that new livestock regulations are adopted in the countries implementing this technology. In the future, we envision that improved non-genetically modified sterility protocols could replace the current surrogate hosts and eliminate the need for the development of new regulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Macdonald et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nakamura et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nakamura et al., 2012</xref>). Chemical and physical sterility treatments, however, have a high impact on the health of the host bird. In contrast, genome editing loss-of-function mutations and iCapase9-induced apoptosis have minimal to no welfare impact on the surrogate host birds. As the use of GM sterile surrogate hosts is more sustainable and scalable and supports the principles of the 3Rs, this method might be the ideal approach provided that it could be ensured that no endogenous host germ cell transmission occurred. Nevertheless, as research continues to improve avian surrogate host technology, the donor cryopreserved chicken gonadal tissues will remain a functional genetic resource to secure biodiversity and sustainability for future poultry farming.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Chicken breeds and embryos</title><p>Fertile eggs from TdTomato transgenic chickens (ubiquitous expression of TdTomato [RFP<sup>+</sup>]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ho et al., 2019</xref>), GFP<sup>+</sup> transgenic chickens (ubiquitous expression of GFP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">McGrew et al., 2008</xref>), and Hy-line Brown layer were obtained from NARF at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/roslin/national-avian-research-facility">the Roslin Institute</ext-link>.

In a clean laminar flow hood, after wiping surface of eggs with 70% ethanol the blunt end of the egg shell was cracked open using forceps and the shell membrane removed to visualise the embryo. The embryo was isolated and placed in a 100 mm Petri dish, effectively culling the embryo by severing the neck to decapitate the embryo using forceps or scissors. Under a stereo microscope, the embryo body was positioned by placing the ventral surface (belly) upwards, the embryo was opened, and the visceral organs carefully removed to expose the gonads and the attached mesonephroi. The embryo was visually sexed by gonadal morphology. Males have two elliptical, âsausage-shapedâ gonads of approximately equal sizes. Females have a much larger left gonad that is flattened, a âpancake-shapeâ. Both gonads were gently dissected off the mesonephroi using a 23G (1 Â¼â³ in length) hypodermic needle.

After 15 min equilibration of gonadal tissues in STEM-CELLBANKER on ice, the tubes were placed into a Mr. Frosty Freezing Container and placed in a â80Â°C freezer overnight, and then transferred into a â150Â°C freezer or liquid nitrogen for long-term storage.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Single gonadal cell preparation and MACS using SSEA-1 antibody</title><p>The gonadal tissues were retrieved from the â150Â°C freezer and thawed at 37Â°C for 30 s in a heating block. In a biosafety hood, the STEM-CELLBANKER was gently removed from tubes and 500 Î¼l DMEM was added slowly dropwise to wash and equilibrate the tissues. The tissues were recollected at the tube bottom by a quick spin. After removing the wash solution, 200 Î¼l dispase/collagenase solution (5 mg/ml in PBS) was added to the tissues. The tubes were incubated at 37Â°C for 10 min to dissociate the gonads, shaking the tubes to resuspend the tissues three times during the incubation period. Single cells were released by triturating the tissues up and down using a P200 pipette until tissue clumps disappeared. The cell suspension was filtered through a 40 Î¼m pore cell strainer, followed by washing the cell strainer with MACS sorting buffer (0.5% BSA, 2 mM EDTA in PBS) three times, 1 ml each time. The filtered cell suspension was aliquoted into 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 4 min to pellet the cells. The cells were washed twice with 500 Î¼l DMEM, then the cell number was determined using a haemocytometer. The final cell density was adjusted by adding additional DMEM. For male cells, cell density was adjusted to 50,000â60,000 cells/Î¼l for subsequent injection of surrogate hosts.</p><p>The dissociated female gonadal cells were enriched by MACS using an SSEA-1 antibody before injection. The female cells were resuspended in MACS buffer to a cell density of 2 Ã 10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml (~200 Î¼l). SSEA-1 antibody was added to the cell suspension at 1.5 Î¼g antibody per 10<sup>7</sup> cells. The solution was incubated on a roller for 20 min at 4Â°C. The solution was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 4 min to pellet the cells. The cells were washed twice with 200 Î¼l MACS buffer, and the cells were resuspended in appropriate volume of MACS buffer to reach a cell density of 1 Ã 10<sup>8</sup> cells/ml (~40 Î¼l). Anti-mouse IgM-conjugated MACS beads (~10 Î¼l) were added (2.0 Î¼l of beads per 10<sup>7</sup> cells). The cell solution was incubated on a roller for 20 min at 4Â°C. MACS buffer was added to a final volume of 1 ml and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 4 min to separate the conjugated cells from the excess microbeads. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of MACS buffer and loaded into an LS column mounted onto a magnetic station. The column was washed with 3 ml MACS buffer twice, the column was taken off from the magnetic station, and the bound cells were eluted with 3 ml MACS buffer into a 15 ml Falcon tube. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 4 min. After washing the cells twice with 200 Î¼l DMEM, the cells were resuspended in DMEM at a cell density of 1000 cells/Î¼l and injected into host embryos.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Flow cytometric analysis</title><p>The single gonadal cells were immunostained by SSEA-1 antibody (1:500 dilution) for 20 min on ice, followed by anti-mouse IgM conjugated by AF654 (1:5000 dilution) for 15 min on ice. The resulted staining was analysed by B&amp;D Fortessa and FlowJo v10 software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Fluorescent microscopy</title><p>Embryos were visualised using excitation wavelengths of 488 nm (GFP) or 568 nm (RFP) on a Zeiss AxioZoom.v16 microscope. Images were captured using Zen Black software (Zeiss), and green and red channels were superimposed to demonstrate yellow fluorescence. Hatched chicks were imaged for GFP and RFP fluorescence using both GFP and TdTomato lens system headsets (BLS Ltd, Hungary).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Colonisation experiments</title><p>Female gonads from ED 8â11 GFP<sup>+</sup> and RFP<sup>+</sup> transgenic embryos were pooled and frozen in STEM-CELLBANKER at â150Â°C. The single cells were thawed and dissociated as above using dispase/collagenase enzyme, and 15,000 cells, except 10,000 cells/embryos were used for E9 donor cells, were injected into non-fluorescent host embryos at ED 2.5 (stage 16 HH). The migration and colonisation of donor cells in surrogate host were observed at ED 8 or 9. The pools for donor female gonadal tissues were 6 GFP<sup>+</sup>:1 RFP<sup>+</sup> for ED 8, 6 GFP<sup>+</sup>:2 RFP<sup>+</sup> for ED 9, 7 GFP<sup>+</sup> for ED 10, and 3 GFP<sup>+</sup>:1 RFP<sup>+</sup> male for ED 11.</p><p>For hatching surrogate hosts, ED 2.5 iCaspase9 host embryos were injected directly with male gonadal donor cells mixed with B/B compound. Female donor gonadal cells were MAC-sorted before mixing with B/B compound and injected. A 1.0 Î¼l cell solution containing 0.5 mM f.c. AP20187 (B/B) compound (Takara Bioscience) was injected into the dorsal aorta through a small window made in the ventral egg. 50 Âµl of penicillin/streptomycin (P/S) solution (containing 15 Î¼M f.c. B/B compound) was pipetted on top of the embryo before sealing. The window was sealed with a 0.5 cm square of Leukosilk (BSN Medical) and the injected eggs were incubated until hatching. For experiment CRYO 1M, injected eggs were incubated at 15Â° until day 18 of incubation. For subsequent experiments, after 24 hr rocking at 15Â°, rocking was increased to the standard 45Â° rocking until day 18 of incubation. All eggs were transferred to a stationary incubator on day 18 and incubated until hatching which occurred at days 21â22 of incubation. Hatchlings were raised until sexual maturity when natural matings in floor pens were set up.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistics</title><p>The expected proportion of RFP chick in offspring could be predicted by RFP allele frequency in a pool of cryopreserved gonadal tissues, using the formula ((4/3) Ã number of RFP gonad pairs) /(2 Ã total number of gonad pairs in a pool). The RFP germline transmission frequency was statistically analysed by comparison of the expected and observed RFP percentages by using the exact one proportion function in basic statistics of Minitab. Other statistical analyses were calculated using a two-tailed Studentâs <italic>t</italic>-test.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Timothy Doran (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The three reviewers are very enthusiastic about the quality and impact of your manuscript. Please report to their specific points.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript describes a method to cryopreserve embryonic gonads from the chicken to enable effective biobanking of poultry breeds in locations that lack sophisticated germ cell culturing facilities, including poultry research facilities. The stored gonads can be thawed, and cells then dissociated and injected into sterile host chicken embryos. When these host chickens were raised to maturity and placed in matings, it was demonstrated that resulting hatched chicks were derived from the male and female donor germ cells originating from the cryopreserved embryonic gonads.</p><p>I have no doubt that this method will prove to be robust and quickly demonstrate impact in the biobanking of poultry breeds on a global scale. As mentioned by the authors, the use of a genetically modified or genome edited surrogate host chicken to translate this biobanking method will require new livestock regulations in countries that adopt this technology. I certainly hope this happens as GM sterile surrogates have major benefits compared with the alternative approach of using chemical and physical sterility treatments. I also hope that this approach will help with global avian conservation efforts and pave the way for biobanking of gonadal tissue of endangered avian species followed by the use of surrogacy to supplement breeding efforts for these species.</p><p>This is a very well written manuscript and was a pleasure to review. I congratulate the authors on their excellent work and subsequent written presentation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Here, the authors presented an approach to cryopreserve genetic resources of chicken by direct freezing of embryonic gonads from eggs incubated for 10 days.

However, it was a long struggle to obtain a consistent yield of viable gonadal cells at the levels as that of freshly-isolated cells. The size of gonads isnât a concern, and we have successfully cultured PGCs from ED13 frozen gonadal tissue using the same method. The decrease of PGC re-colonisation from ED11 frozen tissues could be a reflection of the biological changes of gonadal PGCs. Possibly, the enzymatic dissociation treatment damages the germ cells which are further damaged upon freezing. We added this point to the discussion on lines 321-325.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 173-175: The authors observed a decrease in SSEA positive female germ cells between D9 and D12.
