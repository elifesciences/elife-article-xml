unanswered questions in evolutionary biology is when and how the transition between diderm (two membranes) and monoderm (one membrane) cell envelopes occurred in Bacteria. The Negativicutes and the Halanaerobiales belong to the classically monoderm Firmicutes, but possess outer membranes with lipopolysaccharide (LPS-OM). Here, we show that they form two phylogenetically distinct lineages, each close to different monoderm relatives. In contrast, their core LPS biosynthesis enzymes were inherited vertically, as in the majority of bacterial phyla. Finally, annotation of key OM systems in the Halanaerobiales and the Negativicutes shows a puzzling combination of monoderm and diderm features. Together, these results support the hypothesis that the LPS-OMs of Negativicutes and Halanaerobiales are remnants of an ancient diderm cell envelope that was present in the ancestor of the Firmicutes, and that the monoderm phenotype in this phylum is a derived character that arose multiple times independently through OM loss.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14589.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14589.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14589.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The cell envelope is one of the evolutionarily oldest parts of a bacterium. This structure – made up of a cell wall and either one or two cell membranes – surrounds the bacterial cell, maintaining the cell’s structure and providing an interface through which bacteria can sense their environment and communicate.</p><p>Bacteria can be broadly classed based on the number of cell membranes that their envelope consists of. Bacteria that have a single cell membrane are known as “monoderm”, whereas those with two membranes are termed “diderm”. The number of membranes that bacteria have can affect how well they resist antibacterial compounds. When, how and why bacteria switched between monoderm and diderm cell envelopes are some of the major unanswered questions in evolutionary biology.</p><p>The textbook example of a monoderm cell envelope can be found in bacteria called Firmicutes. This group includes some notoriously harmful bacteria such as <italic>Staphylococcus</italic>, which can cause conditions ranging from abscesses to pneumonia. However, some Firmicutes possess two cell membranes. It was unclear how these unusual diderm Firmicutes developed a second membrane, and how they are related to their monoderm relatives.</p><p>Antunes, Poppleton et al. set out to answer these questions by analyzing the information contained in the thousands of bacterial genomes that have already been described. The results indicate that Firmicutes originally had diderm envelopes, and that species with monoderm envelopes arose independently several times through the loss of their outermost membrane.</p><p>Future work is needed to investigate the driving forces and the precise mechanism that led most Firmicutes to lose their outer membrane. Also, further characterization of diderm Firmicutes will provide key information about the biology of these poorly understood bacteria.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14589.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14589.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Negativicutes</kwd><kwd>Halanaerobiales</kwd><kwd>Firmicutes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-BINF-01-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brochier-Armanet</surname><given-names>Céline</given-names></name><name><surname>Gribaldo</surname><given-names>Simonetta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Phylogenomics provides support for the Gram-positive type of bacterial cell envelope being a derived character that arose independently multiple times through loss of an ancestral outer membrane.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The bacterial envelope is one of the oldest and most essential cellular components, involved in key housekeeping functions such as physical integrity, cell division, motility, substrate uptake and secretion, and cell-cell communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Silhavy et al., 2010</xref>). Yet, bacteria show substantial differences in their cell envelope architectures, among which the most dramatic one is the presence of one (monoderm) or two (diderm) membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sutcliffe, 2010</xref>). The study of cell envelope architecture has been mostly narrowed to the Firmicutes and the Gammaproteobacteria as textbook examples of monoderm and diderm bacteria, respectively. In <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, teichoic and lipoteichoic acids are embedded in a thick peptidoglycan wall, while in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> a thin peptidoglycan layer is surrounded by an outer membrane (OM) whose biogenesis and functioning involve a complex system of synthesis and transport for LPS, lipoproteins, and OM proteins (OMPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Silhavy et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The transition between monoderm and diderm cell envelopes must have been a significant and complex process in the evolutionary history of Bacteria. Two major hypotheses have been largely discussed in the literature, which can be generally defined as <italic>diderm-first</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cavalier-Smith, 2006</xref>) and <italic>monoderm-first</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gupta, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lake, 2009</xref>) scenarios. The fact that the majority of phyla seem to possess two membranes might favor the <italic>diderm-first</italic> scenario, although the actual diversity of cell envelopes in Bacteria remains largely unexplored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sutcliffe, 2010</xref>). However, the lack of a robustly resolved phylogeny for Bacteria, notably the uncertainty on its root and the nature of the earliest branches, has left the relationships between diderm and monoderm phyla unclear, and not allowed to define in which direction and how many times this transition occurred.</p><p>In this respect, the Negativicutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marchandin et al., 2010</xref>) represent an interesting case: while belonging phylogenetically to the classical monoderm Firmicutes, they surprisingly display a diderm cell envelope with an OM and LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Delwiche et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vos et al., 2009</xref>). The Negativicutes have been identified in various anaerobic environments, such as soil and lake sediments, industrial waste, and animal digestive tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vos et al., 2009</xref>). Their best-characterized member is <italic>Veillonella</italic>, first described in 1898 by Veillon and Zuber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Veillon and Zuber, 1898</xref>). Curiously, the very first observation and use of the term 'outer membrane' has been based on studies of <italic>Veillonella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bladen and Mergenhagen, 1964</xref>). <italic>Veillonella</italic> is one of the most abundant components of the human oral flora (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tanner et al., 2011</xref>), and a common inhabitant of the intestinal microbiome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">van den Bogert et al., 2013</xref>). Together with other gut microbes, it has been recently associated with maturation of the immune system and partial protection of asthma in infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arrieta et al., 2015</xref>), but can also develop into an opportunistic pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hirai et al., 2016</xref>). Several other Negativicutes members such as <italic>Dialister, Selenomonas, Mitsuokella,</italic> and <italic>Anaeroglobus</italic> show increased incidence in oral tract disease linked to biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Griffen et al., 2012</xref>) and involvement in other infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Very little experimental data is available on the nature of the diderm cell envelope of Negativicutes. In <italic>Selenomonas ruminantium</italic> the abundant OmpM protein appears to replace the important function of Braun’s lipoprotein in anchoring the OM to the cell peptidoglycan through a link with cadaverine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kojima et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>How the OM originated in the Negativicutes represents an evolutionary conundrum. Recently, Tocheva and colleagues analyzed the sporulation process in the Negativicute <italic>Acetonema longum</italic> by cryoelectron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tocheva et al., 2011</xref>). They showed that, while an outer membrane forms only transiently during sporulation in classically monoderm Firmicutes such as <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, it is retained in <italic>A. longum</italic> leading to its diderm phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tocheva et al., 2011</xref>). This study provided the first experimental support for the hypothesis that the bacterial OM could have initially evolved in an ancient sporulating monoderm bacterium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dawes et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Errington, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vollmer, 2012</xref>). Moreover, a phylogenetic tree of the essential Omp85 protein family for proteins insertion in the outer membrane, although largely unresolved, did not show the Negativicutes as emerging from any specific diderm phylum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tocheva et al., 2011</xref>). The authors speculated that the OM of Negativicutes was not acquired by horizontal gene transfer but was already present in the ancestor of Firmicutes and would have been lost in the other members of this phylum, although it remained unclear when and how many times this would have occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tocheva et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, a recent analysis of the genome of the Negativicute <italic>Acidaminococcus intestini</italic> revealed that as much as 7% of the BLAST top hits were from Proteobacteria, the majority of which corresponded to functions related to OM biogenesis, concluding to a possible acquisition of the OM in Negativicutes by horizontal gene transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campbell et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the Negativicutes are not the only diderm lineage in the Firmicutes. The Halanaerobiales are a poorly studied group of moderate halophilic, strictly anaerobic Firmicutes that were isolated from saline environments such as lake and lagoon sediments, and oil reservoirs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Oren, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Roush et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly to the Negativicutes, they display a diderm-type cell envelope, with a thin peptidoglycan and an outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cayol et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zeikus et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhilina et al., 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhilina et al., 2012</xref>). When analyzing the first sequenced genome of a member of Halanaerobiales, <italic>Halothermothrix orenii</italic>, Mavromatis and colleagues identified a number of OM markers, suggesting the presence of an LPS-diderm cell envelope homologous to the one of Negativicutes and other diderm bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mavromatis et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast to the few analyses on Negativicutes, no experimental data are available on the characteristics of the OM in the Halanaerobiales.</p><p>The existence of two diderm lineages in the Firmicutes provides a fantastic opportunity to clarify the monoderm/diderm transition in this major bacterial phylum. However, the origins and evolutionary relationships between the OM of Halanaerobiales and Negativicutes have been unclear. In fact, no Halanaerobiales were present in the analysis of Tocheva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tocheva et al., 2011</xref>). Mavromatis et al. built a tree from the combined analysis of the genes coding for LPS, which showed a clustering of Halanaerobiales and Negativicutes, leading the authors to propose a horizontal gene transfer of the OM between these two lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mavromatis et al., 2009</xref>). However, the sequenced genome of only one member of Halanaerobiales and one of Negativicutes were available at the time, and the LPS tree was largely unresolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mavromatis et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, current phylogenies of the Firmicutes have been unclear with respect to the relationships between Negativicutes and Halanaerobiales. The Negativicutes have been alternatively indicated as branching within Clostridia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yutin and Galperin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mavromatis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vesth et al., 2013</xref>) or at the base of Bacilli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kunisawa, 2015</xref>). The phylogenetic placement of Halanaerobiales remains also uncertain, as they have been assigned either to Class Clostridia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cayol et al., 1994</xref>), as a deep branch in the Firmicutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mavromatis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vos et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kunisawa, 2015</xref>), or left unresolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yutin and Galperin, 2013</xref>). Finally, no detailed genomic analysis has been carried out to infer and compare the characteristics of the cell envelopes of several Halanaerobiales and Negativicutes.</p><p>The large number of Negativicutes and Halanaerobiales genomes currently available prompted us to carry out a global phylogenomic study. This allowed to robustly clarifying the relative placement of Negativicutes and Halanaerobiales within the Firmicutes, to assess the evolutionary relationships of their cell envelopes, and to perform in depth comparative analysis to understand the characteristics of key OM-related processes in these two lineages. Our results provide robust support for an emergence of monoderm Firmicutes from diderm ancestors via multiple independent losses of the OM.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Electron microscopy of the diderm cell envelopes of Halanaerobiales and Negativicutes</title><p>Although the presence of an OM has been previously shown by electron microscopy for members of Negativicutes (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tocheva et al., 2011</xref>) and Halanaerobiales (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhilina et al., 2012</xref>), these images have been obtained separately and with different techniques, making difficult their comparison. We therefore obtained electron microscopy images of one representative of Negativicutes (<italic>Megamonas rupellensis</italic>) and one of Halanaerobiales (<italic>Halanaerobium saccharolyticum</italic>). We used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) following high-pressure freezing, freeze substitution, plastic embedding and ultrathin sectioning of the samples (see Materials and Methods). The application of high-pressure freezing in combination with appropriate freeze-substitution protocols facilitates the ultrastructural analysis of microorganisms and their membranes and also results in densely and homogeneously packed cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McDonald, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McDonald et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rachel et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Ultrathin sections of high-pressure frozen cells of <italic>M. rupellensis</italic> and <italic>H. saccharolyticum</italic> confirmed the presence of clearly diderm-type cell envelope architecture in both strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In a cross section from inside to outside, the densely packed cytoplasm of <italic>M. rupellensis</italic> is surrounded by a cytoplasmic membrane followed by the periplasm with a thin peptidoglycan layer and an OM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Furthermore, pilus-like structures could be detected, as well as another electron dense layer outside the OM, which might correspond either to the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or an S-layer. Thin sections of <italic>H. saccharolyticum</italic> also revealed a diderm cell envelope with a densely packed cytoplasm enclosed by a membrane surrounded by a relatively electron lucent periplasm so that the thin line representing the peptidoglycan is clearly visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). For both organisms, in some cases the periplasm appeared inflated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>), which was most likely caused by a preparation artifact due to swelling of the cells in the freeze substitution process. This effect nevertheless enabled us to observe the peptidoglycan much better as compared to cells without that artifact.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14589.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Transmission electron microscopy of a member of Negativicutes and a member of Halanaerobiales.</title><p>Ultrathin sections of high-pressure frozen cells of the Negativicutes member <italic>Megamonas rupellensis</italic> (<bold>A</bold>,<bold>C</bold>), and the Halanerobiales member <italic>Halanaerobium saccharolyticum</italic> (<bold>B</bold>,<bold>D</bold>).

The Bayesian tree was well resolved at most nodes (Posterior Probabilities (PP) &gt; 0.95, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Despite the weak signal and the stochastic errors frequently associated to small proteins such as ribosomal ones, topology congruence tests on individual markers showed a largely congruent phylogenetic signal, especially at high rank taxonomy level, justifying their combined analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and Materials and methods). Maximum Likelihood (ML) analysis of the same concatenated dataset and the site-homogeneous LG model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Le and Gascuel, 2008</xref>) gave a largely consistent topology although it was much less resolved, especially at deep nodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). With respect to previous analyses, the relative placement of Negativicutes and Halanaerobiales in the Firmicutes phylogeny was robustly resolved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In fact, the Negativicutes branched within Class Clostridia, specifically related to Peptococcaceae and other incertae-sedis clostridial families (PP = 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This placement is consistent with previous analyses, although performed with less taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yutin and Galperin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mavromatis et al., 2009</xref>).

Accordingly, synteny is also conserved in Halanaerobiales and Negativicutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We therefore searched for these four core LPS genes (<italic>lpxABCD</italic>) in a local databank of 121 genomes representative of 30 major bacterial phyla (Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). As compared to what could be previously inferred from available genomic data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sutcliffe, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Opiyo et al., 2010</xref>), we show the presence of homologues of the four core LPS coding genes in 26 major bacterial phyla, eight of which evidenced for the first time: Thermodesulfobacteria, Fibrobacteres, Ignavibacteria, Nitrospina, Chrysiogenetes, Cloacimonetes, Atribacteria, and Armatimonadetes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). This suggests that LPS-diderm cell envelopes might be even more widespread in Bacteria than currently thought, leaving only four major phyla that appear to lack the coding capacity for LPS: Thermotogae, Caldiserica, Chloroflexi/Thermomicrobia, and Actinobacteria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We assembled the four core LPS protein homologues into a concatenated dataset (898 amino acid characters) also including Halanaerobiales and Negativicutes, and obtained a Bayesian tree with the CAT+GTR+Γ<sub>4</sub> evolutionary model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, Materials and methods). In agreement with their conserved synteny, congruence tests showed that these four core LPS genes have a consistent phylogenetic signal at large evolutionary distances, in particular concerning the monophyly of major bacterial phyla, justifying their combined analysis (Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consistently with the notorious difficulty in resolving the global phylogeny of Bacteria, the tree is not completely resolved. However, it is largely in agreement with bacterial systematics, showing the monophyly of major phyla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This pattern indicates that the core LPS genes were present in the ancestor of each of these diderm phyla, and that inter-phylum horizontal gene transfers were surprisingly rare during bacterial evolution. Consistently, the Halanaerobiales and Negativicutes also form a well-supported monophyletic cluster (PP = 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), with internal branching pattern matching their respective reference species phylogeny shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p>These results indicate that the LPS-OM of Halanaerobiales and Negativicutes do not have distinct origins, but rather that, similarly to the other main diderm bacterial phyla, they were inherited from their common ancestor, which is also the ancestor of all Firmicutes, in agreement with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tocheva et al., 2011</xref>.

To this aim, we investigated a few key processes that are related to OM biogenesis and functioning and are shared between Negativicutes and Halanaerobiales. Because OM markers frequently display low sequence conservation or are part of large membrane-related protein families often preventing the building of robust phylogenies, we helped tentative annotation by merging information obtained from homology to known OM markers, the presence of specific protein domains, and genomic synteny. In this respect, the presence of the conserved OM locus helped annotation greatly and provided important insights into the unique nature of the cell envelopes of Negativicutes and Halanaerobiales, which show both specific characteristics as well as an intriguing combination of diderm and monoderm features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14589.011</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Sketched diagram of inferred characteristics of the diderm Firmicutes cell envelope.</title><p>The main processes discussed in the text are shown schematically.

Although LPS can be very heterogeneous in bacteria, it has an overall conserved structure composed of a membrane-anchored hydrophobic domain (lipid A, or endotoxin), an oligosaccharide (inner and outer core), which can be extended with a distal polysaccharide (O-antigen) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). The Lipid A-core portion (known as 'rough' LPS) and the O-antigen have independent pathways for their synthesis and transport. If O-antigen is produced, it is ligated to the lipid A-core by an integral membrane ligase, generating 'smooth' LPS. Then, the transport of LPS to the OM is carried out by a dedicated system (the Lpt pathway) and is independent from O-antigen presence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wang et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Both Negativicutes and Halanaerobiales have a complete set of genes for the synthesis of the Lipid A moiety and inner core of LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

Moreover, the <italic>lpx</italic> gene cluster also includes a <italic>fabZ</italic> homologue, which encodes an enzyme involved in a key step of fatty acid synthesis and is also present in monoderm Firmicutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Parsons and Rock, 2013</xref>).

Because FabZ acts on a substrate that is shared with the lipid A pathway, its conserved genomic proximity with LpxC is a strong indication that these two proteins interact in diderm Firmicutes, likely in a common process that regulates the phospholipid/LPS balance of the OM as described in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Klein et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ogura et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Once synthesized, the lipidA-core is translocated through the IM by the flippase MsbA, which is composed of a typical architecture including an N-terminal ABC-transporter transmembrane domain and a C-terminal ATP-binding cassette domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ruiz et al., 2009</xref>).

LPS is extracted from the IM by LptC and the LptFGB transporter, then mobilized to the OM by the chaperone LptA, and finally assembled into the OM by LptDE. In all Negativicutes and Hanaerobiales, we identified a conserved Lpt four-gene cluster next to the LPS synthesis genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This includes a homologue of LptB, a single homologue of LptF/G, plus two proteins of ~200aa containing OstA domains that may represent LptA and LptC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Apart from LptB, which belongs to the large P-loop-NTPase superfamily, none of the remaining putative components are present in monoderm Firmicutes.

They are assembled via post-translational modifications after translocation through the inner membrane in both diderm and monoderm bacteria. The lipid modification occurs on a 'lipobox' signal near the N-terminus at the cytoplasmic membrane where the pre-lipoprotein diaglycerol transferase Lgt adds a diacylglycerol moiety. The lipobox signal is then cleaved off by the lipoprotein signal peptidase LspA, which allows anchoring of the lipoprotein to the outer face of the plasma membrane. A second lipoprotein N-acetyltransferase, Lnt, can add a third amide fatty acid onto the N-terminus of lipoproteins. Tri-acylated lipoproteins are preferentially targeted to the OM in diderm bacteria via the Lol machinery. This is a multiprotein system formed by an IM-spanning ABC-like transporter component (LolCDE) that captures lipoproteins from the IM and delivers them to the carrier LolA utilizing ATP hydrolysis. LolA then translocates the lipoprotein to the structurally related LolB, which inserts it into the OM by an unclear mechanism.</p><p>While LolCDE are part of the large protein family of ABC transporters, the presence of LolA homologues is indicative of a functional Lol system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sutcliffe et al., 2012</xref>). We found no homologues of LolA nor of LolB in any of the Negativicutes genomes, confirming previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campbell et al., 2014</xref>). It is possible that Negativicutes do not address lipoproteins to the OM or that they use a still unknown, non-homologous system. In contrast, we found homologues of LolA in each of the analyzed Halanaerobiales genomes, which correlate to the presence of Lnt homologues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). By looking at the genomic surroundings of these LolA homologues, we identified a conserved gene cluster in most Halanaerobiales genomes, which likely code for a complete Lol system, notably the two ABC transporter permeases (LolC/E) and one ATPase (LolD) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We could not find any homologues of LolB in the genomic locus or elsewhere in the Halanaerobiales genomes, although this protein is not well conserved in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sutcliffe et al., 2012</xref>).

The main issue mostly revolves around the question of how and when an OM originated in Bacteria, and whether monoderm cell envelopes predate diderm cell envelopes or instead derived from them. The complexity of the diderm cell envelope with respect to a perceived more 'rudimentary' monoderm type, together with its higher resistance toward antibiotics, are arguments usually put forward to propose that the OM is a relatively late invention in Bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Koch, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gupta, 2011</xref>). However, it is now evident that diderm phyla outnumber monoderm ones, and span a large fraction of bacterial diversity, including early emerging lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sutcliffe, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Errington, 2013</xref>). Unfortunately, the evolutionary relationships among monoderm and diderm bacterial phyla are presently unclear, and do not allow to clarify OM origins. In this respect, the existence of a major bacterial phylum –the Firmicutes- including both diderm and monoderm lineages, and whose evolutionary relationships can be resolved, provides a unique opportunity to address the issue.</p><p>Our results provide support for the hypothesis that the Firmicutes are ancestrally diderm, and that the monoderm envelope is a derived cell structure that originated through OM loss, at least in this phylum. Although previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tocheva et al., 2011</xref>), the inclusion of both Halanaerobiales and Negativicutes in our analysis strengthens and extends this scenario. Our robust phylogeny of the Firmicutes indicates that Halanaerobiales and Negativicutes form two distinct lineages, each related to different monoderm relatives. This allows inferring that the OM was lost from three to five times independently in the Firmicutes, and is therefore not a unique event in the history of Bacteria that would have led to all present-day monoderm lineages, as proposed earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cavalier-Smith, 2006</xref>). The deep branching of Halanaerobiales and the still limited genomic coverage for this group makes them a priority target for further exploration as their cell envelopes may retain ancestral characters.</p><p>Our results confirm that the LPS-OMs of Negativicutes and Halanaerobiales are homologous structures that share a common origin and are evolutionarily related with those of other classically diderm bacteria, therefore excluding convergence. Indeed, we show that the core enzymatic apparatus for producing LPS is even more widespread than previously thought, and that the LPS-OM is an ancient feature that emerged once and was largely inherited vertically during bacterial evolution, including in Halanaerobiales and Negativicutes. This is unusual for cytosolic enzymes, and underlines the key importance of maintaining cell-envelope function. Clearly, the availability of genomic data from an ever-wider sampling of bacterial diversity is sensibly changing perspective on the evolution of bacterial cell envelopes. For example, by revealing the presence of an LPS-OM in the ancestor of Deinococcus/Thermus we show that this phylum does not represent a monoderm-to-diderm intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gupta, 2011</xref>), but rather that LPS was lost in some of their members, a process similar to what likely occurred in Thermotogae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cavalier-Smith, 2006</xref>). This indicates that, although having an OM is surely advantageous in certain conditions, the diderm cell envelope is a flexible structure that can be modified/simplified during evolution.</p><p>Although the presence of a large cluster coding for key OM functions might be seen as supporting the hypothesis of an acquisition of the OM of diderm Firmicutes via genetic transfer from a diderm bacterium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mavromatis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campbell et al., 2014</xref>), our data weaken this hypothesis. Given the distinct branching of the two diderm lineages in the Firmicutes phylogeny, and the pattern of LPS inheritance similar to all other diderm bacterial phyla, the gene transfer hypothesis would imply a complex scenario consisting of two independent transfers of a very large genomic region, a first one to the ancestor of Halanaerobiales or to the ancestor of Negativicutes, and a second one between these two ancestors, which would have had to coexist at the same time and in the same environment. The sudden acquisition of an OM has been already discussed as mechanistically complicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cavalier-Smith, 2006</xref>). This would have in fact required the dramatic modification of an originally monoderm cell envelope through the concerted acquisition of several complex systems at once, not to mention the replacement of the native inner membrane components of these systems or their coordination with the newly acquired ones. Moreover, not all OM systems involved in OM biogenesis and function in Negativicutes and Halanaerobiales are part of the gene cluster, and their detailed annotation suggests that their cell envelopes share characteristics with deep-emerging bacterial phyla (e.g. the OmpM porin instead of Braun’s lipoprotein for OM tethering), and present a peculiar combination of monoderm/diderm features (e.g. flagella, pili). The OM gene cluster may therefore represent an ancestral genomic locus for OM–related functions, and it becomes essential to obtain further experimental characterization of the OM of Halanaerobiales and Negativicutes, as well as many other poorly explored deep emerging bacterial phyla. Nevertheless, we have analyzed here only a few OM systems shared between Halanaerobiales and Negativicutes in order to infer the nature of the ancestral diderm cell envelope in the Firmicutes. There are surely additional components that are lineage-specific and may have been acquired from diderm bacteria thriving in the same environment. This is an important future area of investigation, as it could inform on how the presence of an OM in a Firmicutes background may have helped adaptation to specific niches, including the human environment.</p><p>By which process the ancestral OM would have been lost multiple times independently in the majority of present-day Firmicutes remains to be understood. It has been proposed that a spontaneous mutation leading to hypertrophy of the peptidoglycan layer would be sufficient to transform a diderm into a monoderm, through disruption of the attachment of the OM, leading to its loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cavalier-Smith, 2006</xref>). Alternatively, we speculate that mutations may have affected the ancestral OmpM, causing a de-regulation of OM-PG attachment. This transition may have been made easier during the process of sporulation, where an OM is transiently formed and lost when the vegetative cell matures. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tocheva et al. (2011)</xref> proposed indeed that the OM might have been lost in the Firmicutes to increase sporulation and germination efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tocheva et al., 2011</xref>). A link between OM loss and sporulation may explain why there is no current evidence of monoderm lineages within other diderm phyla that do not sporulate. Further genomic and experimental data on the closest monoderm relatives of Negativicutes and Halanaerobiales might provide key information on the process of OM loss.</p><p>Our results suggest that the cell envelopes of diderm Firmicutes might be the remnants of an ancient type of cellular structure, adding up to the ones found in the major diderm bacterial phyla. Moreover, they seem to have ancestral and simpler cell envelope systems with respect to the well-studied Proteobacteria. Halanaerobiales and Negativicutes are therefore promising new experimental models that will provide precious insights into the processes that have shaped the diversity not only of diderm cell envelopes, but also of monoderm ones.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ultrastructural analysis</title><p>Negativicutes strain <italic>Megamonas rupellensis</italic> DSM 19944<sup>T</sup> was grown anaerobically at 37°C to late exponential phase on TGY broth (w/v; 3% tryptone, 2% yeast extract, 0.5% glucose, 0.05% L-cysteine hydrochloride) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chevrot et al., 2008</xref>).

Congruence among the four markers was assessed by the IC criterion as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Protein annotation</title><p>Given the small number of markers analyzed and their frequently limited conservation at the sequence level, we followed a semi-manual procedure for annotation based on a combination of profile-based homology searches, protein domain identification, and genomic synteny. Profile-based homology searches of specific OM markers were performed by using the HMMER package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Johnson et al., 2010</xref>). Initial searches were conducted by HMM on the local Firmicute genome databank by using standard Pfam domain models corresponding to a given protein of interest. The top-scoring hits were used to build new HMM models and perform a novel search. This process was iterated until no new hits were found. The resulting homologues were aligned and manually inspected in order to confirm homology and to eliminate divergent, partial or non-homologous sequences. Additional searches with tblastn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altschul et al., 1997</xref>) were used to identify eventually misannotated homologues in some genomes. Protein domains were inspected by querying the Conserved Domain Database (CDD) at NCBI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Marchler-Bauer et al., 2015</xref>). Genomic synteny was investigated using the interactive web-based visualization tool SyntTax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Oberto, 2013</xref>). Local genomic alignments were generated using EasyFig (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sullivan et al., 2011</xref>) with a BLAST cutoff E-value of 0.0001. For localization prediction, we used the PSORT v3.0 server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.psort.org/psortb/">http://www.psort.org/psortb/</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yu et al., 2010</xref>) with default settings for Gram-negative Bacteria. Protein families were assigned to Clusters of Orthologous Groups by searching the COG database, which was downloaded from the NCBI FTP server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/wolf/COGs/">ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/wolf/COGs/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tatusov et al., 2000</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Note</title><p>While this manuscript was in the last phase of revision, Tocheva et al. published a Perspective paper (Tocheva, EI, Ortega, DR &amp; G Jensen. 2016. Sporulation, bacterial cell envelopes and the origin of life. <italic>Nature Reviews Microbiology</italic> 14, 533-542. doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.85).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Jonathan Eisen, served as guest Reviewing Editor, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Losick as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Andrew Roger (peer reviewer).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The consensus is that this is an interesting topic and that the work has some novel findings. There is not complete agreement on the degree of novelty of the findings. One factor for which there was consensus is that the paper does not do a thorough enough job of discussing the differences in this paper compared to previous papers on the same general topic. Thus if this paper is revised we recommend that the authors make a more thorough comparison to prior work including a comparison of phylogenetic results, statistical support for results, and inferences about the evolution of diderms and monoderms. This should include a discussion of the papers referenced in the reviews (e.g., Jensen, Tocheva et al. 2011, Errington 2013, Vollmer 2011, Yutin and Galperin 2013) and others to cover the history of theories on this topic and also a paper just published recently &quot;Evolutionary relationships of completely sequenced Clostridia species and close relatives&quot; see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2641069">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2641069</ext-link>. See the individual reviews for more details.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In addition to the topic of the novelty of the work some other concerns were raised by the reviewers which would need to be addressed in any revision. These include</p><p>1) Phylogenetic analysis should be done of individual genes to examine congruence among different markers and not just a concatenation based phylogeny. See review #2 for more detail.</p><p>2) Release of alignments.

See Review 2 for details but more information is needed on the statistical analysis of branching patterns in this tree and additional statistical analyses are recommended.</p><p>4) Figure quality and amount. Some concern was expressed about the number of figures and the difficulty in reading some of them. It is recommended that the authors consider moving some Figures to supplemental material and redoing some figures to make them more readable.</p><p>5) Presence of second membrane in some species listed as monoderms. See Review 3 for details but this issue should be addressed and discussed in any revision.</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. There was some concern that the structures pointed to by the authors may be the result of artifacts. This issue (either further justification of this method or use of an alternative method) should be addressed in any revision.</p><p>7) Incomplete description of methods. See Review 1 in particular for more details but many of the methods used in the paper are not described in enough detail for readers to know what was done or for anyone to reproduce the work. A full description of all methods used needs to be included in any revision.</p><p>8) The computational workflows used in the paper (e.g., for identifying homologs and for generating and trimming alignments) are not tested in any obvious way. Some further discussion of the workflows they have used and any evidence regarding how well they work (e.g., alignment quality) would be helpful.</p><p>9) Support for results and conclusions is overstated in the text. See Review 1 in particular but there are many parts of the paper where the wording used is too strong in how it implies statistical or other support for their conclusions. In addition, many claims are made without referencing results or citing the literature. Any claims in the paper need to be supported either by results in the paper or by referencing the literature.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Overall, I believe this paper is novel and represents some important contributions to the field of evolutionary biology especially in regard to the evolution of major groups of bacteria and their cell envelopes. And the detailed analysis of the phylogeny and the genomes and predicted pathways is very useful and important. In general, I believe many of their conclusions are likely to be supported by the data. However, there are some significant limitations of the manuscript in its current form that prevent me from being able to go beyond &quot;likely to be supported&quot; to saying &quot;are supported&quot;. These areas need addressing before I would recommend publishing it in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Below are the major areas I think need addressing:</p><p>1) Methods description is generally incomplete and inadequate: much more detail needed including genome IDs, how COGs generated, BLAST parameters, HMM parameters, how outgroups were chosen, use of synteny and other information to predict function, how various web tools were run, parameters for many programs, what types of computers used, and much, much more. The methods are in many cases simply insufficiently described to be able to evaluate some sections of the paper.</p><p>2) Limited assessment of how well their phylogenomic approach works. It is good to see some high PP and other scores for the trees but some more analysis showing the validity of their results is important. For example, how do the branching patterns the see compare to those seen in other studies (including within each group)? Do they have any data showing their identification of orthologs works well? What about their alignemtns and identification of poorly aligned regions?</p><p>3) All alignments used in different phylogenomic analyses and functional predictions need to be released publicly.</p><p>4) There is repeated use of overly strong terms to describe the results and conclusions. For example the term &quot;indicate' or &quot;strongly support&quot; or their varieties are used extensively but in most cases are not appropriate (e.g., in regard to what their phylogenetic analysis implies or what the presence of genes in the genomes implies). The authors should go through the entire paper and rephrase many sections. In essence the problem is that the wording repeatedly over inflates the results. I agree in most cases that one could conclude &quot;we believe this result supports this model&quot; but unless they present statistics or explicit hypothesis testing that is as far as they should go in the wording.</p><p>5) Many statements are made in the text without either results or citations to back them up.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript the authors marshal several types of evidence (phylogenomic, TEM, and genome content analysis) to suggest that two very distinct types of bacteria – the Negativicutes and the Haloanaerobiales which belong to the single-membrane bounded ('monoderm') Firmicute clade of bacteria, (an important 'gram-positive' bacterial group) – actually possess outer membranes and are 'diderm'. Furthermore, the authors show that like classical gram-negative bacteria these taxa retain a number of the molecular machines that function with the outer membrane in 'diderm' bacteria. Their phylogenetic positions, as assessed by a 47 ribosomal protein super-matrix, indicate that they emerge from within two distinct clades in the Firmicutes suggesting that the 'monoderm' nature of other Firmicutes has evolved multiple times from 'diderm' firmicute ancestors. The authors go on to describe features of the outer membrane which must be ancestral to Firmicutes and lost separately in the monoderm members (flagellar genes, LPS genes and pilus genes). These are extremely interesting findings and are important contributions to the understanding of bacterial genome and cell evolution.</p><p>In general I think the study is quite thorough and the conclusions are very interesting – especially with regard to the polyphyly of 'monoderm' condition within Firmicutes. This should serve as a strong argument against the claims that loss of the outermembrane is extremely rare and occurred possibly only once in prokaryotic evolution (e.g. as repeatedly claimed by Cavalier-Smith over the last few decades).</p><p>Below I itemize some suggestions for revisions in the manuscript:</p><p>1) The phylogenetic analyses of the 47 ribosomal protein genes are well done in general. However, these days there is a lot of talk about lateral gene transfer in bacterial genome evolution and I think it is important to do some kind of analyses to show that the authors believe that all of these proteins have evolved 'vertically' – i.e. demonstrate that their single phylogenies are generally congruent with each other. There are a number of published methods to do this rigourously that are very involved (e.g. as reviewed by Leigh et al. (2011) Genome Biol. Evol. 3:571-87). However I think simpler methods could also be used. For example, the authors could report the proportion of genes in the concatenate that support each of the splits in the ML tree that they show. They could also check to see whether any of the single gene trees conflict with the concatenated tree with &gt;70% bootstrap support for the conflicting split. Another measure that the authors could consider is 'internode certainty' (IC) that has recently been extended to the case where single gene trees do not contain all taxa of the full tree (i.e. deal with missing data) – see Kobert et al. (2016) Mol. Biol. Evol. (advanced access); this method has been implemented in RAxML and could be easily applied to the data set.</p><p>Note that this same criticism applies to the concatenation of the 7 components of the LPS biosynthesis pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Some attempt to evaluate congruence amongst these markers should be made.</p><p>The general point here is that there needs to be some evidence that the markers being used in these super-matrices are all congruent (or at least congruent for the relevant parts of the tree being discussed).</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows the Bayesian phylogeny estimated and posterior probabilities on splits. However, there are second numbers on those splits that I am guessing are bootstrap values. However, the figure legend doesn't mention what they are. If they are bootstrap values, then the fact that they are sometimes quite a bit lower than the posterior probability should be acknowledged in the discussion of the phylogenetic positions of the Halanaerobiales and Negativicutes. For example, the latter taxa maybe 'nested' within the Clostridia implying many independent losses of LPS as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, yet all of the backbone branches in the tree seem to be supported by very weak bootstrap values (if this values are what they seem to be). This is highly relevant to the discussion and should be mentioned. Specifically, the authors should specify a range of independent numbers of losses of LPS for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>. Furthermore, probably the authors should do topology tests (e.g. AU tests) to see if a 'basal' branching position of the Negativicutes within the Clostridia can be excluded statistically. I suspect not. It would also be useful to see bootstrap values on the LPS tree since posterior probabilities don't adequately capture the uncertainty in branching patterns.</p><p>3) There are far too many figures in the manuscript. Some are dispensable or should be moved to supplementary information. For example, Figure 6 is unreadable in the colours given and is not interesting (redo it without coloured background and put it in the supplementary material). Figures 7, 8 and 9 are interesting but large. Perhaps the authors can condense the information shown in these figures and put them as 3 panels of one figure. Alternatively pick two of them to make into two panels and put the third in supplementary information.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The paper by Antunes et al. describes detailed phylogenomic analyses of two diderm classes, the Negativicutes and Halanaerobiales that belong to the classically monoderm phylum Firmicutes. The results indicate shared outer membrane features between the two families that are also present in other diderm phyla. The authors conclude that since the outer membrane features are ancient in all diderm phyla, the presence of monoderm phyla in the current tree of bacteria is due to loss of the outer membrane from a common diderm ancestor.</p><p>I find the analyses thorough and incorporating significant amount of genomic data. However, these analyses are very similar to already published data and support published conclusions. In particular, previous phylogenetic analyses by Grant Jensen of the lps synthesis pathway, Omp85, TolC, and the flagellar genes <italic>flgH</italic> and <italic>flgI</italic> have already shown &quot;no evidence to suggest that recent lateral gene transfer played a role in its acquisition of an OM. The possibility of convergent evolution of the OM in the Veillonellaceae is ruled out by the presence of many unambiguous homologs of different subsystems associated with OM biogenesis and function in other Gram-negative phyla.&quot; Please refer to Figure S7 and the Discussion of Tocheva et al. 2011 Cell &quot;Peptidoglycan remodeling and conversion of an inner membrane into an outer membrane during sporulation&quot;. A phylogenetic tree of the Omp85 analysis shows the relationship between all diderm phyla and the lack of relationship with any one particular diderm phylum indicating that the Omp85 in A. longum (member of Veillonellaceae/Negativicutes) is an ancient feature. This is exactly what Antunes et al. claim with their more extensive analysis and present the idea as novel. It is important to note that the following hypothesis was also put forward by Jensen and co-authors: &quot;We are only proposing that a single membraned last common ancestor of both Firmicutes and Gram-negatives possessed some primitive sporulation/phagocytotic-like ability, which gave rise to the OM. From this double-membraned sporulation ancestor many phyla could have diverged. Any one of these could have lost the OM and given rise to the Firmicutes. Other phyla could have lost the ability to sporulate at different times, giving rise to the current models of microbial phylogeny.&quot; These findings were further discussed and supported by reviews and articles written by Errinton 2013 Open Biol &quot;L-form bacteria, cell walls and the origins of life&quot;, Vollmer 2011 Nat Chem Biol &quot;Bacterial outer membrane evolution via sporulation?&quot; and Yutin and Galperin 2013 Evniron Microbiol &quot;A genomic update on clostridial phylogeny: Gram-negative spores formers and other misplace clostridia.&quot;</p><p>A major point that the authors fail to address is the presence of a second membrane in certain species that lack LPS/OMPs. For example, they claim that Thermotoga and Actinobacteria are monoderm phyla, however, Thermotoga species clearly have a unique OM and so do Mycobacteria (members of Actinobacteria). The authors need to address the difference between diderm and outer membranes containing LPS/OMPs.</p><p>Overall, I find the paper by Antunes et al. to support already existing claims by elaborating on the analysis (Negativicutes and Halanaerobiales). I didn't find any significant new claims presented here and therefore I don't consider this work novel enough for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. This work would be appropriate for a more specialized journal since it provides detailed analysis of Negativicutes and Halanaerobiales and the relationship between the two.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14589.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Summary:</italic> </p><p><italic>The consensus is that this is an interesting topic and that the work has some novel findings.

See the individual reviews for more details.</italic> </p><p>We wish to thank the three reviewers and the editor for evaluating our submission and providing suggestions on how to make our analysis stronger. We agree that some improvement was necessary and we have now carefully revised the text by taking into account all comments. They helped improving the manuscript a lot, and we believe that its novelty with respect to previous publications is now clearly highlighted, as well the robustness of our results.</p><p>Regarding the novelty of our contribution, we acknowledge that Tocheva et al. 2011 and others made important contributions to the field. We have expanded the Introduction section to present these previously published data, which helps greatly to highlight the novelty of our analysis. Previous analyses were much less complete than ours, not because of inherent flaws but largely because of lack of genomic data for Halanaerobiales and Negativicutes, and results could not be interpreted unambiguously. The analysis by Tocheva et al. was very important, but largely focused on microscopy (their expertise field) rather than phylogenomics, and it presented a single tree (that of Omp85). Most importantly, they did not include Halanaerobiales.</p><p>We believe that the existence of a second diderm lineage in the Firmicute and its combined analysis with Negativicutes is one of the key originalities of our contribution. Moreover, we use much more genomes than any previous study. We would like to mention three major points that differentiate our analysis with respect to previously published data: (i) we robustly resolve the placement of the two diderm lineages in the Firmicutes phylogeny; (ii) we present for the first time a well-resolved LPS concatenate tree including a large taxonomic sampling of bacterial diversity, and clearly show that LPS-outer membranes are even more widespread in bacteria than currently known; (iii) we carry out a first detailed annotation of OM systems in these two atypical firmicute lineages, which complements the evolutionary discussion and provides important information on the Firmicute OM, guiding future experimental characterization. For all these reasons, we believe that our analysis provides robust phylogenomic data to the issue and, as such, is likely to become a highly cited reference, and of interest to the large audience of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>We notice that Tocheva et al. have just published a Perspective paper in Nature Rev Microbiol that basically enlarges the discussion of their 2011 paper. The existence of a second diderm lineage in the Firmicutes, the Halanaerobiales, is not mentioned, and the authors conclude by welcoming future new data. This underlines the current strong interest of the scientific community on the issue and makes our analysis all the more timely. We have included a note to acknowledge this review at the end of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>In addition to the topic of the novelty of the work some other concerns were raised by the reviewers which would need to be addressed in any revision. These include</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Phylogenetic analysis should be done of individual genes to examine congruence among different markers and not just a concatenation based phylogeny. See review #2 for more detail.</italic> </p><p>Concatenation of ribosomal proteins has become a standard in the literature, as it has been shown early on that these markers rarely transfer (see Brochier et al. 2002 for example). Nevertheless, we have carried out the congruence tests suggested by reviewer 2. We observed no major incongruence, therefore justifying concatenation. The same was done for LPS gene concatenation. See more detailed answer to reviewers.</p><p><italic>2) Release of alignments. The alignments used in this paper and the treefiles for the trees need to be released to a public site such as Figshare or Dryad.</italic> </p><p>These have been deposited to Dryad.</p><p><italic>3) Statistical analysis for phylogeny in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.

This issue (either further justification of this method or use of an alternative method) should be addressed in any revision.</italic> </p><p>Co-author Andreas Klingl, who is responsible for the electron microscopy platform at the University of Munich and who carried out the microscopy analyses is adamant on the quality of the images, and on the relevance of high pressure freezing for studying bacterial cell envelopes, as much as cryoelectron microscopy is. We would like however to precise that in this paper our aim was not to focus specifically on detailed microscopy analysis but to compare images of an outer membrane in Halanaerobiales and Negativicutes by the same technique, which had been lacking in current literature, and represents a good basis to discuss the genomics results. See more detailed answer to reviewers.</p><p><italic>7) Incomplete description of methods. See Review 1 in particular for more details but many of the methods used in the paper are not described in enough detail for readers to know what was done or for anyone to reproduce the work. A full description of all methods used needs to be included in any revision.</italic> </p><p>We have expanded the Methods section (see more detailed answer to reviewers). Given the small number of markers analyzed and the delicate issue of de novo annotation, we did not use any automatic bioinformatics pipeline, which would have been less precise, but went mostly manually. We now give enough details so that any reader will be able to reproduce our results.</p><p><italic>8) The computational workflows used in the paper (e.g., for identifying homologs and for generating and trimming alignments) are not tested in any obvious way.

Any claims in the paper need to be supported either by results in the paper or by referencing the literature.</italic> </p><p>We praise such editorial policy of <italic>eLife</italic> in a time where evolutionary scientists may seem to be encouraged to oversell their results to get to the big journals, with deleterious consequences for the credibility of the discipline. That was however not our aim, and in the revised version of the manuscript we are careful to back up any strong statement by a strong result, while introducing nuance otherwise.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>Overall, I believe this paper is novel and represents some important contributions to the field of evolutionary biology especially in regard to the evolution of major groups of bacteria and their cell envelopes. And the detailed analysis of the phylogeny and the genomes and predicted pathways is very useful and important. In general, I believe many of their conclusions are likely to be supported by the data. However, there are some significant limitations of the manuscript in its current form that prevent me from being able to go beyond &quot;likely to be supported&quot; to saying &quot;are supported&quot;. These areas need addressing before I would recommend publishing it in eLife.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for your comment on the importance of our work. We used a methodology that is relatively standard in phylogenomic studies. However, we acknowledge that more details were necessary. As for results, they have now been strengthened by additional tests allowing us to increase our confidence in their interpretation.</p><p><italic>Below are the major areas I think need addressing:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Methods description is generally incomplete and inadequate: much more detail needed including genome IDs, how COGs generated, BLAST parameters, HMM parameters, how outgroups were chosen, use of synteny and other information to predict function, how various web tools were run, parameters for many programs, what types of computers used, and much, much more. The methods are in many cases simply insufficiently described to be able to evaluate some sections of the paper.</italic> </p><p>Details on the genomes have now been included in a table provided as additional data. Both the text and the Materials and methods section have been expanded to provide more detail on the approaches. The small number of proteins analyzed and the fact that they are often clustered on the genomes helped a lot manual annotation. COG categories were assigned by blasting the COG database with a representative of each protein family. We used personal computers in the lab for small-scale analyses and the server of the Institut Pasteur to run Bayesian trees. It is unusual to provide such kind of information in the M&amp;M, and we would prefer not doing it.</p><p><italic>2) Limited assessment of how well their phylogenomic approach works. It is good to see some high PP and other scores for the trees but some more analysis showing the validity of their results is important. For example, how do the branching patterns the see compare to those seen in other studies (including within each group)? Do they have any data showing their identification of orthologs works well? What about their alignemtns and identification of poorly aligned regions?</italic> </p><p>We now discuss more in detail in both the Introduction and Results sections the similarities and differences between our results and those previously published, including the recent analysis by Kunisawa 2015. Of course, we cannot fully compare all internal branching among our analysis and previous ones as none of these analyses use identical taxonomic sampling, although they generally agree. Our major aim in this paper was to discuss the placement of Halanaerobiales and Negativicutes and as such we compare specifically these placements with respect to what was published previously.</p><p>Concerning orthologs identification, we have tested the congruence of markers before concatenation as suggested by reviewer#2. Description of alignments and trimming methods was already included in the M&amp;M of the originally submitted manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) All alignments used in different phylogenomic analyses and functional predictions need to be released publicly.</italic> </p><p>We are providing all the single gene datasets and the corresponding concatenates used for the ribosomal protein tree and the LPS tree. As for functional prediction, all information was already included in a large table S1 with all accession numbers of the markers discussed in the text for all Halanaerobiales and Negativicutes. This should be sufficient.</p><p><italic>4) There is repeated use of overly strong terms to describe the results and conclusions. For example the term &quot;indicate' or &quot;strongly support&quot; or their varieties are used extensively but in most cases are not appropriate (e.g., in regard to what their phylogenetic analysis implies or what the presence of genes in the genomes implies). The authors should go through the entire paper and rephrase many sections. In essence the problem is that the wording repeatedly over inflates the results. I agree in most cases that one could conclude &quot;we believe this result supports this model&quot; but unless they present statistics or explicit hypothesis testing that is as far as they should go in the wording.</italic> </p><p>The text has been largely modified, and we have introduced nuances when appropriate.</p><p><italic>5) Many statements are made in the text without either results or citations to back them up.</italic></p><p>The text has been extensively revised to take into account these comments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>In this manuscript the authors marshal several types of evidence (phylogenomic, TEM, and genome content analysis) to suggest that two very distinct types of bacteria – the Negativicutes and the Haloanaerobiales which belong to the single-membrane bounded ('monoderm') Firmicute clade of bacteria, (an important 'gram-positive' bacterial group) – actually possess outer membranes and are 'diderm'. Furthermore, the authors show that like classical gram-negative bacteria these taxa retain a number of the molecular machines that function with the outer membrane in 'diderm' bacteria. Their phylogenetic positions, as assessed by a 47 ribosomal protein super-matrix, indicate that they emerge from within two distinct clades in the Firmicutes suggesting that the 'monoderm' nature of other Firmicutes has evolved multiple times from 'diderm' firmicute ancestors. The authors go on to describe features of the outer membrane which must be ancestral to Firmicutes and lost separately in the monoderm members (flagellar genes, LPS genes and pilus genes). These are extremely interesting findings and are important contributions to the understanding of bacterial genome and cell evolution.</italic> </p><p><italic>In general I think the study is quite thorough and the conclusions are very interesting – especially with regard to the polyphyly of 'monoderm' condition within Firmicutes. This should serve as a strong argument against the claims that loss of the outermembrane is extremely rare and occurred possibly only once in prokaryotic evolution (e.g. as repeatedly claimed by Cavalier-Smith over the last few decades).</italic> </p><p>Thank you, this is a very pertinent comment. We now mention this point in the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>Below I itemize some suggestions for revisions in the manuscript:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The phylogenetic analyses of the 47 ribosomal protein genes are well done in general. However, these days there is a lot of talk about lateral gene transfer in bacterial genome evolution and I think it is important to do some kind of analyses to show that the authors believe that all of these proteins have evolved 'vertically' – i.e. demonstrate that their single phylogenies are generally congruent with each other. There are a number of published methods to do this rigourously that are very involved (e.g. as reviewed by Leigh et al. (2011) Genome Biol. Evol. 3:571-87). However I think simpler methods could also be used. For example, the authors could report the proportion of genes in the concatenate that support each of the splits in the ML tree that they show. They could also check to see whether any of the single gene trees conflict with the concatenated tree with &gt;70% bootstrap support for the conflicting split. Another measure that the authors could consider is 'internode certainty' (IC) that has recently been extended to the case where single gene trees do not contain all taxa of the full tree (i.e. deal with missing data) – see Kobert et al. (2016) Mol. Biol. Evol. (advanced access); this method has been implemented in RAxML and could be easily applied to the data set.</italic> </p><p><italic>Note that this same criticism applies to the concatenation of the 7 components of the LPS biosynthesis pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Some attempt to evaluate congruence amongst these markers should be made.</italic> </p><p><italic>The general point here is that there needs to be some evidence that the markers being used in these super-matrices are all congruent (or at least congruent for the relevant parts of the tree being discussed).</italic> </p><p>Concatenation of ribosomal proteins has become a standard in building species phylogenies, as they have been shown in the past to be less prone to horizontal gene transfer (see for example Brochier et al. 2002). To our knowledge, none of the previous analyses on the phylogeny of Firmicutes (and in general all recently published large-scale phylogenies) contain such individual gene congruence tests (see for example Yutin et al.; Kunisawa. etc.). However, we agree that such analyses can strengthen our results. It has to be noted, nevertheless, that no congruence test is perfect, in particular those based on strict topology comparison, and there is still much room for development of strategies and methodologies. Thank you for providing precise suggestions on possible software. We have used IC tests as they deal with different taxonomic sampling in the single gene datasets. Of course, ribosomal proteins being mostly small, the phylogenetic signal carried by each single marker is accordingly weak. As a result, most single gene trees were largely unresolved, and most topological differences among trees are likely due to stochastic errors rather than true incongruent signal. However, we found very few split conflicting with the concatenate tree at &gt;70% BV, as you suggested (IC&lt;1), and these do not concern any major high rank nodes, i.e. those leading to the monophyly of major classes and orders, which are important to our discussion. This analysis is now provided as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. All raw data are available for the reviewers in Dryad (folder IC-tests; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antunes et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Same results apply for the LPS genes. We decided to be more conservative and make a new analysis including only four core LPS genes instead of the seven genes previously used, because they are conserved in all bacteria containing LPS-OM and in order to avoid too much missing data that might have caused artifacts in the concatenate tree. Moreover, these four genes display conserved synteny across large taxonomic distances, strongly suggesting that they carry a congruent signal. Indeed, the resulting tree is fully consistent with the previous one based on 11 genes, and moreover it recovers monophyly of a few additional phyla. Congruence among the four markers was confirmed by IC tests, which showed no strong conflicting splits concerning the monophyly of major bacterial phyla at &gt;70% BV (now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) Figure two shows the Bayesian phylogeny estimated and posterior probabilities on splits. However, there are second numbers on those splits that I am guessing are bootstrap values. However, the figure legend doesn't mention what they are. If they are bootstrap values, then the fact that they are sometimes quite a bit lower than the posterior probability should be acknowledged in the discussion of the phylogenetic positions of the Halanaerobiales and Negativicutes. For example, the latter taxa maybe 'nested' within the Clostridia implying many independent losses of LPS as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, yet all of the backbone branches in the tree seem to be supported by very weak bootstrap values (if this values are what they seem to be). This is highly relevant to the discussion and should be mentioned. Specifically, the authors should specify a range of independent numbers of losses of LPS for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>. Furthermore, probably the authors should do topology tests (e.g. AU tests) to see if a 'basal' branching position of the Negativicutes within the Clostridia can be excluded statistically. I suspect not. It would also be useful to see bootstrap values on the LPS tree since posterior probabilities don't adequately capture the uncertainty in branching patterns.</italic> </p><p>Maximum likelihood analysis of the ribosomal protein concatenate with the site homogeneous model LG was basically consistent with the Bayesian tree but did not succeed in resolving the deepest nodes, in particular the four nodes you noticed with very low BV% (the ML tree is now provided as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). In fact, Bayesian analysis with the site heterogeneous model CAT+GTR frequently outperforms site homogeneous models such as LG that are implemented in maximum likelihood frameworks, and provides better resolution for deep, difficult nodes (Lartillot &amp; Philippe 2004).</p><p>This is clearly evident when we look at the LPS concatenate analysis. While the Bayesian tree with CAT+GTR resolves the monophyly of basically all major bacterial phyla, the ML tree with LG is completely unresolved (the tree is given to the reviewers for consultation, but we do not believe necessary to show this tree or map these BV% onto the Bayesian tree, as they do not contribute any meaningful data to the discussion).</p><p>Concerning AU tests on alternative topologies of the ribosomal tree, these are run with a site homogeneous model, and are expected to reflect the same uncertainty as the ML tree. Unfortunately no hypothesis testing is currently available in a Bayesian framework, so we could not compare the two models on these alternative topologies. We nevertheless ran AU tests with the LG site homogeneous model on 12 alternative topologies where Negativicutes or Halanaerobiales were moved “up and down” the n nodes separating them (N<sub>1</sub>-N<sub>6</sub> for the topologies involving moving the Negativicutes; H<sub>1</sub>-H<sub>6</sub> for the topologies moving the Halanaerobiales, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> and supplementary data). These alternative topologies imply a range of losses from 2 to 5. The Bayesian topology (H<sub>0</sub>N<sub>0</sub>) was the preferred one (5 losses). Then, two topologies only could not be rejected by the data, where the Negativicutes branched a bit earlier in the Clostridia (N<sub>1</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>, implying 4 and 3 losses respectively). Importantly, the alternative topologies presenting monophyly of Halanaerobiales and Negativicutes for these ribosomal markers was strongly rejected, as well as all the topologies where the Halanaerobiales were moved away from the root of the Firmicute tree. This is consistent with the separate origins of the two diderm lineages, and with the hypothesis of a diderm ancestor for the Firmicutes. Therefore, although this test with a less performing model than CAT+GTR, it adds robustness and completeness to our results and is now included in the revised version. This analysis is now provided as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>.</p><p><italic>3) There are far too many figures in the manuscript. Some are dispensable or should be moved to supplementary information. For example, Figure 6 is unreadable in the colours given and is not interesting (redo it without coloured background and put it in the supplementary material). Figures 7, 8 and 9 are interesting but large. Perhaps the authors can condense the information shown in these figures and put them as 3 panels of one figure. Alternatively pick two of them to make into two panels and put the third in supplementary information.</italic> </p><p>We agree. We removed Figure 6 and moved Figures 7, 8 and 9 to the supplementary material. They are now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">3</xref>, respectively.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>The paper by Antunes et al. describes detailed phylogenomic analyses of two diderm classes, the Negativicutes and Halanaerobiales that belong to the classically monoderm phylum Firmicutes. The results indicate shared outer membrane features between the two families that are also present in other diderm phyla. The authors conclude that since the outer membrane features are ancient in all diderm phyla, the presence of monoderm phyla in the current tree of bacteria is due to loss of the outer membrane from a common diderm ancestor.</italic> </p><p><italic>I find the analyses thorough and incorporating significant amount of genomic data. However, these analyses are very similar to already published data and support published conclusions. In particular, previous phylogenetic analyses by Grant Jensen of the lps synthesis pathway, Omp85, TolC, and the flagellar genes flgH and flgI have already shown &quot;no evidence to suggest that recent lateral gene transfer played a role in its acquisition of an OM. The possibility of convergent evolution of the OM in the Veillonellaceae is ruled out by the presence of many unambiguous homologs of different subsystems associated with OM biogenesis and function in other Gram-negative phyla.&quot; Please refer to Figure S7 and the Discussion of Tocheva et al. 2011 Cell &quot;Peptidoglycan remodeling and conversion of an inner membrane into an outer membrane during sporulation&quot;. A phylogenetic tree of the Omp85 analysis shows the relationship between all diderm phyla and the lack of relationship with any one particular diderm phylum indicating that the Omp85 in A. longum (member of Veillonellaceae/Negativicutes) is an ancient feature. This is exactly what Antunes et al. claim with their more extensive analysis and present the idea as novel. It is important to note that the following hypothesis was also put forward by Jensen and co-authors: &quot;We are only proposing that a single membraned last common ancestor of both Firmicutes and Gram-negatives possessed some primitive sporulation/phagocytotic-like ability, which gave rise to the OM. From this double-membraned sporulation ancestor many phyla could have diverged. Any one of these could have lost the OM and given rise to the Firmicutes. Other phyla could have lost the ability to sporulate at different times, giving rise to the current models of microbial phylogeny.&quot; These findings were further discussed and supported by reviews and articles written by Errinton 2013 Open Biol &quot;L-form bacteria, cell walls and the origins of life&quot;, Vollmer 2011 Nat Chem Biol &quot;Bacterial outer membrane evolution via sporulation?&quot; and Yutin and Galperin 2013 Evniron Microbiol &quot;A genomic update on clostridial phylogeny: Gram-negative spores formers and other misplace clostridia.&quot;</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the paper by Jensen and colleagues and we are sorry if we gave the impression that we did not acknowledge it sufficiently. According to the comments of the other two reviewers, we now give more detail in both the introduction and Results section on the analyses presented by Tocheva et al., as well as the other papers that dealt with the issue. However, we gently disagree with the claim that our analyses are very similar to the ones presented in that paper and do not provide any novel significant contribution. We present a lot of novel data that complement and extend previous studies including that of Tocheva et al. and provide much more robust results. To our knowledge, the only tree of an OM marker that was shown in Tocheva et al. was that of Omp85, while the other markers were only mentioned but not shown, so it is difficult to compare our results to theirs. In order to facilitate discussion and comparison with our results, we include in this response the Supplementary Figure S7 of Tocheva et al. that is mentioned above, for your convenience.</p><p>More importantly, Tocheva et al. did not include Halanaerobiales in their analysis, which is the major key that brings novelty to our study.</p><p><italic>A major point that the authors fail to address is the presence of a second membrane in certain species that lack LPS/OMPs. For example, they claim that Thermotoga and Actinobacteria are monoderm phyla, however, Thermotoga species clearly have a unique OM and so do Mycobacteria (members of Actinobacteria). The authors need to address the difference between diderm and outer membranes containing LPS/OMPs.</italic> </p><p>We might have been unclear in the text. We only say that these phyla do not have outer membranes with LPS, not that they are monoderms. We have now clarified this point in the revised version. The fact that the large majority of bacterial phyla have some sort of outer membrane is now clearly stated and strengthens the hypothesis of the monoderm phenotype being a derived feature.</p><p><italic>Overall, I find the paper by Antunes et al. to support already existing claims by elaborating on the analysis (Negativicutes and Halanaerobiales). I didn't find any significant new claims presented here and therefore I don't consider this work novel enough for publication in eLife. This work would be appropriate for a more specialized journal since it provides detailed analysis of Negativicutes and Halanaerobiales and the relationship between the two.</italic> </p><p>As also noted by the other two reviewers, we provide indeed a large number of novel results (even more in the revised version). The inclusion of Halanaerobiales as a second diderm lineage in the Firmicutes and its comparison to the Negativicutes is not an irrelevant issue of interest to a specialized audience, but is rather key to the discussion. We provide robust support for an existing claim that was based on much weaker and partial genomic data and met no consensus in the literature. Our analysis nicely complements and extends previous studies, including the one by Tocheva et al.</p></body></sub-article></article>
