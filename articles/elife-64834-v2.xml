new TB regimen to not only reduce treatment duration but also escape pathogen resistance mechanisms. With the aim of harnessing the host response in providing support to existing regimens, we used sertraline (SRT) to stunt the pro-pathogenic type I IFN response of macrophages to infection. While SRT alone could only arrest bacterial growth, it effectively escalated the bactericidal activities of Isoniazid (H) and Rifampicin (R) in macrophages. This strengthening of antibiotic potencies by SRT was more evident in conditions of ineffective control by these frontline TB drug, against tolerant strains or dormant Mtb. SRT, could significantly combine with standard TB drugs to enhance early pathogen clearance from tissues of mice infected with either drug sensitive/tolerant strains of Mtb. Further, we demonstrate an enhanced protection in acute TB infection of the highly susceptible C3HeB/FeJ mice with the combination therapy signifying the use of SRT as a potent adjunct to standard TB therapeutic regimens against bacterial populations of diverse physiology. This study advocates a novel host directed adjunct therapy regimen for TB with a clinically approved antidepressant to achieve quicker and greater control of infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mycobacterium tuberculosis</kwd><kwd>host directed therapy</kwd><kwd>antidepressant</kwd><kwd>sertraline</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001412</institution-id><institution>Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BSC0123</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rao</surname><given-names>Vivek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001412</institution-id><institution>Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OLP0136</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rao</surname><given-names>Vivek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001411</institution-id><institution>Indian Council of Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GAP0213</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rao</surname><given-names>Vivek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001412</institution-id><institution>Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>STS0016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rao</surname><given-names>Vivek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001412</institution-id><institution>Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MLP2106</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rao</surname><given-names>Vivek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001412</institution-id><institution>Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MLP2012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rao</surname><given-names>Vivek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sertraline, a widely used antidepressant, enhances the potency of the standard antimycobacterial therapy in preclinical models of TB infection.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The current TB therapy regimen ranging between 6 months for pulmonary and 1–2 years for extra pulmonary infections, is often associated with severe drug-induced toxicity in patients. Moreover, its failure to completely eradicate the pathogen from the host, forms an ideal platform for the emergence of drug-resistant strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blumberg et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sharma et al., 2017</xref>). It is not surprising that these strains have emerged at an alarming rate in the population and are imposing serious impediments to TB control programs globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Falzon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Singh et al., 2020</xref>). Introduction of newer modalities like host directed therapy (HDT) with the potential to reduce duration of therapy and not be affected by pathogen resistance mechanisms offer significant advantages in this scenario (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hancock et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Munguia and Nizet, 2017</xref>). Effective molecular entities like antibodies, cytokines, cell-based therapies, repurposed drugs have been tested against bacterial and viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Parida et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Foster, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zakaria et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fedson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Skerry et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Scanlon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yedery and Jerse, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jiménez de Oya et al., 2018</xref>). Several facets of infection response ranging from enhancing pathogen clearance to augmenting host metabolism or nutrition have been tapped to develop novel host targeted interventions strategies against complex bacterial infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lange et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Phelan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Oh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cusumano et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berube and Bubeck Wardenburg, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blum et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Mtb infection invokes several mechanisms of pathogen clearance in host cells involving, the induction of pro-inflammatory response, metabolic stress, phago-lysosomal lysis programs, apoptosis/autophagic mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Benmerzoug et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Martino et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shi et al., 2019</xref>). On the other hand, by virtue of its long standing association with humans, Mtb has evolved complex and intricate mechanisms to survive and establish optimal infection in the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Padhi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gupta et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brites and Gagneux, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Smith et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mehta and Singh, 2019</xref>). While attempts to boost the host immune mechanisms for better control of the pathogen are promising, efforts have focused on the development of counter-measures against pathogen mediated subversion of cellular clearance mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Salahuddin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Suárez-Méndez et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Singhal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Naftalin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lachmandas et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rayasam and Balganesh, 2015</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesized that neutralizing a prominent pathogen-beneficial response would indirectly supplement host immunity facilitating better pathogen control. The early, robust, type I IFN response of phagocytes to intracellular bacterial infections including Mtb, is often associated with a detrimental effect on host immune activation and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dorhoi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Watson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Donovan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shankaran et al., 2019</xref>). We sought to offset this response by using sertraline (SRT) – a previously identified antagonist of poly I:C mediated type I IFN signaling, in macrophages and evaluate Mtb infection dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhu et al., 2010</xref>). We demonstrate that SRT, effectively inhibited infection induced IFN that manifested as growth arrest of Mtb in macrophages. Interestingly, SRT could augment mycobacterial killing in the presence of INH (H) and rifampicin (R), two of the frontline TB drugs in macrophages by effectively lowering the concentration of antibiotics required to achieve clearance. Remarkably, the combination proved effective even against dormant bacilli or antibiotic tolerant Mtb strains. Addition of SRT to TB drugs – HR or HRZE (HR +pyrazinamide, ethambutol) significantly protected infected mice from TB-related pathology both by enhancing bacterial clearance and host survival, implying on the usefulness of this combination therapy in both the intensive and continuation phases of anti TB therapy (ATT). Taken together, we report a novel adjunct TB therapy module by repurposing the FDA-approved antidepressant – sertraline.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sertraline augments control of Mtb by frontline TB drugs in the macrophage model of infection</title><p>Macrophages respond to Mtb infection by elaborating an array of signaling cascades and effector functions with the nucleic acid driven type I IFN response as an active and dominant response to during infection in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shankaran et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Xu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Petit-Jentreau et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wassermann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wiens and Ernst, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Moreira-Teixeira et al., 2018</xref>). With its proven benefit to the pathogen, we hypothesized that suppressing the type I IFN response in cells would alter macrophage infection dynamics. The FDA-approved antidepressant – SRT, previously identified to suppress TLR-mediated IRF signaling in macrophages, controlled Mtb-induced type I IFN response in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). While extremely low doses up to 0.5 μM did not alter the response, doses of 1 μM and higher were significantly inhibitory. Even at 1 µM, SRT inhibited the response by 1.5–2 folds that increased to 35 and 43%, at 5 μM and 10 μM of SRT, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). At 20 µM, the observed fivefold decrease in RLU SRT reflected as complete loss of IFNβ secretion by Mtb infected macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Moreover, while naive macrophages were permissive for Mtb growth to 10-folds of input by day 6, 20 µM of SRT, despite its minimal activity on Mtb in vitro (inhibiting Mtb growth by ~30–40% by days 8–11 of culture), efficiently restricted growth in infected macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Sertraline inhibits Mtb-induced Type I IFN response and restricts intra-macrophage Mtb growth.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) IRF-dependent luciferase activity in THP1 Dual macrophages following infection with Mtb at a MOI of 5.

Decreased portioning of potent antibiotics to regions of bacterial presence in the center of granulomas remains a major cause for the improper clearance of bacteria from infected tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cicchese et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Prideaux et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, Mtb is endowed with the inherent propensity to enter into a drug-tolerant, non-replicating dormant state associated with drug tolerance and antibiotic failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sarathy et al., 2018</xref>). In order to mimic conditions of reduced effective drug concentrations, we tested the effect of SRT across three different concentrations of frontline TB drugs – isoniazid (H) and rifampicin (R). As expected, a gradual reduction in antibiotic effectivity was observed with decreasing doses; while C1 (200 ng/ml INH and 1000 ng/ml Rifampicin) was able to reduce bacterial numbers drastically (~62-fold by day 3 and ~92-fold by day 5), a 10-fold lower dose of C2 (20 ng/ml INH and 100 ng/ml Rifampicin) was less effective resulting in with 2–3 folds lower numbers and bacteriostasis in cells treated with the 2.5-fold lower dose -C3-8 ng/ml INH and 40 ng/ml Rifampicin (similar to input values) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). Addition of SRT efficiently boosted the bactericidal properties of antibiotics at all concentrations tested. Even at the highly effective HR concentration, addition of SRT further reduced bacterial numbers by 2–3 folds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Surprisingly, the ability of SRT to boost antibiotic properties was evident at lower doses- at the C2 dose, SRT lowered numbers by 8 at day 3 and 50 folds by day 5. Even at the lowest dose of C3, SRT substantially enhanced bacterial killing by 6- and 20-folds at days 3 and 5 post infection, respectively, in comparison to HR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>This ability of SRT was also observed in primary macrophages (human monocyte derived macrophages) from seven healthy individuals. Although Mtb growth varied across samples, the antibiotic potentiating effect of SRT was preserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Across different individuals, while SRT and HR individually showed minimal but highly variable bacterial control, SRT universally synergized with antibiotics to further reduce bacterial numbers by 10–15 folds supporting a more general adjunct activity of SRT to frontline TB drugs.</p><p>For further test of the combination in conditions that reflect reduced antibiotic availability, we used two recently established models of Mtb infection that would mirror this in vivo situation– (1) the recently reported model of vitamin-C-treated THP1 macrophages associated with Mtb dormancy and loss of HR efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sikri et al., 2018</xref>) and (2) lipid-rich conditions that restrict entry of frontline TB drugs in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dartois, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jaisinghani et al., 2018</xref>). Again, while HR efficacy was completely nullified in macrophages with vitamin C pretreatment, inclusion of SRT resulted in 10–12-fold lower bacterial numbers after 4 days of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). In order to mimic lipid rich conditions in ex vivo studies, we treated THP1 macrophages with 200 µM oleic acid and observed significant lipid loading in cells without any alteration in cellular morphology. However, the combination of H and R showed poor efficacy in controlling infection, from and found poor efficiency of HR in these cells, addition of SRT led to more than 10-fold reduction in bacterial loads, further substantiating the increased bactericidal properties of the combination (HRS) in conditions of decreased antibiotic efficacy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Sertraline-mediated increase in anti-microbial effect of TB drugs is dependent on attenuation attenuates Mtb-induced type I IFN signaling in macrophages</title><p>Similar to the type I IFN response restriction, SRT was found to increase HR efficiency in a dose dependent manner with doses lower than 1 µM failing to alter the growth of Mtb in macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). At concentration of 1–20 µM, SRT, could effectively synergize with antibiotics and inhibit bacterial numbers by ~5–70 folds, respectively, in the treated macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, SRT along with HR does not significantly inhibit growth in vitro, even 6 μM SRT failed to impact Mtb growth either alone or in combination with 3 concentrations of HR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), alluding to an indirect mode of SRT in enhancing the ability of macrophages to control bacteria rather than a direct action on bacteria. Our observation that SRT controlled Mtb induce type I IFN responses argued for further evaluation of this axis as a plausible mechanism. We first evaluated the impact of BX795, a specific inhibitor of type I IFN signaling, on bacterial growth control in our model of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>). We first established the efficacy of BX795 in abrogating Mtb-induced type I IFN in THP1 macrophages at different concentrations. Treatment of macrophages with BX795 at concentrations as low as 1.2 μM completely nullified the infection induced type I IFN response in macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Again, similar to SRT, BX795 alone resulted in bacteriostasis with bacterial numbers maintained at input levels in these cells in similar to SRT treated macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Again, addition of BX795 to HR enhanced bacterial control by 4–5 folds by day 3 of infection as compared to the antibiotics alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Given our observation of increased antibiotic efficacy by IFN inhibition (by SRT and BX795), we reasoned that a similar effect of increased antibiotic efficacy would be visible in IFN signaling deficient macrophages. To test this, we compared the intracellular bacterial numbers in cGAS<sup>-/-</sup> and STING<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages with WT cells after 3 days of treatment with HR. As expected, Mtb was restricted in its growth in these macrophages. Nearly 2–3 folds lower bacterial numbers were observed in cGAS<sup>-/-</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) with a much stronger inhibition (40–50 folds) in STING<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) in comparison to the corresponding IFN-sufficient cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Augmentation property of SRT is due to its ability to inhibit IFN signaling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Bacterial growth in macrophages treated with HR at C2 and different concentrations of SRT as indicated.

Our results hinted at the reciprocal effect of IFN signaling on macrophage infection control as has been demonstrated earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Teles et al., 2013</xref>). Further support for this was observed in the macrophages preactivated with IFNγ and treated with HR or HRS. While IFNγ treatment resulted in two- to threefold lower bacteria in combination with HR alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), we found a similar enhancement in IFNγ mediated control in SRT-treated macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Analysis of the pro-inflammatory response in SRT-treated infected macrophages also lend credence to this hypothesis. Gene expression profiles showed reduction in the expression of TNF and IL1β after 18 hr of treatment with SRT consistent with reported literature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sitges et al., 2014</xref>). In comparison to HR, while TNF expression was reduced slightly in the HRS-treated macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), negligible levels of TNF was observed in the cell supernatants in SRT-treated cells (SRT, HRS), contrasting with the high levels of TNF (between 500pg- 1 ng/ml) in the case of Mtb infected cells with or without treatment with HR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Surprisingly, while expression levels of IL1β were 2–3 folds lower in HRS-treated macrophages by 18 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), the amount of secreted cytokine was significantly elevated (&gt;2–3 folds) in macrophages treated with SRT/ HRS from 18 hr until 66 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). These data strongly indicated potential activation of the host cell inflammasome by SRT. With several studies supporting inverse regulation of type I IFN and inflammasome activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Szałach et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ruiz-Grosso et al., 2020</xref>), we tested the efficacy of SRT to potentiate antibiotic mediated killing in the presence of inflammasome inhibitors- isoliquiritigenin (I) and MCC950. Isoliquiritigenin did not show any significant effect on macrophages that were untreated or treated with HR or SRT alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, inset). However, while addition of SRT to HR significantly reduced bacterial numbers in macrophages by more than 10–20 folds, pretreatment of cells with the isoliquiritigenin, completely nullified this boosting effect of SRT on antibiotic efficacy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Treatment with a NLRP3-specific inhibitor- MCC950 also resulted in a reversal of enhanced bacterial control in HRS in infected macrophages without altering the effect of antibiotics alone on the bactericidal properties validating the involvement of inflammasome in the ability of SRT to enhance bacterial control by frontline antibiotics. In line with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Labzin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yu et al., 2018</xref>), we also observed a significant decrease in Mtb-induced type I IFN in macrophages following treatment with inflammasome activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>).

We reasoned that the survival of Mtb infected C3HeB/FeJ mice would provide an optimal platform for a fast readout of comparative drug efficacies of standard TB drugs and the adjunct regimen with SRT. Given the inherent heterogeneity of infection dynamics across animals of this mouse strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dawa et al., 2021</xref>), we opted for the higher dose of Mtb Erdman infection (500 cfu/ animal) to achieve acute infection in all animals. The adjunct effect of SRT was tested at effective-C1(1 x) and ineffective doses <italic>-</italic> C2 (0.1 x) and C3 (0.01 x) of INH and Rifampicin ad libitum in drinking water. To facilitate disease progression prior to treatment initiation, treatment with antibiotics was initiated after 2 weeks of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Aerosol delivery at this dose resulted in precipitous disease with rapid killing of untreated (NT) animals by day 31 of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). SRT alone was effective in delaying the disease progression in animals as the mean survival time (MST) increased from 31 days for untreated animals to 38 days. HR at the lowest concentration (C3), similar to SRT, deferred animal mortality with MST of 41 days while the higher doses of HR (C2 and C1) increased MST significantly to 85 and &gt;90, respectively. Given the higher susceptibilities of female mice to infection observed in our study, we decided to differentially tally the gender-based effects of SRT treatment in these animals. The combination of HRC3 and SRT, nearly doubled the MST of both female and male mice to 78 days and 100 days from 41 and 45 days respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This benefit of SRT was similar to that observed for a 10-fold higher concentration of HR alone (MST of 85 for HRC2).

Moreover, the adjunct regimen was efficient in controlling the infection in spleens of infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

Lungs of mice receiving the combination showed better resolution of granulomas with significantly smaller regions of cellular collection by 3 weeks dispersed across the tissue, that was more or less absent from the tissues of mice by the 6th week of treatment. Treatment with HRZE for up to 8 weeks did not effectively clear the bacterial from the lungs of infected mice (scale bar of 0.1mm). While untreated animals harbored close to 10<sup>6</sup> bacilli in the lungs, all treated mice had between 40 and 640 bacteria in the lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

With recent evidences implicating type I IFN as a pathogen beneficial response, we hypothesized that attenuating this axis would prove beneficial in controlling bacteria in macrophages. In line with this idea, we observed that the previously reported TLR3 antagonist – sertraline (SRT) could effectively stunt Mtb-induced type I IFN response in macrophages and also inhibit bacterial growth in macrophages.</p><p>SRT, along with other weak bases like fluoxetine, has been reported to moderately restrict intracellular Mtb replication in macrophages due in part to its weak basic nature without affecting the host cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schump et al., 2017</xref>). An important role for the acidic environment of bacteria resident vesicles (pH dependence) in the mycobactericidal properties of these drugs was demonstrated in this study. We also observed similar effects of SRT alone in our study – a moderate level of bacterial control in macrophages with minimal host cell death by treatment of SRT to infected macrophages. Additionally, several studies have indicated a direct action of SRT and other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors on host immune response pathways: from enhancing the anti-inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hannestad et al., 2011</xref>), augmenting NK and CD8 cell response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benton et al., 2010</xref>) and to inhibition of acid-sphingomyelinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kouznetsova et al., 2014</xref>), an essential component of the viral trafficking into NPC1 +endosomes in cells. Activation of host cell inflammasome and its antagonistic effect on the type I IFN response of cells has now been realized as important factors for controlling bacterial infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Novikov et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ji et al., 2019</xref>). A direct effect on activating eicosanoids which control type I IFN following infection was identified as a key bacterial clearance mechanism of infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hawn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mayer-Barber et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with this observation, targeted therapy toward elevating PGE2 activity protected mice from acute infection-induced fatality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mayer-Barber et al., 2014</xref>). In line with these observations, we also describe the ability of SRT to potentiate antibiotic-mediated killing by altering the inflammasome-type I IFN axis. Our results also highlight this cross-regulation between two important innate response pathways with SRT boosting the macrophage pathogen control program by repressing a pro- pathogenic and activating the host beneficial response. In line with this observation, treatment with inflammasome inhibitors reversed the ability of SRT to enhance the effects of HR in macrophages. While our work points toward the type I IFN antagonism-mediated inflammasome activation as a key mechanism in providing synergy to anti-TB therapy, identifying the exact molecular target of SRT in this process remains an important future challenge.</p><p>SRT combination with front-line anti-TB drugs provided early bacterial control with improved resolution of pathology and enhanced host survival, thereby being a strong candidate for host directed therapy. SRT provides additional benefits as an adjunct modality. The pharmacological properties of SRT with excellent PK-PD, safety and tolerance for long term usage in the human population has been well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sheehan and Kamijima, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ronfeld et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mandrioli et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, two patients undergoing TB therapy with INH given SRT as an anti- depressant, did not show any deleterious effects on long-term use of the combination, auguring well for safety in the human population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Malek-Ahmadi et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Judd et al., 1994</xref>). In addition, these studies combined with the enhanced protective capabilities of the combination therapy in pre-clinical animal models (our data), indirectly rule out any possibility of negative drug-drug interactions between SRT and ATT on prolonged usage. It is logical to expect that SRT with its wide use as an anti-depressant in adults and children may be beneficial in efficiently with a combination regimen of frontline TB drugs and SRT.</p><p>A recent clinical trial with SRT as an adjunct regimen with fluconazole for asymptomatic cryptococcal antigenemia demonstrated SAEs (non-fatal) in 4 out of 10 participants (3 with psychosis and aggressive behavioral changes, 1 with serotonin syndrome) as opposed to 3 out of 10 (1 fatal) SAEs in the control placebo group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boulware et al., 2020</xref>). While such concerns cannot be overlooked for use of SRT as an adjunct TB therapy, it would be prudent to weigh the advantages of the tackling the dual problem of severe drug induced depression in TB patients (invisible co-morbidity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sweetland et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Trenton and Currier, 2001</xref>) in future detailed studies on the effective dose and duration of therapy needs to be undertaken. Our studies with lower doses of sertraline showing greater efficacy would be of immense use in future clinical studies for testing this adjunct regimen. However, the collective properties of a SRT adjunct TB therapy – faster bacterial control, enhanced host survival and capacity to target drug tolerant/ dormant bacterial populations augurs well for the highly constrained national/ global economy combating the TB pandemic.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions<bold>—</bold>Mtb strains were cultured in Middlebrook 7H9 broth with 4% ADS or in 7H10/7H11 agar (BD Biosciences, USA) with 10% OADC (HiMedia laboratories, India).</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents</title><p>THP1 Dual Monocytes was obtained from InvivoGen (Toulouse, France).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Bavesh Kana as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Robert Wallis (Reviewer #2); Robert O Watson (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1. The conclusion that SRT enhances inflammasome activation is not supported by the data. The control Isoliquiritigenin, a NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor, potentially has other effects. In addition, NLRP3 inflammasomes appear to enhance Mtb growth and spread in host cells (see Beckwith et al. 2020) which would counter the argument that NLRP3 inflammasomes are central to SRT mediated bactericidal effects. Hence studies to demonstrate that the activity of SRT can be directly linked to inhibition of signaling would corroborate the hypothesis that SRT acts as an HDT. In this regard, demonstrating that SRT acts by interfering with IRF3 signaling would be helpful in addition to demonstration that IRF3 transcription is downregulated. There are multiple tools and assays available to explore pathways that lead to IRF3-dependent transcription as well as the ultimate outcome of these effects on phagosome maturation or autophagy.</p><p>2. SRT is presented as an antagonist of polyI:C-induced type I IFNs. However, during TB infection, cytosolic DNA sensing via the cGAS/STING axis constitutes the major pathway through which type I IFNs are induced in macrophages. To offer more support that SRT inhibits type I IFN, the authors should consider measuring the actual amount of type I IFN using an IFNb ELISA. Additionally, the authors should use human/mouse primary macrophages (not just THP1 reporter cells) and measure transcript levels (at key time points post infection) and protein levels of type I IFN and other proinflammatory mediators (e.g. TNFa, IL-1, IL-6) +/- SRT to determine if SRT is specific to the type I IFN response. If this is indeed the case, other NFkB genes/cytokines should not be impacted. A set of experiments using an IFN blocking antibody would enhance Figure 2, as both cGAS and STING KO macs have significant differences in basal gene expression and their ability to respond to innate immune stimuli.</p><p>3. Figure 1. It is hard to understand what the relative contributions are of sertraline (SRT) compared to the other treatments from the way that the data is presented in panels C and D. It would be easier to look at the data if presented as in panel B. What is the concentration of SRT in panel B? from panel C, the effect of HR is worse on day 5 compared to day 3, which does not match with the expected efficacy of this two-drug combo: thus, at 0.2ug/mL Rif (10X MIC) and 1ug/mL Rif (50X MIC), the effect at day 5 should be better than day 3. The text mentions that the effect is greater on day 5 (92-fold reduction compared to 62 on d3) but this is not supported by the C1 bars in panel C. Similarly, in panel D, C1 is worse on da 5 compared to day 3, thus the statement that SRT improves potency for C1 doses is hard to interpret. Panel E: what is the treatment time for the MDMs? This seems to be missing from the Materials and methods as well. The HR treatment appears rather inefficacious for the MDM if this is the C1 concentration but maybe the treatment time is short.</p><p>4. Figure 1H: what macrophage model was used? Mtb CFU go up by 10-fold which is not comparable to any of the other panels. How long have the macrophages been treated? It is odd that there is no dose dependence between 1-5uM SRT despite remarkable potency at these concentrations. The SRT needs to be titrated to lower doses (eg., 0.5 and 0.1uM). Sertraline and BX795 both inhibit IRF3 dependent signaling but by different mechanisms. SRT inhibits IRF3 signaling through inhibition of the PI3K pathway. In Figure 2 panels B and C, there is little evidence that SRT and BX795 have similar effects from the way that the data is presented. It would be best to perform experiments with BX795 using a similar experimental design to that used for SRT and to present this as in Figure 1 (as requested above, using a layout as in panel B). It seems odd that BX795 by itself causes bacteriostasis but it does not cause bacteriostasis in combination with HR even though it potentiates the activity of HR (panel C).</p><p>5. Isoliquiritigenin is not a very specific immune modulator, having multiple effects including effects on NLP3 inflammasomes. Nevertheless, it has an effect on Mtb CFU in the macrophages. To strengthen this, experiments with SRT alone and SRT + isoliquiritigenin should be added.</p><p>6. Figure 2F should also include a treatment with HR. This will support a model where IFN-γ treatment augments SRT activity.</p><p>Other concerns:</p><p>in vitro studies (i.e. bacterial culture) were only performed with SRT up to 6 μm while the cultured cell experiments used a range up to 20 uM. 5 μm had almost no effect on the viability/growth of Mtb in macrophages. Why was such a low concentration used in the in vitro experiments and a very high concentration in cell culture. Related to this, will the dose that was used in mice, when translated to humans, lead to toxicity? The authors may wish to consider a recent study by David Boulware of adjunctive sertraline in patients with cryptococcal antigenemia that was stopped early due to psychoses and serotonin syndrome. Please include these sentiments in the discussion. Also, what is the physiological concentration of SRT when taken for depression and how does that compare to the concentrations used in vitro? Are the in vitro concentrations feasible to achieve in patients?</p><p>Vitamin C leads to growth arrest of Mtb in vitro whereas in macrophages, Vitamin C does not suppress growth but does render isoniazid, rifampicin and ethambutol ineffective (Sikri et al., 2018). Stating that these bacteria are dormant (lines 113 – 117) comes across as incorrect given that the Mtb cells are growing.</p><p>Figure 1G: 200uM oleic acid should cause most of the THP-1 cells to become necrotic. Presumably this is the case, but it's not clear what the status is of the cells since these are infected. Please clarify.</p><p>Why does HR have no effect on WT macrophages in Figure 2, panels D-E? The type of macrophage used in Figure 2 should be indicated since it is known that different macrophage lineages are quite different with respect to their type 1 IFN production.</p><p>Figure 3B: The secretion of TNF-α is hard to understand. It is dramatically increased only at 42h in the HRS sample but supressed compared to HR alone in the other time points.</p><p>In contrast, IL1beta secretion does not explain the activity of SRT. At 42h, it is a bit higher in the HRS sample compared to untreated, HR or SRT-only samples. However, at 66h, it is highest in the untreated sample. Can the authors explain this?</p><p>An infecting dose of 500 CFU, especially in C3HeB/FeJ mice, does not lead to formation of caseous granulomas, although this is strain-dependent. This is an incredibly high dose. What drove the selection of this dose? It seems that the authors set themselves up for less robust results by using such high doses. The strain of Mtb used is critical and never mentioned. In addition, the authors do not show whether the classical type 1, type 2 and type 3 lesions form, which would generally be the basis for the selection of this mouse model.</p><p>Delivering drugs via drinking water is not ideal but is sometimes necessary when there's no manpower to do daily oral gavage. SRT is given as 10ug/mL in the drinking water. Do the authors know what the serum drug concentration is? Does it affect the serum drug concentrations of the other anti-tubercular drugs? It is possible that SRT affects metabolism of the other drugs thus this information seems important to have.</p><p>Figure 4: please indicate the number of mice in each group.</p><p>SRT increases the survival of the HRC3 and HRC2 drug treatments groups in Figure 4. How does SRT affect organ burdens? Effects on lung pathology are shown in the HRC1 and HRC1+ SRT groups showing improved pathology. This group survived beyond day 90 but are the effects on bacterial organ loads known?</p><p>The statement &quot;the adjunct regimen was efficient in controlling dissemination of infection into spleens&quot; is not necessarily supported by the data. Mice are treated at week 4 by which time dissemination has already occurred. Thus, SRT is effective in both lungs and spleens as an adjunct treatment but it's not clear what effect it has on dissemination.</p><p>Although there is some discussion of the histological findings in Figures 5-6, the images do not really show much difference between the groups. The differences shown can merely be attributed to the differences in bacterial burdens and does not point to any host-directed effect. A key feature of potential HDTs would be to reduce lung injury. It was difficult to assess the effects of SRT on lung pathology. Perhaps a detailed Image analysis would be helpful.</p><p>The authors may wish to cite a study by Sarah Stanley in Plos Pathogens in 2014 that found intracellular anti-TB effects of fluoxetine.</p><p>It is unlikely that HDTs would be adopted for the purpose of reducing the dose of TB drugs, but more likely for shortening treatment. Do the authors have any data on relapse in mice?</p><p>It might be worth consistently using the more common INH and RIF abbreviations to increase the clarity/readability of the manuscript and figures.</p><p>In Figure 3B, why is there a spike in TNF-a in the HRS treated cells only at 42h?</p><p>Was statistical analysis performed on the data in Figure 3B and D?</p><p>A description/discussion of the different mouse strains use in infection – what benefits each has as a model and why several were used – would help convey the impact of the in vivo studies.</p><p>Since antibiotics and SRT were administered ad libitum, how did the authors ensure that mice took enough of the antibiotics and especially SRT? Is it known whether these drugs affect the water taste enough to affect a mouse's willingness to drink them?</p><p>Was statistical analysis performed on time-to-death experiments?</p><p>Were CFUs measured in mice from Figure 4 to determine empirically how effective the antibiotic treatments were? And if SRT impacted their effectiveness?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64834.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1.

We agree with the reviewer that the previous study (Beckwith et.al., 2020) that inflammasome activation results is detrimental to bacterial growth, however, the importance of inflammasome in the context of TB-antibiotic treatment is not yet understood.</p><p>We employed two strategies to answer these questions:</p><p>1) To test if specific inflammasome activation was important for antibiotic efficacy, we used a more specific inhibitor of NLRP3 inflammasomes- MCC950 in HRS treated macrophages and observed reversal of antibiotic efficacy in these cells (Figure 3G).</p><p>2) By comparing antibiotic potencies in macrophages with and without MCC950 treatment (Fig-3H), we observed loss of antibiotic efficacy in MCC950 treated cells again supporting the synergy of inflammasome activation and antibiotics.</p><p>In parallel, we have also tested the effect of inflammasome activation by LPS and nigericin in improving the effectiveness of H and R in controlling bacterial growth in macrophages and observe that treating cells with LPS and nigericin augments antibiotic efficacy again substantiating the importance of inflammasome activation on antibiotic efficacy. We are currently pursuing this study forward and this would form the basis of a subsequent manuscript detailing the importance of this axis.</p><p>The IFN inhibitor BX795 is known to be a type I IFN inhibitor in cells (Clark et.al, 2009, J. Biol. Chem, 284(21): 14136-46). BX795 is recognised as a potent inhibitor of type I IFN signaling, selectively blocking the phosphorylation, nuclear translocation and transcriptional IRF3 signalling in RAW macrophages. BX795 was identified as a potent inhibitor of IRF3 nuclear translocation in a screen for small molecule modulators of STING- IRF3 (Koch et.al, 2018 ACS Chem Biol. 13 (4): 1044-81). We have employed BX795 in our study and show comparable effects of this treatment to SRT treatment on Mtb growth restrictions as well as antibiotic effectiveness providing evidence for type I IFN restriction via IRF3 signalling inhibition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

If this is indeed the case, other NFkB genes/cytokines should not be impacted.</p></disp-quote><p>We have tested the effect of SRT on the expression of these genes in human MDMs. We do not see any significant change in the transcript levels of TNF in these macrophages following treatment with SRT, however given the variables associated with human primary cells, the numbers that we tested were small and did not reach any significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Even in the mouse Bmdm from C57BL6 mice, while the trend of increased expression of IL1β and decreased IFN with SRT treatment was observed, these results did not reach statistical significance. However, in these cells, we observed increased expression of TNF and IL6 with SRT treatment indicating the upregulation of NFkb dependent pathways in these cells. For another inflammatory cytokine like IL18, again we did not see any significant difference in the levels of expression in the SRT- and SRT+ groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). Given, our results with BX795, a potent inhibitor of IRF3 signalling and not impacting canonical NfkB signalling (Clark et.al, JBC, 2009), we shifted our attention to exploring the IFN 1 pathway in detail. Exploring detailed mechanistics of innate signalling affected by SRT would be part of a future comprehensive manuscript.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Relative expression of inflammatory cytokines in hMDMs treated with HR or HRS.</title><p>Data depict fold expression (transcript abundance) relative to UI alone as mean + SEM from three independent experiments with triplicate wells each at 18h post treatment.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-64834-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Relative expression of inflammatory cytokines in mBMDMs treated with HR or HRS.</title><p>Data depict fold expression (transcript abundance) relative to UI alone as mean + SEM from two independent experiments with triplicate wells each at 18h post treatment.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-64834-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In terms of cytokine secretion, we did observe a statistical downregulation of TNF and IFNα levels in human MDM, however, we did not observe any difference in the levels of TNF, IL6 or IFNγ in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>). Moreover, while we did not observe any significant difference in the levels of IL1β cytokine, the levels of IL1RA were significantly downregulated. Recent evidence suggests that IL1RA is involved in the stunting of IL1β signalling in line with our data of increased IL1β signalling and expression in the SRT treated cells. (JI et.al, 2019, nat.

While in the THP1 cells, these results are pronounced at the tested conditions, in primary human and mouse cells, the extent and kinetics of modulation may differ. Analysing these aspects in detail would involve significantly higher numbers of experiments that would form the basis for independent studies. While in most cases, a direct correlation of responses seen in one organism is possible, the inherent differences in the immune response dynamics the kinetics of this response can differentiate the responses seen in the two conditions. Moreover, given that the immune signalling pathways often intersect at multiple time points, it is often not possible to correctly associate a phenotype observed in one cell type vs the other.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A set of experiments using an IFN blocking antibody would enhance Figure 2, as both cGAS and STING KO macs have significant differences in basal gene expression and their ability to respond to innate immune stimuli.</p></disp-quote><p>We tested the effect of IFNAR antibody in an attempt to block the signalling cascade.

What is the concentration of SRT in panel B? from panel C, the effect of HR is worse on day 5 compared to day 3, which does not match with the expected efficacy of this two-drug combo: thus, at 0.2ug/mL Rif (10X MIC) and 1ug/mL Rif (50X MIC), the effect at day 5 should be better than day 3. The text mentions that the effect is greater on day 5 (92-fold reduction compared to 62 on d3) but this is not supported by the C1 bars in panel C. Similarly, in panel D, C1 is worse on da 5 compared to day 3, thus the statement that SRT improves potency for C1 doses is hard to interpret. Panel E: what is the treatment time for the MDMs? This seems to be missing from the Materials and methods as well. The HR treatment appears rather inefficacious for the MDM if this is the C1 concentration but maybe the treatment time is short.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the panels (now D and E) to make it easier to comprehend the contribution of SRT with respect to HR. SRT was used at the concentration of 20μM for macrophage infections, either alone or in combination with HR. We thank the reviewer for suggesting changes in depicting the figures, we have represented the data to read better. We do see a gradual increase in the efficiency of HR by day 5 than at day 3, however, while SRT in combination works 4-5 folds better than HR alone at day 3, the enhanced effect is not significant at day 5. We have used a concentration of 0.1X HR (HRC2) for MDMs again to evaluate if SRT would work in conditions of less-than-optimal efficacy of the frontline TB drugs. We have added this in the legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 1H: what macrophage model was used? Mtb CFU go up by 10-fold which is not comparable to any of the other panels. How long have the macrophages been treated? It is odd that there is no dose dependence between 1-5uM SRT despite remarkable potency at these concentrations. The SRT needs to be titrated to lower doses (eg., 0.5 and 0.1uM). Sertraline and BX795 both inhibit IRF3 dependent signaling but by different mechanisms. SRT inhibits IRF3 signaling through inhibition of the PI3K pathway. In Figure 2 panels B and C, there is little evidence that SRT and BX795 have similar effects from the way that the data is presented. It would be best to perform experiments with BX795 using a similar experimental design to that used for SRT and to present this as in Figure 1 (as requested above, using a layout as in panel B). It seems odd that BX795 by itself causes bacteriostasis but it does not cause bacteriostasis in combination with HR even though it potentiates the activity of HR (panel C).</p></disp-quote><p>The THP1 infection model was used in this study of dose dependent efficacy of SRT (earlier Figure 1H, now Figure 2A). These are CFU values at day 5 in relation to day 0. This kinetics of growth is anticipated for Mtb in macrophages at an MOI of 5, wherein bacterial numbers increase until day 4-5 to values in the observed range. We again thank the reviewer for the suggestions to titrate the SRT doses to lower ranges. We have tested these at concentrations upto 0.05μM and have shown this as Figure 1A, Figure 2—figure supplement 1 (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig5">Author response image 5A</xref>, B).</p><p>Both BX795 and SRT inhibit type I IFN signalling although at different nodes in the signalling cascades. Experiments with BX795 at 10μM have been performed similar to the ones with SRT alone in THP1 macrophages. These results also show that similar to SRT alone, BX795 imparts bacteriostasis, while in combination with HR shows increased control than HR alone. While we are not able to completely comprehend the basis for this effect of both SRT and BX795, we feel that inhibition of Mtb driven type IFN induction after infection with Mtb, leads to an arrest of bacterial growth in macrophages. A detailed analysis of the underlying mechanisms responsible for this augmentation would shed further light into the actual pathway and would form the basis of a new manuscript.</p><fig id="sa2fig5" position="float"><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption><title>Testing the effect of SRT at lower concentrations: A-IRF dependent luciferase activity in THP1 Dual macrophages following infection with Mtb at a MOI of 5.</title><p>Cells were left untreated or treated with increasing concentrations of SRT for 24h in culture and the luminescence in culture supernatants was measured and is represented as mean + SEM from 2 independent experiments with triplicate wells each.

Isoliquiritigenin is not a very specific immune modulator, having multiple effects including effects on NLP3 inflammasomes. Nevertheless, it has an effect on Mtb CFU in the macrophages.

Why was such a low concentration used in the in vitro experiments and a very high concentration in cell culture.</p></disp-quote><p>We haven’t seen any appreciable decrease in the growth of Mtb at upto 20μM in in vitro experiments, nearly 30-40% restriction after 8 days of culture. We used in combination of HR a lower dose of 6mM in combination with HR to offset the effect of minimal SRT inhibitory effects so that only the effect of SRT is understood.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to this, will the dose that was used in mice, when translated to humans, lead to toxicity? The authors may wish to consider a recent study by David Boulware of adjunctive sertraline in patients with cryptococcal antigenemia that was stopped early due to psychoses and serotonin syndrome. Please include these sentiments in the discussion. Also, what is the physiological concentration of SRT when taken for depression and how does that compare to the concentrations used in vitro? Are the in vitro concentrations feasible to achieve in patients?</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the concerns of the reviewer and have incorporated these suggestions in the discussion about the possibility of excess toxicity and complications of using SRT at these doses. People with depression are prescribed between 50-200mg/kg/day, our dose ranges at the higher spectrum of the prescribed dose. To also address this further, we have done dose escalation experiments with lower doses of SRT in combination with TB drugs (Figure 6D, E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Vitamin C leads to growth arrest of Mtb in vitro whereas in macrophages, Vitamin C does not suppress growth but does render isoniazid, rifampicin and ethambutol ineffective (Sikri et al., 2018).
