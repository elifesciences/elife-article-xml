upon adaptive changes in the organization of whole-brain functional networks. However, the link between task-induced network reconfigurations and their underlying energy demands is poorly understood. We address this by multimodal network analyses integrating functional and molecular neuroimaging acquired concurrently during a complex cognitive task. Task engagement elicited a marked increase in the association between glucose consumption and functional brain network reorganization. This convergence between metabolic and neural processes was specific to feedforward connections linking the visual and dorsal attention networks, in accordance with task requirements of visuo-spatial reasoning. Further increases in cognitive load above initial task engagement did not affect the relationship between metabolism and network reorganization but only modulated existing interactions. Our findings show how the upregulation of key computational mechanisms to support cognitive performance unveils the complex, interdependent changes in neural metabolism and neuro-vascular responses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>simultaneous pet/mri</kwd><kwd>brain metabolism</kwd><kwd>functional connectivity</kwd><kwd>functional PET</kwd><kwd>dynamic causal modeling</kwd><kwd>metabolic connectivity mapping</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FWF KLI 610</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hahn</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001822</institution-id><institution>Austrian Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DOC Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rischka</surname><given-names>Lucas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1099082</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cocchi</surname><given-names>Luca</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1138711</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cocchi</surname><given-names>Luca</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cognitive performance is supported by symbiotic metabolic and neuro-vascular responses in task-specific brain networks.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Brain function relies on coordinated activity in local neural circuits, from which large-scale functional brain networks are composed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Park and Friston, 2013</xref>). Such changes in the activity of local neural circuits and large-scale systems are paralleled by the modulation of metabolic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Riedl et al., 2016</xref>). Recent work has assessed the dynamic changes in functional brain network architecture associated with cognitive task engagement. Results from these investigations have challenged the prior notion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smith et al., 2009</xref>) that functional interactions at resting-state are relatively stable and sufficient to support goal-directed behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cocchi et al., 2013</xref>). For example, studies have highlighted dynamic brain network reconfigurations when switching from a state of rest to that of cognitive engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Braun et al., 2015</xref>). Solving tasks of increasing cognitive complexity has further been linked to complex changes in the functional interplay between cortical regions that otherwise comprise distinct networks at rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hearne et al., 2017</xref>). These findings are in line with the proposal that brain networks exhibit a flexible modular architecture, with highly interconnected hub regions changing their functional network assignment according to task demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cole et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Task-induced neural activation in segregated brain regions and corresponding network dynamics have, of late, been largely assessed using the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal. The BOLD signal represents a non-specific proxy of activation, which is directly mediated by hemodynamic factors including changes in blood flow and oxygen content rather than by neural metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Heeger and Ress, 2002</xref>). As a result, the metabolic underpinnings accompanying large-scale functional network reconfigurations that support cognition have received little recent research focus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Horwitz et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McIntosh et al., 1994</xref>). It also remains unknown if the association between functional connectivity and metabolism is confined to specific task-related brain networks or extends more globally. Furthermore, the variation of this association as a function of task load is poorly understood. To address this gap in knowledge, we analyzed simultaneously acquired positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI, i.e., BOLD and arterial spin labeling (ASL)) data while healthy participants performed a well-validated cognitive task comprising two levels of difficulty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haier et al., 2009</xref>). By combining these different imaging modalities we were able to (i) comprehensively map whole-brain network reconfigurations as a function of varying cognitive demands; (ii) assess the coupling between task-driven metabolic increases and modulations in functional connectivity; and (iii) model the neural dynamics underpinning changes in functional connectivity and related metabolic demands. We hypothesized significant task-induced changes in the link between metabolic and neural factors, supporting our ability to flexibly engage in cognitive processes. Previous work has shown that the bulk of functional network reconfigurations occur when participants engage in a cognitive task, with minor reorganizations as a function of cognitive load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hearne et al., 2017</xref>). We therefore expect greater metabolic demands to be mobilized to establish task-specific patterns of functional brain interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Simultaneous functional MRI (BOLD and ASL) and [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET data were acquired while 22 healthy adult participants performed a cognitive task (Tetris).

This was followed by task-specific PET/MR acquisition. During the fPET measurement (52 min, blue) participants completed four times (6 min each) the video game Tetris with two levels of cognitive load. Simultaneous MRI acquisition included BOLD used to estimate functional connectivity (orange) and ASL (green). In the final part of the experiment, participants performed 12 task blocks (easy, hard and control, 30 s for each block, red) during BOLD acquisition to estimate neural task effects and to compute effective connectivity using dynamic causal modeling. Numbers indicate the duration of blocks in minutes unless indicated otherwise. (<bold>B</bold>) Task load (easy and hard) was defined by the speed of the falling bricks and the amount of bricks at the bottom. In the control condition the bricks were navigated through the channel, but no lines could be built as bricks vanished afterwards. (<bold>C</bold>) Data analysis comprised three main steps (same color codes as in A). First, brain regions involved in task processing were identified as conjunction of task-specific changes in glucose metabolism (fPET), blood oxygenation (BOLD) and blood flow (ASL). Second, the interplay between these brain regions was determined by the combination of metabolism and functional connectivity at rest and during task performance. Seed-to-voxel correlations were calculated to obtain patterns of functional connectivity. Metabolic connectivity mapping (MCM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Riedl et al., 2016</xref>) was then computed by correlating the regional patterns of metabolic demands and functional connectivity with the inference of directionality if these spatial patterns show a significant association. Third, to assess the putative link between MCM and neural dynamics, the resulting MCM model was compared to the one obtained using dynamic causal modeling (DCM).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-52443-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>We first integrated information regarding task-related changes in local BOLD signals, cerebral blood flow (CBF) and glucose consumption to identify functionally segregated brain regions involved in task performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This analysis leveraged the recently introduced approach of functional PET (fPET) imaging to determine task-specific changes in the cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMRGlu) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hahn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rischka et al., 2018</xref>) as well as canonical analyses for BOLD and ASL signal changes.

MCM evaluates the association between <italic>regional</italic> patterns of BOLD-derived functional connectivity and glucose metabolism (see Materials and methods for rationale underlying this approach). To this end, task-based functional connectivity was computed from data collected during periods of continuous task performance (6 min, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This approach minimizes the influence of nonspecific factors including episodic rest-to-task transitions and major changes in visual luminance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cole et al., 2019</xref>).

In addition to increments in regional neural activation and energy consumption, the execution of a cognitively challenging task elicited a marked increase in the association between glucose metabolism and functional network dynamics. In our task, requiring rapid and complex visuo-spatial reasoning, this effect was specific to feedforward connections linking the visual and dorsal attention systems. Once established, the task-based association between metabolic and neural demands reached a plateau and only few effective connections were further modulated by additional cognitive load. These findings highlight the key role of metabolic factors in supporting brain network reconfigurations as a function of cognitive engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bassett et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cocchi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cole et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hearne et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Task performance led to regional increases in different parameters of energy consumption including CMRGlu, CBF and BOLD-inferred activation. To date, only a few studies using [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG fPET imaging have assessed the possible functional relationships between these diverse parameters of brain activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Horwitz et al., 1995</xref>). For example, the association between task-induced BOLD signal changes and glucose metabolism (but not CBF) has been previously studied using simple visual stimulation and finger-tapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rischka et al., 2018</xref>) and with a visual-perceptual task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jamadar et al., 2019</xref>). Here we extend upon previous work by providing a comprehensive assessment of the neural and metabolic processes supporting performance in a complex cognitive visuo-motor task. We demonstrated that the technique of fPET is sufficiently sensitive to capture metabolic differences between multiple levels of cognitive load. Moreover, our results directly support previous findings, suggesting that regional neural and metabolic changes converge in spatially circumscribed and functionally specialized brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jamadar et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Riedl et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rischka et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Our results provide novel information regarding the link between energy demands and neural dynamics on a whole-brain systems level. We demonstrated that changes in metabolic demands and large-scale network dynamics converge when participants engage in a cognitive task. In other words, the association between glucose metabolism and BOLD-derived functional connectivity strengthened during cognitive performance, compared to a state of rest.</p><p>The relationship between blood flow and metabolic factors has been demonstrated to be in balance at rest, whereas task-induced neural activations induce a mismatch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gusnard et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Raichle et al., 2001</xref>). Specifically, CMRGlu and CBF markedly increase compared to oxygen consumption in response to increases in local neural activity. The resulting difference between CBF and oxygen consumption is thought to be the major driver of changes in the BOLD signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fox and Raichle, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Raichle, 1998</xref>). Increases in CBF are linked to glutamate release via both neuronal and astrocytic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Attwell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mishra et al., 2016</xref>), supporting the contribution of glutamate-mediated post-synaptic processing to BOLD signal changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Logothetis et al., 2001</xref>). The coupling between BOLD changes, local high frequency neurophysiological activity and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Engell et al., 2012</xref>) also implicates the contribution of local recurrent feedback to BOLD, as well as activity reflecting efferent output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Siero et al., 2013</xref>). On the other hand, the relationship between CBF and CMRGlu is attributable to the downstream effects of glutamate release associated with neuronal activation. In fact, glutamate release also leads to an increased glucose uptake into neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lundgaard et al., 2015</xref>) and astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zimmer et al., 2017</xref>), to provide energy for the reversal of ion gradients and glutamate recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harris et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Magistretti and Allaman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Raichle and Mintun, 2006</xref>). These considerations highlight the linked but distinct mechanisms underpinning BOLD fMRI and [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET signals. The asymmetry of these two different imaging techniques motivates the assumptions underlying MCM. Although the physiological mechanisms coupling CBF and CMRGlu most likely remain the same, our findings indicate that the time-dependent, nonlinear interactions between synaptic processing, energy consumption and neurovascular responses across macroscopic brain regions become apparent when engaging in a cognitively demanding task. The ability of functionally specialized brain regions to dynamically change their connectivity patterns is essential for cognitive processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cocchi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cole et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hearne et al., 2019</xref>). Our results extend this knowledge by highlighting that external task engagement is accompanied by the convergence between metabolic factors and functional brain network reconfigurations.</p><p>In a state of rest, the association between glucose metabolism and functional connectivity was confined <italic>within</italic> a given functional system, namely the dorsal attention network. In contrast, task performance elicited the emergence of marked interactions <italic>between</italic> brain regions known to be part of distinct resting-state networks including the visual and dorsal attention systems. These observations support previous results on the emergence of between-system interactions during visual task execution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Riedl et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast to the substantial changes associated with the transition from rest to task, we observed that additional cognitive load does not substantially influence the association between metabolic and neural processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These findings suggest that departing from the intrinsic (resting-state) network configuration carries the bulk of the metabolic cost associated with external task engagement. Considering that the availability of glucose in the brain is carefully maintained (unless experimentally or pathologically altered) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dienel, 2019</xref>), our results put forward the hypothesis that the functional limits of efficient cognitive performance are largely related to neural processes supporting dynamic interactions between remote brain regions. Our work provides a strong motivation for future studies aiming to test this hypothesis and assess to what extent cognitive limits may depend on the efficiency of neural ensembles to use the underlying metabolic resources.</p><p>Within the task-based network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), MCM and DCM allowed inferences regarding the directionality of functional connectivity between brain regions supporting task processes. Specifically, the use of these techniques draws upon metabolic knowledge (MCM) and computational modeling (DCM) to disambiguate the task-related changes in local engagement from inter-regional interactions, which compound classic linear measures of functional connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cole et al., 2019</xref>). Our results showed that task engagement was associated with the emergence of distinct patterns of effective connectivity from the visual to the dorsal attention networks. DCM further highlighted fine-grained modulations of specific connections as a function of increased task load. The observed bottom-up processing of visual input is in line with the role of attention networks in stimulus-driven control of attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corbetta and Shulman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vossel et al., 2014</xref>) as well as the observed emergence of feedforward interaction with the FEF following stimulation of the visual cortex via transcranial magnetic stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castrillon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cocchi et al., 2016</xref>). On the other hand, the lack of feedback control of the dorsal attention network over visual areas is consistent with studies showing that top-down modulation only emerges when distractors need to be filtered or context specific information extracted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corbetta and Shulman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vossel et al., 2014</xref>), which was not the case in our task.</p><p>Estimating measures of directed functional connectivity is a considerable challenge, particularly when those measures depend purely upon conditional likelihoods in the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Smith et al., 2011</xref>), or in networks with closed cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ramsey et al., 2010</xref>). In this context, it is worth considering the complementary nature of the two different approaches (DCM and MCM) used in this work to infer causal directionality. Whereas DCM requires careful a priori selection of regions and specification of a model space, MCM is less vulnerable to these issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Riedl et al., 2016</xref>). MCM represents a simplified index of effective connectivity that draws upon the coupling between glutamate-mediated changes in the BOLD signal and metabolic demands. On the other hand, DCM provides a formal assessment of interactions between neural populations using a computational model that has been extensively validated (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stephan et al., 2008</xref>). By using a generative model and an observation (HRF) equation, DCM also avoids reliance upon making direct inference on conditional dependences in data, a challenge for many measures of directed functional connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Smith et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In interpreting our findings, we acknowledge that the limited sample size of this study may have diminished the ability to detect more subtle changes in the coupling between metabolic and neural processes. Although small changes between the two task conditions may indeed be present or further brain regions may have been involved, these effects more likely play only a minor part in processing of the employed task and are therefore unlikely to substantially change the implications of our results. Also, our task only tested for a circumscribed set of visual-motor cognitive domains. While it is unlikely that the observed effects are specific to a given set of cognitive functions, future work is required to expand current findings to different domains. By successfully linking metabolic and functional network dynamics, the current study provides new methodological and neurobiological frameworks to understand the nature of pathological alterations of brain functions. Specifically, our paradigm and findings may help unfold the complex interdependent effects of cognitive, metabolic, and neural factors in pathologies such as epilepsy, schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Scherr et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental design</title><p>All participants underwent a single PET/MRI examination during performance of a challenging cognitive task within this cross-sectional single-site study. The experimental sequence comprised a structural scan (8 min), ASL and BOLD signal acquisitions as well as simultaneous fPET imaging at rest and during task performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). During periods of rest, participants were instructed to look at a crosshair, relax and not focus on anything in particular. First, one ASL and BOLD sequence (6 min each) were each obtained at rest. Next, fPET started with a baseline of 8 min, which was followed by 4 periods of continuous task performance (6 min each, two easy, two hard, randomized) with rest periods following all tasks (5 min each). During the task periods (see description below), ASL and BOLD data were also acquired in pseudorandom order. BOLD data obtained during these continuous task periods were used for the computation of functional connectivity. The session finished with the acquisition of BOLD data in a conventional block design with performance of the same task (12 task blocks, 30 s each, four easy, four hard, four control, randomized, 8.17 min in total) separated by short periods of rest (10 s each). Data from this BOLD block design allowed inference of task-specific changes in neuronal activation and dynamics using DCM. Thus, participants completed the same task in both the continuous task performance and block design components of the session. The timing of these tasks differed in order to optimize the efficiency of the various analyses (cross-modal functional connectivity <italic>vs.</italic> activation analyses, respectively; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The total scan time was 100 min, which represents a typical duration for PET studies.

Bricks descended from the top of the screen and required rotation and alignment in order to build horizontal lines. Completed lines then vanished and increased the score. The upcoming brick was shown in a preview on the screen. To move the bricks participants used four buttons with the right hand only (index finger: move brick left, middle: rotate, ring: down, small: right). The two task conditions were different in the speed of the descending bricks (easy/hard: 1/3 lines per sec) and the number of incomplete lines that were already built at the bottom (easy/hard: 2/6 lines out of 20). An additional control condition was used for the BOLD block design only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Here, bricks required navigation through a channel, which then vanished at the bottom (i.e., there was no possibility to build or complete lines). To familiarize with the task and the control buttons, participants completed a 30 s training of each condition before the scan started. The implementation represents a cognitively challenging task which requires rapid visuo-spatial motor coordination, spatial planning and problem solving. The adopted task is also well-suited for continuous performance of several minutes, which is required for the detection of task-specific glucose metabolism with fPET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rischka et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Participants</title><p>Twenty-two healthy participants were recruited for this study (mean age ± SD = 24.0 ± 3.1 years, 11 female, all right-handed).

All participants underwent a standard medical examination at the initial screening visit, which included blood tests, electrocardiography, neurological testing and the Structural Clinical Interview for DSM-IV performed by an experienced psychiatrist. Female participants also underwent a urine pregnancy test at the screening visit and before the PET/MRI scan. Exclusion criteria were current and previous (12 months) somatic, neurological or psychiatric disorders, current and previous substance abuse or psychotropic medication, contraindications for MRI scanning, pregnancy or breast feeding, previous study-related radiation exposure (10 years) and previous experience with Tetris in the last 3 years. After detailed explanation of the study protocol, all participants gave written informed consent.

During the scan manual arterial blood samples were drawn at 3, 4, 5, 14, 25, 36 and 47 min after start of the tracer application. This sampling scheme has been shown to be sufficient for the determination of the input function for the employed bolus plus infusion protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rischka et al., 2018</xref>). Processing of blood samples included measurement of whole-blood activity in a gamma-counter (Wizward<sup>2</sup>, 3’, Perkin Elmer), separation of plasma and again measurement of plasma activity.

In short, PET data were reconstructed to frames of 30 s (matrix size = 344×344, 127 slices) and corrected for attenuation using an established database approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burgos et al., 2014</xref>). Image preprocessing in SPM12 included motion correction (quality = 1, registered to mean), spatial normalization via the T1-weighted structural MRI and smoothing with an 8 mm Gaussian kernel. Data were masked to include only gray matter voxels and a low-pass filter was applied with the cutoff frequency set to half the task duration (i.e., 3 min). To separate task effects from baseline metabolism, a general linear model was used with four regressors representing the baseline, the task conditions (easy and hard separately, linear ramp function with slope = 1 kBq/frame) and head movement (first principal component of the six motion regressors). The baseline was defined as average time course of gray matter voxels which do not change in the hard condition (<italic>vs.</italic> baseline) of the corresponding individual BOLD block design (p<italic><sub>FWE</sub></italic> &lt; 0.05 corrected voxel level, see below). The approach was chosen to capture the maximum amount of voxels that are changed by the task and since this was previously shown to provide good model fits and a robust estimate of baseline CMRGlu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rischka et al., 2018</xref>).

CBF was then averaged across time separately for each condition (rest, easy, hard). The resulting CBF maps were then spatially normalized via the T1-weighted structural image and smoothed with an 8 mm Gaussian kernel. Because the resulting maps linked to task conditions represent the sum of both baseline and task effects, the baseline CBF was subtracted to obtain the pure easy and hard CBF maps.

After correction of slice timing differences (reference: middle slice) and motion (quality = 1, registered to mean) the data were normalized to MNI-space and smoothed with an 8 mm Gaussian kernel to match the kernel used for the PET and ASL data. To estimate task-specific effects the general linear model was used with one regressor for each condition (easy, hard, control) and nuisance regressors for movement, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid. The first level contrasts of interest were easy <italic>vs.</italic> control and hard <italic>vs.</italic> control, which were then carried over to a second level random effects analysis.

For each of these imaging modalities the group-average task effects were obtained separately by a one-sample t-test (p<italic><sub>FWE</sub></italic> &lt; 0.05 corrected cluster level, height threshold of p &lt; 0.001 uncorrected voxel level). The resulting patterns of suprathreshold effects were binarized and a conjunction map across the three imaging modalities was calculated based on the intersection among the binary clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Brain regions included in this conjunction map were used for the subsequent MCM analysis with a focus on large, symmetric regions (except the SMA, see results). Homologous regions in both hemispheres were combined since the dorsal attention network is not considered to be strongly lateralized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fox et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Metabolic connectivity mapping (MCM)</title><p>Proceeding from the network defined above, we assessed the relationship between functional connectivity and glucose metabolism in the three conditions (rest, easy, hard) using metabolic connectivity mapping (MCM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Riedl et al., 2016</xref>). MCM evaluates the correspondence between <italic>regional</italic> patterns of BOLD-derived functional connectivity and glucose metabolism. As the majority of energy is consumed post-synaptically, the method further allows inference on the direction of functional connectivity between any two brain regions.</p><p>MCM involves a seed-to-voxel <italic>temporal</italic> correlation between region A (mean BOLD signal of the seed) and region B (BOLD signal of each voxel). This yields a pattern of functional connectivity values in B reflecting the voxel-wise connectivity with the mean signal in A. The connection is assumed to have directionality from region A to B when the pattern of voxel-wise functional connectivity in B shows a significant <italic>spatial</italic> correlation with the corresponding voxel-wise pattern of glucose metabolism in region B. The main assumption of the approach is that the majority of energy demands arise post-synaptically, that is, in the target region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Attwell and Laughlin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harris et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mergenthaler et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Riedl et al., 2016</xref>), which are tightly linked to post-synaptic glutamate-mediated processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Attwell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mishra et al., 2016</xref>). Although BOLD signal changes receive a substantial drive from post-synaptic activity from distant inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Logothetis et al., 2001</xref>), it also receives contributions from local recurrent feedback and output (spiking)-related activity. Hence, the BOLD signal strongly covaries with local high frequency neurophysiological activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Engell et al., 2012</xref>), as well as inputs to sensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aquino et al., 2012</xref>) and behavioral output from primary motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Siero et al., 2013</xref>). MCM exploits this asymmetry across data modalities: If the BOLD-derived pattern of functional connectivity in region B is indeed caused by the influence region A exerts on region B (i.e., testing directionality of pairwise interactions), this will yield a corresponding pattern of the underlying energy consumption in region B, given the tight coupling between BOLD signal changes and glucose metabolism.</p><p>Functional connectivity was computed at rest (i.e., initial 6 min period, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, orange box) and for continuous task performance (6 min task periods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hahn et al., 2018</xref>). Data preprocessing was identical to that of the BOLD block design data up to (including) spatial smoothing. To mitigate against the confounding effect of task-related head movement, motion scrubbing was applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Power et al., 2015</xref>). Here, the framewise displacement was calculated as the sum of frame-to-frame absolute differences across all six motion parameters. Rotation parameters were converted from degrees to millimeters by calculating the displacement on the surface of a sphere (radius = 50 mm). All frames with framewise displacement &gt; 0.5 mm (plus one frame back and two forward) were removed from the further analysis (5 ± 8% of frames across all conditions). Afterwards, linear regression against confounding signals (six movement parameters, white matter, cerebrospinal fluid) and bandpass filtering was applied. Cut-off frequencies were chosen to enable comparison of functional connectivity at resting-state and during task performance (0.01 Hz &lt; f &lt; 0.15 Hz) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sun et al., 2004</xref>). For MCM, functional connectivity was computed as seed-to-voxel correlations between two brain regions followed by z-transformation. In other words, the average time course of region A was correlated with each voxel’s time course of region B, yielding a voxel-wise pattern of functional connectivity in region B. For direct comparison between MCM and functional connectivity, we also report the functional connectivity as the Pearson’s correlation between time courses of the three brain regions.</p><p>MCM was then computed as linear spatial correlation (z-transformed Pearson’s r) between regional patterns of functional connectivity and glucose metabolism of region B (i.e., between the vector of voxel-wise functional connectivity and the vector of voxel-wise CMRGlu values). Note that MCM is a directed measure, in the sense that two regions with a symmetric functional connectivity will yield MCM estimates with directed links towards those regions, where spatial patterns of functional connectivity and metabolism show a significant association. The procedure was repeated for all six combinations of regions of the network identified above, which results in an asymmetric (directional) 3 × 3 matrix of connections.</p><p>We tested for a potential mediation effect of FEF on the connection Occ -&gt; IPS by adapting an established statistical approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baron and Kenny, 1986</xref>) to the MCM framework. Specifically, a partial correlation between BOLD functional connectivity and glucose metabolism was calculated in the IPS, while correcting for the BOLD functional connectivity between IPS and FEF. The resulting MCM values were then compared to the original MCM values of Occ -&gt; IPS using a paired t-test.</p><p>To assess the influence of spatial smoothing on MCM estimates, a control analysis was carried out testing whether a spatial correlation of zero is artificially inflated by smoothing. For each subject, unsmoothed BOLD functional connectivity and CMRGlu data were separately permuted across voxels. MCM was then calculated before and after spatial smoothing (8 mm) using the identical regions of interest as for the main analysis. To generate a null distribution representing the influence of smoothing in these finite sampled data, this procedure was repeated 500 times for each of the 22 subjects.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Dynamic causal modeling (DCM)</title><p>The directed functional connectivity model obtained from the MCM analysis was benchmarked against directed effective connectivity inferred from DCM. DCM for fMRI couples a simplified (bilinear) model of neural dynamics with a biophysical model of hemodynamics to infer causal interactions between remote brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Friston et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stephan et al., 2010</xref>). Regional BOLD time courses were extracted from each brain region of the above defined network using fMRI data derived from the task blocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, red box). Regions of interest (ROIs) were defined from peak signals at group level (p<italic><sub>FWE</sub></italic> &lt; 0.05 corrected voxel level). For each ROI, the group-level coordinate was individually shifted over subject’s nearest maximum effect size (F-test across all three conditions, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) within the conjunction map defined by our previous analysis step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The BOLD signal was extracted as the eigenvariate within a sphere of 5 mm radius, adjusted for the effect of interest. Control analyses were performed using a sphere of 8 mm radius. Thus, the region employed for DCM represents a subregion of that used for MCM, with a focus on the individual location of task-specific changes in the BOLD signal. DCM is a hypothesis-driven framework that requires the definition of a model space given by: (i) intrinsic (context-independent) connections, (ii) task-driven modulation of these intrinsic connections and (iii) extrinsic inputs (here, the visual stimuli). All tested models had extrinsic inputs to the occipital cortex but differed regarding the absence or presence of intrinsic connections and task modulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). For each of these models a bilinear DCM was estimated. Model comparison was performed using random effects Bayesian model selection. Model selection rests upon identifying the model that has the highest likelihood, conditioned on the observed data and penalized by relative model complexity. In the context of uniform model priors, as we implemented, model selection identifies the model with the highest posterior probability (evidence) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Penny et al., 2007</xref>). Each effective connection was also individually tested for the presence of task modulation using model family inference (i.e., all models comprising task modulation of a given connection against those without).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All <italic>p</italic>-values were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni-Holm procedure (number of performed tests for each separate analysis indicated below in brackets). To assess the spatial agreement of task effects between imaging modalities the Dice coefficient was used. Differences between the two task levels (easy <italic>vs.</italic> hard) were evaluated using two-tailed paired t-tests. This statistical analysis was applied to both behavioral data and imaging parameters of each brain region defined in the conjunction map (three parameters * four brain regions, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). For the MCM analysis, the significance of each connection was tested separately using one-sample t-tests against zero (six connections * three conditions). As MCM yields one spatial correlation value for each subject, the test for each connection and condition is pooled across 22 correlations, corresponding to <italic>n</italic> = 22 subjects. Differences of the two task levels against rest were computed step-wise. First, a repeated measures ANOVA was calculated to assess a potential interaction effect between the factors condition and connection (one interaction). Next, the main effect of condition was assessed for each connection (six connections), followed by post-hoc paired t-tests of each task level against baseline (two conditions).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are particularly grateful to Prof. Danny JJ Wang, Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute, University of South California, and the Regents of the University of California, for providing the pCASL sequence.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Timothy Behrens as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In the current manuscript, Hahn and colleagues analyzed data from 22 participants in a concurrent fMRI-PET dataset. Participants were either at rest or asked to play a Tetris game at two different levels of difficulty. While playing, fMRI BOLD or ASL was collected concurrently with FDG PET imaging. In addition, a set of baseline fMRI (BOLD and ASL) resting state scans and a final set of blocked BOLD task scans were collected in the absence of PET imaging. With this data, the authors examined the overlap of glucose metabolism (PET), BOLD, and cerebral blood flow (ASL) during the task. The authors then used a combination of the PET and BOLD data to make estimates of directed connectivity during the Tetris task, a technique called Metabolic Connectivity Mapping (MCM), and compared the results of this MCM analysis to a DCM analysis on the BOLD data.</p><p>This is a unique and interesting dataset, providing the authors with concurrent measurements of both fMRI and PET measures. The first analysis (Figure 2) demonstrating substantial overlap between glucose metabolism, BOLD, and ASL appears quite compelling. The convergence between two very different approaches (DCM and MCM; Figure 3) is quite impressive.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Throughout the manuscript, the authors refer to BOLD measurements as &quot;neural activation&quot; measurements. This is imprecise terminology to use, especially in the current context, where the BOLD measurements are being contrasted with measurements of cerebral blood flow and glucose metabolism. Likely all of these measures are at some level related to neural activity, but all are indirect, and it's not clear why BOLD measurements receive a privileged status on this front in this manuscript. I would strongly recommend shifting this terminology.</p><p>2) This terminological distinction is important because it obscured the approach used in the MCM analyses in this paper. The authors argue that glucose metabolism tends to occur largely post-synaptically, and thus a comparison between BOLD functional connectivity and PET glucose metabolism profiles allows for the determination of directed information flow. But there is also substantial evidence that the BOLD signal is better related to neural post-synaptic potentials than action potentials (e.g., Logothetis et al., 2001). Thus this logic is unclear. It would be helpful if the authors could expand further on the motivation and validation for this analysis.</p><p>3) Given general issues in the field with interpreting directed connectivity (e.g., Ramsey et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2011), validation with DCM seems like an insufficient standard. The authors should be explicit about the pitfalls of both approaches (DCM and MCM) and whether they cover each other's pitfalls. For example, DCM is probably sensitive to missing nodes, while MCM won't have that issue (as far as we can tell), so the two approaches nicely complement each other in this respect. Are there pitfalls that apply to both DCM and MCM? If so, how serious are these pitfalls and can they be addressed with control analyses?</p><p>4) Given the large amount of spatial smoothing that was performed across all modalities (8 mm), how informative is a spatial correlation calculated within ROIs for MCM? One way to test for this more robustly is to perform permutation testing by comparing a BOLD connectivity map from one subject to a glucose metabolism map of a different subject (and build a null distribution through many such permutations), rather than performing a basic t-test against zero (and similarly for the comparison against rest). This will determine whether spatial similarity is truly indicative of connectivity-metabolic coupling, or whether it is observed as a function of the large smoothing kernel (and relatively small ROIs).</p><p>5) Why were DCM ROIs different from the MCM ROIs (Figure 4—figure supplement 1)? If DCM is used for validation, it seems to make sense to use the same regions in both analyses. Furthermore, how does the interaction between the size of the ROIs (5 mm) and the smoothing kernel (8mm) affect the results?</p><p>6) Some of the statistical tests are unclear. The authors wrote that &quot;the significance of each connection was tested separately using one-sample t-tests against zero&quot;. So let's consider one connection: FEF to IPS. The MCM analysis yields one spatial correlation for each subject. So can I confirm the t-test involves 22 numbers (corresponding to the 22 subjects)? Because a p value of 10e-12 is quite impressive with only 22 subjects; one would need a t-score of around 14?</p><p>7) For Figure 3, the authors say that the thickness of arrows depend on r values. More details will be useful. For example, when looking at Occ -&gt; FEF, the two box plots for easy and hard conditions look highly overlapping, but the green arrow was much thicker in the hard condition than easy condition. And from what I gather from the plot, the IPS-&gt;FEF during hard condition has higher MCM correlation than Occ-&gt;FEF during hard condition. So why is the green arrow thickness than the yellow arrow during the hard condition?</p><p>8) It would be important to report the pure functional connectivity among the 3 regions. More specifically, are there region pairs with strong functional connectivity, but the MCM connectivity is weak in both directions. If so, how can this be interpreted? Similarly, are there regions with weak functional connectivity but the MCM connectivity is strong? If so, how can this be interpreted?</p><p>9) The DCM modeling needs to be further elaborated. Maybe the current details are sufficient for a practiced DCM user, but as someone who is somewhat familiar with DCM (but do not actively use it), I found it hard to know how task modulation and intrinsic connection were modeled in the generative model.</p><p>10) &quot;A putative mediation effect of FEF was suggested by the observation that Occ -&gt; IPS MCM values decreased in the easy condition (from 0.17 to 0.14, pBonf-Holm = 0.017) when controlling for the indirect pathway (Occ -&gt; FEF -&gt; IPS).&quot; – Please elaborate on how this is done.</p><p>11) Literature review and discussion.</p><p>A) Given the nature of the paper, the authors should include a discussion of how their findings compare to a large and long-standing literature on cerebral blood flow and metabolism, which explicitly contrasts cerebral blood flow, oxygen consumption, and glucose metabolism to one another in and outside of tasks contexts, e.g., from Marc Raichle and others (see for example: Gusnard and Raichle, 2001). The current work would have substantially greater impact if it were to engage more deeply with this older literature. For example, do the authors mean to suggest (as might appear from their statement in the Abstract that &quot;dynamic regulation of neural-metabolic coupling is essential to support human cognition&quot;) that different mechanisms exist to couple neural activity with glucose consumption depending on the task at hand? This claim seems quite large and far reaching given the evidence, and if true, would have profound implications in invalidating the current use and interpretation of many neuroimaging methods.</p><p>B) The authors should also be more precise about differences with previous work (e.g., Jamadar et al., 2019; Rischka et al., 2018). For example, &quot;Here we extend upon previous work by providing a comprehensive assessment of the neural and metabolic processes supporting performance in a complex cognitive visuo-motor task&quot; can be briefly expanded to mention that Rischka investigated a finger-tapping task and Jamadar investigated a visual checkerboard task.</p><p>12) The Discussion states: &quot;Our results extend this knowledge by highlighting that the convergence between metabolic factors and functional network reconfiguration is pivotal to support cognition&quot;. However, the relationship with cognition or performance was not tested here (e.g. MCM was not shown to be stronger for those subjects who performed better). As such, I would recommend adjusting this interpretation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52443.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Throughout the manuscript, the authors refer to BOLD measurements as &quot;neural activation&quot; measurements.

It would be helpful if the authors could expand further on the motivation and validation for this analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>While it is true that post-synaptic responses make a strong contribution to both glucose metabolism and BOLD responses, considerable work since the seminal paper by Logothetis et al. has shown that BOLD reflects more of a composite of local activity which includes post-synaptic activity arising from distant inputs, but also local recurrent feedback and output-related activity. The latter can be seen in studies that show a link between BOLD responses in M1 and motor movement rates. We have expanded on the explication of MCM and also disambiguated between fPET and BOLD signal changes):</p><p>“The main assumption of the approach is that the majority of energy demands arise post-synaptically, i.e., in the target region (Attwell and Laughlin, 2001; Harris et al., 2012; Mergenthaler et al., 2013; Riedl et al., 2016) which are tightly linked to post-synaptic glutamate-mediated processes (Attwell et al., 2010; Mishra et al., 2016). […] MCM exploits this asymmetry across data modalities: If the BOLD-derived pattern of functional connectivity in region B is indeed caused by the influence region A exerts on region B (i.e., testing directionality of pairwise interactions), this will yield a corresponding pattern of the underlying energy consumption in region B, given the tight coupling between BOLD signal changes and glucose metabolism.”</p><p>We have also significantly extended the Discussion on the underlying physiological mechanisms of BOLD and [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET imaging (response to main issue 11A) and added the following text:</p><p>“The relationship between blood flow and metabolic factors has been demonstrated to be in balance at rest, whereas task-induced neural activations induce a mismatch (Gusnard and Raichle, 2001; Raichle et al., 2001). […] Our results extend this knowledge by highlighting that external task engagement is accompanied by the convergence between metabolic factors and functional brain network reconfigurations.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Given general issues in the field with interpreting directed connectivity (e.g., Ramsey et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2011), validation with DCM seems like an insufficient standard.

Are there pitfalls that apply to both DCM and MCM? If so, how serious are these pitfalls and can they be addressed with control analyses?</p></disp-quote><p>Considering that MCM and DCM use different underlying data and employ distinct models, the two approaches indeed complement each other. As such, we did not attempt to use DCM as a validation tool, but rather to assess if a comparable network structure was obtained by two independent, yet complementary approaches. As suggested by the reviewers we have addressed this by adding the following to the Discussion:</p><p>“Estimating measures of directed functional connectivity is a considerable challenge, particularly when those measures depend purely upon conditional likelihoods in the data (Smith et al., 2011), or in networks with closed cycles (Ramsey et al., 2010). […] By using a generative model and an observation (HRF) equation, DCM also avoids reliance upon making direct inference on conditional dependences in data, a challenge for many measures of directed functional connectivity (Smith et al., 2011).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Given the large amount of spatial smoothing that was performed across all modalities (8 mm), how informative is a spatial correlation calculated within ROIs for MCM? One way to test for this more robustly is to perform permutation testing by comparing a BOLD connectivity map from one subject to a glucose metabolism map of a different subject (and build a null distribution through many such permutations), rather than performing a basic t-test against zero (and similarly for the comparison against rest). This will determine whether spatial similarity is truly indicative of connectivity-metabolic coupling, or whether it is observed as a function of the large smoothing kernel (and relatively small ROIs).</p></disp-quote><p>It is in principle possible that spatial correlations induced by smoothing may have biased MCM estimates. We directly tested this hypothesis by assessing if an original correlation of zero was artificially inflated by different levels of smoothing. Compared to the suggested permutation approach, the adopted test unequivocally addresses the potential problem. We have added the following to demonstrate that smoothing does not significantly impact the MCM findings:</p><p>Materials and methods:</p><p>“To assess the influence of spatial smoothing on MCM estimates, a control analysis was carried out testing whether a spatial correlation of zero is artificially inflated by smoothing. […] To generate a null distribution representing the influence of smoothing in these finite sampled data, this procedure was repeated 500 times for each of the 22 subjects.”</p><p>Results:</p><p>“A control analysis was performed to assess the impact of spatial smoothing on the MCM estimates (Figure 3—figure supplement 3). […] This suggests that smoothing does not systematically inflate the MCM estimates, which is also in line with our observation that half of the MCM values were approximately zero despite using smoothed data (Figure 3).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Why were DCM ROIs different from the MCM ROIs (Figure 4—figure supplement 1)? If DCM is used for validation, it seems to make sense to use the same regions in both analyses. Furthermore, how does the interaction between the size of the ROIs (5 mm) and the smoothing kernel (8mm) affect the results?</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewers we have re-calculated the DCM with a ROIs size of 8 mm (i.e., matching the smoothing kernel), yielding similar results. We also added an explanation about the different ROI definition for the two approaches.</p><p>BOLD methods:</p><p>“[…] the data were normalized to MNI-space and smoothed with an 8 mm Gaussian kernel to match the kernel used for the PET and ASL data.”</p><p>DCM methods:</p><p>“The BOLD signal was extracted as the eigenvariate within a sphere of 5 mm radius, adjusted for the effect of interest. […] Thus, the region employed for DCM represents a subregion of that used for MCM, with a focus on the individual location of task-specific changes in the BOLD signal.”</p><p>DCM results:</p><p>“Notably, the DCM results did not change when using a larger ROI size of 8 mm (Figure 4—figure supplement 3).”</p><p>Results:</p><p>“To allow for a focus on cross-modal changes, the regions included in MCM and DCM analyses were Occ, FEF and IPS as obtained from the conjunction analysis (Figure 2). […] The average distance between any voxel of one region to the closest voxel of another region was 46 ± 23 mm, mitigating potential cross-talk between the regions introduced through spatial smoothing.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Some of the statistical tests are unclear. The authors wrote that &quot;the significance of each connection was tested separately using one-sample t-tests against zero&quot;. So let's consider one connection: FEF to IPS. The MCM analysis yields one spatial correlation for each subject. So can I confirm the t-test involves 22 numbers (corresponding to the 22 subjects)? Because a p value of 10e-12 is quite impressive with only 22 subjects; one would need a t-score of around 14?</p></disp-quote><p>Correct, the t-tests of the MCM against zero comprised 22 numbers, one for each subject. The t-value of the connection FEF to IPS (hard condition) was indeed t = 14.4 and the corresponding p-value was p<sub>uncorrected</sub> = 2*10^-12 and p<sub>Bonf-Holm</sub> = 4*10^-11.</p><p>To address the comment, we have also provided the data used to generate Figure 3, enabling the reader to assess the validity of the statistical tests. We have also amended the manuscript as follows:</p><p>“For the MCM analysis, the significance of each connection was tested separately using one-sample t-tests against zero (6 connections * 3 conditions). As MCM yields one spatial correlation value for each subject, the test for each connection and condition is pooled across 22 correlations, corresponding to n = 22 subjects.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) For Figure 3, the authors say that the thickness of arrows depend on r values. More details will be useful. For example, when looking at Occ -&gt; FEF, the two box plots for easy and hard conditions look highly overlapping, but the green arrow was much thicker in the hard condition than easy condition. And from what I gather from the plot, the IPS-&gt;FEF during hard condition has higher MCM correlation than Occ-&gt;FEF during hard condition. So why is the green arrow thickness than the yellow arrow during the hard condition?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now revised the figure as suggested. Furthermore, r-values were changed to z-scores. We also changed boxplots to dot plots with lines connecting the individual subjects to better reflect the within-subject nature of the design and the statistics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) It would be important to report the pure functional connectivity among the 3 regions. More specifically, are there region pairs with strong functional connectivity, but the MCM connectivity is weak in both directions. If so, how can this be interpreted? Similarly, are there regions with weak functional connectivity but the MCM connectivity is strong? If so, how can this be interpreted?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now also computed the pure functional connectivity between the three regions. The results are now included in the manuscript as follows.</p><p>Materials and methods:</p><p>“For MCM, functional connectivity was computed as seed-to-voxel correlations between two brain regions followed by z-transformation. […] For direct comparison between MCM and functional connectivity, we also report the functional connectivity as the Pearson’s correlation between time courses of the three brain regions.”</p><p>Results:</p><p>“Notably, functional connectivity was also sensitive to task performance with significant increases from rest to task for all three connections (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). Taking into account the underlying metabolic demands using MCM allowed us to infer directionality on these task-induced changes in functional connectivity, i.e., the influence one region exerts on another (Occ -&gt; IPS, Occ -&gt; FEF), as well as a separation of task effects (FEF -&gt; IPS) from intrinsic connectivity (IPS -&gt; FEF).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The DCM modeling needs to be further elaborated. Maybe the current details are sufficient for a practiced DCM user, but as someone who is somewhat familiar with DCM (but do not actively use it), I found it hard to know how task modulation and intrinsic connection were modeled in the generative model.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have improved the description of the DCM approach:</p><p>“Dynamic causal modelling (DCM): The directed functional connectivity model obtained from the MCM analysis was benchmarked against directed effective connectivity inferred from DCM. […] Each effective connection was also individually tested for the presence of task modulation using model family inference (i.e., all models comprising task modulation of a given connection against those without).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) &quot;A putative mediation effect of FEF was suggested by the observation that Occ -&gt; IPS MCM values decreased in the easy condition (from 0.17 to 0.14, pBonf-Holm = 0.017) when controlling for the indirect pathway (Occ -&gt; FEF -&gt; IPS).&quot; – Please elaborate on how this is done.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the missing information and have added the following details to the Materials and methods section:</p><p>“We tested for a potential mediation effect of FEF on the connection Occ -&gt; IPS by adapting an established statistical approach (Baron and Kenny, 1986) to the MCM framework. […] The resulting MCM values were then compared to the original MCM values of Occ -&gt; IPS using a paired t-test.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Literature review and discussion.</p><p>A) Given the nature of the paper, the authors should include a discussion of how their findings compare to a large and long-standing literature on cerebral blood flow and metabolism, which explicitly contrasts cerebral blood flow, oxygen consumption, and glucose metabolism to one another in and outside of tasks contexts, e.g., from Marc Raichle and others (see for example: Gusnard and Raichle., 2001). The current work would have substantially greater impact if it were to engage more deeply with this older literature. For example, do the authors mean to suggest (as might appear from their statement in the Abstract that &quot;dynamic regulation of neural-metabolic coupling is essential to support human cognition&quot;) that different mechanisms exist to couple neural activity with glucose consumption depending on the task at hand? This claim seems quite large and far reaching given the evidence, and if true, would have profound implications in invalidating the current use and interpretation of many neuroimaging methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the paper could have been more clearly contextualized and now include a more comprehensive discussion of the physiological mechanisms underpinning CBF, oxygen consumption, and glucose metabolism (see also, our revisions in response to main issue 2, above). Notably, we did not mean to imply that the physiological mechanisms coupling neural activity to glucose metabolism (and BOLD) depend on the task at hand. As rightly pointed out, this claim goes well beyond what we can rightly infer from our data. Rather, the time-dependent, multi-step and nonlinear nature of these relationships become more apparent in the setting of a dynamic task of increasing complexity, as does the role of varying signal and noise on the statistical effects evident across different imaging modalities.</p><p>We revised the Abstract:</p><p>“The ability to solve cognitive tasks depends upon adaptive changes in the organization of whole-brain functional networks. […] Our findings show how the upregulation of key computational mechanisms to support cognitive performance unveils the complex, interdependent changes in neural metabolism and neuro-vascular responses.”</p><p>… and the impact statement:</p><p>“Cognitive performance is supported by symbiotic metabolic and neuro-vascular responses in task-specific brain networks.”</p><p>We have significantly extended the Discussion on the underlying physiological mechanisms of BOLD and [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET imaging and included the following text (see also our response to main issue 2):</p><p>“The relationship between blood flow and metabolic factors has been demonstrated to be in balance at rest, whereas task-induced neural activations induce a mismatch (Gusnard and Raichle, 2001; Raichle et al., 2001). […] Our results extend this knowledge by highlighting that external task engagement is accompanied by the convergence between metabolic factors and functional brain network reconfigurations.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) The authors should also be more precise about differences with previous work (e.g., Jamadar et al., 2019; Rischka et al., 2018). For example, &quot;Here we extend upon previous work by providing a comprehensive assessment of the neural and metabolic processes supporting performance in a complex cognitive visuo-motor task&quot; can be briefly expanded to mention that Rischka investigated a finger-tapping task and Jamadar investigated a visual checkerboard task.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have added this information:</p><p>“To date, only a few studies using [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG fPET imaging have assessed the possible functional relationships between these diverse parameters of brain activity (Horwitz et al., 1995). […]. Moreover, our results directly support previous findings suggesting that regional neural and metabolic changes converge in spatially circumscribed and functionally specialized brain regions (Jamadar et al., 2019; Riedl et al., 2014; Rischka et al., 2018).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) The Discussion states: &quot;Our results extend this knowledge by highlighting that the convergence between metabolic factors and functional network reconfiguration is pivotal to support cognition&quot;. However, the relationship with cognition or performance was not tested here (e.g. MCM was not shown to be stronger for those subjects who performed better). As such, I would recommend adjusting this interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>This statement has been amended as follows: “Our results extend this knowledge by highlighting that external task engagement is accompanied by the convergence between metabolic factors and functional brain network reconfigurations.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
