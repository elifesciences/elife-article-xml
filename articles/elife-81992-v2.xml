To examine how diverse populations of upper motor neurons subserve distinct functions and the specific repertoire of ion channels involved, we conducted a thorough study of the excitability of upper motor neurons controlling somatic motor function in the zebra finch. We found that robustus arcopallialis projection neurons (RAPNs), key command neurons for song production, exhibit ultranarrow spikes and higher firing rates compared to neurons controlling non-vocal somatic motor functions (dorsal intermediate arcopallium [AId] neurons). Pharmacological and molecular data indicate that this striking difference is associated with the higher expression in RAPNs of high threshold, fast-activating voltage-gated Kv3 channels, that likely contain Kv3.1 (<italic>KCNC1</italic>) subunits. The spike waveform and Kv3.1 expression in RAPNs mirror properties of Betz cells, specialized upper motor neurons involved in fine digit control in humans and other primates but absent in rodents. Our study thus provides evidence that songbirds and primates have convergently evolved the use of Kv3.1 to ensure precise, rapid AP firing in upper motor neurons controlling fast and complex motor skills.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>patch-clamp electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>zebra finch</kwd><kwd>excitability</kwd><kwd>potassium channels</kwd><kwd>action potential</kwd><kwd>vocal/motor cortex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NSF1456302</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mello</surname><given-names>Claudio V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NSF1645199</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mello</surname><given-names>Claudio V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM120464</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mello</surname><given-names>Claudio V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC004274</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>von Gersdorff</surname><given-names>Henrique</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC012938</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>von Gersdorff</surname><given-names>Henrique</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG055378</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zemel</surname><given-names>Benjamin M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NSF2154646</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mello</surname><given-names>Claudio V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NSF2154646</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>von Gersdorff</surname><given-names>Henrique</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Molecular and electrophysiological evidence shows that Kv3 subunits contribute critically to ultrashort action potential waveforms and high-frequency firing in large projection neurons in zebra finch motor nuclei controlling song production and somatic movements.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Zebra finches are an accessible model organism for studying how upper motor neurons control a rapid and precise learned behavior. Their song consists of bouts of repeated motifs made up of multiple syllables, each containing distinct features that change on a rapid timescale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Leonardo and Fee, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Sturdy et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Yazaki-Sugiyama et al., 2015</xref>). In sharp contrast with mammals, which possess a six layered neocortex, songbirds orchestrate song behavior with a circuitry consisting of pallial nuclei, which nonetheless have connectivity analogous to mammalian cortical microcircuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jarvis, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Karten, 2015</xref>). Projection neurons within the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RAPNs) represent the main forebrain output of the vocal motor system of songbirds. They share several molecular markers with mammalian layer 5 pyramidal neurons (L5PNs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dugas-Ford et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Nevue et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Pfenning et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Stacho et al., 2020</xref>). During song production, RAPNs exhibit robust burst-pause firing with high temporal precision (~0.2 ms variance in the first spike latency; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chi and Margoliash, 2001</xref>). They are thus well poised to orchestrate the rapid movements of the syringeal muscles (~4 ms to peak force of muscle twitch; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam and Elemans, 2020</xref>).</p><p>We have recently shown that zebra finch RAPNs share many electrophysiological properties with mammalian L5PNs, including a hyperpolarization-activated current (I<sub>h</sub>), a persistent Na<sup>+</sup> current, and a large transient Na<sup>+</sup> current (I<sub>NaT</sub>) with a short onset latency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Zemel et al., 2021</xref>). These properties facilitate the minimally adapting, regular spiking of APs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Almog et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">McCormick et al., 1985</xref>). A major difference, however, is that RAPNs exhibit an ultranarrow AP half-width (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Zemel et al., 2021</xref>), a property also found in primate Betz cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lemon et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Vigneswaran et al., 2011</xref>). Not found in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lacey et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Soares et al., 2017</xref>), these cells are sparsely distributed across layer 5 of the motor cortex in primates and cats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Rivara et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Tomasevic et al., 2022</xref>), often terminate directly onto lower motor neurons and are thought to facilitate highly refined aspects of motor control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lemon and Kraskov, 2019</xref>). The unique AP half-width of Betz cells is associated with high expression of the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv3.1 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bakken et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ichinohe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Soares et al., 2017</xref>). The high-voltage, fast activation and fast deactivation of these channels have been shown to significantly narrow the AP waveform, thus facilitating high-frequency firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kaczmarek and Zhang, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Rudy and McBain, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Similar to mammalian Betz cells, RAPNs in adult male finches also exhibit high expression of <italic>KCNC1</italic> (Kv3.1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lovell et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, this expression is significantly lower in the adjacent dorsal intermediate arcopallium (AId) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Nevue et al., 2020</xref>), an area thought to be involved in non-vocal somatic motor functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Feenders et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mandelblat-Cerf et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Yuan and Bottjer, 2020</xref>) that have different temporal requirements than song (e.g., ~10 ms to peak force of twitch for pectoral wing muscles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bahlman et al., 2020</xref>). Whereas the excitable properties of RAPNs have been examined in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adret and Margoliash, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Garst-Orozco et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Liao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Spiro et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Zemel et al., 2021</xref>), little is known about (1) the excitability of AId neurons and (2) the molecular basis shaping the AP waveform in either brain region.</p><p>A comparison of excitable features between RAPNs and AId neurons may reveal molecular specializations that evolved to specifically support the execution of complex, learned vocalizations. Here, we show that compared to RAPNs, AId neurons have broader APs and spike at lower frequencies during current injections. We found that these differences are due, in part, to the differential activity of Shaw-related K<sup>+</sup> channels (Kv3.1â3.4), as Kv3 channel blockers disproportionately broadened APs and decreased firing rates in RAPNs compared to AId neurons. Furthermore, a novel Kv3.1/3.2 positive modulator, AUT5, narrowed the AP waveform and increased the steady-state firing frequency of RAPNs, but not of AId neurons. Moreover, <italic>KCNC1</italic> had significantly higher expression in RA compared to AId, while <italic>KCNC2â4</italic> (Kv3.2â3.4) genes were non-differential in expression. Notably, our analysis identified zebra finch <italic>KCNC3</italic> (Kv3.3), a gene previously thought to be absent in birds. Morphological analysis revealed higher dendritic complexity and spine density but smaller spines in AId neurons compared to RAPNs, which had larger spines, like Betz cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kaiserman-Abramof and Peters, 1972</xref>). We propose that the shared molecular and electrophysiological properties that promote ultranarrow spikes in songbird RAPNs and primate Betz cells likely originated from a convergent evolutionary process that allowed these neurons to operate as fast and precise signaling devices for fine motor control.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Understanding the neuronal basis of specific behaviors requires determining the cellular properties of the upper motor neurons involved in those behaviors. RAPNs and AId neurons are thought to control vocal and non-vocal somatic functions respectively via descending projections out of the finch telencephalon toward lower motor centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bottjer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Feenders et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mandelblat-Cerf et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Nottebohm et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Paton et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Wild, 1993b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Yuan and Bottjer, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mello et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Contrasting the properties of RAPNs and AId neurons may reveal specific features of vocal motor neurons (RAPNs) that have not been previously identified. RAPNs and AId neurons are known to differ in their molecular profiles, including higher expression of the voltage-gated potassium channel <italic>KCNC1</italic>/Kv3.1 in RAPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Nevue et al., 2020</xref>). Our goal here was to contrast the excitable properties of RAPNs and AId neurons in order to (1) identify and (2) determine the role of molecular correlates of excitability that differ between these neuronal populations.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Morphology of robustus arcopallialis projection neurons (RAPNs) and dorsal intermediate arcopallium (AId) neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of the motor pathways in the zebra finch.

Upon examining properties of spontaneous APs, we found that RAPNs and AId neurons shared similar threshold, amplitude, peak, and after-hyperpolarization at both temperatures examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). However, AId neurons had an AP half-width that was twice as broad as the RAPN APs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2CâD , and FâG</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The shorter half-width of RAPNs could be due to either a faster AP depolarization and/or repolarization rate. To determine which phase of the AP was responsible for this difference, we derived phase plane plots from averaged spontaneous APs and compared the maximum rates of depolarization and repolarization. At room temperature, the maximum rate of repolarization was 76% larger in RAPNs compared to AId neurons (mean Â± SEM in V/s: 181.9Â±7.8 vs 64.5Â±3.7, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), whereas the maximum rate of depolarization was only 29% larger in RAPNs compared to AId neurons (mean Â± SEM in V/s: 658.4Â±26.5 vs 477.1Â±24.6, respectively; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). At 40Â°C the difference in the maximum depolarization rate was not significant, while the maximum repolarization rate was still 37% greater in RAPNs (mean Â± SEM in V/s: 764.7Â±92.4 vs 482.3Â±52.8, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). While the similar maximum rate of depolarization at 40Â°C may result from limitations on temporal resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">OlÃ¡h et al., 2021</xref>), taken together with the room temperature recordings these findings indicate that RAPN APs are narrower than those of AId neurons, with larger differences in the maximum repolarization rate compared to the depolarization rate.</p><p>We next examined the evoked firing properties by delivering increasing, step-wise 1 s current injections to RAPNs and AId neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and C</xref>, examples at +500 pA). As expected, a higher firing rate was observed in both brain regions at physiological temperature compared to room temperature. In the absence of injected current, both RAPNs and AId neurons fired spontaneous APs (spontaneous APs in RAPNs also observed in extracellular slice recordings; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Wood et al., 2011</xref>), however, RAPNs exhibited significantly higher firing rates than AId neurons at high temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, we consistently observed lower firing rates in AId neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and D</xref>), with lower instantaneous (frequency of the first two spikes) and steady-state (frequency of the last two spikes) firing frequencies at all levels of current injected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and C</xref>, top of each AP train).

To further minimize space and voltage-clamp issues, we (1) decreased the slice thickness from 180 Âµm to 150 Âµm to eliminate more neuronal processes, (2) lowered intracellular K<sup>+</sup> from 142.5 mM to 75 mM to decrease the magnitude of I<sub>K</sub>, and (3) compensated the series resistance electronically to 1 âMÎ©.

By dividing the current 8 ms after the initial A-type peak by the peak A-type current, we found that the degree of inactivation was indistinguishable between RAPNs and AId neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Notably, the time to peak of the A-type component was preserved (mean Â± SE: 4.5Â±0.4 ms vs. mean Â± SE: 5.8Â±0.4 ms for RAPNs and AId neurons, respectively), with RAPNs maintaining a trend toward smaller values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Importantly, whether measuring the A-type current peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>; mean Â± SE: 4.7Â±0.4 nA vs. 1.1Â±0.3 nA for RAPNs and AId neurons, respectively) or the I<sub>200ms</sub> peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>; mean Â± SE: 5.0Â±0.7 nA vs. 1.3Â±0.5 nA for RAPNs and AId neurons, respectively), RAPNs had a significantly larger TEA-sensitive I<sub>K+</sub> than AId neurons. In sum, our voltage-clamp results show a higher proportion of a fast-activating, TEA-sensitive current in RAPNs compared to AId neurons, consistent with the presence of a larger Kv3 current in RAPNs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Differential mRNA expression of the TEA-sensitive ion channel subunit Kv3.1 in RAPNs vs. AId neurons</title><p>The evidence presented thus far is consistent with the ultra-fast APs unique to RAPNs being related to higher expression of Kv3.1 in RA compared to AId. However, Kv3.1 is only one of four members of the Shaw-related channel family (Kv3.1â3.4) in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kaczmarek and Zhang, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Rudy and McBain, 2001</xref>). To further examine a link between RAPN properties and Kv3.1, it was important to examine other Kv3.x family members. As a start, through close assessments of reciprocal alignments and synteny we confirmed that the locus named <italic>KCNC1</italic> (100144433; located on chromosome 5) is the zebra finch ortholog of mammalian <italic>KCNC1</italic>, noting the conserved synteny across major vertebrate groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Importantly, the predicted zebra finch Kv3.1 protein (Kv3.1b isoform) is remarkably conserved (96.5% residue identity) with human (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2</xref>) and is thus predicted to have similar pharmacology as in mammals, which is supported by our recordings from RAPNs. Additionally, we confirmed the correct identification of the zebra finch orthologs of mammalian <italic>KCNC2</italic>/Kv3.2 and <italic>KCNC4</italic>/Kv3.4, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lovell et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Previous investigations of the zebra finch genome (taeGut1, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Warren et al., 2010</xref>) reported that zebra finches lacked a <italic>KCNC3</italic>/Kv3.3 ortholog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lovell et al., 2013</xref>). Recent long-read sequencing technology, however, has facilitated a more complete assembly of genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Rhie et al., 2021</xref>), elucidating the presence of some genes previously thought to be absent. Using RefSeq release 106 (GCF_003957565.2 assembly), we observed a locus (LOC115491734) described as similar to member 1 of the <italic>KCNC</italic> family on the newly assembled zebra finch chromosome 37, one of the smallest and hardest to sequence avian microchromosomes. LOC115491734, however, exhibited the highest alignment scores and conserved upstream synteny with <italic>KCNC3</italic>/Kv3.3 in humans and various vertebrate lineages, noting that NAPSA in zebra finch and other songbirds is misannotated as cathepsin D-like (LOC121468878) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1C</xref>).

We have also identified an avian <italic>KCNC3</italic> locus in a few other songbird and non-songbird species, noting that in most cases the gene is incorrectly annotated in NCBI as <italic>KCNC1</italic> or <italic>KCNC1</italic>-like, whereas conversely, a large set of avian genes in this family are incorrectly annotated as <italic>KCNC3</italic>-like (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1BâC</xref>). Also notably, a <italic>KCNC3</italic> locus (XM_009582050.1) previously described as the ortholog of <italic>KCNC3</italic> in two seabirds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">De Paoli-Iseppi et al., 2017</xref>) was misidentified in that study and most likely represents <italic>KCNC4</italic> in those species. Interestingly, the downstream immediate synteny is not conserved across vertebrate lineages, with the ancestral condition in tetrapods likely being TBC1D17 downstream of <italic>KCNC3</italic>. The predicted zebra finch <italic>KCNC3</italic> protein showed only moderate conservation with human (68.32% residue identity), some domains including the BTB/POZ and transmembrane domain being fairly conserved, but spans of residues on the N-terminal and C-terminal regions being highly divergent. Notably, based on the genomic sequence, the N-terminal inactivation domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Rudy and McBain, 2001</xref>) is absent in the predicted zebra finch <italic>KCNC3</italic> protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7âfigure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>We next performed in situ hybridization for all identified <italic>KCNC</italic>/Kv3.x family members in adjacent frontal brain sections from adult male zebra finches.

Kv3.2-expressing cells were sparse, strongly labeled, and reminiscent of the GABAergic cell distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Pinaud and Mello, 2007</xref>), while Kv3.4 expression was uniformly weak throughout both brain regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). We also found that Kv3.3, while more strongly expressed in both brain regions compared to the surrounding arcopallium, is non-differentially expressed between RA and AId (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, bottom left). Importantly, we found strong Kv3.3 expression in the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, bottom left), consistent with findings in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akemann and KnÃ¶pfel, 2006</xref>).

In contrast, the specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Covarrubias et al., 2023</xref>), novel positive Kv3.1/3.2 modulator, AUT5, potentiates Kv3.1 currents by speeding up activation kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Taskin et al., 2015</xref>) and leftward shifting the voltage dependence of activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Taskin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Covarrubias et al., 2023</xref>).

Compared to pre-drug measurements, RAPNs showed a significant narrowing of the AP waveform (mean Â± SE: 6.5 Â± 2.1% decrease; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, middle) and an increase of the maximum repolarization rate (mean Â± SE: 12.2 Â± 4.3% increase; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, right) but not of the maximum depolarization rate (paired t-test, t<sub>stat</sub> = 1.04, p=0.3), whereas no significant effects were seen in AId neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, middle and right). Spontaneous APs from RAPNs also displayed significant depolarizations in the peak (mean Â± SE: 35.1Â±1.1 mV to 38.9Â±1.2 mV, paired t-test, t<sub>stat</sub> = 2.72, p=0.03), threshold (mean Â± SE: â58.9Â±1.8 mV to â57.0Â±1.6 mV, paired t-test, t<sub>stat</sub> = 3.542, p=0.01), with a non-significant trend observed for the peak after-hyperpolarization (mean Â± SE: â72.0Â±0.7 mV to â71.1Â±0.7 mV, paired t-test, t<sub>stat</sub> = 2.3, p=0.06). We note, that the depolarization in the AP peak could in turn further recruit Kv channel-mediated AP repolarization. In comparison AId only showed a modest change in the after-hyperpolarization (â69.6Â±1.1 to â67.3Â±0.6, paired t-test, t<sub>stat</sub> = 2.874, p=0.03).

Interestingly, whereas AUT5 had no effects on the instantaneous firing frequency in RAPNs, the steady-state firing frequency (as measured for the last two spikes recorded during the 1 s + 500 pA current injection) increased substantially (mean Â± SE: 24.3 Â± 8.2% increase). We did not observe significant washout with AUT5. This result was not surprising as previous studies indicate limited capacity for washout of this compound, even within cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Taskin et al., 2015</xref>).

We found that RAPNs and AId neurons share similar soma size and elaborate branched dendrites, and both form extensive local axon collaterals. However, we also obtained evidence of morphological differences that may have implications for how RAPNs and AId neurons integrate synaptic inputs. The higher dendritic branch complexity revealed by a Sholl analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Sholl, 1956b</xref>) and the higher number of dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>) of AId neurons (a finding revealed using two methods: FIJI, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>, and ShuTu, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jin et al., 2019</xref>) suggest that AId may receive more synaptic inputs than RAPNs. Such inputs would be from the nidopallium, the main known source of input to the AI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bottjer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Johnson et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Karten, 2015</xref>), and/or from local GABAergic interneurons. Conversely, the higher proportion of large spines in RAPNs than in AId neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref>) parallels Betz cells, which also contain higher proportions of large spines compared to other pyramidal neurons within the cat M1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kaiserman-Abramof and Peters, 1972</xref>). These differences in spine shape and surface area suggest potential differences in filtering of incoming synaptic signals, with some input sources potentially having larger effects on membrane potential changes than others. Of note, the spine density difference between RAPNs and AId neurons closely approximates findings in the high vocal center (HVC), where upstream HVC-RA projecting neurons exhibit roughly half the spine density as HVC-Area X projecting neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kornfeld et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, whereas axonal projection targets for RAPNs are discrete and have been studied in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Vicario, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Wild, 1993a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Wild et al., 2009</xref>), those for AId neurons appear to be more complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bottjer et al., 2000</xref>) and are possibly more heterogeneous in terms of cell-type composition. While our present findings do not address potential subpopulations of AId neurons, they lay the groundwork for future efforts using cell filling and/or track tracing to further characterize the similarities and differences between RAPNs and AId neurons.</p><p>Calculations of membrane capacitance (C<sub>m</sub>) allowed us to estimate the average surface area of RAPNs and AId neurons (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), whereas 3D reconstructions using ShuTu allowed us to also estimate shrinkage-corrected surface areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The values were fairly close, in spite of the uncertainties and assumptions involved in both methods (see Results and Methods). Based on their larger overall spine surface area, it appears that AId neurons are investing more âresourcesâ on spines than RAPNs, despite having proportionately smaller individual spines. We suggest that the sparse population of large spines in adult male RAPNs may indicate larger synaptic inputs per spine compared to AId neurons, a factor that could at least partly contribute to the highly stereotyped song of adult male finches. Large, stable and mature spines in RAPNs may thus enable large EPSCs in adult RAPNs from male birds with crystallized songs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Garst-Orozco et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kittelberger and Mooney, 1999</xref>).

Our data suggest similar convergence in the motor control circuitry where, like Betz cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bakken et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ichinohe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Soares et al., 2017</xref>), RAPNs appear to be a specialized class of upper motor neurons that display higher temporal precision of AP firing and faster firing rates than AId neurons.</p><p>We also note, however, some marked differences between the properties of finch RAPNs and AId neurons compared to those of L5PNs in mammalian M1. Foremost, RAPNs and AId neurons lack the large, tufted apical dendrites typical of L5PNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Callaway et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally, these avian neurons fire spontaneously in the absence of synaptic inputs, a property not typically seen in M1 L5PNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lacey et al., 2014</xref>). The size and distribution of Betz cells in M1 also differ compared to RAPNs in the finch. Whereas Betz cells have very large somas and are interspersed with smaller L5PNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lassek, 1940</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Rivara et al., 2003</xref>), RAPNs and AId neurons have similar soma sizes and localize to adjacent but distinct regions within the finch arcopallium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bottjer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Johnson et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Nevue et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Optimized for speed: Kv3.1 subunits facilitate fast spiking</title><p>By quickly activating at depolarized voltages, Kv3 channels can efficiently initiate Nav channel recovery from inactivation during repetitive AP firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bean, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kaczmarek and Zhang, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Rudy and McBain, 2001</xref>). Importantly, the fact that the AP waveforms and firing rates of RAPNs were indeed more sensitive to sub-millimolar concentrations of TEA and 4-AP than AId neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) implicates Kv3.1 channels in regulating the excitable features of RAPNs. Notably, however, these antagonists have known effects on other members of this ion channel family, even at sub-millimolar concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kaczmarek and Zhang, 2017</xref>). In situ hybridization showed higher expression of the Kv3.1 subunit in RAPNs than in AId neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), suggesting a more specialized role of Kv3.1 in RAPNs compared to other upper motor neurons. Using the Kv3.1/3.2 positive modulator AUT5, we were able to further correlate the differential expression of Kv3.1 subunits with excitable properties in RAPNs and AId neurons. AUT5 is known to alter gating kinetics, and leftward shift the voltage dependence of activation of Kv3.1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Boddum et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Covarrubias et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Taskin et al., 2015</xref>). The narrowing of the AP waveform and increase in steady-state firing provide support for a stronger contribution of Kv3.1 in the repolarization of APs and in increasing the availability of Nav channels during high-frequency firing in RAPNs versus AId neurons.</p><p>We also noted a modest depolarization of the AP peak, after-hyperpolarization and threshold with AUT5 exposure. Considering this combination of changes was not observed in AId, this may be an additional result of increases in Nav channel availability due to positive modulation of Kv3.1. The fact that the AUT5 effects on Kv3.1-expressing zebra finch neurons were similar to those seen in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Boddum et al., 2017</xref>) is not surprising, as the predicted peptide sequence of finch Kv3.1 is ~96.5% identical to that of the human Kv3.1b splice variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Birds and mammals diverged 300 million years ago, so this remarkable conservation suggests that Kv3.1 channels may be optimized for enabling ultranarrow AP waveforms and high-frequency firing. Accordingly, loss-of-function mutations in the human Kv3.1 gene result in myoclonus epilepsy and ataxia, a disease that among other symptoms presents with severe motor deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Barot et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Muona et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Kv3.1 channels have been found in fast-spiking, parvalbumin-expressing interneurons and in layer 5 Betz cells of primate motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bakken et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Soares et al., 2017</xref>). The two splice variants described in mammals, Kv3.1a and 3.1b, have differing trafficking patterns and protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kaczmarek and Zhang, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Rudy et al., 1999</xref>). The longer C-terminal domain of Kv3.1b appears to enable trafficking out of the soma into the axon, while providing protein kinase C phosphorylation sites that decrease the open probability of the channel. We note that in previous transcriptome sequencing efforts in the finch, five Kv3.1 transcripts were predicted (NCBI GeneID:100144433), including Kv3.1b, that contain C-terminal domains with varying lengths. Thus, there is a strong likelihood that, like mammals, RAPNs express different Kv3.1 splice variants that are differentially trafficked and/or phosphorylated based on the specific characteristics of their C-terminal domains.</p><p>In contrast to Kv3.1, the expression of Kv3.2â3.4 is not different between RA and AId. Unlike Kv3.1 and Kv3.2, Kv3.4 exhibits rapid inactivation at depolarized voltages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kaczmarek and Zhang, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Rudy and McBain, 2001</xref>). Interestingly, whereas in mammals Kv3.3 channels exhibit inactivation, albeit on a slower timeframe than Kv3.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kaczmarek and Zhang, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Rudy and McBain, 2001</xref>), the predicted finch Kv3.3 peptide lacks an N-terminal âball-and-chainâ domain thought to be associated with inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7âfigure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Rudy et al., 1999</xref>). This would suggest that Kv3.4 may be solely responsible for the inactivating component of TEA-sensitive currents measured in both RA and AId (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>), possibly by participating in a hetero-multimeric complex with non-inactivating Kv3.1/2 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Baranauskas et al., 2003</xref>). It is this initial part of the current, including the A-type component, that likely participates in the repolarization of APs in both RAPNs and AId neurons. Interestingly, cell-attached recordings in rat layer V pyramidal neurons in the sensorimotor cortex display TEA-insensitive A-type currents, a finding consistent with our data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kang et al., 2000</xref>). This current is likely composed of channels that, in contrast to Kv3.4, gate at significantly more negative membrane potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kang et al., 2000</xref>). Despite lacking an inactivation domain, Kv3.3 expressed in both RA and AId likely contributes to the TEA sensitivity seen in both current- and voltage-clamp recordings. The calyx of Held nerve terminal also generates ultranarrow spikes that can fire at 1 kHz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kim et al., 2013</xref>) and both Kv3.1 and Kv3.3 subunits contribute to its excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Richardson et al., 2022</xref>).

We have now found that both RAPNs and AId neurons express Kv3.3 subunit transcripts, a previously unrecognized gene in the songbird genome, which likely imparts some of the TEA and 4-AP hypersensitivity to AP waveforms. These shared properties of RAPNs and AId neurons distinguish them from those examined in other arcopallial regions (e.g. caudal arcopallium outside of RA), where neurons exhibit broad APs, are incapable of sustained fast spiking, and exhibit less expression of the aforementioned ion channel subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Friedrich et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Nevue et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Zemel et al., 2021</xref>).

In order to isolate K<sup>+</sup> currents, slices were exposed to bath applied CdCl<sub>2</sub> (100 Î¼M), TTX (1 Î¼M), Picrotoxin (100 Î¼M), CNQX (10 Î¼M), and APV (100 Î¼M) for ~5 min prior to running voltage-clamp protocols. After protocols were applied, TEA (500 Î¼M) was bath applied and the same voltage-clamp protocols were repeated after K<sup>+</sup> currents were eliminated. K<sup>+</sup> currents were isolated by subtracting the TEA-insensitive current traces from the initial traces. Capacitive currents generated during voltage-clamp recordings were eliminated by P/4 subtraction. Recordings were not corrected for a measured liquid junction potential of +12 mV.</p><p>Within RA, inhibitory GABAergic interneurons are sparse, and are easily distinguished from RAPNs based on differences in their firing properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Miller et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Spiro et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Zemel et al., 2021</xref>). In situ hybridization for GAD1 and -2 indicates low proportions of GABAergic cells in AId as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lovell et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Pinaud and Mello, 2007</xref>). Accordingly, in our AId recordings we very infrequently encountered neurons with properties resembling interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Garst-Orozco et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kittelberger and Mooney, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Liao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Miller et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Spiro et al., 1999</xref>). Because we were primarily interested in recording from excitatory neurons, and those represented the vast majority of recorded cells based on electrophysiological criteria, we excluded putative GABAergic interneurons in AId from further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Morphology</title><p>For these experiments Biocytin (4 mg/ml; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and Alexa Fluor 488 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) were included in the intracellular solution used in current-clamp experiments. Upon entering the whole-cell current-clamp configuration, the current was set to 0 pA and the cell was held in for 20â30 min at room temperature to allow for complete filling. The electrode was then slowly removed at a diagonal angle as the fluorescence was monitored to determine when the electrode detached. Upon complete separation of the electrode from the cell, the slice was placed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight. The slice was then washed in PBS with 0.25% Triton X-100 (3Ã for 10 min), blocked in a PBS solution containing 1% skim milk (1 hr) and then stained in a PBS solution containing 1% skim milk and avidin conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 (1:200, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 2 hr. The slice was then washed in PBS with 0.25% Triton X-100 (3Ã for 10 min) before a final wash in PBS followed by mounting on a cover slip. Images were captured with a Zeiss LSM 980 Airyscan 2 confocal microscope.</p><p>Maximum projections of the images were made and analyzed in FIJI-ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) to calculate the 2D soma area, dendritic complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Sholl, 1956a</xref>), and estimate spine density (as measured from averaged 30 Âµm stretches from multiple tertiary branches in each cell) shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. In a subset of these neurons (three RAPNs and two AId neurons) we used the recently developed, open-source software, ShuTu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jin et al., 2019</xref>), to reconstruct the morphologies in 3D (see examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1AâB</xref>). 3D renderings were expanded twofold in the Z-direction to allow for better visualization of cellular processes. Despite the planar appearance of reconstructed neurons, previous imaging work in RAPNs and hippocampal neurons suggests these dendrites tile equally across planes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Spiro et al., 1999</xref>) and have been disproportionately compressed in the Z-axis as a result of tissue processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Pyapali et al., 1998</xref>). We used ShuTuâs automatic reconstruction script to trace high-contrast neurites filled with biocytin and to estimate their diameters. For low-contrast, broken or occluded processes, we manually corrected the reconstruction in ShuTuâs GUI. The reconstructions were stored in SWC format. We used ShuTuâs GUI to manually trace all visible dendritic spines. We annotated spines with thin necks and mushroom-like shapes using single SWC points projected away from the dendrite and following the spineâs neck direction. For spines with curved necks, irregular shapes or filopodia-like spines, we used multiple SWC points tracing their entire extent. We estimated spine areas in two ways. We treated spines annotated by a single SWC point as spheres attached by cylindrical necks with an average radius of 0.5 pixels (0.066 Âµm). For spines with multiple SWC points, we used the trapezoidal cylinders defined by every pair of consecutive SWC point. We also added a dome cap to the last SWC point. To obtain a continuous profile of spine density along each dendritic branch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1E</xref>), we used a rolling window of width 20 SWC points (window length fluctuated between 5 Âµm and 39 Âµm, with an average of 17 Âµm for all cells) and of step size 1 SWC point. From the continuous spine density profile, we computed the average spine density of each dendritic segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). We excluded from the density estimation of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref> segments branching off the soma with fewer than 10 spines and any segment shorter than 20 Âµm. We estimated the total dendritic area and length of each cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) from the reconstructions by constructing trapezoidal cylinders for each pair of consecutive SWC point. Axonal area and length were estimated in the same way, although we were only able to connect a small fraction of axon cable to the soma for three neurons. For two neurons we were not able to trace any portion of the axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>We estimated the surface area of the soma of each neuron by triangulating its 3D structure. We first used ShuTuâs GUI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jin et al., 2019</xref>) to manually trace binary masks of the somas in all slices. Next, we traced the contours of the masks with edge detecting filters. We then took a fixed fraction of 20 equally spaced points in each contour in order to generate polygonal contours. All polygonal contours in the end had the same number of edges. Next, we applied a three-point moving average filter along each sequence of vertex in the Z-direction to smooth out rough edges. We then calculated the areas of the triangles formed by the edges and vertices of each adjacent pair of polygonal contours. We added to this number the surface areas of the first and last non-zero binary masks to represent the caps. We also corrected for the areas of the surface patches where the dendrites attach to the soma. Since these surface patches are small, we approximated them by the cross-sectional area of the first dendrite SWC point connected to the soma.</p><p>We estimated the volumes of the dendrites using 3D binary masks which we constructed from the SWC structure. First, we re-scaled the SWC along the Z-axis to match the scale in the XY plane. Next, we interpolated the space between each connected pair of SWC points by trapezoidal cylinders with radii equal to the SWC pointsâ radii. The binary mask assigns ones to voxels intersecting either an SWC point or a trapezoidal cylinder and zeros otherwise. The volume of the dendrite is the fraction of active voxels in the mask multiplied by the volume of the voxel.</p><p>We estimated the volumes of the somas using an adaptation of our method for the surface areas. Starting from the polygonal contours representing the Z-stack, we used the polygonsâ vertices and baricenters to split the somaâs volume into a collection of tetrahedrons. The vertices of an edge in a slice, the vertices of the closest edge in the next slice, and the baricenters of the two contours define four tetrahedrons for which the volume can be easily calculated. The total volume of the soma is the sum of the volumes of the individual tetrahedrons.</p><p>We approximated the volumes of the spines directly from the SWC structure. Since the spines are small, we estimated their volumes to be approximately the sum of the volumes of the individual SWC points.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Comparative genomics of the <italic>KCNC</italic>/Kv3 (Shaw-related) potassium channel genes</title><p>To identify the full set of genes comprising this gene family in zebra finches, we first retrieved all genes annotated as <italic>KCNCs</italic> (voltage-gated channel subfamily C members) from the latest RefSeq database for zebra finch (Annotation Release 106; GCF_003957565.2 assembly). We next retrieved the similarly annotated genes in other selected songbird and non-songbird avian species, observing the immediate synteny and correct cross-species BLAST alignments. To verify the correct orthology of avian genes to corresponding members of this gene family in mammals, we conducted cross-species BLAST searches, noting the top-scoring reciprocal cross-species alignments as well as conserved synteny as orthology criteria. Cases where the avian gene prediction was located on a small sized scaffold with no synteny information were not included in our analysis, as rigorous confirmation of orthology was not possible. For the <italic>KCNC1L</italic> analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1B</xref>), we only examined songbird species with no sequence gaps in the genomic region of interest. To build cladistic trees for evolutionary inferences, we also included (as outgroups to birds and mammals) representative extant organisms from selected branches of major vertebrate groups, as appropriate, including non-avian sauropsids (crocodiles, turtles, lizards), amphibians, and bony fishes where the genes of interest have been identified, and gene orthology to species with more complete and annotated genomes (e.g. human, mouse) can be clearly established.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Pharmacological compounds</title><p>DL-APV, Picrotoxin, CNQX, XE991, and iberiotoxin were purchased from Tocris Biosciences (Bristol, UK).

revisions, shown below. We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Cortical Betz cells analogue in songbirds utilizes Kv3.1 to generate ultranarrow spikes&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Huguenard as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Ian D Forsythe (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The correspondence between RA cells and cortical Betz cells is a stretch.</p><p>This seems more of a discussion point than an essential part of the title, abstract, or introduction.</p><p>2) The evidence of a specific role for Kv3.1 is not conclusive and relevant claims should be moderated.</p><p>3) A valuable pharmacological approach is used. Evidence of stability of responses and reversibility of drug effects should be provided for each of the major findings.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is an extensive piece of work and it contains some good quality data, but the great breadth of the article means that many elements of the results are too superficial and/or lack sufficient detail to deal with certain aspects and complexities of Kv3 physiology.

This is a methodological aside and is not relevant except to demonstrate the care that the authors have taken to exclude inhibitory neurons from their data set.</p><p>5) Page 5, ln 230-254. The data is consistent with a larger effect of TEA and 4-AP on RA repolarization. Again, absolute measures of duration rather than % change should be quoted and compared for the data in figure 4. This will be important if anyone were to model these conductances and neuronal properties in the future. APs in the Ald neurons are already longer, so a similar effect of TEA or 4AP might be expected to be proportionally smaller (if presented as %).</p><p>Figure 4 clearly shows that TEA and 4-AP have direct effects on the AP of RA cells, but less so on Aid cells. But you can only infer that this is mediated by an action on Kv3 channels. The data is very difficult to interpret as all the numerical graphs are presented in fold change in AP halfwidth. How long were the drugs applied, and was recovery data collected to demonstrate washout? It is a pedantic point, but have you checked that the pharmacological evidence cited (from mammals) applies to birds? Since you show no effect in Supl Figure 4, a key issue would be: does Î±-DTx or iberiotoxin block Kv1 and BK channels (respectively) in the bird; have you positive controls or can you provide citations of such (or at least checked for precise homology at the respective toxin binding sites)?</p><p>6) The effect of TEA and 4AP differs in figure 5 (first AP) from figure 4 (AP train). The effect on the half-width of the 1st AP seems smaller than on subsequent APs in the train â particularly noticeable in 5A and 5B. What is the explanation for this (see point 8 below)?</p><p>7) The AP duration is also changing during the trains in Supl Figure 5. There are a few minor inconsistencies here. For example, XE991 has a significant effect in the lowest current injections in S5c. The control peak firing rates (spikes/sec) in S5E are lower (~70 vs ~100) than in S5A and S5C.</p><p>8) Page 6 and figure 6. Voltage-clamp data is well presented and clearly shows larger outward currents in the RA neurons, with little or no 'low-voltage-activated' (steps to -30 mV; potential DTx-sensitive current) in either neuron type. The 'high-voltage activated' currents are very slow activatingâ¦ And so would be hardly activated during a single fast AP lasting less than a msâ¦.. This undermines your arguments that this is Kv3 on two counts: it is too slow to activate (taking over 100ms) and only differs by around 25% between RA and AId neurons. The key current for the AP repolarization, especially for the first AP in a train, is most likely to be the fast inactivating current. From the evidence in figure 6, it is not clear that this is a classic A-current (Kv4), because no estimation of steady-state inactivation has been conducted.</p><p>Although this undermines your current hypothesis that this is a Kv3.1 current, the possibility that the Kv3 current is fast inactivating (i.e. a Kv3.3 or Kv3.4-like current) is very interesting. In Figure 6G, you appear to show that both the inactivating and slow-activating outward currents are TEA-sensitive. Because the activation of the slow outward current overlaps with the decay of the fast transient outward current, any estimation of one will be contaminated by the other. Ideally, you could steady-state inactivate the transient current so you can measure the slow-activating current. This would then allow you to estimate the 'contamination' of one current by the other.</p><p>9) P7 ln 335. Another paper has described kcnc3/Kv3.3 in a seabird (De Paoli-Iseppi et al. PLOS One 12: e0189181, 2017).</p><p>10) Figure 7 and Page 7/8. The heading on ln 319 states, that Kv3.1 is the TEA-sensitive ion channel subunitâ¦ But this seems a rather weak point and could be disputed, as you have measured mRNA, not protein (and the interpretation of the current is ambiguous). The in situ hybridisation for each of the Kv3 genes is interesting, but the quantification is insufficient. The lack of absolute values (or at least relative to some 'housekeeping' gene) for the mRNA expression is a serious weakness. The ratios expressed here between two nuclei in Figure 7 hide/obscure important information and have contributed to the misinterpretation of the physiology. For example, one could argue on the basis of Fig7A that all Kv3 genes are present and that kcnc3 is most striking in that it highlights the two nuclei of interest, is present in both and you have the positive control of Purkinje neurons. Fig7B and 7C are best omittedâ¦ The expression ratio of RA to Ald has little or no relevance to a measurable parameter in your study. Perhaps you could argue some relevance if you had done a more quantitative measure and/or western blotting, but this has not been done. Your own evidence clearly indicates that multiple Kv3 subunits are present (Figure 7A), but you have no measure of the efficacy with which the mRNA is translated into protein (it is also hard to know what constitutes a 'background' value for any of the mRNA probes).</p><p>11. AUT5. This is not a well-designed experiment, since you apply a dose that is half-maximal (1uM when the EC50 is 1.3uM: ln 391), so you would be unlikely to observe more than half of the potential effect. For most readers, this comes across as a rather minor point and I think they will wonder why they need to know this information, certainly it is a weak figure with which to finish. Perhaps if AUT5 was shown to change the finch song or other behaviour in the opposite way to blocking the channel it would be interesting. AUT5 effects have also been noted previously in other publications:</p><p>2015. Biophysical characterization of KV3.1 potassium channel activating compounds.

There are large replicate numbers for almost all findings, and admirably, there is confirmation of the main result at physiological temperature. The phase plots in Figure 4 make clear that 4AP and TEA, at the concentrations used, have little effect on Ald neurons, but strong effects on RAPNs in both current clamp and voltage clamp. The methods developed to improve voltage clamp compliance are to be commended.</p><p>1) The paper has an unclear focus. In some ways, it focuses on the properties of RAPN neurons and how they might generate fast APs. Yet in other contexts, the paper seems to center on the description of a previously uncharacterized cell type, the neurons of Ald.</p><p>2) The pharmacological analysis of repetitive spike firing is lacking. For example, the traces in Figure 5B and 5D, and 8B and 8D, DO in fact show effects of 4AP/TEA/AUT5 on Ald neurons. This raised two issues. A) Repeated measures, such as a paired t-test I (before and after the drug, on a per cell basis) are arguably more appropriate than group averages at each current injection strength. B) Some effort should be dedicated to reversibility. While it can be technically challenging to hold a cell for the total time required to completely wash out the drug, at least a few examples should be provided to confirm that &quot;drug&quot; effects are not due to time-dependent changes in cell physiology.</p><p>3) For fast repolarization, it would likely be better to focus mainly on the early current, highlight with the red bars in figure 6, rather than on the current persisting until 200 ms.</p><p>4) There is a bit of circular logic regarding the description of the effects of AUT5 on spike depolarization (Figure 8A). If RA affects the maximum depolarization, then this could secondarily increase the recruitment of K channels and in turn produce a faster rate of repolarization.</p><p>5) While voltage clamp compliance is likely much improved by the approaches taken, it will still not be perfect, and there will remain issues of non-isopotentiality. This should be discussed.</p><p>6) The correspondence to Betz cells is oversold and should be removed from the title and abstract. There are many differences, as the authors note. A) The RA cells are not necessarily larger than other motor output neurons as with Betz cells, B) They have presumably developed along a unique evolutionary path, C) Other central features of Betz cells (conduction velocities, myelination, axon fiber diameter) are not reported.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81992.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The correspondence between RA cells and cortical Betz cells is a stretch.</p><p>This seems more of a discussion point than an essential part of the title, abstract, or introduction.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this request, as we may have initially overemphasized the analogy between RA projection neurons and Betz cells.

Our title has changed now to mention âKv3 subunitsâ. However, we have found marked contrasts in excitable properties (e.g. spike half-width, maximum repolarization rate) between upper motor neurons in RA and AId, and thus identified physiological specializations characteristic of just RA projection neurons (RAPNs). The molecular data also give clear indication that Kv3.1 is differentially expressed between RAPNs and AId neurons, in contrast to the other TEA-sensitive Kv3 family members, which are not differentially expressed between RA and AId. Coupled with the data from the Kv3.1/Kv3.2 specific agonist, AUT5, we argue that Kv3.1 is the most likely subunit to explain the difference in spike properties between these two regions. Importantly, our paper shows the presence of Kv3.3 in RA and AId and also possible functional evidence of Kv3.4, since we show that a component of the K currents inactivates very quickly (see Figure 6A and 6G).</p><p>To address this important issue, we have changed the wording throughout the manuscript to moderate our claims about a unique role of Kv3.1 in RA.

We note that the opposing effects of AUT5 versus 4-AP and TEA, as well as the stability of recordings during administration of iberiotoxin already provide an indication of stable recordings that can be differentially affected depending on the types of compounds applied to our slices, but we agree that the additional requested data help to solidify the study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This is an extensive piece of work and it contains some good quality data, but the great breadth of the article means that many elements of the results are too superficial and/or lack sufficient detail to deal with certain aspects and complexities of Kv3 physiology.

The Introduction now starts with the paragraph where we introduce zebra finches as a useful model for studying regulation of intrinsic neuronal excitability in the context of refined, fast motor control. In that regard, we note that more traditional genetic models like mice lack the equivalent of a cortical vocal nucleus like RA and its specialized projection neurons, as well as the vocal learning behavior this nucleus subserves. Thus, in spite of the current limitations in applying transgenic methods to these birds, their use provides a unique opportunity to study features of fine motor control systems that are uniquely shared with primates and not apparent in rodents.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Page 3.

The ShuTu analysis confirmed, using a different approach, the findings of cell type differences in spine density and dendrite area. To fully address the reviewerâs request, we now also present our ShuTu measurements as average absolute values of the surface area of different neuronal compartments for both cell types, besides % differences (lines 149-150).

We also include information on drug application times in the Methods (lines 894-897). Additionally, we now show wash out experiments with TEA, 4-AP and AUT5. The effects of TEA were almost completely reversed within 3 minutes of washout. We also observed a significant, but not complete washout with 4-AP on a significantly slower timescale than TEA. We did not observe a significant reversal of the effects of AUT5. This was not surprising, as a previous publication (Taskin et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol., 2015) has indicated that this compound does not washout readily. Nevertheless, these results confirm the stability of our recordings throughout the duration of our experiments. These data are now described in a new Figure 5âfigure supplement 1, the figure legend, and the Results section (see lines 262-271, 442-444).</p><p>With regard to the effects of DTX and BK channels on neuronal excitability in birds, we note that both of these compounds have previously been shown to affect cellular properties in avian species. For example, administration of DTX in the nucleus magnocellularis in the chicken inhibits low threshold potassium currents (Rathouz and Trussell, J. Neurophysiol., 1998). Additionally, iberiotoxin inhibits a ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent potassium current in the chicken ductus arteriosis (Moonen et al., Neonatology, 2010). We additionally performed amino acid sequence alignments for Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv7.2, Kv7.3 and BK channels between humans and zebra finches. We found that the percent identity was 93%, 98%, 77%, 84% and 92% respectively. Kv1.1 and 1.2 both contained high conservation (&gt;95%) in the region between S5 and S6 implicated in the binding of Î±-DTX (Hurst et al., Mol. Phamacol. 1991, Tytgat et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1995). We additionally note a near 100% conservation of the S1-S6 region of Kv7.2 (97% identity) and Kv7.3 (99% identity) between zebra finches and humans. We also note that the BK channel showed remarkable conservation with 98% identity of the S0-S6 domains. Lastly, we note that there were detectable effects on evoked AP firing in RAPNs from administration of DTX. These effects appeared to be restricted to inter-spike periods and not the AP waveform, as shown in Figure 4âfigure supplement 2A and Figure 5âfigure supplement 2A. Thus, while this drug can exert detectable effects on finch RAPNs, we did not observe significant effects on their AP halfwidth. We now comment on these important aspects in lines 282-288.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The effect of TEA and 4AP differs in figure 5 (first AP) from figure 4 (AP train). The effect on the half-width of the 1st AP seems smaller than on subsequent APs in the train â particularly noticeable in 5A and 5B. What is the explanation for this (see point 8 below)?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewerâs comments. Regarding the first sentence, the examples shown in Figure 4 are spontaneous APs which were recorded with no current being injected. Figure 5 shows a train of APs evoked by a +500 pA current injection. Both RAPNs and AId neurons display broader APs, including the first AP, with the administration of TEA and 4-AP. The APs being shown in Figures 4 &amp; 5 are on very different timescales, making visual comparisons of the halfwidth changes in these APs difficult to assess.</p><p>Regarding the second point, the increase in width of the subsequent APs in Figure 5 may be due to the accumulation of voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels and/or A-type potassium channels in inactivated states. The decrease in Nav and/or Kv channel availability may add to the increase in the width of the subsequent APs in the train due to a relatively slower depolarization and/or repolarization rate. We note that this adaptation is described in our previous publication (Zemel et al., Nat. Commun., 2021), in which we show the first AP in a train (at +500 pA) is narrower, with significantly greater rates of depolarization and repolarization than subsequent APs. In order to acknowledge this adaption, we have changed our reference to RAPN and AId neuron firing as non-adapting to minimally adapting in the text (Lines 452,518).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The AP duration is also changing during the trains in Supl Figure 5. There are a few minor inconsistencies here. For example, XE991 has a significant effect in the lowest current injections in S5c. The control peak firing rates (spikes/sec) in S5E are lower (~70 vs ~100) than in S5A and S5C.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate again the reviewerâs comments, and refer the reviewer to the response to the previous comment to address the first sentence.</p><p>Regarding the second sentence, we acknowledge that there were indeed some changes in the evoked firing rates on APs in RAPNs in response to XE991. The statistical differences were shown in the legend of Figure 5âfigure supplement 2. These findings in fact provide further supportive evidence that these drugs were exerting effects on neuronal cell excitability in finches, and suggest that Kv7 may contribute to the spike rates of RAPNs. Importantly, however, XE991 exerted no detectable effects on AP halfwidth or maximum rate of repolarization, as evidenced from the data from spontaneously firing APs in Figure 4âfigure supplement 2. The difference in spontaneous firing rates of RAPNs exposed to XE991, while modest, may reflect the relative weight of the Kv7 conductance when cells are sparsely firing versus at more depolarized voltages during positive constant current injections, when additional voltage dependent conductances are more heavily recruited.</p><p>Regarding the third sentence, we acknowledge that on average the control peak firing rates are lower in Figure 5âfigure supplement 2E compared to 2A and 2C. But these differences are very small, within the standard error for half of the current injection levels. Specifically, the averages for the controls in 2A and 2E were 35.2 Â± 2.2 vs. 39.7 Â± 4.3 at +100 pA, 53.8 Â± 3.1 vs. 54.3 Â± 5.6 at +200pA and 68.3 Â± 4.1 vs. 64.5 Â± 6.2 at +300pA. While the values for current injections above +300 pA were indeed lower the variability of the data in 2E was clearly greater, as indicated by the standard error. Taken together, while we cannot be certain as to what caused the decreased averages and higher variability in the two data points in Figure 5âfigure supplement 2E, we do show that the RAPN evoked firing properties are remarkably consistent across experimental conditions (Figure 5, Figure 8, Figure 5âfigure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Page 6 and figure 6. Voltage-clamp data is well presented and clearly shows larger outward currents in the RA neurons, with little or no 'low-voltage-activated' (steps to -30 mV; potential DTx-sensitive current) in either neuron type.

This would then allow you to estimate the 'contamination' of one current by the other.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the thoughtful comments from the reviewer. We acknowledge that there is indeed a discrepancy between the time to the peak outward K<sup>+</sup> current and the AP duration measured in RAPNs and AId neurons. There are a number of technical reasons that could explain this: (1) While we have identified conditions that maximize our ability to obtain high quality voltage-clamp recordings from RAPNs (see Zemel et al., Nat. Commun., 2021), we note that our cells likely retain some complex processes consisting of dendrites and local axon collaterals. This non-spherical geometry likely limits isopotentiality in our recordings, limiting our ability to accurately measure the speed of the onset of these currents. (2) While we successfully eliminated the vast majority of the Nav currents during our experiments using TTX, we note that our previous estimates of the Na<sup>+</sup> current during the AP upstroke was ~65 nA (Zemel et al., Nat. Commun., 2021). We thus posit that a residual Na<sup>+</sup> current that might remain even after administration of 1 ÂµM TTX could limit our ability to fully isolate and measure the onset of the K<sup>+</sup> current. (3) Under physiological conditions the outward K<sup>+</sup> currents were too large to measure accurately. As stated in Methods, we lowered our intracellular K<sup>+</sup> concentration by half in an attempt to limit the size of the outward current. This in turn reduces the current size, even at very early timepoints.</p><p>Nevertheless, we were able to reliably obtain outward K<sup>+</sup> currents under the same experimental conditions from RAPNs and AId neurons. We note that the larger currents with shorter time to peak in RAPNs compared to AId neurons are consistent with a differential expression of Kv currents in these brain regions. Taken together with the differential expression of Kv3.1, but not other TEA-sensitive Kvs, our voltage clamp data provides further indication that Kv3.1 likely contributes to this difference between RAPNs and AId neurons.</p><p>We also agree with the reviewer that the overlap of any delayed rectifier current with the decay of the fast, transient outward current obscures any measurement of either of these components individually. The TEA sensitivity of these currents does suggest that Kv3 channels likely exist as heteromultimeric complexes, that include Kv3.4. This point is discussed in lines (584-588). While further studies on the components of the K<sup>+</sup> current are of great interest to us, the data are consistent with a differential expression of a high-threshold, TEA-sensitive Kv channel between RAPNs and AId neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) P7 ln 335.

BLAST alignments of this transcript indeed reveal high hits only to KCNC4 in birds, sauropsids and mammals, including humans, thus this is clearly KCNC4, not KCNC3.</p><p>2) BLAST alignments of the primers (File S1, Table A in De Paoli-Iseppi et al) used to amplify the presumed CpG region of KCNC3 in the fulmar fully align to a scaffold (NW_009228155.1) that contains no trace of KCNC3, KCNC4, or any other voltage-gated ion channel, so the claim that these primers amplify a regulatory region of these genes cannot be verified;</p><p>3) Our study is the first to describe the KCNC3 genomic locus, including its synteny. Notably, the locus is on zebra finch chromosome 37, whose equivalent has not been assembled in either the fulmar or the shearwater, as well as in most other bird species. This hard to characterize microchromosome has only been completed in very few avian species, requiring the latest advances in long-read sequencing and assembling technologies (Rhie et al., 2021), which helps to explain why this remains an undefined locus in the majority of bird species.</p><p>4) There are no significant hits to a KCNC3-like locus in fulmar or shearwater in our unbiased BLAST searches of genomic databases using as queries the identified KCNC3 in zebra finch, gyrfalcon and kakapo. Altogether, we conclude that the locus mentioned as KCNC3 was erroneously identified as KCNC3 and most likely is KCNC4. We have added an explanatory comment with regard to this misannotation in the Results. We also provide further details of our curation/annotation efforts in Methods, as well as include in the legend of Figure 7âfigure supplement 1 the loci numbers for all avian genes that were misannotated in NCBI and that we have reannotated as part of our curation effort.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Figure 7 and Page 7/8. The heading on ln 319 states, that Kv3.1 is the TEA-sensitive ion channel subunitâ¦ But this seems a rather weak point and could be disputed, as you have measured mRNA, not protein (and the interpretation of the current is ambiguous). The in situ hybridisation for each of the Kv3 genes is interesting, but the quantification is insufficient. The lack of absolute values (or at least relative to some 'housekeeping' gene) for the mRNA expression is a serious weakness. The ratios expressed here between two nuclei in Figure 7 hide/obscure important information and have contributed to the misinterpretation of the physiology. For example, one could argue on the basis of Fig7A that all Kv3 genes are present and that kcnc3 is most striking in that it highlights the two nuclei of interest, is present in both and you have the positive control of Purkinje neurons. Fig7B and 7C are best omittedâ¦ The expression ratio of RA to Ald has little or no relevance to a measurable parameter in your study. Perhaps you could argue some relevance if you had done a more quantitative measure and/or western blotting, but this has not been done. Your own evidence clearly indicates that multiple Kv3 subunits are present (Figure 7A), but you have no measure of the efficacy with which the mRNA is translated into protein (it is also hard to know what constitutes a 'background' value for any of the mRNA probes).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer brings up important points with regard to mRNA expression of Kv3 subunits. In retrospect, we agree that the heading of that section may have been somewhat misleading, and have adjusted it accordingly. It was not our intention to claim that Kv3.1 is the sole channel in this family that is expressed in RAPNs, or that it is the sole determinant of RAPN properties, nor was our intention to disprove the possible contributions of other Kv3 family subunits to RAPN properties. Our goal was to demonstrate that Kv3.1 differential expression in RAPNs vs AId neurons in a pattern consistent with the regional differences in their electrophysiological properties, thus indicative of Kv3.1 playing a larger role in RAPNs compared to AId neurons. In that regard, we disagree that our analysis is misleading or irrelevant. We do show that other Kv3s are expressed in RAPNs, but we are saying that their mRNA expression patterns are inconsistent with the differences seen between RAPNs and AId spikes. Thus, these other family members are less likely to contribute to the differences in electrophysiological properties seen between RAPNs and AId neurons. We agree that the Kv3.3 pattern is interesting, suggesting a prominent role of this subunit in both RAPNs and AId neurons, but the high Kv3.3 expression in both areas is inconsistent with the differential electrophysiological properties seen between these two regions. We have modified the relevant passages of the text to make these points more clearly (see lines 85-87, 105-116, 395-399, 409-410, 446, 546, 551-553, 1592, 1624).</p><p>To further address the reviewerâs concerns, and for disclosure and completeness, we note that the absolute values of our densitometric analysis that were used to generate the ratios are provided in the corresponding tab 7B and 7C of the Source Data file that accompanies the manuscript, as is also done for electrophysiological parameters. We also note that the in situ signal is sensitive to differences in probe length, hybridization strength and stringency conditions, and does not involve counts of mRNA molecules, thus the values do not allow us to conclude which specific subunit is most highly expressed in RAPNs, which again was not our goal. We closely examine probe specificity through genomic alignment of probe sequences, and our in situs are run under optimized hybridization conditions that result in no detectable signal upon omission of probe or anti-dig antibody. Background levels as measured in tissue areas devoid of cells are well below the cellular levels measured for each of the probes used, as attested in the Source Data file. Furthermore, the large number of probes in Figures 7B/C that show no differences between regions essentially play a normalizing role (similar to the request for âhousekeepingâ gene data), showing that transcript of various lengths and sequences are not differential between RAPNs and AId neurons, and further helping to establish the specificity of the differential expression of Kv3.1 between RAPNs and AId. Lastly, we agree that we cannot directly infer protein levels from mRNA expression, and note that there is currently no published use of Kv3.1 antibodies in the zebra finch. However, based on parsimony, we think it is reasonable to infer that the Kv3.1 mRNA pattern correlates better with the electrophysiological differences between RAPNs and AId neurons than any of the other subunits examined. We have edited several passages in Methods and Results to address these important points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. AUT5. This is not a well-designed experiment, since you apply a dose that is half-maximal (1uM when the EC50 is 1.3uM: ln 391), so you would be unlikely to observe more than half of the potential effect. For most readers, this comes across as a rather minor point and I think they will wonder why they need to know this information, certainly it is a weak figure with which to finish. Perhaps if AUT5 was shown to change the finch song or other behaviour in the opposite way to blocking the channel it would be interesting. AUT5 effects have also been noted previously in other publications:</p><p>2015. Biophysical characterization of KV3.1 potassium channel activating compounds.

Neuropharmacology, 118:102-112.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewerâs comments and note that we have cited both of these studies within our manuscript. We additionally note that the half maximal dose of AUT5 yielded significant effects on RAPNs, but not on AId neurons. These results are consistent with the difference in expression of Kv3.1 between RAPNs and AId neurons. We believe that the AUT5 data is critical in: (1) Narrowing down to Kv3.1/Kv3.2 as the most likely contributing channels for the differences between RAPNs and AId neurons; and (2) Showing that by positively modulating Kv3.1 channel activity we can demonstrate opposite effects of blockade by TEA or 4-AP. With regard to delivering AUT5 to RA during song production, it would require various elaborate controls and the exact predictions are unclear, as one might see opposing effects due to AUT5âs possible actions on Kv3.1/2 expressed in both RAPNs and GABAergic interneurons. Thus, while we agree this is a tantalizing experiment, we believe it is beyond the scope of the present study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This paper was a pleasure to read and goes through a logical sequence of experiments to pinpoint the role of Kv3(.1?) in the fast-spiking of RAPN neurons. There are large replicate numbers for almost all findings, and admirably, there is confirmation of the main result at physiological temperature. The phase plots in Figure 4 make clear that 4AP and TEA, at the concentrations used, have little effect on Ald neurons, but strong effects on RAPNs in both current clamp and voltage clamp. The methods developed to improve voltage clamp compliance are to be commended.</p><p>1) The paper has an unclear focus. In some ways, it focuses on the properties of RAPN neurons and how they might generate fast APs. Yet in other contexts, the paper seems to center on the description of a previously uncharacterized cell type, the neurons of Ald.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewerâs concern. Our main goal has been to characterize the excitable properties of RAPNs, which are upper motor neurons with a specialized role in vocal-motor control. However, we also discovered that the excitable properties of RAPNs differ in significant ways from those of neurons in the adjacent AId, which are thought to control non-vocal somatic motor function (Mandelblat-Cerf, <italic>eLife</italic>, 2014; Yaun and Bottjer, eNeuro, 2020; Feenders et al., PLoS One, 2008). We then realized that an important way to highlight the unique properties of RAPNs would be to contrast them with those of AId neurons. Whereas there is literature describing the excitable properties of RAPNs, no studies to date have described the intrinsic excitable properties of AId neurons (using whole-cell patch clamp), nor contrasted the neuronal excitable properties of these two regions. Examination of the differences between RAPNs and AId neurons provided key insights into specializations that may be associated with vocal production. To clarify this important point, we now make the goals and general strategy of our study more explicit in the beginning of the Results section (see lines 105-116).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The pharmacological analysis of repetitive spike firing is lacking. For example, the traces in Figure 5B and 5D, and 8B and 8D, DO in fact show effects of 4AP/TEA/AUT5 on Ald neurons. This raised two issues. A) Repeated measures, such as a paired t-test I (before and after the drug, on a per cell basis) are arguably more appropriate than group averages at each current injection strength. B) Some effort should be dedicated to reversibility. While it can be technically challenging to hold a cell for the total time required to completely wash out the drug, at least a few examples should be provided to confirm that &quot;drug&quot; effects are not due to time-dependent changes in cell physiology.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the comment about the need for statistical rigor and drug reversibility experiments. With regard to the first point, we did run repeated measures statistics. In our experimental design we measured spikes per second at multiple levels of positive current injections before and after drug administration. Based on this experimental design, we conducted a Repeated Measures Two-way ANOVA to determine any effects on the spikes per second of the recorded cells, which is statistically more appropriate than running multiple t-tests. For datasets in which the ANOVA detected a significant effect, we followed up with post-hoc tests to determine significance for individual comparisons that could explain our results. While we note the trends in the data for AId neuron responses to 4-AP and TEA (see lines 252-260), no significant effect was detected by the ANOVA. To our knowledge we used an appropriate and rigorous statistical treatment of the data given the experimental design.</p><p>Per the reviewersâ suggestion (see also Reviewer 1) we performed washout experiment with TEA, 4-AP and AUT5. These data are now described in Results (lines 262-271, 442-444) and presented in the new Figure 5âfigure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) For fast repolarization, it would likely be better to focus mainly on the early current, highlight with the red bars in figure 6, rather than on the current persisting until 200 ms.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the early current indeed plays a more important role in AP repolarization. While we analyzed the currents at 200 ms, we gave equal attention to analysis of the initial inactivating current observed. We have now added a sentence to the discussion focusing on the early current and its putative effects on the repolarization of APs in RAPNs and AId neurons. See lines (588-589).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There is a bit of circular logic regarding the description of the effects of AUT5 on spike depolarization (Figure 8A). If RA affects the maximum depolarization, then this could secondarily increase the recruitment of K channels and in turn produce a faster rate of repolarization.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer comments here on another important point. We note, however, that there was no change in the maximum rate of spike depolarization in RAPNs in response to AUT5 (stats in lines 425-426). While we agree that Kv channel recruitment could result from a more depolarized spike peak, as far as we are aware there is no data to suggest effects of AUT5 on Nav channels, that could cause this increased peak. Previously published literature (Boddum et al., Neuropharmacol., 2017; Taskin et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol., 2015) and personal communications with Autifony Therapeutics describe AUT5 as being a highly selective positive modulator for Kv3.1 and Kv3.2. We acknowledge that the exact explanation for the effects of AUT5 on spike shape may be complicated, with indirect effects on the availability of other voltage gated ion channels during spiking as a result of voltage-dependent shifts, activation changes and deactivation changes of Kv3.1 channels in response to 1 ÂµM AUT5. Nonetheless, coupled with the other AUT5-induced changes that were seen in RAPNs, but not in AId neurons, we believe that the most parsimonious explanation for our data is that the changes seen in RAPNs with AUT5 are due to the positive modulation of the Kv3.1 subunit.</p><p>We have now included a statement regarding the potential increase in recruitment of Kvâs as a result of the depolarized peak of the AP (See lines 432-433).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) While voltage clamp compliance is likely much improved by the approaches taken, it will still not be perfect, and there will remain issues of non-isopotentiality. This should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewerâs comments and revised text in Results to address issues of isopotentiality.

There are many differences, as the authors note. A) The RA cells are not necessarily larger than other motor output neurons as with Betz cells, B) They have presumably developed along a unique evolutionary path, C) Other central features of Betz cells (conduction velocities, myelination, axon fiber diameter) are not reported.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewerâs comments and have removed the reference to Betz cells from the title. We have additionally modified the Abstract and significantly changed the Introduction (eliminating the first paragraph) to de-emphasize the comparison with Betz cells. While we also agree that future studies are indeed required (i.e. looking at myelination, axon fiber diameter and conduction velocities) for thorough comparisons, we nonetheless believe it is worth discussing the similarities to Betz cells in the paper. In particular, the presence of Kv3.1b in Betz cells (but not in other Layer 5 motor cortex pyramidal neurons) has been highlighted by researchers working with primates, so we find it most intriguing that this important feature is also present in the RA cells. Nevertheless, the comparison with Betz cells is now mostly detailed in the Discussion section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
