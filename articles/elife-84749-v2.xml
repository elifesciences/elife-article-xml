The mechanisms of collective cell migration of epithelial cell populations have been well studied. It remains unclear, however, how the highly motile mesenchymal cells, which migrate extensively throughout the embryo, are connected with each other and coordinated as a collective. During chick gastrulation, cells emerging from the primitive streak and migrating in the 3D space between ectoderm and endoderm (mesoderm region) exhibit a novel form of collective migration. Using live imaging and quantitative analysis, such as topological data analysis (TDA), we found that these cells undergo a novel form of collective migration, in which they form a meshwork structure while moving away from the primitive streak. Overexpressing a mutant form of N-cadherin was associated with reduced speed of tissue progression and directionality of the collective cell movement, whereas the speed of individual cells remains unchanged. To investigate how this meshwork arises, we utilized an agent-based theoretical model, which suggests that cell elongation, cell-cell adhesion, and cell density are the key parameters for the meshwork formation. These data provide novel insights into how a supracellular structure of migrating mesenchymal cells may arise in loosely connected cell populations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>gastrulation</kwd><kwd>live imaging</kwd><kwd>3D cell tracking</kwd><kwd>epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition</kwd><kwd>topological data analysis</kwd><kwd>mathematical model</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16K07385</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nakaya</surname><given-names>Yukiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19H14673</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tarama</surname><given-names>Mitsusuke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>22H05170</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shibata</surname><given-names>Tatsuo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.52926/JPMJCR1852</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shibata</surname><given-names>Tatsuo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00hhkn466</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19K03645</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tasaki</surname><given-names>Sohei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00hhkn466</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>23K03208</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tasaki</surname><given-names>Sohei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel form of collective mesenchymal cell migration is identified during chick gastrulation, where a dynamic 3D meshwork supported by N-cadherin-mediated adhesion coordinates movement and enhances directional migration in the unconfined space between ectoderm and endoderm.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Collective behaviors of migrating cells are fundamental in processes of morphogenesis of tissues and organs, wound healing, and tumor metastasis. Such collective cell migration is typically found in epithelial tissues, in which the motile ability can be acquired by bringing multiple cells together into one group via intercellular adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chuai and Weijer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Friedl and Gilmour, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Friedl and Mayor, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sato et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Scarpa and Mayor, 2016</xref>). On the other hand, mesenchymal cells do not exhibit stable intercellular adhesion with surrounding cells, and they can migrate as individual cells. However, even for these mesenchymal cells, collective cell migration that exploits transient cell-cell adhesion is required for the morphogenesis in living organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Scarpa and Mayor, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shellard and Mayor, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Theveneau and Mayor, 2014</xref>). Neural crest (NC) migration is one of the most studied model systems for mesenchymal collective migration, in which cells are gathered into characteristic chains or streams within a physically restricted environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Szabó and Mayor, 2018</xref>). In <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos, cranial NC streams emerge from the interaction with neighboring tissue placode, where transient cell-cell interactions called contact inhibition of locomotion confer the supracellular polarity to determine the orientation of movement as a group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carmona-Fontaine et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hiraiwa, 2019</xref>). Whereas the mechanism of this streaming migration is relatively well investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bronner and Simões-Costa, 2016</xref>), it is still largely unknown how mesenchymal cells that are not tightly confined, such as those in mesoderm, move toward their destination and how their transient cell-cell adhesions contribute to it.</p><p>Mesoderm is a germ layer consisting of mesenchymal cells, and it forms during gastrulation. In the case of chick embryos, as the primitive streak is being formed, cells in the superficial layer (epiblast) move toward the primitive streak. Most of the mesoderm cells are formed by the convergence of these epithelial-shaped epiblast cells to the primitive streak, which subsequently undergoes the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). These mesoderm cells ingress adopting an irregular mesenchymal morphology and acquire high motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nakaya et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nakaya and Sheng, 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Voiculescu et al., 2014</xref>). Then, the mesoderm cells move away from the primitive streak at various anterior-posterior positions, in the three-dimensional (3D) space between the epiblast and endoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (Video: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sdbcore.org/object?ObjectID=358">https://www.sdbcore.org/object?ObjectID=358</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chuai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Iimura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nájera and Weijer, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nakaya and Sheng, 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nakaya et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Psychoyos and Stern, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Voiculescu et al., 2014</xref>). Previous reports suggested that the mesoderm cells migrate at high density and their long-range migration pathway was controlled by a balance between chemo-repulsion mediated by FGF8 secreted from the primitive streak and chemo-attraction mediated by FGF4 secreted from the head-process and notochord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chuai and Weijer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2002</xref>). It is not clear, however, whether they are essentially solitary cells following the same cues while occasionally contacting each other or whether collective effects are essential for the mesoderm migration. If the latter is the case, questions arise as to what kind of cell-cell interactions give rise to the collective property, and what spatial structure emerges beyond the single cellular scale when cells migrate collectively.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mesoderm cells move collectively during gastrulation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram of the chicken embryo at stage HH3.

However, spatiotemporal patterns of migration differ among the models. In zebrafish prechordal plate, cells exhibit collective movement towards the animal pole, whose directionality is maintained by contact between cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dumortier et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, in mice, live imaging of whole embryo indicated that the mesoderm cells migrate individually rather than collective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ichikawa et al., 2013</xref>). More recently, in mice, embryonic mesoderm cells demonstrate random aspects in their migration behavior and neighboring cells tend to migrate in parallel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Saykali et al., 2019</xref>). Leveraging the flat and easily accessible nature of the early chick embryo, researchers have conducted extensive and well-documented experimental studies over many years. The chick embryo has been particularly valuable in studying the properties of the mesoderm, including the migration pathways that depend on cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Psychoyos and Stern, 1996</xref>). Live imaging techniques have also been employed to visualize the migratory routes of cells emerging from various positions along the primitive streak, spanning from anterior to posterior regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we examined how primitive-streak-derived mesenchymal cells, which are mostly mesoderm cells but a small fraction of definitive endoderm cells may be included, migrate during early chick gastrulation. Our quantitative data analysis, including large-scale cell tracking and topological data analysis (TDA) on high-resolution microscopy images showed that the cells migrate collectively, and they are connected to each other via cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion and form a meshwork structure that exhibits a continual and rapid reorganization. This dynamic meshwork structure was reproduced by a theoretical model, which suggests that the morphology of the cells, the strength of cell-cell adhesion, and the cell density are key parameters for the meshwork formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mesoderm cells move collectively with frequent changes in their relative position</title><p>We first investigated how mesoderm cells migrate in the early gastrulating stage of chick embryos. To this end, we electroporated a plasmid encoding H2B-eGFP into the mesoderm precursor cells located at the primitive streak of stage HH3 embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hamburger and Hamilton, 1951</xref>), and then the embryos were cultured ex vivo for several hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chapman et al., 2001</xref>). To follow the behavior of electroporated cells, we obtained 3D images (scan area: 500 µm × 500 µm, scan depth: 50 µm) of the mesoderm at three different streak levels along the primitive streak, at 1 min intervals, for 2 hr using an inverted two-photon microscope with 25 x WMP/0.25 NA objective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). We note that at this developmental stage (HH3), the entire length of the primitive streak is less than 2 mm. We also note that although the tissue scale extension along the anterior-posterior axis becomes more prominent after HH4+, the cell trajectories at this stage (HH3) reflect the cell migration in the environment of mesoderm region without the tissue-scale deformation.</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-84749-video1.mp4" id="video1"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Mesoderm cell movements on gastrulating chick embryo.</title><p>Left: Nuclei of mesoderm cells are labeled by H2B-eGFP expression (green).

Most of these 3D trajectories were attributed to mesoderm cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), although a small fraction of definitive-endoderm cells may also be present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Psychoyos and Stern, 1996</xref>). In all three regions, the mesoderm cells exhibited a spreading behavior with maximal cell displacement in particular directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, Anterior, Middle, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In the anterior and middle regions, the mesoderm cells tended to move in the anterior-lateral direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> Anterior, Middle and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In contrast, the mesoderm cells in the posterior region tended to move toward the lateral direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, Posterior and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These migration directions were consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nájera and Weijer, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2002</xref>).

The z-position of the mesoderm cells also changed frequently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In fact, the distribution of the difference between the maximum and minimum z-positions of individual trajectories in 60 min showed a peak around 20 µm with a tail that extended more than 40 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), indicating that most cells change their z-position by more than one to two cell lengths, given that the typical cell length is 10–20 µm. Thus, the mesoderm cells frequently change their direction of motion in 3D.</p><p>We first quantitatively characterize this migration behavior of individual cells for trajectories obtained from six embryos (in total, 6 × 3 = 18 samples) (see Materials and methods).

The directionality for the trajectories of 20 min length in 18 samples was smaller than one and was distributed from about 0.45–0.7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We then performed a mean squared displacement (MSD) analysis to evaluate the randomness of the individual mesoderm migration (Materials and methods).

We also confirmed that the MSD exponent and the directionality showed a good positive correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). To further verify the persistence of the migration direction, we calculated the autocorrelation function (ACF) of the velocity of individual cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). The ACF indicated that the correlation decreased below 0.5 in 2 min for all 18 samples, indicating that the migration direction shows random fluctuations. For a longer time scale, the ACF gradually decreased, but did not converge to zero, indicating that the motion was biased slightly to a particular direction in each region. Thus, the motion of mesoderm cell is considered as a biased random walk. We note that these migration characteristics were not significantly different between the three regions: anterior, middle, and posterior.</p><p>We next elucidate the coordination of cell migrations among neighboring cells by analyzing the collective order of the mesoderm cell motions.

The value of <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf11"><mml:mi>φ</mml:mi></mml:math><tex-math id="inft11">\begin{document}$\varphi $\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula> was distributed from 0.5 to 0.75 with a mean value of 0.64, indicating that the migration direction is well aligned among the neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), despite of the randomness in the individual cell motion. To investigate how far the cell migration direction is aligned, we measured the polar order parameters for different radius of the measurement circle. As the radius of the measurement circle increases, the polar order parameter decreases exponentially with a characteristic decay length of 57 µm, beyond which the average of <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf12"><mml:mi>φ</mml:mi></mml:math><tex-math id="inft12">\begin{document}$\varphi $\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula> is less than 0.5. This result indicates that the mesoderm cells within a length scale of about 60 µm migrate collectively. In the longer length scale, the migration of the mesoderm cells becomes less coordinated due to the fluctuation in the migration direction as the ACF of the velocity indicates.</p><p>To study whether the mesoderm cells within this characteristic length move together, we measured the mean squared relative distance (MSRD) (Materials and methods), which quantifies the temporal change of the relative distance between two cells. The MSRD curve increases with time, but there is a threshold time about 10 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>) beyond which the increase of the MSRD slows down. In this timescale, the two cells initially in contact move away from each other to about 25 μm. Beyond the threshold time, the MSRD increases linearly in time. This indicates that the migrating mesoderm cells do not form a tight cluster, changing their relative positions frequently. It also suggests that there is sufficient extracellular space where the cells can easily change their relative positions in the mesoderm tissue. We note that the Péclet number can be estimated to be 2–4 considering the mean cell speed obtained above, the typical cell size to be about 10 µm, and the persistent time obtained from the MSRD analysis.</p><p>We finally measured the progression speed of mesoderm for 18 samples, which was obtained as the time average of the average velocity of cells in small regions (50 μm × 50 μm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> color code). The mean of the progression speed was distributed from about 0.5–2 μm/min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), which was almost the half of the individual cells speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This difference can be explained by considering the randomness of cell migrations and the value of the polar order parameter of this length scale.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Mesoderm cells form meshwork structure</title><p>If there is sufficient extracellular space for cells to change their relative position frequently, how do they distribute in 3D space between the epiblast and the endoderm? To explore this question, we prepared 3D reconstructed images of the mesoderm tissue at the mid-streak level in HH4 embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). From the projected image on the xy plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, z - projection), we found no clear pattern in the distribution of cells in the primitive streak (dense region of nuclei stained with DAPI) and the mesoderm next to the streak, consistent with previous reports based on scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">England and Wakely, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">England and Wakely, 1977</xref>).

Thus, in contrast to previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chuai et al., 2012</xref>) that suggested that the mesoderm is densely packed with migrating cells, we found a meshwork structure of collectively migrating mesoderm cells.

Persistent homology is a tool that has been developed recently in applied mathematics to quantitatively characterize the topological structure in disordered systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Buchet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hiraoka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Obayashi et al., 2018</xref>). To analyze an image by persistent homology, we first prepare a black and white binary pixel image from the original image by thresholding, where the pixels occupied by cells are white. Such a binary image can be seen as a landscape with hills and valleys, where hills represent cluster of cells, and the valleys represent holes between them. We can assign height and depth (negative height) of hills and valleys, respectively, by considering the shortest distance (Manhattan distance) from the interface between white and black pixels. Now, we consider this landscape at different heights. To uncover topological features, we apply progressive thresholding to the binary image from the minimum height (leading to completely white) to the maximum (leading to completely black) in a stepwise manner. At each threshold level, pixels below the threshold are black. As the threshold level incrementally changes, a feature, such as a hole which is a black area surrounded by a white area, emerges or ‘is born’. Such a threshold level is recorded as ‘birth level’ of the feature. As the threshold level is increased further, the feature merges with another feature or ‘dies’. Such a threshold level is recorded as ‘death level’ of the feature. Thus, the holes are characterized by the two quantities called birth and death levels, and they are visualized by points in persistence diagram (PD) where the coordinates are given by the birth and death levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). These two quantities basically represent the size of the feature and the distance between two features, respectively. The difference between the death and the birth levels is called ‘persistence’, which becomes large for a reliable topological feature. Note that in the persistent homology on binary images, the birth and death levels, and thus the persistence, are measured in the unit of pixels.</p><p>We performed persistent homology analysis by using a software named HomCloud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Obayashi et al., 2018</xref>) and applying it to binarized images of the mesoderm at three different z levels. The PDs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> show the results correspond to the images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>. The points with large persistence were distributed around the death level ≈0 as a branch extended away from the diagonal line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), which we call <italic>hole branch</italic> in this paper. Each point in this hole branch corresponded to a clear hole in the binary image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To characterize the size of the holes quantitatively, we calculated the radius from the birth level of a hole in the hole branch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, see also Materials and methods), which was estimated on average as 17 µm, 15 µm, and 12 µm for the upper, middle, and lower layers, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Thus, the diameter of the hole is about half of the characteristic length scale of collective migration measured in the previous subsection (~60 µm). To conclude, these results indicate that the mesoderm is extended as a loose layer of cells, and the characteristic meshwork structure is formed by cells connected by N-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion, which may lead to their collective migration.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Meshwork structure is dynamic with the emergence and collapse of holes</title><p>To examine whether the meshwork structure was also observed in living embryos, we next performed live imaging of transgenic chicken embryos that ubiquitously express cytoplasmic GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Motono et al., 2010</xref>) to visualize the migration of the mesoderm cells and how they interact with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

The PDs at different time points (0, 12, and 24 min) showed the hole branch of the points with large persistence, which was comparable to the PDs obtained for the fixed embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3B</xref>). From this, we conclude that the meshwork structure found in the living embryo is the same structure as those found in the fixed embryos. The radius of the holes was on average about 13 µm, which showed no systematic change during the observation over 24 min. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we investigate how the meshwork structure changes in time. The advanced inverse analysis enables us to detect the region of the hole in the original binary image, which corresponds to each point in PD (Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). To visualize the time evolution of the holes, we plotted the region of some holes obtained by the advanced inverse analysis in x-y-t coordinates over 24 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The holes underwent emergence and collapse, and they also split and merged occasionally, while moving gradually in the anterior-lateral direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>).</p><p>These results implied that the mesoderm cells are only transiently connected to each other and can easily change their partners. Thus, the meshwork structure is dynamic in the sense that cells that form a hole are replaced over time while the mesoderm cells migrate away from the primitive streak. Since the characteristic length scale of collective migration and the diameter of the holes are comparable, the cells that form a hole move in roughly the same direction. However, frequent changes in the relative positions among the cells cause the collective order to decay over long length scales much larger than the hole size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>N-cadherin appears to play an important role for collective cell migration during mesoderm formation</title><p>Previous studies based on scanning and transmission electron microscopy observations have reported that the space between the epiblast and endoderm in early chick embryos, where the mesoderm cells migrate, is filled with water-soluble components such as hydrated glycosaminoglycans, in particular hyaluronic acid, and contains little extracellular matrix that can provide a scaffold for cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Van Hoof et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sanders, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sanders, 1979</xref>). This suggests that the mesoderm cells rely on cell-cell adhesion to get traction to migrate, as well as the contact to the basal lamina of either epiblast or endoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brown and Sanders, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sanders, 1986</xref>). The formation of the meshwork and its dynamic characteristics may also rely on cell-cell adhesion. Taking these points into consideration, we questioned how much impact cell-cell adhesion has on cell migration as well as on the meshwork structure.</p><p>Consistent with the previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moly et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nakaya et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2008</xref>), during gastrulation, most mesoderm cells expressed the classical adhesion molecule N-cadherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Notably, we found that N-cadherin was localized at the cell-cell contact site between the cells in both the x-y and x-z sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), meaning that the N-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion is present at the cell-cell contact sites between upper and lower cells as well as at the horizontal cell-cell contact site. This implies that N-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion plays a fundamental role in the formation of the meshwork structure and the collective migration. To test this idea, we studied the effect of reducing the intercellular adhesion of mesoderm cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nieman et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ozawa, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ozawa and Kobayashi, 2014</xref>).

Qualitative observations suggest that control cells tend to elongate their bodies and establish prolonged cell-cell contacts via protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). These cells remained in contact for several tens of minutes, with the longest contact duration exceeding 1 hr (No.1 and No.2 pair in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>, upper panels, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>). In contrast, mutant cells appeared to exhibit shorter-lived interactions, as they typically did not maintain cell-cell contacts for more than 20 min after colliding with neighboring cells (See No.1 cell in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>, bottom panels, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>).

We, therefore, hypothesize that cell-cell adhesion mediated by N-cadherin is one of the key factors for the formation of the meshwork structure. Unfortunately, for technical reasons, it was difficult to introduce N-Cad-M into all mesoderm cells to see if tissues composed only of N-Cad-M cells fail to form a meshwork structure. Therefore, we next tested our hypothesis by developing an agent-based theoretical model.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Theoretical model to investigate the formation of meshwork structure</title><p>From the experiment using the mutant form of N-cadherin, we hypothesized that the cell-cell adhesion is one of the key factors for the meshwork structure formation. To understand how the dynamic meshwork structure of mesoderm cells emerges and how it is influenced by the cellular and intercellular properties, we develop an agent-based theoretical model. To this end, we modeled a cell by a rod-shape particle that interacts with others by short-range attraction with a repulsive core (Materials and methods). To focus on the essential aspect of the meshwork formation without complication, we will consider a model in two-dimensional space. We note that previous theoretical studies reported that elongated cells with attractive interaction can reproduce the formation of angiogenetic network structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Palm and Merks, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Szabo et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>To start with, we studied the steady-state spatial distribution of agents, starting from the initial state where the agents were randomly positioned in space with random orientation.

Most of the aggregates have an elongated shape with an aspect ratio much greater than one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> left, color). Inside the aggregates, the agents tend to align their direction of the shape elongation. Such a directional order is called nematic order. The direction of the nematic order in each aggregate is correlated with that of the aggregate elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> left and the red curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> right), indicating that the aggregates tend to elongate in the direction of the nematic order. When the agent density increases beyond a threshold value, a meshwork structure is formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf36"><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.6</mml:mn></mml:math><tex-math id="inft36">\begin{document}$\rho =0.6$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>). Thus, a scenario for the formation of the meshwork structure is as follows. The attractive interaction between agents induces the formation of aggregates, in which the agents align their orientation nematically. The positional and directional fluctuations of the agents deform the shape of aggregates in a way that they elongate in the direction of the nematic order. As the agent density increases, such elongated aggregates further extend and are eventually connected to each other, leading to the formation of the meshwork structure due to the randomness of the aggregate elongation direction.

To mimic this situation, we modified the simulation condition to the case where the agents are supplied constantly at the rate from one side of the boundary, which corresponds to the primitive streak (Materials and methods). We also switched on the self-propulsion of the agents in the direction of the shape elongation and introduced a slight chemotaxis so that the agents move efficiently away from the primitive streak boundary (PS boundary).

To answer this question, we performed a persistent homology analysis using the horizontal slice images at different developmental stages. Interestingly, we found that as the developmental stage proceeds, the size of holes decreases and eventually the space was filled by cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, top). The corresponding PDs showed that the points of birth-death pair with large persistence were distributed in a hole branch around death level ~0 at HH3+. However, as the developmental stage proceeded to HH4+, the hole branch shrank, and the distribution of the points was eventually changed to a clumped pattern near the diagonal line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, bottom). The average radius of holes was reduced from about 8 μm at HH3 + to 5 μm at HH4+, which took about 6 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Note that the average radius of the holes at HH3 + becomes 15 μm when we focused on the larger holes by setting the threshold birth level to the same as that for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3C</xref> (see also Materials and methods). Thus, while the size of holes is maintained for about half an hour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), it gradually decreases over several hours. From the simulation results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, we speculated that the supply rate of mesoderm cell from the primitive streak increases gradually as the developmental stage proceeds. Therefore, we performed a simulation with a time-dependent supply rate of the agent from the PS boundary (Materials and methods). We found that the size of the holes was initially large, but gradually decreased with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The radius of holes obtained from the PDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> bottom) decreases as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), although the hole sizes and the number of cells surrounding the holes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>, left y-axis) in the simulation were slightly larger than those of the experiment. This quantitative difference might come from the fact that the shape of the cells in the simulation is kept constant, while the shape of the real mesoderm cells changes dynamically. From these results, one possible reason for the decrease in the hole size as the developmental stage of the embryo proceeds could be a potential increase in the appearance rate of mesoderm cells at the primitive streak.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Changes in the meshwork structure during development.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Spatial distribution of the cells in the mesoderm tissue stained for nuclei (cyan) and N-cadherin (white) at different developmental stages (top) and the corresponding persistence diagrams (PD) (bottom).

In the early gastrulation stage of chick embryos, the fate of the various cell populations in the mesoderm has been studied in detail and it is known to be determined by the final migration destination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Psychoyos and Stern, 1996</xref>). However, it was not well understood whether the mesoderm cells move collectively without scattering toward their destination. In addition, the mesoderm cells were thought to be densely packed without any spatial structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Psychoyos and Stern, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2002</xref>). In this study, we investigated these points quantitatively by the 3D time lapse imaging and the horizontal thin optical sectioning of the mesoderm region in fixed whole mount embryos applying tissue-clearing method. From the analysis of the multicellular tracking data, we confirmed that the cells emerging from the primitive streak migrate collectively with the characteristic decay length of about 60 μm. The cell trajectories we analyzed are presumed to be almost entirely mesodermal, although a small fraction of definitive-endoderm cells may be included near the rostral part of the primitive streak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Psychoyos and Stern, 1996</xref>). From the horizontal thin sections, we found that the cells in the mesoderm region form a meshwork structure. The diameter of the holes is about 30 μm, which is almost comparable to the characteristic decay length of the collective migration. From these results, we presume that this meshwork structure is relevant to the collective migration of the cells in the mesoderm region. Since only little extracellular matrix exists in the mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Van Hoof et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sanders, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sanders, 1979</xref>), the formation of meshwork structure should be based on the intercellular adhesion. In fact, the disruption of the extracellular domain using a mutant form of N-cadherin lead the exclusion tendency of the mutant cells from the meshwork of the control cells. Moreover, although the migration speed along trajectory is unaltered, the directionality of individual cell migration, the tissue progression speed, and the stability of the direction of collective motion were reduced for the mutant cells compared to the control cells. These results suggest that the cell-cell adhesion coordinates the migration of the mesoderm cells. To summarize, we conclude that the cell-cell adhesion plays a fundamental role in the meshwork formation for the mesoderm cells to migrate collectively. Such collective motion could contribute to the robust formation of cell migration pattern in response to guidance signals such as chemoattractant and chemorepellent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2002</xref>). Since the introduced deletion mutant of N-cadherin lacks the extracellular domain that is responsible for cell-cell adhesion activity, it is expected that the cells expressing the mutant N-cadherin have reduced cell-cell adhesion. However, the mutant N-cadherin may also affect other processes such as cell motility and signaling, which requires further investigations.</p><p>Extracting information about the organization and arrangement of cells in tissues from microscopy images and comparing them with mutants has been largely based on visual inspection. Moreover, their quantitative and objective characterization is often challenging because of their variability and lack of periodicity. To obtain the information of the holes of the meshwork structure in the mesoderm tissues, such as their size and position objectively and automatically, we used persistent homology, a tool of topological data analysis (TDA). TDA is a recently growing unique methodology, and it provides geometric information of the complex data, which has been employed in physical, medical, and biological research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hiraoka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lawson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McGuirl et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Topaz et al., 2015</xref>). We used this method to extract the information of the dynamics of the meshwork structure, which is still a challenging task in TDA. By applying the same analysis method to the simulation result, we compared it with the experiment quantitatively and we successfully showed that the theoretical model captures the essential aspect of the meshwork formation observed experimentally.</p><p>The in vivo collective migrations of mesenchymal cells have been reported for the neural crest cells in frog and chick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Szabó and Mayor, 2018</xref>). These neural crest cells migrate on a two-dimensional surface within a confined space with a physical barrier of neighboring tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Szabó and Mayor, 2018</xref>). Contact attraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hayakawa et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2019</xref>) and contact inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carmona-Fontaine et al., 2008</xref>) orient the cell motion to induce the collective cell migration, such as chain migration and stream formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Szabó et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, mesoderm cells at the early gastrulation stage migrate in the three-dimensional space between the epiblast and endoderm without physical barrier in the lateral direction. Almost all cells were attached to other cells. Upon collision, the mesoderm cells stay in contact for more than a few tens of minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, contrary to the neural crest cells, the mesoderm cells did not show contact inhibition of locomotion, which is consistent with the case of the mouse mesoderm cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Saykali et al., 2019</xref>). In situations where cells exploit other cells as scaffolds and the cell density is low, we speculate that forming a meshwork rather than a three-dimensional mass would be more efficient to extend the distance.</p><p>In the nascent mesoderm tissue of chick embryo, matured ECM is almost absent in the intermediate layer where cells are in contact with other cells but not with the epiblast or endoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Van Hoof et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sanders, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sanders, 1979</xref>). How cells in the intermediate layer can generate traction force for the movement is an intriguing future question. Mesoderm cells on the basal lamina of either epiblast or endoderm can generate traction force to migrate. By adhering to these cells, it may be possible that the mesoderm cells in the intermediate layer move forward together in a passive manner. In addition to such passive movement, the intermediate cells might generate active force at the intercellular contacts, by which they migrate further. Another possibility for the active process of the cell motility is the treadmilling of intercellular junction, which has been implicated in the migration of adhering cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Peglion et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>During the vasculogenesis, endothelial cells also form a meshwork structure with cords of cells that surround the regions void of cells. In this case, cell aggregates formed initially are connected to organize into a primitive vascular plexus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Risau and Flamme, 1995</xref>). The cell motions appear to be random along the cords (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sato et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, the meshwork structure we observed is formed by the mesoderm cells which are provided from the primitive streak without the formation of cords of cells and a different lineage than the cells that contribute to the vasculogenesis. Moreover, the mesoderm cell motion is biased to the anterior-lateral direction. Thus, although there are some similarities in the 2D horizontal section patterns, the 3D structures are different between these two cases.</p><p>During the development of enteric nervous system, enteric neural crest cells (ENCCs) migrating in the mesenchyme also form a meshwork structure within a narrow 2-dimensional layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Newgreen et al., 2013</xref>). ENCCs migrate in chains and the cells immediately behind the preceding chains often follow the same path (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Young et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, the network created by the preceding cells often remained intact for many hours. This constant shape of the network contrasts with the dynamic properties of the meshwork structure formed by the mesodermal cells in the chick embryo.</p><p>To understand how the meshwork forms, we developed a theoretical model that demonstrated that the elongated shape of agents and the attractive interaction between them are the key factors for the formation of meshwork. While a previous study reported that the branches of a meshwork structure showed nematic order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Palm and Merks, 2013</xref>), it was not clear how a meshwork structure emerges as the density increases. We showed quantitatively that clusters composed of agents deforms in the direction of the nematic order of the agent elongation. As the density increases, the elongated clusters grow and finally fuse with each other to form a meshwork structure. Although the agents in the current model do not deform their shape, actual mesoderm cells do, which enables them to migrate. Presumably, the shape deformation may play an important role for the 3D meshwork structure formation where the intermediate cells have no scaffold to migrate other than other cells, like the one that we found in the mesoderm of chick embryo. It is thus a future work to investigate how the shape deformation of the agents contributes to the 3D meshwork structure formation.</p><p>Our data and theoretical model suggest that cell elongation and cell-cell adhesion actively stabilize the meshwork. There may still be a possibility that a spinodal-like instability driven by N-cadherin-mediated adhesion. If it exists, anisotropic cell shape would act on top of the instability process. Future work will be required to determine whether such an instability exists in the meshwork formation of chick mesoderm.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

To this end, we performed persistent homology analysis by using the software named HomCloud (3.0.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Obayashi et al., 2018</xref>). We first prepared a black and white binary pixel image from the original image by thresholding, where the pixels occupied by cells are white. The binary image was then used as an input data for HomCloud. Each topological structure is characterized by a pair of two values called birth and death levels based on the Manhattan distance from the interface between white and black pixels. Thus, birth and death levels are given in the unit of pixels. These two quantities basically represent the size of the identified topological structures and the distance between two topological structures, respectively. The birth and death levels are usually called birth and death times, respectively, in the persistent homology field. In this paper, to avoid confusion we use the term ‘level’ instead of ‘time.’ In HomCloud, the identified topological structures are visualized in persistence diagram (PD), which plots each pair of birth and death levels. Since holes are identified by the 0th persistent homology, we focused on 0th PDs, i.e., the PDs for the 0th persistent homology. Each birth-death pair characterizes a black region in the binary image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Obayashi et al., 2018</xref>). The difference between the death and birth levels is called persistence, which is often referred to as lifetime in the field of persistent homology. The topological structures with small persistence are basically noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Obayashi et al., 2018</xref>). Although in the original PD the points correspond to actual holes appear in the region with birth level &lt;0 and death level &gt;0, the death level of most holes in the experimental image becomes slightly smaller than 0 due to fluctuations possibly caused by several factors, including those in staining and fluorescent imaging. By taking this into consideration, we identified the points with a birth level smaller than –10 μm and a death level larger than –2.5 μm as detected holes, except for the those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> where the threshold is set as the birth level smaller than –5 μm and the death level larger than –2.5 μm because there was no hole satisfying the above stricter threshold for the later stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6Ac</xref> and 6Ad). Since the magnitude of birth level corresponds to the shortest distance from the center to the periphery of a hole, we regarded this multiplied by the length of a pixel as the radius of the hole. The number of cells that surround each single hole was calculated from the perimeter length by assuming that a cell diameter is 10 μm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Analyzing the dynamics of holes</title><p>To visualize the spatiotemporal dynamic of holes, we first carried out the inverse analysis by HomCloud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Obayashi et al., 2018</xref>) for a total of 13 images at 2 min intervals out of the live imaging of 24 min and saved them as a series of images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref> bottom). From this 2D image sequence, we constructed a z-stack image using the 3D image reconstruction function of IMARIS by setting the z-interval at 5 μm. Each hole was visualized by the <italic>‘surface</italic>’ function in IMARIS.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Nicoletta Petridou (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) The authors argue that their agent-based model is used to investigate how the meshwork arises and how it contributes to cell movement. This is not supported by the data. The authors can tone down their claims throughout the manuscript, or provide further support as suggested by the reviewers. Specifically (not all suggestions must be followed, but claims must be supported by data):</p><p>a. Analyze how the network structure affects the collective migration of cells (Reviewer #2, point #1).</p><p>b. Verify the model prediction regarding the increased rate of mesoderm cells at the primitive streak with a current experimental framework (Reviewer #1).</p><p>c. Is the cell's aspect ratio an essential factor for network formation? Reviewer #2 proposes to perform simulations with higher attraction values. (Reviewer #2, point #6)</p><p>d. Milder perturbations (e.g., less concentration of N-cad-M so the cells do not lose adhesion completely) or the combination with complementary approaches (e.g., use of blebbistatin, ROCK inhibitor, etc) to understand the contribution of shape, cell-cell adhesion, and density to meshwork formation (Reviewer #3 – point #3)</p><p>2) Several clarifications and further quantitative support are required regarding the interpretation of the experimental data. Again, the authors can choose to remove unsupported claims or clarify and provide better support.</p><p>a. The argument that mutated cells are excluded from the meshwork is not supported by Figure 4C-D and should be properly quantified (Reviewer #1, Reviewer #2 – point #2).</p><p>b. Figure 4J should include the data of all five embryos and the statistical test should take them into consideration (Reviewer #2 – point #4). It is not clear what statistical tests are used throughout the manuscript (e.g., 3/5 embryos usually lead to a p-value &gt; 0.08).</p><p>c. There is insufficient data to draw conclusions on the dynamics of the mutant-control cell-cell interactions, this can be resolved with more extensive analysis (Reviewer #2 – point #5).</p><p>d. The authors claim that mutated cells are more rounded. This should be quantified (Reviewer #1, Reviewer #2 – point #3)</p><p>3) Depleting the intracellular domain of N-cadherin can have effects on intracellular signaling that can lead to changes in cell migration and morphology (cell rounding, de-attachment) which is very much expected to affect the network structure. This is quite a harsh experiment to conclude how N-cadherin contributes to the meshwork, since many parameters change at the same time, and thus these experiments alone do offer much understanding of how the meshwork is formed and functions. In general, the manuscript would benefit a lot from more targeted experiments on either adhesion/shape (different N-cadherin mutants or combinations with other manipulations), and specifically, Reviewer #3 proposes a control experiment of overexpressing N-cad lacking the intracellular domain (Reviewer #3 – point #2). Another possibility is tuning down relevant claims and addressing these issues in the Discussion.</p><p>4) Experimental confirmation that the cells being labeled by electroporation (Figure 1) are indeed (mostly) mesodermal and that the meshwork structure is only present in the mesoderm (Figure 2). Reviewer #3 proposes immunostaining or HCR with a mesodermal marker (Reviewer #3 – point #1).</p><p>5) The description of the topological data analysis should be elaborated and self-contained. This point was raised by all reviewers. Specifically:</p><p>a. Persistent homology analysis: the technical terminology that is inconsistent with the context and very hard to follow. A minimal explanation of the terminology, namely of what is meant by birth-, death rates, and lifetimes, how/why they relate to particular structural properties, and how one should understand the persistence diagrams must be included briefly in the Results and extensively in the Methods section. As a recommendation, Reviewer #2 suggests translating the terminology to be consistent with the context of spatial data (instead of using quantities with temporal terminology).</p><p>b. Illustration and a better description of agent-based simulations. The authors should explain how they solved their equations and why they chose a particular potential energy and their set of parameters (Reviewer #2).</p><p>6) Regarding the theoretical model, it is not clear to me if the size ratio of hole vs. particles/agents is comparable to the ratio measured experimentally. It seems that in the microscopy images, there are clearly fewer cells surrounding one hole than agents around a hole in the model. A brief quantitative description/analysis would be beneficial to clarify this (Reviewer #3 – point #4).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Nakaya et al. investigate the cellular mechanisms underlying mesoderm cell migration in chick embryos. Through the use of live and fixed high-resolution imaging and so-called topological data analysis (TDA), they uncover the existence of a dynamic, cell-cell adhesion-dependent meshwork pattern in the mesoderm. By tracking wildtype vs. dominant negative N-cadherin expressing cells, they uncover a dependency of directed collective cell migration but not individual cell migration on cell-cell adhesions. Combining experimental observations with theoretical modeling, the authors demonstrate that elongated shape, attractive interaction, and specific cell densities can sufficiently explain the formation of dynamic meshworks during mesoderm formation.</p><p>The key findings in this work are compelling and the integration of theoretical modeling to ask questions that are not experimentally tractable is well-done, done, and well-integrated with experiments. While the author's claims and conclusions are largely justified by their data, a few key observations in the imaging data are described only anecdotally and could be better characterized. Clarifications of some of the methods and motivations would also strengthen the work.</p><p>The authors apply topological data analysis (TDA), which is an innovative approach to quantifying tissue topology and provides clear quantitative measures for holes within the meshwork. I appreciate the value of this approach and its application both to experimental and modeling data. However, the authors did not explain this method adequately, and visualization of the results could be improved for clarity.</p><p>The use of theoretical modeling and its juxtaposition to experimental data to explain the formation of the meshwork through adhesions, cell shape, and density alone is very strong and compelling, and the data align well with the theoretical model. Since there are numerical predictions that come out of the theoretical models, there are some potential opportunities for experimental measurements that are missed. In fact, while certain elements are quantified very well, some key elements of the model are demonstrated only anecdotal and glossed over – cell shape (shown in supplemental Figure 5 but should be shown earlier), exclusion of dom. Neg. cadherin cells from holes, and time of contact. It would have strengthened the work to better characterize these key observations.</p><p>The experiments and modeling of the change in the meshwork structure over time in Figure 6 are compelling. The model predicts an increased rate of appearance of mesoderm cells at the primitive streak. The authors have the opportunity to make an experimental observation of this using their current experimental framework.</p><p>Overall, the methods described in this work are likely to have a broad impact in the field of developmental biology in terms of quantitative analysis of imaging data, and a well-designed combination of modeling and experimental results. The biological insights of this work in terms of how the developing mesoderm migrates as a meshwork will likely also open the door for the discovery of such modes of collective migration in other developmental systems.</p><p>The use of the classic chick model is not adequately presented. The authors should elaborate in the introduction on the advantages and limitations of the chick model, and how this model has been used historically for such cell migration assays, and how it compares to other experimental models.</p><p>Figure 1 does not strongly contribute to the narrative- the anterior/middle/posterior aspect of the mesoderm is not mentioned again, and sometimes taken into consideration and sometimes ignored, even within figure 1. In this reviewer's view, All information in Figure 1 is already contained in Figure 4 in direct contrast to the dom. Neg. cadherin cells, illustrating the desired points much more clearly. Figure 1 panels are also out of order and not referenced in order in the main text, making reading confusing.</p><p>For all electroporation experiments- how do the authors know that they are observing mostly mesodermal cells? Are there markers the authors could use to demonstrate this?</p><p>Line 135: &quot;The directionality of trajectories was smaller than unity&quot;- what does that mean?</p><p>For PD diagrams- for clarity, could the authors create a threshold that indicates a hole and pseudocolor data points in that color?</p><p>The authors' claim that the length scale of collective migration is similar to the diameter of the hole is not substantiated.</p><p>Clearer control examples of N and p-cadherin endogenous stainings would be useful.</p><p>Figure 3: measurements i 3D are not very informative, but if the authors can measure the directionality of the meshwork and how it changes over time (all the inverse xy area for example), or come up with other measures that could indicate dynamics of the network, that would add value.</p><p>Last sentence of page 15: &quot;Since the length scales of the polar order of the collective migration and the size of the holes of the meshwork are comparable, we speculate that the frequent rearrangement of the cell-cell contact is a reason why the collective order of the mesoderm cells decays in the long length scale.&quot; This reviewer did not follow the logic. If collective order was similar in cells that are near each other if they are constantly rearranging why would that explain this phenomenon?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors provide a detailed experimental and computational investigation of the collective migration of chick mesoderm cells during early gastrulation. Using live imaging and quantitative analysis they characterize the motility of individual cells as they migrate from the primitive streak. From measurements of individual cell directionality, MSD, and cell-speed autocorrelation function they conclude that individual cells migrate in a directed manner but their motion fluctuates in three dimensions and generally appears as a biased random walk. Quantifications of a motility order parameter and measurements of MSRD revealed that the motility of neighboring cells is correlated within a radius of a few tens of microns. Consistent with these findings they also discover that during cell migration a 3D meshwork is formed in between the epiblast and the endoderm. Using persistent homology analysis they characterize the meshwork structure and its dynamics. They find that the meshwork holes are tens of microns in size, consistent with the length scale found in the migration analysis. To investigate the role of cell-cell adhesion in this process they overexpressed an N-cadherin mutant in the mesoderm cells and analyzed cell motility and network formation. Mutated cells were less persistent, the tissue progression speed was lower and their directional coordination was weaker. They, therefore, conclude that cell-cell adhesion is important for the coordinated movement of the cells. To investigate how the meshwork is formed they developed agent-based stochastic simulations of rod-shaped cells interacting via short-range attraction and core repulsion. The simulations showed that meshwork structures form with strong inter-cell attraction and that a threshold cell aspect ratio is required to form the meshwork. In addition, for the networks to form, cell density needed to be sufficiently low since otherwise, they would fill the space with no holes, as they find in later stages of development. The work presented in this manuscript is comprehensive and interesting but I nevertheless have a few important comments.</p><p>Strengths: The work provides a detailed characterization of the individual and collective motility of mesoderm cells during gastrulation. The authors discover a novel structure that is formed in the process and present computer simulations that reproduce the structures formed and suggest key factors that may drive and influence their formation.</p><p>Weaknesses: Major one: The authors present their analysis of the network structure using persistent homology analysis and use technical terminology that is inconsistent with the context; they describe the structural properties of the meshwork in terms of birth-, death rates, and lifetimes. This makes it very hard to understand their findings. The authors should translate the expressions to the current context, namely use expressions that have concrete structural rather than temporal meaning, and explain in more detail how the points in the persistent diagrams relate to the structural properties of the network.</p><p>1. The authors should consider examining their network structure using more direct metrics as done in the analysis of fluid phase transitions in the references mentioned above.</p><p>2. The authors could use the simulations described in the section &quot;Dynamic meshwork formation with the supply of agents&quot; to also measure the motility characteristics of the cells in these simulations. This might shed light on how the network structure affects the collective motility of the cells.</p><p>Other comments:</p><p>1. Abstract line 30-31: The authors say: &quot;To investigate how this meshwork arise and how it contributes to the cell movement we utilized an agent-based theoretical model …&quot;. While the authors could use their simulations to explicitly analyze how the network structure affects the collective migration of cells, in the current version of the manuscript this is not done.</p><p>2. Line 308 and caption of Figure 4: It isn't clear why the authors say that mutated cells are excluded from the meshwork. They do appear to line a hole. It isn't clear that the images in 4C and 4D shed light on the propensity of the mutated cells to form a network.</p><p>3. Line 309-311, 356-358, and 388: Based on 4C and 4D, the authors reach the conclusion that mutated cells are more rounded. This is hard to tell and needs to be quantified.</p><p>4. Line 330-334: The graph in 4J should include the data on the two embryos that did not show the effect on Phi(t) and only then the p-value needs to be calculated. It currently is not compelling that there is an effect on the polar order parameter.</p><p>5. Line 342-352: The few shown images in Figure 4 supplement 2 are insufficient to draw conclusions on the dynamics of the cell-cell interactions between the mutated and control cells; this requires more extensive analysis.</p><p>6. The simulations results appear to resemble a one-component spinodal decomposition of unstable fluids where condensation occurs globally throughout the system (for relevance in biological systems see reviews by Cats and Tailleur, Annu. Rev. Condens. Matter Phys. 2015. 6:219-44 and Joel Berry et al. 2018 Rep. Prog. Phys. 81 046601) It is driven by the attractive van der Waals interactions between particles and does not require them to be anisotropic; for a 2D simulation with Lennard- Jones potential see for instance, Koch et al., Phys Rev A, 1983. I.e., simpler simulations of round particles in attractive interaction (Lennard Jones potential) reveal similar structures in a so-called spinodal decomposition process. Moreover, in the experiments, the cells appear to be quite round. The aspect ratio is close to 1. It is therefore not clear that the rather small cells' aspect ratio is indeed an essential factor for network formation. The authors show in Figure 5C that for a specific choice of cell density and interaction strength, the aspect ratio is important for network formation. I suggest testing stronger attraction strengths (would it not phase separate?) and lower densities.</p><p>7. The description of the topological structure analysis in the methods section needs to be self-contained and not be based on the readers' knowledge of the original reference by Obayashi 2018. In addition, as mentioned above, the terminology should also be modified and adapted to the current context of the manuscript and more detailed explanations should be given on how to understand the persistence diagrams (which are a major tool used in the manuscript).</p><p>8. Theoretical model section: It would be useful if the authors included an illustration of how their agents and their interaction potential look like. They should add a few sentences explaining how Eq. 1 (and/or 8) was solved, and a few sentences motivating the choice of parameters and of the interaction potential.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In their manuscript, Nakaya et al. investigate the migration of mesoderm cells in the gastrulating chick embryo to understand how they coordinate as a collective despite the lack of tight confinement and lasting cell contacts. By means of confocal imaging and thorough quantitative analyses for cell tracking, they show that, while individual mesoderm cell motion displays some randomness, the cells move collectively toward the anterior-lateral or lateral direction. Moreover, the mesoderm forms a dynamic 3D meshwork structure, which the authors characterise applying persistent homology analysis. Immunostainings and a knockdown assay hint towards a role of N-cadherin-based cell adhesion in controlling collective cell migration and meshwork structure. Furthermore, Nakaya et al. develop an agent-based theoretical model to recapitulate the experimental observations and test additional parameters, such as cell-cell adhesion, cell elongation, and cell density. This model confirms the importance of adhesion for meshwork formation and supports cell shape and density as further parameters influencing it.</p><p>One major strength of this work is the detailed analysis of cellular motion, providing a compelling characterisation of mesoderm cell migration. Moreover, the theoretical model notably complements the experimental observations, while also adding to them. It provides further parameters influencing meshwork formation that could be tested experimentally in the future. Generally, the analysis methods employed in this manuscript constitute a good basis for future work on similar structures and processes. A point of improvement for this study is to understand the differential contribution of N-cadherin in cell adhesion, elongation, and density and through which of these parameters it influences meshwork formation.</p><p>All in all, the authors describe a novel mode of collective cell migration of the mesenchymal cells forming the chick mesoderm. This work also contributes to our understanding of cell migration in environments that are not physically restricted and highlights the importance of keeping tissue structure in mind when investigating cellular behaviour. In addition, the methods employed for analysis may be of interest to an audience beyond the field of developmental biology.</p><p>Here, I provide some suggestions for experiments that could contribute to strengthening the author's claims, as well as some considerations that in my opinion should be taken into account when coming to conclusions about the experiments:</p><p>1. Experiments to confirm that the cells being labelled by electroporation (Figure 1) are indeed (mostly) mesodermal, especially since the authors also suggest other cells may have been labelled, but do not quantify this (&quot;there might have been a few endodermal and epiblast cells&quot;, p. 7). This could be done e.g. by immunostaining or HCR with a mesodermal marker. Similarly, in Figure 2, labelling of the epiblast/mesoderm/endoderm via immunostaining or HCR would show in a convincing way that the meshwork structure is only present in the mesoderm.</p><p>2. In Figure 4, the authors conclude that intercellular adhesion controls collective mesoderm cell migration based on the effects of overexpression of N-cad-M (lacking the extracellular domain). However, this experimental setup does not take into account that overexpressing the intracellular domain of N-cadherin can have effects on intracellular signalling. Changes in signalling could also account for changes in cell migration, instead of or in addition to the effect of cell adhesion and the associated outcomes of cell elongation. A control experiment would be to overexpress N-cad that lacks the intracellular domain instead and compare the effects between the two manipulations.</p><p>3. The theoretical model predicts that shape, cell-cell adhesion, and density contribute to meshwork formation. The authors test these predictions via the N-cad loss of function experiments, where cells naturally round up since they lose cell-cell adhesion to their neighbours. This experimental approach makes it hard to evaluate which of the model parameters are indeed physiologically relevant in vivo. I understand that finding experimental strategies that influence more than one parameter over the other is difficult, however more mild approaches (e.g. less concentration of N-cad-M so the cells do not lose adhesion completely) or the combination with complementary approaches (e.g. use of blebbistatin, ROCK inhibitor, etc) may help understand more the cellular basis of the meshwork formation.</p><p>4. Regarding the theoretical model, it is not clear to me if the size ratio of hole vs. particles/agents is comparable to the ratio measured experimentally. It seems that in the microscopy images, there are clearly fewer cells surrounding one hole than agents around a hole in the model. A brief quantitative description/analysis would be beneficial to clarify this.</p><p>5. An additional point regarding the theoretical model is if the emergence of the nematic order is also observed in the experimental data, and how this is disrupted in N-cad loss of function.</p><p>6. Overall, the manuscript is clearly written, with only some minor typos (&quot;chamotaxis&quot; in Table S6, &quot;transvers&quot; in Figure 2 S1A). Additionally, the sentence &quot;… five embryos, each of which contains a lot of cells&quot; (p. 18) could be rephrased to be more specific regarding the approximate number of cells.</p><p>7. The figures are clear and well-structured, with some sketches greatly contributing to the understanding of the experimental setups and imaging regions. However, in some cases, displaying the fluorescent images in different colours could make them clearer (e.g. green and cyan together do not provide much contrast; green and red in the same image is not accessible to people with red-green colour blindness, as in Figure 3, Figure 3 S1, Figure 4, Figure 4 S2). Additionally, in Figure 1C it may be helpful to clarify that the dot marks the initial position of the cells (as is done in Figure 4E). In Figure 4, Figure 4 S1 and S2, as well as in the main text, more consistency in the naming of the mutant N-cadherin construct would add cohesion to the work (&quot;N-Cad M&quot;, &quot;Ncad DN&quot;, &quot;N-cad mutant&quot;, &quot;N-cad-M&quot;, &quot;N-Cad-M&quot;).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Migrating mesoderm cells self-organize into a dynamic meshwork structure during chick gastrulation&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Indeed, as mentioned in my previous report, the network structures found in their experiments resemble the patterns formed with unstable fluids undergoing a one-component spinodal decomposition. This process is driven by the attractive van der Waals interactions between particles and does not require them to be anisotropic in shape. See references in my previous report.

In response to the comments, we have adjusted the expression to weaken the claim.

However, there is a critical aspect ratio below which the size of voids becomes very small even in the percolation regime. The percolation is promoted when the attractive interaction is introduced, but for a very high attraction the critical density for percolation becomes large again (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>).

Milder perturbations (e.g., less concentration of N-cad-M so the cells do not lose adhesion completely) or the combination with complementary approaches (e.g., use of blebbistatin, ROCK inhibitor, etc) to understand the contribution of shape, cell-cell adhesion, and density to meshwork formation (Reviewer #3 – point #3)</p></disp-quote><p>We recognize the importance of conducting experiments to quantitatively assess the effects of disrupting cell-cell adhesion on the meshwork formation, such as low concentration of N-Cad-M. However, we would like to draw your attention to some of the practical challenges we face in carrying out the suggested experiment. Despite our best efforts, the experimental success rate of introducing plasmids into a sufficient number of cells has been low, making it challenging to generate a robust dataset for quantitative evaluation. Given the inherent complexities, conducting a substantial number of experiments to achieve statistical significance appears to be impractical within the constraints of our current resources. This difficulty was one reason why we developed a theoretical model and performed simulations. Therefore, we concluded that the quantitative experimental approaches to better understand the cellular basis of the meshwork formation remain to be a future issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Several clarifications and further quantitative support are required regarding the interpretation of the experimental data. Again, the authors can choose to remove unsupported claims or clarify and provide better support.</p><p>a. The argument that mutated cells are excluded from the meshwork is not supported by Figure 4C-D and should be properly quantified (Reviewer #1, Reviewer #2 – point #2).</p></disp-quote><p>Visual inspection suggested a tendency for cells expressing N-Cad-M to be excluded from the meshwork. However, it was challenging to quantitatively define the holes that constitute the meshwork. Without clear definition of these holes, quantitatively assessing the exclusion of cells proved difficult. To address this, we employed persistent homology, which allows for quantitative characterization of the meshwork. Although the use of persistent homology was considered appropriate, the low proportion of cells expressing N-Cad-M limited the robustness of quantification. Therefore, we decided to soften the statement as indicated in the revised manuscript as “Indeed, the cells expressing N-CadM tended to be somewhat excluded from the meshwork of the control cells (Figure 4D).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Figure 4J should include the data of all five embryos and the statistical test should take them into consideration (Reviewer #2 – point #4). It is not clear what statistical tests are used throughout the manuscript (e.g., 3/5 embryos usually lead to a p-value &gt; 0.08).</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we clearly indicate that the difference in the polar order parameter between control and mutated cells is NOT statistically significant. The statistical tests we used in this manuscript is indicated in the figure legends. For Figure 4J (Figure 4F-K), paired t-test was used to compare the average values obtained from five embryos. The obtained p-values were indicated in individual graphs (Figure 4F-K). The p-value for Figure 4J was 0.081, which indicated that the difference was not statistically significant.</p><p>In Figure 4 figure supplement 1 D, the temporal average of the polar order parameter in the areas of 125μm x 125μm were indicated for control and mutated cells.

There is insufficient data to draw conclusions on the dynamics of the mutant-control cell-cell interactions, this can be resolved with more extensive analysis (Reviewer #2 – point #5).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concern that the data shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 2 may be insufficient to conclusively characterize the dynamics of cell-cell interactions between control and mutant cells. We acknowledge that a more extensive quantitative analysis would be necessary to rigorously establish differences in intercellular contact behavior.</p><p>Given our limitations in image acquisition, we have modified the main text to clarify that these observations are qualitative and speculative rather than conclusive. Specifically, we now state that the time-lapse images suggest that mutant cells exhibit reduced contact duration, which may contribute to their more randomized movement. However, we note that a more comprehensive dataset would be required to statistically validate this trend.</p><p>We appreciate this feedback, as it has helped us refine the presentation of our findings and ensure that our claims are appropriately framed.</p><p>Here is the revised version mentioning these results in the main text:</p><p>“To explore potential differences in intercellular contact dynamics between control and mutant cells, we carefully examined time-lapse images. Qualitative observations suggest that control cells tend to elongate their bodies and establish prolonged cell-cell contacts via protrusions (Figure 4—figure supplement 3). These cells remained in contact for several tens of minutes, with the longest contact duration exceeding one hour (No.1 and No.2 pair in Figure 4—figure supplement 3, upper panels, Video 6). In contrast, mutant cells appeared to exhibit shorter-lived interactions, as they typically did not maintain cellcell contacts for more than 20 minutes after colliding with neighboring cells (See No.1 cell in Figure 4—figure supplement 3, bottom panels, Video 6). While these observations suggest that reduced contact duration may contribute to more randomized movement of mutant cells, leading to frequent changes in the direction of collective migration, a more extensive quantitative analysis would be necessary to confirm this trend.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d. The authors claim that mutated cells are more rounded. This should be quantified (Reviewer #1, Reviewer #2 – point #3)</p></disp-quote><p>We quantified the cell aspect ratio in Figure 4 figure supplement 1. We mentioned this point in the main text (line 429-431). According to the quantification, “the aspect ratio of mesoderm cells was 2.34 ± 0.08 (± SEM) (Figure 4 figure supplement 1, control), while that of the N-cadherin mutant cells was 1.91 ± 0.08 (± SEM) (Figure 4 figure supplement 1, N-Cad-M).”</p><p>Before this quantification, we also mentioned in the main text that the mutated cells were more rounded (line 338-340, 384-386, 416-418). We have toned down the assertion that the mutated cells are more rounded in shape and have referenced the figure for quantification (Figure 4 figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Depleting the intracellular domain of N-cadherin can have effects on intracellular signaling that can lead to changes in cell migration and morphology (cell rounding, de-attachment) which is very much expected to affect the network structure. This is quite a harsh experiment to conclude how N-cadherin contributes to the meshwork, since many parameters change at the same time, and thus these experiments alone do offer much understanding of how the meshwork is formed and functions. In general, the manuscript would benefit a lot from more targeted experiments on either adhesion/shape (different N-cadherin mutants or combinations with other manipulations), and specifically, Reviewer #3 proposes a control experiment of overexpressing N-cad lacking the intracellular domain (Reviewer #3 – point #2). Another possibility is tuning down relevant claims and addressing these issues in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Since the deletion mutant of N-cadherin (N-Cad-M) lacks the extracellular domain that is responsible for cell-cell adhesion activity, it is expected that expression of N-Cad-M primarily decreases cell-cell adhesion. However, as pointed out by the reviewer, within the current data we cannot exclude the possibility that the introduction of N-Cad-M may affect other processes such as cell motility. Therefore, to mitigate the claim that “cell-cell adhesion” affects the collective cell migration, we modify the statement to suggest that N-Cad-M has an effect on the collective cell migration. In addition, potential effects of N-Cad-M on the collective cell migration other than cell-cell adhesion are discussed in the Discussion (line 552-557).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Experimental confirmation that the cells being labeled by electroporation (Figure 1) are indeed (mostly) mesodermal and that the meshwork structure is only present in the mesoderm (Figure 2). Reviewer #3 proposes immunostaining or HCR with a mesodermal marker (Reviewer #3 – point #1).</p></disp-quote><p>We looked at the expression of a typical mesoderm marker Brachury. The expression levels were quite variable (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref> showing the Brachury expression level at different z level). Even in the mesoderm region (B, horizontal section), some cells expressed it and others did not (D). It is also expressed in some cells in the epiblast (A horizontal and C transverse section). This may be due to the fact that the embryos we studied were at a relatively early stage (HH4). Therefore, we concluded that it is not possible to test whether cells expressing H2B-eGFP introduced by electroporation are mesoderm by co-expression of Brachury.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Brachury expression level at different z level of early chick embryo.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-84749-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Next, we fixed an embryo with H2B-eGFP introduced by electroporation after the timelapse imaging and stained it with DAPI and Phalloidin to determine the position where the cells expressing H2B-eGFP were located (Figure 1 figure supplement 1A). The transverse section of the embryos showed that almost all the cells expressing H2B-eGFP were in the region of mesoderm between the epiblast and the endoderm. Therefore, from this histological examination, almost all the cells were determined to be mesoderm.To avoid confusion, we removed the sentence mentioning the possibility of including epiblast and endoderm, and made the following correction: “Almost all of these 3D trajectories were of mesoderm cells (Figure 1 figure supplement 1A).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The description of the topological data analysis should be elaborated and self-contained. This point was raised by all reviewers. Specifically:</p><p>a. Persistent homology analysis: the technical terminology that is inconsistent with the context and very hard to follow. A minimal explanation of the terminology, namely of what is meant by birth-, death rates, and lifetimes, how/why they relate to particular structural properties, and how one should understand the persistence diagrams must be included briefly in the Results and extensively in the Methods section. As a recommendation, Reviewer #2 suggests translating the terminology to be consistent with the context of spatial data (instead of using quantities with temporal terminology).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for any confusion caused by not providing a clear explanation of the concept of persistent homology. In the revised manuscript, the method of persistent homology was concisely explained using the analogy of an image as a landscape. The terminology of persistent homology, such as birth and death times and lifetime, also caused confusion. We will replace the terms &quot;birth time”, “death time” and “lifetime” with “birth level”, “death level” and “persistence,” respectively.</p><p>Explanations of persistent homology added to the main text are as follows: “To analyze an image by persistent homology, we first prepare a black and white binary pixel image from the original image by thresholding, where the pixels occupied by cells are white. Such a binary image can be seen as a landscape with hills and valleys, where hills represent cluster of cells, and the valleys represent holes between them. We can assign height and depth (negative height) of hills and valleys, respectively, by considering the shortest distance (Manhattan distance) from the interface between white and black pixels. Now, we consider this landscape at different height. To uncover topological features, we apply progressive thresholding to the binary image from the minimum height (leading to completely white) to the maximum (leading to completely black) in a stepwise manner. At each threshold level, pixels below the threshold are black. As the threshold level incrementally changes, a feature, such as a hole which is a black area surrounded by a white area, emerges or “is born”. Such a threshold level is recorded as “birth level” of the feature. As the threshold level is increased further, the feature merges with another feature or “dies”. Such a threshold level is recorded as “death level” of the feature. Thus, the holes are characterized by the two quantities called birth and death levels, and they are visualized by points in persistence diagram (PD) where the coordinates are given by the birth and death levels (Figure 2F). These two quantities basically represent the size of the feature and the distance between two features, respectively. The difference between the death and the birth levels is called “persistence”, which becomes large for a reliable topological feature. Note that in the persistent homology on binary images, the birth and death levels, and thus the persistence, are measured in the unit of pixels.”</p><p>Persistent homology can filter out noise with small persistence while capturing topological features with large persistence, the method is robust with respect to noise. Thus, the persistent homology is a reliable tool for analyzing biological images with inherent noise. We were exploring methods to quantify meshwork structure from cell-tocell connections. However, due to the noisy nature of the images, automatically achieving this from the images was challenging. Meshwork structure is considered to be a structure that can only be identified by some kind of appropriate coarse-graining. Persistent homology provide a suitable approach for this purpose. We hope that the revise manuscript gives a better explanation of how persistent homology works to identify the characteristic structure that an image contains, and how it is robust against the noise.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Illustration and a better description of agent-based simulations. The authors should explain how they solved their equations and why they chose a particular potential energy and their set of parameters (Reviewer #2).</p></disp-quote><p>The equations of motion (Eq.1) were solve numerically using the Euler method, which is now indicated in the method section. The value of the attractive interaction is chosen to be an optimal value where percolation is most promoted (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). The cell width is used as the unit of length; stretching elasticity is set large enough so that the shape is kept almost constant; interaction length is set to half the cell width so that the cells interact only with the nearest neighbours; effective viscosity is set as that of water; temperature is set to room temperature. We also provide the schematics of the model and the potential and force profiles of the attractive interaction in Figure 5 figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Regarding the theoretical model, it is not clear to me if the size ratio of hole vs. particles/agents is comparable to the ratio measured experimentally. It seems that in the microscopy images, there are clearly fewer cells surrounding one hole than agents around a hole in the model. A brief quantitative description/analysis would be beneficial to clarify this (Reviewer #3 – point #4).</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer’s concern regarding the difference in hole size between the simulation and the experiment and appreciate the opportunity to clarify this point. In response, we would like to emphasize that we have already quantified the number of cells surrounding the holes in Figure 6C and 6D (right y-axis). Our analysis indicates that hole size is indeed smaller in the experiment than in the simulation, as stated in the original main text:</p><p>“The radius of holes obtained from the PDs (Figure 6B bottom) decreases as well (Figure 6D), although the hole sizes in the simulation were slightly larger than those of the experiment. This quantitative difference might come from the fact that the shape of the cells in the simulation is kept constant, while the shape of the real mesoderm cells changes dynamically.”</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we will explicitly state the number of surrounding cells as follows:</p><p>“The radius of holes obtained from the PDs (Figure 6B bottom) decreases as well (Figure 6D), although the hole sizes and the number of cells surrounding the holes (Figure 6C and D, left y-axis) in the simulation were slightly larger than those of the experiment.”</p><p>This revision ensures that the quantitative comparison is explicitly mentioned, addressing the reviewer’s concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Nakaya et al. investigate the cellular mechanisms underlying mesoderm cell migration in chick embryos. Through the use of live and fixed high-resolution imaging and so-called topological data analysis (TDA), they uncover the existence of a dynamic, cell-cell adhesion-dependent meshwork pattern in the mesoderm. By tracking wildtype vs. dominant negative N-cadherin expressing cells, they uncover a dependency of directed collective cell migration but not individual cell migration on cell-cell adhesions. Combining experimental observations with theoretical modeling, the authors demonstrate that elongated shape, attractive interaction, and specific cell densities can sufficiently explain the formation of dynamic meshworks during mesoderm formation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the clear summary and positive assessment of our work.

In response to the reviewer’s suggestion, we have revised the text to clarify several methodological details and motivations behind our analyses, such as topological data analysis (TDA) and use of chick embryos. While we agree that certain imaging observations—such as cell shape, and contact duration—are important, we note that limitations in image quality or resolution made robust quantification difficult in some cases. For such instances, we have softened the corresponding statements in the manuscript to avoid overinterpretation and to maintain appropriate rigor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors apply topological data analysis (TDA), which is an innovative approach to quantifying tissue topology and provides clear quantitative measures for holes within the meshwork.

Since there are numerical predictions that come out of the theoretical models, there are some potential opportunities for experimental measurements that are missed. In fact, while certain elements are quantified very well, some key elements of the model are demonstrated only anecdotal and glossed over – cell shape (shown in supplemental Figure 5 but should be shown earlier), exclusion of dom. Neg. cadherin cells from holes, and time of contact. It would have strengthened the work to better characterize these key observations.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their thoughtful comments and for highlighting the strength of the theoretical model and its alignment with the experimental data. We agree that certain aspects of the model—such as cell shape, exclusion of dominant-negative N-cadherin– expressing cells from the meshwork, and the duration of cell-cell contact—could further benefit from more direct experimental characterization. However, as mentioned above, limitations in imaging resolution and sample size made it challenging to robustly quantify these features. For this reason, we chose to present them cautiously and have softened the corresponding claims in the revised manuscript. In addition, we have moved the relevant image showing cell aspect ratio (previously in Figure 5—figure supplement 1) to an earlier position (Figure 4—figure supplement 1) according to the suggestion.

Now, we have included the works on mesoderm cell migration in different model systems and advantage of the use of chick model in Introduction as follows.</p><p>“Mesoderm migration have been studied mostly in fly, fish, frog, chick and mouse embryos. However, spatiotemporal patterns of migration differ among the models. In zebrafish prechordal plate, cells exhibit collective movement towards the animal pole, whose directionality is maintained by contact between cells (Dumortier et al., 2012). In contrast, in mice, live imaging of whole embryo indicated that the mesoderm cells migrate individually rather than collective (Ichikawa et al., 2013). More recently, in mice, embryonic mesoderm cells demonstrate random aspects in their migration behavior and neighboring cells tend to migrate in parallel (Saykali et al., 2019). Leveraging the flat and easily accessible nature of the early chick embryo, researchers have conducted extensive and well-documented experimental studies over many years. The chick embryo has been particularly valuable in studying the properties of the mesoderm, including the migration pathways that depend on cell fate (Psychoyos and Stern, 1996). Live imaging techniques have been also employed to visualize the migratory routes of cells emerging from various positions along the primitive streak, spanning from anterior to posterior regions (Yang et al., 2002).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1 does not strongly contribute to the narrative- the anterior/middle/posterior aspect of the mesoderm is not mentioned again, and sometimes taken into consideration and sometimes ignored, even within figure 1. In this reviewer's view, All information in Figure 1 is already contained in Figure 4 in direct contrast to the dom. Neg. cadherin cells, illustrating the desired points much more clearly. Figure 1 panels are also out of order and not referenced in order in the main text, making reading confusing.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 1 is one of the most important results of this paper. Cell tracking was performed in much wider area than that in Figure 4. Using this data, basic cell motility analysis has been performed, and its properties have been shown. It also features simultaneous cell tracking in anterior, middle, posterior regions. We found that the properties of cell migration did not differ significantly between these three regions. We have carefully checked the main text to ensure that the panels in Figure 1 are referenced in the correct order. As reviewer #3 said that “the figures are clear and well-structured” in the comment #7, we think that Figure 1 gives fundamental information about the mesoderm cell migration in the early chick embryo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For all electroporation experiments- how do the authors know that they are observing mostly mesodermal cells?

The average diameter of the holes was estimated to be 34 µm. Because there is no order of magnitude difference between the characteristic length of the collective migration and the diameter of the holes, we considered that the two sizes are almost comparable to each other.

The sentence was attempting to explain what can be speculated from these findings.

Using live imaging and quantitative analysis they characterize the motility of individual cells as they migrate from the primitive streak. From measurements of individual cell directionality, MSD, and cell-speed autocorrelation function they conclude that individual cells migrate in a directed manner but their motion fluctuates in three dimensions and generally appears as a biased random walk. Quantifications of a motility order parameter and measurements of MSRD revealed that the motility of neighboring cells is correlated within a radius of a few tens of microns. Consistent with these findings they also discover that during cell migration a 3D meshwork is formed in between the epiblast and the endoderm. Using persistent homology analysis they characterize the meshwork structure and its dynamics. They find that the meshwork holes are tens of microns in size, consistent with the length scale found in the migration analysis. To investigate the role of cell-cell adhesion in this process they overexpressed an N-cadherin mutant in the mesoderm cells and analyzed cell motility and network formation. Mutated cells were less persistent, the tissue progression speed was lower and their directional coordination was weaker. They, therefore, conclude that cell-cell adhesion is important for the coordinated movement of the cells. To investigate how the meshwork is formed they developed agent-based stochastic simulations of rod-shaped cells interacting via short-range attraction and core repulsion. The simulations showed that meshwork structures form with strong inter-cell attraction and that a threshold cell aspect ratio is required to form the meshwork. In addition, for the networks to form, cell density needed to be sufficiently low since otherwise, they would fill the space with no holes, as they find in later stages of development. The work presented in this manuscript is comprehensive and interesting but I nevertheless have a few important comments.</p><p>Strengths: The work provides a detailed characterization of the individual and collective motility of mesoderm cells during gastrulation. The authors discover a novel structure that is formed in the process and present computer simulations that reproduce the structures formed and suggest key factors that may drive and influence their formation.</p><p>Weaknesses: Major one: The authors present their analysis of the network structure using persistent homology analysis and use technical terminology that is inconsistent with the context; they describe the structural properties of the meshwork in terms of birth-, death rates, and lifetimes. This makes it very hard to understand their findings. The authors should translate the expressions to the current context, namely use expressions that have concrete structural rather than temporal meaning, and explain in more detail how the points in the persistent diagrams relate to the structural properties of the network.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comprehensive and thoughtful evaluation of our work, and for acknowledging both the novelty of our findings and the integration of experimental and computational approaches. We are encouraged by the reviewer’s recognition of the detailed characterization of mesodermal cell motility, the discovery of the 3D meshwork structure, and the modeling that recapitulates the key aspects of the system.</p><p>We particularly appreciate the reviewer’s comment regarding the use of persistent homology analysis. In the original version, we indeed used standard terminology from topological data analysis (such as “birth time” “death time” and “lifetime”) without sufficiently translating these terms into the biological context of our study. In the revised manuscript, we have addressed this issue by replacing those terms with “birth level”, “death level” and “persistence”, respectively. (See our response to 5a in Essential Revisions). We have substantially updated the explanation about topological data analysis in the main text. We have also revised the figure legends (Figure 2 and 3) to clarify how points in the persistence diagrams correspond to holes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors should consider examining their network structure using more direct metrics as done in the analysis of fluid phase transitions in the references mentioned above.</p></disp-quote><p>Our aim was to quantitatively characterize the holes that appear in the inhomogeneous distribution of cells. Initially, we explored several conventional methods for this purpose. Specifically, we attempted to extract cell nucleus positions and infer cellular connectivity based on nucleus-to-nucleus distances. However, due to the anisotropic elongation of cell shapes, nucleus distances did not reliably reflect cell proximity, making it difficult to characterize hole formation. Similarly, approaches based on Delaunay triangulation were also challenging, as they assume isotropic spacing between points, which is not valid in our case.</p><p>We also considered image-based thresholding techniques to directly extract hole regions. However, setting a single threshold value to robustly detect hole locations proved to be highly challenging due to variations in cell density and morphology across different regions.</p><p>Given these challenges, we adopted topological data analysis (TDA), which allows us to quantify topological features such as holes without relying on predefined connectivity assumptions or arbitrary thresholds. Unlike conventional network-based approaches, TDA provides a multi-scale characterization of spatial structures, making it particularly well-suited for analyzing the distribution of non-uniformly arranged cells with irregular shapes.</p><p>We acknowledge the importance of conventional network metrics. However, a systematic comparison between different methods for characterizing network structures is beyond the scope of this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

The simulations results appear to resemble a one-component spinodal decomposition of unstable fluids where condensation occurs globally throughout the system (for relevance in biological systems see reviews by Cats and Tailleur, Annu. Rev. Condens. Matter Phys. 2015. 6:219-44 and Joel Berry et al. 2018 Rep. Prog. Phys. 81 046601) It is driven by the attractive van der Waals interactions between particles and does not require them to be anisotropic; for a 2D simulation with Lennard- Jones potential see for instance, Koch et al., Phys Rev A, 1983. I.e., simpler simulations of round particles in attractive interaction (Lennard Jones potential) reveal similar structures in a so-called spinodal decomposition process. Moreover, in the experiments, the cells appear to be quite round. The aspect ratio is close to 1. It is therefore not clear that the rather small cells' aspect ratio is indeed an essential factor for network formation. The authors show in Figure 5C that for a specific choice of cell density and interaction strength, the aspect ratio is important for network formation. I suggest testing stronger attraction strengths (would it not phase separate?) and lower densities.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to 1-c in Essential Revisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The description of the topological structure analysis in the methods section needs to be self-contained and not be based on the readers' knowledge of the original reference by Obayashi 2018.

By means of confocal imaging and thorough quantitative analyses for cell tracking, they show that, while individual mesoderm cell motion displays some randomness, the cells move collectively toward the anterior-lateral or lateral direction. Moreover, the mesoderm forms a dynamic 3D meshwork structure, which the authors characterise applying persistent homology analysis. Immunostainings and a knockdown assay hint towards a role of N-cadherin-based cell adhesion in controlling collective cell migration and meshwork structure. Furthermore, Nakaya et al. develop an agent-based theoretical model to recapitulate the experimental observations and test additional parameters, such as cell-cell adhesion, cell elongation, and cell density. This model confirms the importance of adhesion for meshwork formation and supports cell shape and density as further parameters influencing it.</p><p>One major strength of this work is the detailed analysis of cellular motion, providing a compelling characterisation of mesoderm cell migration. Moreover, the theoretical model notably complements the experimental observations, while also adding to them. It provides further parameters influencing meshwork formation that could be tested experimentally in the future. Generally, the analysis methods employed in this manuscript constitute a good basis for future work on similar structures and processes. A point of improvement for this study is to understand the differential contribution of N-cadherin in cell adhesion, elongation, and density and through which of these parameters it influences meshwork formation.</p><p>All in all, the authors describe a novel mode of collective cell migration of the mesenchymal cells forming the chick mesoderm.

While our current data clearly show that N-Cad-M expression impairs directional coordination and meshwork integrity, experimentally separating its specific contributions to adhesion strength, cell morphology, and effective cell density within the tissue remains technically challenging. We have added a comment in Discussion (lines 553-557) to acknowledge this limitation and to propose it as an important direction for future studies, possibly involving tools that allow more selective modulation of these parameters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Here, I provide some suggestions for experiments that could contribute to strengthening the author's claims, as well as some considerations that in my opinion should be taken into account when coming to conclusions about the experiments:</p><p>1. Experiments to confirm that the cells being labelled by electroporation (Figure 1) are indeed (mostly) mesodermal, especially since the authors also suggest other cells may have been labelled, but do not quantify this (&quot;there might have been a few endodermal and epiblast cells&quot;, p. 7). This could be done e.g. by immunostaining or HCR with a mesodermal marker. Similarly, in Figure 2, labelling of the epiblast/mesoderm/endoderm via immunostaining or HCR would show in a convincing way that the meshwork structure is only present in the mesoderm.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to 4 in Essential Revisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In Figure 4, the authors conclude that intercellular adhesion controls collective mesoderm cell migration based on the effects of overexpression of N-cad-M (lacking the extracellular domain). However, this experimental setup does not take into account that overexpressing the intracellular domain of N-cadherin can have effects on intracellular signalling. Changes in signalling could also account for changes in cell migration, instead of or in addition to the effect of cell adhesion and the associated outcomes of cell elongation. A control experiment would be to overexpress N-cad that lacks the intracellular domain instead and compare the effects between the two manipulations.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to 3 in Essential Revisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The theoretical model predicts that shape, cell-cell adhesion, and density contribute to meshwork formation. The authors test these predictions via the N-cad loss of function experiments, where cells naturally round up since they lose cell-cell adhesion to their neighbours. This experimental approach makes it hard to evaluate which of the model parameters are indeed physiologically relevant in vivo. I understand that finding experimental strategies that influence more than one parameter over the other is difficult, however more mild approaches (e.g. less concentration of N-cad-M so the cells do not lose adhesion completely) or the combination with complementary approaches (e.g. use of blebbistatin, ROCK inhibitor, etc) may help understand more the cellular basis of the meshwork formation.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to 1d in Essential Revisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Regarding the theoretical model, it is not clear to me if the size ratio of hole vs. particles/agents is comparable to the ratio measured experimentally. It seems that in the microscopy images, there are clearly fewer cells surrounding one hole than agents around a hole in the model. A brief quantitative description/analysis would be beneficial to clarify this.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to 6 in Essential Revisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. An additional point regarding the theoretical model is if the emergence of the nematic order is also observed in the experimental data, and how this is disrupted in N-cad loss of function.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion to assess whether the emergence of nematic order in our theoretical model is also observed in the experimental data and how this is affected by N-cadherin loss of function. In response, we conducted an additional analysis of nematic order in our experimental dataset.</p><p>Ideally, nematic order should be defined in terms of cell shape anisotropy. However, extracting cell shape anisotropy from enough samples to statistically assess nematic order was challenging. Therefore, we instead evaluated nematic order based on the polarity of cell motion. While we observed a statistically significant decrease in nematic order in 2 out of 5 embryos, the difference was not statistically significant when considering all samples.</p><p>One possible explanation for this variability is that N-cadherin disruption was not fully efficient in all embryos. Variations in the extent of N-cadherin loss could influence the degree to which nematic order is affected, potentially contributing to the lack of a consistent trend across samples. Additionally, since motion-based polarity may not fully capture the underlying structural order of the cell arrangement, this methodological limitation may have further contributed to the inconsistency in our analysis.</p><p>Given these considerations, the variability in N-cadherin disruption efficiency and the challenge of accurately assessing nematic order from available data, we have decided not to include this analysis in the revised manuscript, as the current data do not provide a clear or consistent conclusion. However, we appreciate this valuable suggestion and acknowledge that future studies with a larger sample size, improved N-cadherin disruption, and more direct measurements of shape anisotropy-based nematic order may be needed to further investigate this relationship.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

The figures are clear and well-structured, with some sketches greatly contributing to the understanding of the experimental setups and imaging regions.

Additionally, in Figure 1C it may be helpful to clarify that the dot marks the initial position of the cells (as is done in Figure 4E). In Figure 4, Figure 4 S1 and S2, as well as in the main text, more consistency in the naming of the mutant N-cadherin construct would add cohesion to the work (&quot;N-Cad M&quot;, &quot;Ncad DN&quot;, &quot;N-cad mutant&quot;, &quot;N-cad-M&quot;, &quot;N-Cad-M&quot;).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this review for pointing out that the figures are clear and well-structured.

Nevertheless, with one point I think the authors need to tone done their conclusion. Although with their theoretical model the authors did not observe network formation with round cells, this does not yet mean that cell elongation is an essential factor for network formation in the experimental system. Indeed, as mentioned in my previous report, the network structures found in their experiments resemble the patterns formed with unstable fluids undergoing a one-component spinodal decomposition. This process is driven by the attractive van der Waals interactions between particles and does not require them to be anisotropic in shape. See references in my previous report. This implies that network formation of the type that the authors find could indeed form with interacting round cells under appropriate conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>Visual inspection alone cannot determine whether the cell-cell adhesion mediated by N-cadherin can actually induce a spinodal-like instability. In principle, one could test for such an instability by quantifying domain coarsening, but this is impractical here because cells are continuously supplied from the primitive streak, and the supply rate increases over time, masking any intrinsic coarsening law. As we cannot entirely rule out the possibility, we now acknowledge it at the end of Discussion. If such an instability exists, anisotropic cell shape would act on top of the instability process. The inserted paragraph follows.</p><p>“Our data and theoretical model suggest that cell elongation and cell-cell adhesion actively stabilize the meshwork. There may still be a possibility that a spinodal-like instability driven by N-cadherin-mediated adhesion. If it exists, anisotropic cell shape would act on top of the instability process. Future work will be required to determine whether such an instability exists in the meshwork formation of chick mesoderm.”</p><p>From our analysis of cell motility, the Péclet number is estimated to be 2 to 4, given that the mean cell speed is from 2 to 4 µm/min, typical cell size is about 10 µm, and the persistent time obtained from the MSRD analysis is about 10 min. This value is much smaller than the value required for the motility induced phase separation (MIPS).

In response, we have revised the abstract and main text. For (1), in the abstract, we refrained from using the term “mesoderm cells”.

In the main texts, we explicitly note that a small fraction of definitive endoderm cells may be included. For (2), in the abstract, since from our experiment it might not be straight forward to conclude how N-cadherin contributes to the meshwork, we removed the sentence asserting that the meshwork structure was supported by Ncadherin. Throughout the manuscript we now frame N-cadherin as a potential contributor to the collective cell migration. The revised abstract follows.</p><p>“Migration of cell populations is a fundamental process in morphogenesis and disease. The mechanisms of collective cell migration of epithelial cell populations have been well studied. It remains unclear, however, how the highly motile mesenchymal cells, which migrate extensively throughout the embryo, are connected with each other and coordinated as a collective. During chick gastrulation, cells emerging from the primitive streak and migrating in the 3D space between ectoderm and endoderm (mesoderm region) exhibit a novel form of collective migration. Using live imaging and quantitative analysis, such as topological data analysis (TDA), we found that these cells undergo a novel form of collective migration, in which they form a meshwork structure while moving away from the primitive streak. Overexpressing a mutant form of N-cadherin was associated with reduced speed of tissue progression and directionality of the collective cell movement, whereas the speed of individual cells remains unchanged. To investigate how this meshwork arises, we utilized an agent-based theoretical model, suggesting that cell elongation, cell-cell adhesion, and cell density are the key parameters for the meshwork formation. These data provide novel insights into how a supracellular structure of migrating mesenchymal cells may arise in loosely connected cell populations.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
