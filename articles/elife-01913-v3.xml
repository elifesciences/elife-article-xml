mechanisms that link the nutritional state to RBC growth are incompletely understood. We performed a screen for cell types that have high levels of signaling through mTORC1, a protein kinase that couples nutrient availability to cell growth. This screen revealed that reticulocytes show high levels of phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6, a downstream target of mTORC1. We found that mTORC1 activity in RBCs is regulated by dietary iron and that genetic activation or inhibition of mTORC1 results in macrocytic or microcytic anemia, respectively. Finally, ATP competitive mTOR inhibitors reduced RBC proliferation and were lethal after treatment with phenylhydrazine, an inducer of hemolysis. These results identify the mTORC1 pathway as a critical regulator of RBC growth and proliferation and establish that perturbations in this pathway result in anemia.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01913.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01913.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01913.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>To multiply and grow, cells need to create more of the molecules—such as proteins—that make up their structure. This only happens if the cell has a good supply of the nutrients used to build the proteins.</p><p>Red blood cells are particularly sensitive to the supply of nutrients, especially iron, which is a key component of the hemoglobin molecules that enable the cells to transport oxygen around the body. A lack of iron can lead to a shortage of red blood cells and a condition called anemia. People with mild forms of anemia may feel tired or weak, but more severe forms of anemia can cause heart problems and even death.</p><p>A protein called mTOR forms part of a protein complex that helps alert the cells of many different organisms to the presence of nutrients. mTOR can add phosphate groups to ribosomes—the molecular machines that translate molecules of mRNA to build proteins. In 2012, researchers developed a technique called Phospho-Trap that can isolate these phosphorylated ribosomes from cells. Cells with an activated mTOR complex express more mTOR protein and in turn have more ribosomes that are modified. Examining the mRNA molecules associated with these ribosomes can reveal which proteins are produced in greater amounts in these cells.</p><p>Previous experiments using Phospho-Trap found the proteins that make up hemoglobin in unexpectedly high amounts in the mouse brain. Now, Knight et al.—and other researchers involved in the 2012 work—have established that the hemoglobin was not coming from the brain cells but from immature red blood cells circulating within the brain. These immature blood cells were found to have a highly active mTOR complex that promotes the production of hemoglobin and new blood cells.</p><p>Using genetic techniques in mice, Knight et al. found that the mTOR complex can cause anemia if it is underactive or overactive. Underactive mTOR complexes cause a type of anemia that produces small red blood cells and is usually triggered by a lack of iron. This made sense because mTOR is known to regulate both protein production and cell size. Boosting the activity of the mTOR complex leads to a type of anemia in which the cells are much larger than normal, and which is normally associated with inadequate amounts of folate and B12 vitamins.</p><p>When Knight et al. gave mice a drug that inhibits the mTOR protein, the mice developed anemia that resolved when the treatment stopped. However, mice that were given the mTOR inhibitor at the same time as a drug that destroys red blood cells, all died within days. Clinical trials are currently testing mTOR inhibitors as a possible cancer treatment; however, a common side effect of chemotherapy is that it stops new red blood cells being produced. Knight et al. suggest that the red blood cells of patients in these clinical trials must be closely monitored before deciding whether to continue the treatment further.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01913.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01913.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>mTOR</kwd><kwd>mTORC1</kwd><kwd>anemia</kwd><kwd>erythropoiesis</kwd><kwd>RBC</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Friedman</surname><given-names>Jeffrey M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK083531</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Knight</surname><given-names>Zachary A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK041096</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Friedman</surname><given-names>Jeffrey M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007457</institution-id><institution>JPB Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Friedman</surname><given-names>Jeffrey M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Transcription profiling of activated cells using Phospho-Trap, a new method for identifying activated cells, reveals a critical role for mTOR signaling in red blood cell development and the pathogenesis of anemia</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cells must coordinate their rate of growth and proliferation with the availability of nutrients. mTOR, a serine–threonine kinase, is one the key proteins responsible for nutrient signaling in eukaryotic cells. mTOR is activated by conditions that signal energy abundance, such as the availability of amino acids, growth factors, and intracellular ATP. Activated mTOR then phosphorylates a set of downstream targets that promote anabolic processes, such as protein translation and lipid biosynthesis, while suppressing catabolic processes such as autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zoncu et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>mTOR resides in two cellular complexes that have distinct functions and regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Loewith et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sarbassov et al., 2004</xref>). mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) is sensitive to inhibition by the natural product rapamycin and contains the protein Raptor. Key targets of mTORC1 include S6 kinase (S6K), which influences cell size, and the eIF4-E binding protein (4E-BP1), which regulates cell proliferation through effects on cap-dependent translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shima et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dowling et al., 2010</xref>). mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) is resistant to rapamycin and contains the protein Rictor. mTORC2 phosphorylates and activates several kinases in the AGC family, such as Akt and SGK, on a sequence known as the hydrophobic motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sarbassov et al., 2005</xref>). As Akt itself activates mTORC1 by phosphorylation of the Tsc1/2 complex, these two kinases reciprocally regulate each other in response to growth factor signals.</p><p>TOR was discovered in yeast, where it functions as a nutrient sensor regulating cell growth and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heitman et al., 1991</xref>). This cell-autonomous function is conserved in higher organisms, and there has been rapid progress in delineating the molecular pathways by which mTOR controls basic cellular processes such as protein translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zoncu et al., 2011</xref>). Less is understood about how mTOR signaling links nutrient signals to cellular growth to regulate the physiologic state of multicellular organisms such as mammals. However, the availability of mice bearing conditional alleles of essential mTORC1 and mTORC2 components has made it possible to begin to dissect the physiologic functions of these signaling complexes using cell-type-specific Cre drivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gan and DePinho, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kalaitzidis et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In a previous report, we developed a systematic approach to identify the cell types that show high levels of mTORC1 activity in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Knight et al., 2012</xref>). This approach takes advantage of the fact that activation of mTORC1 leads to rapid phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) on five C-terminal serine residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; Ser 235, 236, 240, 244, 247) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pende et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roux et al., 2007</xref>). As rpS6 is a structural component of the ribosome, this phosphorylation introduces a ‘tag’ on the ribosomes from cells that have active mTORC1 signaling. We thus used phospho-specific antibodies to S6 to selectively immunoprecipitate these phosphorylated ribosomes from cells with high levels of TORC1 signaling in mouse brain homogenates, thereby enriching for the mRNA expressed in a subpopulation of activated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Knight et al., 2012</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01913.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Reticulocytes have elevated mTORC1 signaling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram showing the phosphorylation sites on ribosomal protein S6 and strategy for immunoprecipitation of phosphorylated ribosomes.

However, we also noted that genes encoding the protein subunits of hemoglobin were highly enriched in our pS6 immunoprecipitates. In this study, we report that these transcripts are derived from reticulocytes, immature red blood cells (RBCs), that we find have especially high levels of mTORC1 signaling. We further use a combination of pharmacologic, genetic, and nutritional perturbations to delineate a critical role for mTORC1 signaling in RBC development and the pathogenesis of anemia, suggesting that this pathway links the availability of iron to cell growth and hemoglobin synthesis during erythropoiesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reticulocytes have unusually high levels of pS6</title><p>We recently described a method for molecular profiling of activated neurons in the mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Knight et al., 2012</xref>). This approach takes advantage of the fact that ribosomal protein S6 is phosphorylated following neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lenz and Avruch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Villanueva et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zeng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Valjent et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bertran-Gonzalez et al., 2012</xref>). These phosphorylated ribosomes can then be immunoprecipitated from mouse brain homogenates, enriching for the mRNA expressed in a subpopulation of activated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>During the course of these studies, we noticed that <italic>Hba-a1</italic> and <italic>Hbb-b1</italic> were highly enriched transcripts in pS6 immunoprecipitates from the mouse hypothalamus and other brain regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). <italic>Hba-a1</italic> and <italic>Hbb-b1</italic> encode α- and β-globin, the protein subunits of hemoglobin. As hemoglobin is not highly expressed in the brain, the enrichment of these transcripts was unexpected and we set out to clarify their cellular origin.</p><p>We initially considered the possibility that hemoglobin might be expressed in a specific population of neurons that have high levels of pS6 at baseline. For example, VIP neurons of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) have high levels of pS6, and VIP mRNA is highly enriched in pS6 immunoprecipitates from the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, consistent with the data from the Allen Brain Atlas, we were unable to detect specific α-globin expression in the SCN or any other hypothalamic region by immunostaining or in situ hybridization. We thus considered the possibility that the globin RNA was not derived from a specific neural population but from another cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>Hba-a1</italic> and <italic>Hbb-b1</italic> are most abundantly expressed in reticulocytes, immature RBCs that circulate in the blood. To test whether the <italic>Hba-a1</italic> and <italic>Hbb-b1</italic> transcripts originated from the circulating cells, we perfused mice with saline to remove blood from the tissue and then quantified the amount of globin mRNA remaining in hypothalamic extracts. Perfusion removed approximately 95% of <italic>Hba-a1</italic> and <italic>Hbb-b1</italic> mRNA from hypothalamus but had no effect on transcripts expressed in neurons or glia, such as <italic>Actb</italic> or <italic>Pomc</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These data show that the vast majority of <italic>Hba-a1</italic> and <italic>Hbb-b1</italic> mRNA in the brain originates from the circulating cells. To determine if <italic>Hba-a1</italic> and <italic>Hbb-b1</italic> were the only enriched erythroid transcripts in the blood, we scanned the RNAseq data for altered expression of other genes expressed in cells of the erythropoietic lineage. In contrast to transcripts for Hbb, we failed to find enrichment for erythroid catalase, carbonic anhydrase II, two cytoplasmic proteins, or sprectrin-a, spectrin-b, and ankyrin, which are membrane proteins.</p><p>The observation that the globin transcripts in our pS6 immunoprecipitates were derived from circulating cells suggested that reticulocytes were the source of this RNA and that reticulocytes might have unusually high levels of pS6. Furthermore, since pS6 is widely used as a marker for the activation of the mTORC1 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meyuhas, 2008</xref>), the data further suggested that reticulocytes might have particularly high levels of mTORC1 signaling. To test these possibilities, we first used western blotting to quantify the level of pS6 in the lysates from the brain and RBCs. Consistent with our ribosome profiling data, reticulocyte lysates had a much higher level of pS6 at both Ser 235/236 and Ser 240/244 compared to extracts from the brain as a whole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). We then extended this analysis by purifying the ribosomes from a panel of mouse tissues, including fat, testis, lungs, liver, heart, pancreas, stomach, and kidney, and then analyzed the level of pS6 in these tissues compared to blood. Remarkably, reticulocytes had the highest level of pS6 in any tissue we examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Thus, our ribosome profiling data from the brain revealed the unexpected finding that mTORC1 signaling is highly active in the RBC lineage.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>mTORC1 signaling in RBCs is regulated by iron</title><p>Reticulocytes are highly specialized for hemoglobin synthesis, and we wondered whether the elevated mTORC1 activity in this cell type might reflect its uniquely high demand for protein translation. The mTORC1 pathway plays a general role in linking nutrient availability to protein translation in diverse tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sengupta et al., 2010</xref>), but relatively little is known about its function and regulation in RBCs. However, recent work has shown that mTORC1 can be regulated by the availability of iron in cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ohyashiki et al., 2009</xref>) and the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ndong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fretham et al., 2013</xref>), and, in turn, that mTORC1 activity can modulate downstream enzymes that control intracellular iron metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bayeva et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">La et al., 2013</xref>). These data raise the possibility that mTORC1 activity in RBCs might help coordinate the rate of translation with the availability of iron, although this had not been directly tested.</p><p>To test whether iron can regulate mTORC1 signaling in RBCs, wild-type mice were made iron deficient by placing them on a low iron diet combined with daily injections of the iron chelator deferoxamine. Complete blood counts were performed after 1 month and showed that the treated animals had developed microcytic anemia: the low iron cohort showed a reduction in RBC volume (58.7 vs 52.3 fL, p &lt; 0.001 for reticulocytes; 48.3 vs 46.1 fL for mature RBC, p &lt; 0.001) and RBC hemoglobin content (15.3 vs 13.2 pg for reticulocytes, p &lt; 0.001; 14.0 vs 13.4 pg for mature RBC, p &lt; 0.01) relative to control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). To assess the level of mTORC1 signaling in these cells, we prepared lysates from RBCs from animals in each cohort and performed western blots for pS6. Iron deficiency greatly reduced the level of pS6 in RBCs at both Ser 235/236 as well as Ser 240/244, the latter of which is a specific marker for mTORC1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roux et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meyuhas, 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). Consistent with previous data, we observed a similar inhibition of mTORC1 signaling when we treated the erythroleukemia cell line K562 with iron chelators in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ohyashiki et al., 2009</xref>). Thus iron deficiency results in a marked reduction in mTORC1 signaling in RBCs in vitro and in vivo.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01913.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>mTORC1 signaling in RBCs is regulated by iron.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mean cell volume (MCV) of reticulocytes and mature RBCs in mice that were challenged with a low iron diet (black bars) or maintained on a chow diet (white bars) for 1 month.

In addition, the percentage of cells with elevated hemoglobin was dramatically increased in both young and old RBCs (29.2 vs 5.00% in reticulocytes; 13.5 vs 0.58% in mature RBCs, p &lt; 0.0001).</p><p>Despite this increase in RBC size and hemoglobin content, TSC-KO mice were anemic compared to littermate controls (39.4 vs 45.7% hematocrit, p &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The reduced hematocrit of TSC-KO mice resulted from a reduction in the RBC number (7.58 vs 9.89 × 10^9 cells/mL, p &lt; 0.0001), such that the total amount of hemoglobin in the peripheral blood was reduced (1.12 vs 1.28 g/dL, p &lt; 0.01). Thus constitutive activation of mTORC1 leads to a macrocytic anemia with an increase in hemoglobin per cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gan and DePinho, 2009</xref>).</p><p>We also noticed that TSC-KO mice had a higher percentage of circulating reticulocytes (5.04 vs 2.97%, p &lt; 0.01) with more than threefold increase in the size of their spleens (360 vs 80.5 mg, p &lt; 0.01) relative to littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). These changes are often characteristic of stress erythropoiesis, suggesting erythropoiesis in the spleen of TSC-KO mice is activated to compensate for reduced RBC production by the bone marrow. To confirm this, we isolated splenocytes and bone marrow cells (BMCs) from TSC-KO and control mice and used flow cytometry to quantify the abundance of RBC progenitors in these two compartments. Consistent with this possibility, TSC-KO mice showed a decrease in the number of erythroid progenitors in the bone marrow (EryB: 5.08 vs 16.3, p &lt; 0.01), and a reciprocal increase in the number of erythroid progenitors in the spleen (EryA: 3.15 vs 10.4%, p &lt; 0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Thus, we find that constitutive activation of mTORC1 is sufficient to recapitulate a constellation of features that characterize macrocytic anemia, including an increase in RBC size and hemoglobin content coupled to a decrease in RBC counts and hematocrit.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Iron deficiency decreases survival of TSC-KO mice</title><p>RBCs must balance the rate of globin synthesis with the availability of iron, so that free globin peptides do not aggregate in the absence of heme. An excess of free globin decreases red blood cell survival in a number of conditions including thalassemia. Thus, chronic iron deficiency triggers an adaptive response in which hemoglobin synthesis and RBC size are reduced, resulting in a microcytic hypochromic anemia in which the low heme levels are balanced by lower levels of globin synthesis. During iron deficiency the activity of heme-regulated eIF2alpha kinase (HRI), a protein kinase that is selectively expressed in RBCs is increased and acts to reduce hemoglobin synthesis. This kinase is phosphorylated and inhibited by free heme and is disinhibited with iron depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen, 2007</xref>). HRI knockout mice do not reduce globin synthesis after iron deficiency indicating that activation of this kinase plays an important role in the adaptive response to dietary iron deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Han et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>However, since mTORC1 is inhibited by iron deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), this raised the question of whether the constitutive mTORC1 activation could also exacerbate the response to iron deficiency. To test this we challenged two cohorts of TSC-KO mice as well as littermate controls with either a low iron or control diet for two months and then measured the effect on RBC growth and proliferation. Similar to the effects of an HRI deficiency on the response to iron deficiency, TSC-KO mice became visibly moribund and showed progressive mortality beginning at 3 weeks on an iron deficient diet, such that only 64% of the TSC-KO mice survived the 2-month experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). By contrast, littermate controls were more normal in appearance and had a higher survival. Thus chronic mTORC1 activation in RBCs is maladaptive in the context of iron deficiency.</p><p>Complete blood counts after 2 months revealed that, similar to controls, TSC-KO mice showed a reduction in the RBC volume and hemoglobin content on the low iron diet. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). The iron deficient TSC-KO mice also displayed splenomegaly and reticulocytosis. We also noted premature mortality in TSC-KO mice whether or not they were on a low iron diet. Autopsies of two TSC-KO mice, one on chow and another on an iron deficient diet at 6 months of age were performed. Both mice had extramedullary hematopoiesis with multifocal myeloid hyperplasia which was described as moderate. Consistent with the greater mortality of animals on low iron diet, the iron deficient TSC-KO mouse showed increased number of phagocytosed red blood cells in multiple organs compared to the chow-fed TSC-KO animal. These data are consistent with the possibility that constitutive activation of the mTOR pathway in the setting of iron deficiency, which was further exacerbated by phlebotomy for blood collection, decreased RBC viability and increased mortality at younger ages. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kazemi et al., 2007</xref>)</p><p>All of the TSC-KO mice died prematurely by ∼6 months of age and both animals also developed histiocytic sarcomas which showed diffuse infiltration of neoplastic round cells in thymus, lung, liver, kidneys, spleen, bone marrow, meninges, uterus, and lymph nodes.

Germline deletion of either mTOR or the essential mTORC1 component Raptor results in embryos that die shortly after implantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guertin et al., 2006</xref>), which has complicated analysis of the requirement for mTORC1 signaling in erythropoiesis. Experiments using inducible deletion of mTORC1 subunits in the hematopoietic cells have yielded variable results. For example, an inducible deletion of <italic>Rptor</italic> in either <italic>Mx1</italic><sup><italic>Cre</italic></sup> or <italic>ERT2</italic><sup><italic>Cre</italic></sup> animals was reported to be well tolerated in adult animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoshii et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kalaitzidis et al., 2012</xref>).

The more dramatic phenotype following mTOR deletion may reflect the role of other mTOR complexes in erythropoiesis or reflect differences in recombination efficiency and selectivity between these experiments. To directly address the role of mTOR during the development of the hematopoietic system, we mated <italic>Vav1</italic><sup><italic>Cre</italic></sup> to mice with a floxed allele of <italic>Rptor</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">de Boer et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Initial crosses between <italic>Vav1</italic><sup><italic>Cre</italic></sup><italic>Rptor</italic><sup><italic>fl/+</italic></sup> and <italic>Rptor</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup> animals failed to yield any viable <italic>Vav1</italic><sup><italic>Cre</italic></sup><italic>Rptor</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup> (hereafter called RAP-KO) offspring (&gt;100 offspring genotyped from &gt;20 litters).

Pallor during development is characteristic of a diverse set of mouse mutants that have a defect in definitive erythropoiesis. Mutations that cause a complete block of erythropoiesis, such as loss of erythropoietin or its receptor, lead to embryonic lethality at approximately E13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wu et al., 1995</xref>). In contrast, we found that many RAP-KO embryos continued to develop throughout gestation.

Therefore, the perinatal lethality of RAP-KO embyros could in principle result from <italic>Rptor</italic> deletion in other cell types such as lymphocytes.

Thus there were no other major defects in any of the other hematopoietic compartments that might have contributed to their early lethality; lymphocyte percentages were comparable in the RAP-KO with their littermates, and the total white cell count was higher (p &lt; 0.01) in the RAP-KO. There were no significant differences in the number of basophils, platelets, and monocytes. These data show that the abnormalities in the hematopoietic system of mice with Vav-cre specific inactivation of mTORC1 are limited to erythroid cells.</p><p>Consistent with their visual pallor, hematological analysis of fetal livers from RAP-KO embryos revealed a broad impairment in erythropoiesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). RAP-KO embryos were anemic (Hct 15.4 vs 27.5%, p &lt; 0.01) with reduced RBC numbers (1.72 vs 2.67 × 10^9 cells/mL, p &lt; 0.001). Analysis of specific erythroid progenitors by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) revealed that RAP-KO embryos have an increased abundance of the earliest hematopoietic progenitors (ProE, 5.95 vs 13.7%, p &lt; 0.001) and a decrease in the abundance of more mature populations (EryC, 6.15 vs 2.70%, p &lt; 0.01) relative to littermates. This shift in the distribution of fetal liver progenitors is similar to what has been observed in previous studies of the bone marrow of adult mice following inducible deletion of the mTOR kinase, though in these studies the hematopoietic phenotype was attributed to increased apoptosis of bone marrow RBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We also found that, similar to the effect of iron deficiency, RBCs from RAP-KO embryos were smaller than those from littermate controls (92.8 vs 106 fL, p &lt; 0.05) and had less total hemoglobin (24.0 vs 28.5 pg/cell, p &lt; 0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The defect in hemoglobin synthesis was particularly severe, as there was an eightfold increase in the percentage of cells that were hypochromic in RAP-KO embyros (39.3 vs 4.71, p &lt; 0.0001). We confirmed this reduction in hemoglobin expression biochemically by western blotting, which showed that RAP-KO embyros had reduced α-globin expression compared to the littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Thus genetic ablation of mTORC1 produces a severe microcytic hypochromic anemia that results in perinatal lethality. These data are consistent with the possibility that a reduction of mTORC1 plays a role in the development of the hypochromic microcytic anemia of iron deficiency. However, because the <italic>Rptor</italic> knockout was lethal during development, we were unable to use genetics to assess this possibility in adult animals.

For this reason, we compared first the effects of MLN0128 and rapamycin on mTORC1 signaling. Mice were treated with either rapamycin, MLN0128, or a third, structurally unrelated ATP competitive mTOR inhibitor (KU-0063794) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garcia-Martinez et al., 2009</xref>), and the level of pS6 in RBCs was analyzed by western blotting. MLN0128 and KU-0063794 both potently inhibited S6 phosphorylation in RBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The effect of these drugs was similar at 1 and 2 hr, although MLN0128 showed more durable inhibition at later time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). By contrast, we unexpectedly found that rapamycin only weakly inhibited S6 phosphorylation in RBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) and that this rapamycin resistance could not be overcome even by chronic rapamycin treatment (daily for 4 weeks) at high doses (10 mg/kg). This effect was specific to RBCs, as rapamycin potently and durably blocked S6K signaling in other tissues from the same animals (such as liver, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Because S6 is not a direct target of mTORC1, we also assessed the phosphorylation state of 4E-BP1 in animals treated with MLN0128 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These data showed that phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 was markedly decreased in treated animals. Furthermore, the extent of this reduction was highly correlated with the reduction in the level of phosphorylation of S6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01913.011</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>mTORC1 signaling is required for induction of stress erythropoiesis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Survival of mice treated with MLN0128 (1 mg/kg), rapamycin (10 mg/kg) or vehicle following challenge with phenylhydrazine injection (50 mg/kg) on days 0 and 2.

Thus, mTORC1 signaling through the S6K pathway is selectively resistant to rapamycin in RBCs. While certain mTORC1 substrates such as 4E-BP1 are known to display variable rapamycin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Feldman et al., 2009</xref>), rapamycin resistant S6K signaling has to our knowledge never been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choo and Blenis, 2009</xref>). This unexpected reduction in the sensitivity of RBCs to rapamycin is consistent with our observation that ATP competitive mTOR inhibitors cause a more pronounced inhibition of RBC growth and proliferation than rapamycin.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>mTORC1 signaling is required for survival under conditions of stress erythropoiesis</title><p>The effects of MLN0128 on RBC growth and proliferation were greatly diminished after 4 weeks of treatment, at which point the RBC counts and hemoglobin levels of treated mice were nearly normal. This result suggests that there is tachyphylaxis or some other homeostatic response that can compensate for the chronic but not acute mTOR inhibition in RBCs. As acute erythropoiesis is particularly critical under conditions of erythropoietic stress, we next assayed the effect of mTOR inhibitors following drug-induced hemolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Paulson et al., 2011</xref>). Mice were treated with phenylhydrazine on days 0 and 2 along with daily injections of either an mTOR inhibitor or vehicle. Phenylhydrazine causes irreversible oxidative damage to RBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, right) and triggers acute hematopoiesis with a shift in erythropoiesis from the bone marrow to the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), the proliferation of splenic progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), and the release of stress reticulocytes into the circulation and that rapidly repopulate the hematopoietic system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, center).</p><p>Vehicle-treated mice showed a normal response to phenylhydrazine-induced hemolysis and recovered normally within 1 week (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). By contrast, mice treated with MLN0128 were visibly moribund by day 2, with reduced mobility, weight loss, and a reduction in body temperature. By day 3 all animals had died or had to be euthanized for animal welfare reasons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The dramatic mortality of animals treated with MLN0128 indicates that mTOR signaling is essential for the acute response to hemolytic stress. Western blots were performed using protein from the RBCs of phenylhydrazine-treated mice with and without MLN0128 administration. These data showed high levels of phosphorylation of p4E-BP1, a direct target of mTORC1 and pS6, an indirect mTorc1 target, in mice treated with phenylhydrazine alone. However, this phosphorylation was completely absent in phenylhydrazine-treated mice that also received MLN0128. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>As we previously found that rapamycin only partially inhibited mTORC1 signaling in RBCs, we also tested the effect of this drug in the same assay. Approximately 50% of rapamycin-treated animals survived the 8-day experiment, and the onset of mortality occurred several days later than the animals treated with MLN0128 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Rapamycin treatment also delayed the release of stress reticulocytes into the blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) and reduced by twofold the increase in spleen size that occurred following phenylhydrazine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). These results indicate that the partial mTORC1 inhibition by rapamycin delays but does not block the induction of stress erythropoiesis.</p><p>To characterize rapamycin's effects on stress erythropoiesis in more detail, we performed a time course analysis of erythroid progenitors in the spleen by flow cytometry in animals treated with phenylhydrazine with and without rapamycin. Early erythroid progenitors (EryA and EryB) were present at very low levels in the spleen on day 0 but were rapidly mobilized by phenylhydrazine treatment in control animals, reaching more than 30% of total splenocytes by day 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, black). This proliferative response was significantly reduced at all time points tested by rapamycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, red). By contrast, rapamycin treatment had no effect on erythropoietin levels, which, similar to control mice, increased approximately 400 fold following phenylhydrazine treatment. This suggests that the defect induced by rapamycin results from mTORC1 inhibition in the red cell lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these data reveal a critical role for mTORC1 signaling in mediating the rapid growth and proliferation of erythroid progenitors during stress erythropoiesis. ATP competitive inhibitors block this response much more potently than rapamycin, resulting in a lethal failure to adapt to hemolytic stress. As MLN0128 and other ATP competitive mTOR inhibitors are currently being evaluated in clinical trials, these results suggest that further studies will be necessary to assess the effect of these agents under conditions that trigger stress erythropoiesis, such as hypoxia, blood loss, or drug-induced hemolysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The mTORC1 pathway coordinates protein translation with nutrient availability in organisms ranging from yeast to humans, and the physiologic functions of mTORC1 signaling in specific mammalian tissues have begun to be elucidated. Within the hematopoietic system, an extensive literature has investigated the role of mTORC1 signaling in leukocyte development and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gan and DePinho, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Janes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoshii et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kalaitzidis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Magee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2013</xref>), including its role in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and rapamycin-mediated immunosuppression. By contrast, much less is known about the role of the mTORC1 pathway in erythrocytes.</p><p>Our attention was drawn to the potential significance of mTORC1 signaling in RBCs by screening for cell types in the adult brain that have elevated levels of pS6, a ribosomal protein that is a downstream target of mTORC1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Knight et al., 2012</xref>). In that study, we used immunoprecipitation of polysomes with an anti-pS6 antibody to enrich for mRNAs from cells that had activated mTORC1 signaling. This study revealed an unexpected enrichment of globin transcripts in the precipitated polysomes. In this study, we report that circulating reticulocytes are the source of these enriched globin transcripts and that these cells have an especially high level of S6 phosphorylation. Since mTOR is known to link changes in nutrient availability to changes in translation and cell growth, these data suggested that mTOR could play an important role in fine tuning the physiologic state of RBCs in response to alterations in the availability of critical nutrients such as iron. We found that mTORC1 in RBCs is regulated by iron and that iron deficiency results in decreased mTORC1 activity in RBCs in vivo. We further showed that activation of mTORC1 by deletion of Tsc1 results in severe macrocytic anemia, while genetic inhibition of mTORC1 results in a lethal microcytic anemia. Thus bidirectional modulation of mTORC1 signaling is sufficient to cause either a macrocytic and microcytic anemia, both of which can be caused by nutrient deficiency. We further showed that pharmacologic inhibition of mTOR by ATP competitive inhibitors and to a lesser extent rapamycin resulted in an acute blockade of erythropoiesis in adults and that mTORC1 signaling is critically required for survival, following hemolytic stress. Finally, we identified rapamycin resistant S6K signaling in RBCs as a biochemical correlate of the differential effects of these drugs on RBC function. Thus, these studies delineate a critical role for mTORC1 signaling in RBC growth, development, and proliferation, and define how this pathway is selectively modulated by distinct pharmacologic, genetic, or nutritional perturbations leading to anemia.</p><p>While few studies have directly examined the role of mTORC1 signaling in RBCs, there is some evidence that dysregulation of protein translation downstream of mTORC1 may play a role in the development of anemia. The hereditary anemias, Diamond-Blackfan and 5q-syndrome, are caused by haploinsufficiency of ribosomal proteins S14 and S19, and recent data show that these anemias can be ameliorated by pharmacologic doses of L-leucine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jaako et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Payne et al., 2012</xref>), which activates mTORC1 signaling through S6K and promotes translation. Thus, our finding that RBCs depend critically on signaling through the mTORC1 pathway is consistent with the broader view that RBCs are uniquely sensitive to perturbations that affect protein translation.</p><p>A reduced activity of mTORC1 is known to reduce the size of many cell types. Consistent with this, a reduced level of mTORC activity leads to a microcytic anemia either as a result of iron deficiency or a red cell specific mutation in Raptor. As mentioned, HRI, another iron-dependent kinase, is also known to play a critical role in mediating the response to iron deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kazemi et al., 2007</xref>). Further studies may reveal whether the roles of this kinase and mTORC1 in the response to iron deficiency are redundant or if there is cross-talk between these two pathways. Our data further indicate that increased mTORC1 activity in animals with a red cell specific TSC mutation can increase RBC size, similar to the effects of B12 and folate deficiency. Further studies may reveal whether a deficiency of these nutrients leads to mTORC1 activation or whether a different mechanism contributes.</p><p>A surprising finding from our study was that S6K signaling in RBCs is rapamycin resistant yet remains sensitive to ATP competitive mTOR inhibitors. Countless studies have shown that rapamycin potently blocks S6 phosphorylation in diverse cellular contexts, and the recent mTOR crystal structure has elucidated the structural origin of this sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). The biochemical basis for the rapamycin resistance of RBCs is unclear, but it is intriguing that pharmacokinetic studies have reported that rapamycin preferentially accumulates in RBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yatscoff et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yatscoff, 1996</xref>). This has been proposed to result from the elevated expression of (unidentified) rapamycin binding proteins in the erythrocytes. It is thus possible that RBCs express an unusual complement of FKBPs that blunt rapamycin's ability to block mTORC1 signaling. This would provide an explanation for why the widespread clinical use of rapamycin as an immunosuppressant is not associated with a concomitant impairment of erythropoiesis.</p><p>There is considerable interest in the potential of mTOR inhibitors for the treatment of cancer. While rapamycin analogs have been used clinically for more than a decade, the first ATP competitive mTOR inhibitors are currently in the early-stage clinical trials. A key question for these drugs is how their side-effect profile will compare to widely used rapalogs. Some studies have shown that ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors actually have weaker effects on lymphocytes than rapamycin, suggesting that these drugs may be safer and less immunosuppressive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Janes et al., 2010</xref>). Our data by contrast indicate that ATP competitive mTOR inhibitors block erythropoiesis much more potently than rapamycin, particularly under conditions of erythropoietic stress. Consistent with these data, anemia has been identified as a dose-limiting toxicity in some patients enrolled in the phase I trial of MLN0128 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Infante et al., 2012</xref>). As impairment of erythropoiesis is a common side effect of many chemotherapies, it will be important to monitor how these drugs interact with ATP competitive mTOR inhibitors that potently block RBC function. These data also suggest the need for further studies of patients on these medications in clinical settings where hematopoiesis may be disrupted.</p><p>The results reported here demonstrate how the transcriptional profiling of activated cells can reveal the cell types that respond to specific stimuli. A basic challenge for biology is to understand how complex physiologic processes emerge from the action of individual cell types, genes, and pathways. Advances in mouse genetics have made it possible to test hypotheses about the function of genes in specific tissues using methods such as Cre-lox recombination. Yet, the existence of thousands of distinct cell types in mammals suggests a need for new approaches to prioritize and guide this effort. In this paper and a companion report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Knight et al., 2012</xref>), we have described a new way to map biochemical events onto cell types within a complex tissue. Our approach is based on capturing RNA from cells in proportion to a biochemical signal such as mTORC1 activation, and then using RNA sequencing to quantify this signal across numerous cell-type-specific marker genes in parallel. We have previously used this technique to identify neurons in the mouse brain that are activated during a behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Knight et al., 2012</xref>). In this study, we describe how this same approach has revealed a critical role for mTORC1 signaling in a hematopoietic cell type that was only a trace contaminant in our original experiments. These studies illustrate how unbiased genomic approaches such as RNA sequencing can be powerfully repurposed to measure the functional activity of cell types in a complex tissue. We believe the broader application of these approaches has the potential to transform how biologists monitor and analyze complex physiologic systems.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials</title><p><italic>Vav-iCre</italic> (#008610), <italic>hCD2-iCre</italic> (#008520) <italic>Tsc1</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup> (#005680), and <italic>Rptor</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup> (#013188) mice were obtained from Jackson laboratory.

It has been evident for a long time that a high level of protein synthesis is critical to producing hemoglobin in the quantities required in the red cell, and mTOR, which positively promotes translation, has been shown to be inhibited by iron deficiency in RBCs, suggesting a mechanism of coordination between hemoglobin translation and iron availability. However, the specific link and roles of mTORC1 and mTORC2 have not been previously investigated. The authors' findings demonstrate that abnormally high or low mTORC1 activity induces macrocytic or microcytic anemia, respectively. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of mTOR sensitizes mice to hemolytic stress. Moreover, this work yields some surprising findings regarding attenuated effects of rapamycin on S6K signaling (versus effects of MLN0128, an ATP competitive mTOR inhibitor) that are of chemotherapeutic relevance. These findings arose from a serendipitous finding of globin RNAs in rpS6 enriched ribosomes. This indicates the potential sensitivity of this method for identifying rare populations with enhanced mTORC1 activity. The experiments are carefully performed, the data of high quality, and the results support the conclusions.</p><p>1) Does S6 phosphorylation via the mTOR pathway result in altered expression of other erythroid genes in addition to alpha and beta hemoglobin? If available, it would be interesting to see a more complete analysis of mRNAs enriched by pS6 pulldown analyzed with RNAseq. Are all rbc mRNAs similarly selected, or is there a differential effect on a specific subset of mRNAs?</p><p>2) What is the cause of death in TSC-KO mice on an iron deficient diet? The degree of anemia observed in these animals does not seem to be sufficient to explain this mortality.</p><p>3) Vav-Cre tissue specific raptor knockouts die perinatally, apparently as a result of a profound defect in erythropoiesis. Though selective knockout of raptor in the lymphoid compartment does not affect survival, is there evidence for a defect in any other hematopoietic compartment (e.g. the megakaryocyte or granulocyte/macrophage lineage)?</p><p>4) The authors chose Vav-cre mice to reveal the conditional phenotypes, because of variegated effects and incomplete recombination with other erythrocyte or hematopoietic promoters (Results section). However, an erythropoietin receptor (EpoR)-cre line (Blood 104: 659-66, 2004) provides quantitative and exquisite erythroid-specific excision and would have obviated the use of hCD2-Cre mice to exclude potential effects of lymphoid cells. Nonetheless, given the length of time and expense of repeating experiments with this strain, additional experiments of this kind should not be required, given the clear findings in the manuscript.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1 and 2</xref>: S6 is not a direct substrate of mTORC1. In order to strengthen the evidence for mTORC1 activation, the authors should perform Western blotting for S6K1 and 4EBP1, both are direct mTORC1 substrates.</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4">Figures 3B, 4B</xref>: Does the ratio of hemoglobin/total protein change? These data should be presented. Such information will show whether mTORC1 is selectively involved in hemoglobin translation.</p><p>7) Is mTORC1 activated during erythropoietic stress? This can be easily done by Western blotting of pS6 or pS6K1.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01913.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Does S6 phosphorylation via the mTOR pathway result in altered expression of other erythroid genes in addition to alpha and beta hemoglobin?

The degree of anemia observed in these animals does not seem to be sufficient to explain this mortality</italic>.</p><p>We have performed autopsies of two of the TSC-KO mice at 6 months of age (a time after the hematologic analyses that were performed), one on a chow diet and the other on a low iron diet with an iron chelator. As now mentioned in the revised paper, pathologic analyses showed extensive extra-medullary hematopoiesis and phagocytosis of RBCs, which was greater in the iron deficient animal. At six months of age both animals also showed a widely disseminated histiocytic sarcoma in multiple sites. Consistent with this a prior report showed histiocytic sarcoma with increased Tor activity in hematopoietic cells in animals with a Pten knockout in Mx-1 cre mice. (37) This finding is discussed in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) Vav-Cre tissue specific raptor knockouts die perinatally</italic>, <italic>apparently as a result of a profound defect in erythropoiesis.
