mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)–nuclear DNA (nDNA) combinations is desirable but difficult to achieve and would be enabling for studies of mitochondrial-nuclear communication and coordination in controlling cell fates and functions. We developed ‘MitoPunch’, a pressure-driven mitochondrial transfer device, to deliver isolated mitochondria into numerous target mammalian cells simultaneousl<italic>y</italic>. MitoPunch and MitoCeption, a previously described force-based mitochondrial transfer approach, both yield stable isolated mitochondrial recipient (SIMR) cells that permanently retain exogenous mtDNA, whereas coincubation of mitochondria with cells does not yield SIMR cells. Although a typical MitoPunch or MitoCeption delivery results in dozens of immortalized SIMR clones with restored oxidative phosphorylation, only MitoPunch can produce replication-limited, non-immortal human SIMR clones. The MitoPunch device is versatile, inexpensive to assemble, and easy to use for engineering mtDNA–nDNA combinations to enable fundamental studies and potential translational applications.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Mitochondria are specialized structures within cells that generate vital energy and biological building blocks. Mitochondria have a double membrane and contain many copies of their own circular DNA (mitochondrial DNA), which include the blueprints to create just thirteen essential mitochondrial proteins.</p><p>Like all genetic material, mitochondrial DNA can become damaged or mutated, and these changes can be passed on to offspring. Some of these alterations are linked to severe and debilitating diseases. Both the double membrane of the mitochondria and their high number of DNA copies make treating such diseases difficult. A successful therapy must be capable of correcting almost every copy of mitochondrial DNA. However, the multiple copies of mitochondrial DNA create a problem for genetic research as current techniques are unable to reliably introduce particular mitochondrial mutations to all types of human cells to investigate how they may alter cell function.</p><p>Sercel, Patananan et al. have developed a method to deliver new mitochondria into thousands of cells at the same time. This technique, called MitoPunch, uses a pressure-driven device to propel mitochondria taken from donor cells into recipient cells without mitochondrial DNA to reestablish their function. Using human cancer cells and healthy skin cells that lack mitochondrial DNA, Sercel, Patananan et al. showed that cells that received mitochondria retained the new mitochondrial DNA. The technique uses readily accessible parts, meaning it can be performed quickly and inexpensively in any laboratory. It further only requires a small amount of donor starting material, meaning that even precious samples with limited material could be used as mitochondrial donors.</p><p>This new technique has several important potential applications for mitochondrial DNA research. It could be used in the lab to create large numbers of cell lineswith known mutations in the mitochondrial DNA to establish new systems that test drugs or probe the interaction between mitochondrial and nuclear DNA. It could be used to study a broad spectrum of biological questions since mitochondrial function is essential for several processes required for life. Critically, it could also be used as a starting point to develop next-generation therapies capable of treating inherited mitochondrial genetic diseases in severely affected patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitochondrial dna</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial transplantation</kwd><kwd>MitoCeption</kwd><kwd>MitoPunch</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial

genome coordination regulates metabolism, epigenome modifications, and other processes vital for mammalian cell survival and activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Patananan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ryan and Hoogenraad, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Singh et al., 2017</xref>). Together, these genomes encode &gt;1100 mitochondrial proteins, with only 13 essential electron transport chain (ETC) proteins encoded within the mtDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Calvo and Mootha, 2010</xref>). The mitochondrial proteins encoded in the mtDNA and the nDNA must be compatible to support mitochondrial ETC activity. Mutations in mtDNA can impair the ETC by altering nDNA co-evolved ETC complex protein interactions, causing defective cellular respiration and debilitating diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Greaves et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, the coordination of these two genomes to transcribe, translate, and potentially modify appropriate levels of their respective gene products to maintain energetic and metabolic homeostasis is essential to the proper functioning of the ETC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wolff et al., 2014</xref>). As a result, methods that enable pairing of specific mtDNA and nDNA genotypes in tractable systems are key to understanding the basic biology of mitonuclear interactions and their implications for health and disease.</p><p>Our current inability to edit mtDNA sequences is a roadblock for many studies and potential applications. For example, endonucleases targeted to the mitochondrion inefficiently eliminate and cannot alter mtDNA sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bacman et al., 2018</xref>). An exciting new bacterial cytidine deaminase toxin generates a limited repertoire of point mutations in the mtDNA; however, its efficiency remains low and it is unable to knock-in new gene sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Mok et al., 2020</xref>). Mitochondrial transfer between cells in vitro and in vivo provides a potential path forward for transplanting existing mtDNA sequences; however, the mechanisms controlling such transfers remain unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Torralba et al., 2016</xref>). Isolated mitochondrial transfer has been used to deliver mitochondria to a range of recipient cell types in vitro and even in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Caicedo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Emani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kitani et al., 2014</xref>); however, most studies using these methods observe only short-term changes to cell or organ performance and function. A small number of these studies have coincubated mitochondria with recipient cells and observed permanent retention of the exogenous mtDNA in mtDNA-deficient (so-called ‘ρ0’) cells using large doses of mitochondria or antibiotic selection schemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clark and Shay, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Patel et al., 2017</xref>), although these approaches may not be possible when mitochondrial donor material is limited or does not possess a suitable selection marker.</p><p>Methods that deliver mitochondria directly into ρ0 cells can increase stable mitochondrial transfer efficiency and employ a wider range of mitochondrial donor sources. Such methods include membrane disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">King and Attardi, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wu et al., 2016</xref>) or fusion with enucleated cytoplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wilkins et al., 2014</xref>). However, these methods are typically laborious, low-throughput, or depend on cancerous, immortal recipient cells lacking physiologic mitochondrial activity. An interesting recent study did report one desired mtDNA–nDNA clone and 11 false-positive clones using cybrid fusion with replication-limited cells, an achievement hampered by a low generation rate with unknown reproducibility or generalizability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wong et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>There exist clinically relevant methods to replace the mtDNA of human cells, such as somatic cell nuclear transfer and pronuclear transfer that involve delivering nuclear genetic material from patients with mtDNA diseases into enucleated oocytes with non-mutant mtDNA genotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hyslop et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tachibana et al., 2013</xref>). These methods hold potential for replacing deleterious mtDNA for the unborn, but they are technically challenging, low-throughput, dependent on high-quality patient samples, and prone to contamination by mutant mtDNA from the affected nuclear source material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kang et al., 2016</xref>). Higher-throughput techniques that exchange non-native for resident mtDNAs in non-immortal somatic cells in tissue culture could enable studies of mtDNA–nDNA interactions and replace deleterious mtDNAs within cells with therapeutic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Patananan et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, a higher throughput, reproducible, and versatile mtDNA transfer approach to generate multiple desired ‘stable isolated mitochondrial recipient’ (SIMR) clones in replication-limited cells remains essential for statistically valid studies and potential translation of mitochondrial transplantation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MitoPunch mechanism uses fluid pressure to disrupt the plasma membrane</title><p>We developed ‘MitoPunch’ as a simple, high-throughput mitochondrial transfer device consisting of a lower polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) reservoir loaded with a suspension of isolated mitochondria, covered by a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) filter seeded with ~1 × 10<sup>5</sup> adherent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). MitoPunch uses a solenoid-activated plunger to transfer isolated mitochondria in a holding chamber by force into the cytosol of mammalian cells. Upon actuation, a mechanical plunger deforms the PDMS from below, which, as calculated by numerical simulation, generates pressure up to 28 kPa inside the PDMS chamber, propelling the suspension through numerous 3 µm pores in the PET filter. This pressure cuts the plasma membrane of recipient cells sitting atop the pores and delivers mitochondria into the cytoplasm of the cut cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To assess performance, we compared MitoPunch to mitochondrial coincubation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kitani et al., 2014</xref>) and to MitoCeption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Caicedo et al., 2015</xref>), a method that uses centripetal force generated in a centrifuge to localize mitochondria to recipient mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In MitoCeption, a 1500 × <italic>g</italic> centripetal force draws isolated mitochondria to a recipient cell monolayer. We calculate that the suspended mitochondria exert a pressure of ~1.6 Pa on recipient cell membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) (see Materials and methods).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Pressure simulations of mitochondrial transfer tools.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of MitoPunch apparatus. Recipient cells (1 × 10<sup>5</sup>) are seeded on a porous polyester (PET) membrane ~24 hr before delivery.

ImageStream spot count analysis of 143BTK– ρ0 recipient cells showed MitoPunch delivered a lower mean and median number of dsRed spots per cell than coincubation or MitoCeption. MitoPunch transfers into BJ ρ0 recipient cells yielded fewer mean spots/cell compared to coincubation and MitoCeption with an equivalent median number of spots/cell for MitoPunch and MitoCeption and slightly more for coincubation. Next, we used confocal microscopy to observe dsRed mitochondrial fluorescence in 143BTK– ρ0 recipients fixed 15 min post-transfer, which we chose for its robust mitochondrial acquisition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We visualized mitochondrial localization with confocal microscopy by detecting dsRed protein from the donor mitochondria, shown in red, and labeling the recipient cell plasma membranes with either CellMask Green (coincubation and MitoCeption) or wheat germ agglutinin (MitoPunch), shown in green. Following MitoPunch, mitochondrial dsRed appeared to localize to pores in the filter insert and within the cytoplasm of cells, whereas coincubation and MitoCeption uniformly coated recipient cells with mitochondria, with greater mitochondrial association with recipient cells following MitoCeption. While all three methods initiate physical interactions between mitochondria and recipient cells, MitoPunch delivers mitochondria to the basal membranes of recipient cells at regions associated with the PET membrane pores, compared to a diffuse membrane association pattern seen with coincubation and MitoCeption.</p><p>To investigate the capacity of these methods to disrupt recipient cell plasma membranes, we delivered the membrane impermeant dye propidium iodide (PI) by coincubation, MitoPunch, and MitoCeption to measure membrane disruption from delivery and quantified uptake by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Novickij et al., 2017</xref>). Delivery into 143BTK– ρ0 cells by MitoPunch and MitoCeption resulted in similar percentages of PI-positive recipient cells, and both were greater than coincubation. Interestingly, BJ ρ0 cells showed comparable fractions of PI-positive cells to the 143BTK– ρ0 after coincubation and MitoCeption. However, MitoPunch yielded an approximately fivefold increase in the PI-positive fraction compared to all other conditions. These data show that MitoPunch and MitoCeption disrupt the plasma membranes of recipient cells for potential mitochondrial transfer, and the degree of disruption is cell type and delivery method dependent.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Stable retention of transplanted mtDNA</title><p>After verifying mitochondrial interaction with recipient cells by coincubation, MitoPunch, and MitoCeption, we next determined whether these methods result in permanent retention of exogenous mtDNA to generate SIMR cells. ρ0 cells cannot synthesize pyrimidines and therefore cannot proliferate or survive without supplemented uridine because of ETC impairment, so we used nucleotide-free medium prepared with dialyzed fetal bovine serum (SIMR selection medium) to select for SIMR cells with transplanted mtDNA and restored ETC activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grégoire et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). BJ ρ0 cells survive longer under this selection scheme compared to the 143BTK– ρ0 (data not shown), so we included an additional selection phase by culturing these cells in nucleotide-free, glucose-free, galactose supplemented medium (galactose selection medium) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Robinson et al., 1992</xref>). We isolated and transferred HEK293T dsRed mitochondria into 143BTK– ρ0 and BJ ρ0 cells by coincubation, MitoPunch, and MitoCeption, performed SIMR selection in cell-type appropriate medium for 7 days, and quantified the number of viable clones by crystal violet staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Coincubation did not generate SIMR clones in 143BTK– ρ0 cells, in contrast to MitoPunch and MitoCeption, which each generated dozens of clones. BJ ρ0 cells with delivered HEK293T mitochondria by coincubation or MitoCeption did not form SIMR clones. MitoPunch generated numerous SIMR clones in both cell types, although fewer BJ ρ0 SIMR clones than in 143BTK– ρ0 cells, whereas MitoCeption only generated clones in 143BTK– ρ0 cells and was unable to form stable clones in replication-limited BJ cells. To assess the risk of mitochondrial donor cells surviving disruption during mitochondrial isolation and generating false positive SIMR clones, we performed three independent mitochondrial isolations, plated an aliquot from each isolation representing mitochondria isolated from ~1.5 × 10<sup>7</sup> HEK293T dsRed cells on 10 cm dishes, and carried these plates through the 10-day selection with SIMR selection medium before crystal violet staining for visual assessment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We developed a MitoPunch device with adjustable plunger acceleration modulated by changing the circuit voltage (ImmunityBio). We generated independent voltage titration curves in 1 V increments (0 V – 5 V) for each cell type in technical triplicate at each voltage and used the same mitochondrial preparation for all samples for each cell type. All prior experiments in this study are controlled by delivering DPBS with calcium and magnesium to recipient cells by MitoPunch, but here we included a 0 V condition in which the seeded filter insert was positioned atop the PDMS reservoir and pressed against an aliquot of isolated mitochondrial suspension similar to deliveries with force, but without actuating the piston. We achieved maximum 143BTK– ρ0 SIMR clone generation with this tunable MitoPunch at 1 V, with a sharp reduction to background with increasing voltage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The BJ ρ0 recipient also showed maximal SIMR generation at 1 V, with a shallow decline in SIMR generation efficiency to 5 V. Surprisingly, the 0 V condition consistently yielded a few SIMR clones in the 143 BTK– ρ0 recipients and inconsistently in the BJ ρ0 recipients. This result suggests that the pressure generated by sealing the filter insert against the PDMS reservoir is sufficient to generate SIMR clones at a low frequency. For all forthcoming MitoPunch trials we use the variable voltage MitoPunch device set to 1 V.</p><p>We performed a similar force titration with MitoCeption by varying the maximum centripetal force, using a common mitochondrial preparation for all samples of both cell types. In 143BTK– ρ0 cells, we observed maximum clone generation at 1000 × <italic>g</italic> and 1500 × <italic>g,</italic> and we did not generate BJ ρ0 SIMR clones greater than the 0 × <italic>g</italic> background at any acceleration tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This background, present in both 143BTK– ρ0 and BJ ρ0 conditions at 0 × <italic>g,</italic> is likely from rare un-lysed donor cells from mitochondrial preparations directly pipetted into the culture medium of recipient cells during MitoCeption. We have infrequently observed imperfect donor cell lysis , usually in larger mitochondrial preparations, that results in rare, persistant dsRed fluorescent colonies as observed by fluorescence microscopy. True SIMR clones cannot produce the dsRed protein from donor mitochondria and lose fluorescence with time over selection, while these persistent dsRed colonies maintain their fluorescence over the same period (data not shown). Despite this occasional low-level contaminating donor cell background, MitoCeption yielded a strong dose-dependent response in SIMR clone generation from 143BTK– ρ0 recipients above the background. Additionally, MitoPunch deliveries into B16 ρ0 mouse melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tan et al., 2015</xref>) yielded maximal SIMR generation at a different voltage than in the human cell lines tested, showing that optimal mitochondrial delivery pressure may be cell type dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). These data suggest that MitoPunch is uniquely able to generate SIMR clones in replication-limited fibroblasts and SIMR generation efficiency depends on delivery pressure.</p><p>We next quantified the reproducibility of our mitochondrial preparation technique and the MitoPunch procedure by performing triplicate MitoPunch transfers using three independent mitochondrial preparations from equal numbers of HEK293T dsRed biological replicate populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">4</xref>). We define biological replication here as mitochondrial preparations derived from independently cultured populations of mitochondrial donor cells. Mitochondrial preparations 1, 2, and 3 (same as those pictured in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) generated consistent protein concentrations, and each preparation yielded dozens of SIMR clones in all three technical replicate MitoPunch deliveries with the exception of Prep 3, which resulted in two lower efficiency replicates. We quantified the number of SIMR clones generated per microgram of mitochondrial mass loaded into the MitoPunch apparatus and observed a similar trend. These results showed that our mitochondrial isolation technique produced consistent levels of isolated mitochondrial mass and that the MitoPunch technique yielded high numbers of SIMR clones.</p><p>To enable desirable mtDNA–nDNA clone generation using limited starting material, such as mitochondria from rare cell subpopulations, we determined the minimal mass of mitochondrial isolate required to generate SIMR clones. We performed coincubation, MitoPunch, and MitoCeption transfers into ~1 × 10<sup>5</sup> 143BTK– ρ0 recipient cells using decreasing concentrations of dsRed mitochondria isolated from HEK293T cells and plated half of the recipient cell population on 10 cm plates. We observed a similar dose-dependent relationship between mitochondrial mass delivered and SIMR clones observed for MitoPunch and MitoCeption across 0.16 µg, 1.6 µg, and 16 µg total mitochondrial protein suspended in 120 µL of 1× DPBS, pH 7.4 transfer buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). These results showed that although MitoPunch and MitoCeption generate SIMR clones from transformed recipient cells with similar efficiency per microgram of mitochondrial isolate delivered, the differences inherent to the two protocols rendered direct comparisons of their relative efficiencies less meaningful.</p><p>Moving the seeded PET filter from a 12-well dish to the MitoPunch apparatus often resulted in excess medium being carried to the PDMS reservoir. Combined with the small volume of mitochondrial preparation delivered to the recipient cells, we observed that MitoPunch resulted in diluted residual mitochondrial isolate left in the reservoir post-transfer. In the interest of conserving mitochondrial material, we tested whether a used 120 µL aliquot of isolated mitochondria can be applied to repeated MitoPunch transfers to generate SIMR clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>). We performed 11 sequential deliveries into 143BTK– ρ0 cells using one aliquot of mitochondrial isolate and found maximal SIMR clone generation from the first and second deliveries, after which we observe a sharp reduction in SIMR cell formation and inconsistent SIMR generation rate up to the 11th transfer. These data showed that multiple MitoPunch transfers can be performed using a single aliquot of mitochondrial suspension when material is limited.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>SIMR cells rescue ρ0 mitochondrial respiration and network morphology</title><p>Finally, we measured mitochondrial function in SIMR cells by quantifying the rate of oxygen consumption and assessing mitochondrial morphology.

MitoPunch generates up to hundreds of SIMR clones in both transformed and Hayflick-limited recipient cells by exerting a pressure sufficient to perforate mammalian cell membranes in regions small enough to be repaired within minutes, which sustains cell viability and resumed cell growth and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boye et al., 2017</xref>). We have generated SIMR clones by MitoPunch with mitochondria isolated by a commercially available kit, as performed here, as well as by using standard mitochondrial isolation buffers. Additionally, we achieved similar results by disrupting mitochondrial donor cells using Dounce homogenization (data not shown) but found the commercially available kit with syringe disruption is advantageous due to its ease of use, reproducibility, and a reduced number of steps to isolate mitochondria. We generated dozens of SIMR clones by MitoPunch and MitoCeption using these mitochondrial isolation methods and anticipate that other mitochondrial preparation techniques will also yield SIMR clones.</p><p>Interestingly, we do not observe SIMR clone generation by coincubation in our study. Few reports show limited stable clone formation by coincubation techniques, but these studies used up to 100-fold higher levels of exogenous mitochondria in coincubation experiments than required for MitoPunch or MitoCeption in our hands, or antibiotic selection schemes to achieve stable mitochondrial transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clark and Shay, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Patel et al., 2017</xref>). High levels of mitochondrial protein are easily isolated from fast-growing immortalized cell lines but may not be available when using human donor-derived or other limiting starting material. Additionally, mitochondrial donor cells of interest nearly exclusively lack antibiotic selection markers, making such selection schemes unfeasible. Particularly in those cases, the greatly enhanced SIMR generation capacity of MitoPunch and MitoCeption is strongly enabling for generating desired mtDNA–nDNA combinations.</p><p>The distinct mechanisms and procedures of MitoPunch and MitoCeption make direct comparisons of their relative efficiencies challenging. Despite this, our results demonstrate that both techniques generate SIMR clones from ρ0 transformed cells in a mitochondrial dose-dependent fashion and can be readily adopted by laboratories studying mtDNA–nDNA interactions. Strikingly, in the cell types we have tested, we find that only MitoPunch generates SIMR clones from ρ0 primary, non-immortal cells. Studies in our laboratory suggest that the transcriptome and metabolome of replication-limited SIMR clones differ significantly from un-manipulated control clones but can be recovered and reset to un-manipulated control levels by cellular reprogramming to induced pluripotent stem cells and subsequent differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Patananan et al., 2020</xref>). These results indicate that SIMR clone generation in replication-limited, reprogrammable cells is crucial for studies of mtDNA–nDNA interactions involving mitochondrial transplantation into ρ0 cells, and that MitoPunch is uniquely capable of efficiently generating enough clones for statistically valid studies in such work. We have circumvented the need for ρ0 recipient cells by using the MitoPunch technology to completely replace mutant mtDNA in mouse cells without mtDNA depletion. This was done by delivering mitochondria containing mtDNA with a chloramphenicol resistant point mutation and selecting for SIMR clones containing only rescue mtDNA using antibiotic supplemented nucleotide-free medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dawson et al., 2020</xref>). However, this workflow is dependent upon using antibiotic resistant mitochondrial donor cells and is not applicable to investigating the full spectrum of mtDNA sequences required for robust studies of mtDNA–nDNA interactions. Future work with MitoPunch and other isolated mitochondrial transfer modalities will be improved by developing techniques to avoid fully depleting the mtDNA of recipient cells of interest before generating SIMR clones for downstream analysis and applications.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

(VWR, Radnor, PA, Cat. # 45000–652), and 50 mg/L uridine (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat. # AC140770250). All other human cell lines were grown in DMEM (Fisher Scientific, Cat. # MT10013CM) supplemented with 10% FBS, non-essential amino acids, GlutaMax, and penicillin and streptomycin. B16 ρ0 cells were grown in RPMI (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat. # MT-10–040 CM) supplemented with 10% FBS, non-essential amino acids, GlutaMax, penicillin and streptomycin, pyruvate (Corning, Corning, NY, Cat. # 25000 CI), and 50 mg/L uridine. L929 cells were grown in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS, non-essential amino acids, GlutaMax, penicillin and streptomycin, and pyruvate. All mammalian cells were cultured in a humidified incubator maintained at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The following cells were used in this study: HEK293T dsRed (female), 143BTK– (female), 143BTK– ρ0 (female), BJ ρ0 (male), B16 (male), and L929 (male). We have not formally identified these cell lines; however, we have sequenced their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA for polymorphisms and find unique sequences which we use for genotyping our cultures (unpublished data). BJ ρ0 cells were used as mitochondrial recipients within three passages of thaw for all mitochondrial transfer experiments in this work to avoid the onset of senescence. All lines were routinely tested for mycoplasma with negative results.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Mitochondrial isolation</title><p>Mitochondria were isolated from ~1.5 × 10<sup>7</sup> mitochondrial donor cells per mitochondrial transfer using the Qproteome Mitochondrial Isolation Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany, Cat. #37612) with slight alterations to the manufacturers protocol. Mitochondrial donor cells were harvested using a cell scraper (Fisher Scientific, Cat. # 08-100-241) and collected in 50 mL conical tubes at approximately 6 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells per tube (Thermo Scientific, Cat. #12-565-271). Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4°C and washed with DPBS before pelleting again by centrifugation at 500 × <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4°C. Cells were resuspended at 1 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells/mL in ice-cold Lysis Buffer with Protease Inhibitor Solution and incubated for 10 min at 4°C in 2 mL tubes on an end-over-end shaker. Lysates were centrifuged at 1000 × <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4°C and supernatant was aspirated. Pellets were resuspended in 1.5 mL ice-cold Disruption Buffer with Protease Inhibitor Solution and mechanical disruption was accomplished by 10 passes through a 26 G blunt ended needle (VWR, Radnor, PA, Cat. # 89134–164) attached to a 3 mL syringe (VWR, Cat. # BD309657). The subsequent lysates were centrifuged at 1000 × <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4°C and the supernatants were transferred to new 2 mL tubes. The resultant supernatants were centrifuged again at 1000 × <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4°C to remove any remaining intact cells, and the supernatants were transferred to clean 1.5 mL tubes. These supernatants were centrifuged at 6000 × <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4°C and the supernatants were aspirated. The resulting mitochondrial pellets were resuspended in mitochondrial storage buffer and pelleted by centrifugation at 6000 × <italic>g</italic> for 20 min at 4°C. The isolated mitochondrial pellets were resuspended in 120 µL per transfer replicate 1× DPBS with calcium and magnesium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat. # 14040133) immediately prior to mitochondrial transfer and kept on ice.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Mitochondrial coincubation</title><p>~1 × 10<sup>5</sup> 143BTK– ρ0 or BJ ρ0 cells were seeded into wells of 6-well dishes ~ 24 hr prior to delivery. Mitochondria isolated from ~1.5 × 10<sup>7</sup> HEK293T dsRed cells resuspended in 120 µL 1× DPBS with calcium and magnesium were pipetted into the culture medium of each well containing recipient cells and incubated at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 2 hr. Cells were then released from the dish using Accutase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat. # A1110501) and seeded into 10 cm plates for SIMR cell selection or harvested for additional analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>MitoPunch apparatus construction</title><p>A 5 V solenoid (Sparkfun, Boulder, CO, Cat. # ROB-11015) is screwed into a threaded plug (Thor Labs, Newton, NJ, Cat. # SM1PL) and inserted into a bottom plate (Thor Labs, Cat. # CP02T) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The solenoid is regulated by a Futurlec mini board (Futurlec, New York, NY, Cat. # MINIPOWER) and powered by a MEAN WELL power supply (MEAN WELL, New Taipei City, Taiwan, Cat. # RS-35–12). Optomechanical assembly rods (Thor Labs, Cat. # ER3) are inserted into the bottom plate. The middle and top plates (Thor Labs, Cat. # CP02) are threaded through the assembly rods. The middle plate is fitted with a retaining ring, which supports an aluminum washer (outer diameter, 25 mm; inner diameter, 10 mm). The middle plate is secured along the assembly rods using the included screws. The retaining ring is adjusted such that the top surface of the washer is at the same height as the piston surface in its retracted state. A flexible PDMS (10:1 ratio of Part A base: Part B curing agent) (Fisher Scientific, Cat. #NC9644388) reservoir consisting of a bottom layer (25 mm diameter, 0.67 mm height) bonded to an upper ring (outer diameter, 25 mm; inner diameter, 10 mm; height, 1.30 mm) is placed on top of the washer. This reservoir can contain up to ~120 µL of liquid. To perform MitoPunch delivery, a 3 µm membrane transwell insert (Corning, Cat. # 353181) seeded with 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> adherent cells is lowered through the top plate and rested atop one retaining ring. The insert is secured to the top plate by an additional retaining ring. This assembly is lowered until the base of the insert contacts the top surface of the PDMS reservoir and is secured in place with screws to form a tight seal. In addition, a variable voltage version of this device based on the same principles with identical delivery procedures as MitoPunch, but with tunable plunger acceleration achieved by varying actuator voltage, was engineered by ImmunityBio and is available upon request to the corresponding author. Optimal MitoPunch delivery voltage for individual cell lines is determined empirically by performing a voltage-response curve in technical triplicate across a range of voltages from 1 V to 5 V using the piston acceleration control software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Seeding cells for MitoPunch mitochondrial transfer</title><p>Filter inserts with 3 µm pores (Corning, Cat. # 353181) are placed in wells of a 12-well dish. 1.5 mL warm uridine supplemented medium is dispensed in the wells outside of the filter insert, and 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> adherent cells suspended in 0.5 mL warm uridine supplemented medium are seeded within the filter inserts and placed in a humidified incubator maintained at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> 1 day prior to mitochondrial delivery.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>MitoPunch mitochondrial transfer</title><p>Following mitochondrial isolation, the MitoPunch apparatus is sterilized with 70% ethanol and entered into the biological safety cabinet and an autoclaved PDMS reservoir is placed in the device as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. The PDMS reservoir is washed 3× with 120 µL sterile DPBS with calcium and magnesium after being set in the MitoPunch apparatus. 120 µL mitochondrial suspension from ~1 × 10<sup>7</sup> donor cells in DPBS with calcium and magnesium is loaded into the PDMS reservoir. Mitochondrial transfer is performed by securing the seeded membrane to the PDMS reservoir and actuating the solenoid for 3 s. The mechanical plunger strikes the middle of the PDMS chamber, displacing the base layer by ~1.3 mm. This displacement pressurizes the mitochondrial suspension and propels it through the membrane and into the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Once the solenoid has returned to its starting position, the insert is removed from the apparatus, placed back in the 12-well dish in its original medium, and incubated at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 2 hr. Cells were then released from the dish using Accutase and seeded into 10 cm plates for SIMR cell selection or harvested for additional analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Collecting mitochondrial recipient cells following MitoPunch transfer</title><p>Following MitoPunch mitochondrial transfer and 2 hr incubation, medium is aspirated from within the transwell filter with care taken not to disrupt the cells on the membrane, and then from outside and underneath the filter insert. The well and insert are washed 1× with DPBS (0.5 mL inside the insert and 1 mL outside the insert) with DPBS aspirated as before. Cells are released from the membrane by 5 min incubation at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> with Accutase (0.5 mL inside the insert and 1 mL outside the insert). Following incubation, the cells are suspended in the Accutase within the filter insert using a P1000 pipette, being careful not to puncture the PET membrane, and directly pipetted into 10 cm plates with 10 mL warm uridine supplemented medium.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>MitoCeption</title><p>As described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Caicedo et al., 2015</xref>), 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> recipient cells were seeded in each well of a 6-well dish and incubated at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> overnight.

Samples were then permeabilized by 10 min RT incubation in 0.1% Triton-X 100 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, Cat. # X100). Permeabilized samples were washed 3× with 1× DPBS and then incubated for 1 hr at RT with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) dissolved in 1× DPBS blocking buffer. Blocking buffer was aspirated and cells incubated for 1 hr at RT with a 1:1000 dilution of primary antibodies in 2% BSA blocking buffer against dsDNA (Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom, Cat. # ab27156) and TOM20 protein (Abcam, Cat. # ab78547), and then washed 3× with 5 min 1× DPBS incubations. Cells were then incubated with secondary antibodies (Invitrogen, Cat. # A31573 and A21202) diluted 1:100 in 2% BSA blocking buffer protected from light for 1 hr at RT. After incubation with secondary antibodies, samples were washed 3× with 5 min 1× DPBS incubations and mounted on microscope slides.</p><p>To mount, samples were removed from the 6-well dish and rinsed by dipping in deionized water, dried with a Kimwipe, and mounted using ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, Cat. # P3691) or ProLong Glass Antifade Mountant with NucBlue Stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat # P36985) on microscope slides (VWR, Cat. # 48311–601). Samples were dried at RT protected from light for 48 hr prior to confocal imaging with a Leica SP8 confocal microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) and later analyzed with either LAS X Lite 3.7.1.21655 (Leica) for two-dimensional image preparation or Imaris File Converter 9.5.1 (Oxford Instruments, Abingdon, United Kingdom) and Imaris Viewer 9.5.1 (Oxford Instruments) for Z-stack analysis.</p><p>To perform confocal imaging on cells immediately following mitochondrial transfer, 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells were plated in 6-well dishes with 2 mL of media on glass coverslips for coincubation and MitoCeption or seeded onto 12-well filter inserts as described above for MitoPunch ~24 hr prior to delivery. Immediately prior to mitochondrial transfer, coincubation and MitoCeption samples were stained with 1× CellMask Green PM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, Cat. # C37608) diluted in warm medium for 10 min and washed twice in DPBS, and MitoPunch samples were stained with 5 µg/mL Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated Wheat Germ Agglutinin (Invitrogen, Cat. # W11261) diluted in warm media for 10 min and washed twice in DPBS. Following delivery, culture medium was removed and 1 mL freshly diluted 4% paraformaldehyde in 1× DPBS, pH 7.4, was pipetted onto samples and incubated for 15 min at RT. Paraformaldehyde was aspirated and samples were washed 3× with 1× DPBS, pH 7.4. Samples were further washed with DPBS 3× with 5 min RT incubation per wash. MitoPunch filters were removed from the plastic insert using an inverted P1000 pipette tip. Samples were mounted and imaged as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>OCR measurements</title><p>OCR measurements were performed using a Seahorse XFe96 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). 2 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells were seeded into each well of a V3 96-well plate (Agilent, Cat. # 101085–004) and cultured 24 hr before measuring OCR. The Agilent Seahorse mitochondrial stress test was used to quantify OCR for basal respiration and respiration following the sequential addition of the mitochondrial inhibitors oligomycin, carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP), and antimycin A. Data were analyzed using the Wave 2.6.2 software package (Agilent).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>PI staining, delivery, and flow cytometry</title><p>Cells (1 × 10<sup>5</sup>) were plated for delivery and incubated overnight. Media was changed to FluorBrite DMEM media (ThermoFisher Scientific, Cat. # A1896701) with 3 µM PI (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat. # P1304MP) immediately before transfer. MitoCeption and coincubation were carried out as described above, and MitoPunch was performed with PI FluorBrite medium loaded into the PDMS reservoir and incubated for 15 min at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. All samples were washed with 1× DPBS and collected using Accutase. Samples were collected in flow cytometry tubes and centrifuged 5 min at 500 × <italic>g</italic>. Samples were washed with 1× DPBS with 5% FBS three times and analyzed on a BD Fortessa flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and data were processed using FlowJo 10.6.2 (BD Biosciences).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>All information pertaining to experimental replication are found in the figure legends.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Matt Kaeberlein as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Scott R Kennedy (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Research into certain aspects of mitochondrial biology has been limited by a lack of robust methodology for introducing isolated mitochondria into recipient cells. To date, well-validated mitochondrial transfer methods have been highly specialized and extremely low throughput in nature. Sercel et al. describe a novel mitochondrial transfer technology that uses a plunger actuated mechanism to ballistically deliver isolated mitochondria into mtDNA-deficient recipient cells. They report evidence that transferred mitochondria are stably integrated into the recipient cell and compare this new approach to the previously described MitoCeption technology. The technique works in both immortalized and primary cell lines, with mitochondria persisting in numerous clones derived from individual cells. Furthermore, the authors provide data demonstrating a failure of mitochondrial transfer via simple co-incubation, an important observation.</p><p>Overall, this is an exciting new technique, and should be of high interest to researchers who study mitochondrial disease or the basic biology of mitochondria. However, there are a number of issues that should be addressed prior to publication.</p><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>1) Methodologic and technical details are insufficient in the current manuscript. We remind the authors that for this type of manuscript, &quot;The article should fully describe the tool or resource so that prospective users have all the information needed to deploy it within their own work… methodological advances need to be comprehensibly described, along with details of the reagents and equipment, and their sources.&quot; Please provide detail, including improved diagrams and instructions, sufficient so that independent will be able to reproduce the approach. Where values may need to be empirically determined by other laboratories (such as how to determine the ideal voltage) details should be provided in how to approach the issue. In addition, authors need to note the approximate passage number/population doubling of the primary cells used and verify that they were similar between comparisons, as onset of senescence would undoubtedly have a dramatic impact of success in these assays. Figure legend and text also need more detail – for example, in Figure 4, it can be assumed that immune staining was used for TOM20 detection, and in section “ SIMR cells rescue ρ0 mitochondria network morphology and respiration” needs to state how mtDNA was imaged. Readers should not have to reference methods for these simple details.</p><p>2) Experiments showing stable incorporation of functional mitochondria were performed in uridine-free media to select for cells with mitochondria. Authors should demonstrate that mitochondria remain following passage in uridine-containing media. This data may in fact be present in the freeze-thaw culture experiments, but needs to be explicitly stated – it is not clear which media was used in those assays.</p><p>3) Additional information is needed regarding the mitochondrial isolation methodology, and data showing variability between mitochondrial preparations is necessary, rather than just technical replicates from the same isolation. It is impossible to know if the preparation used is an outlier in terms of performance, and it is important to know how reproducible the entire technique is. In regard to the technique, providing the kit used is simply not sufficient, particularly given that the brief description provided does not seem to match with the kit protocol available online. Further, one reviewer expressed concern that without these details we cannot be confident that contaminating donor cells weren't present in the isolated mitochondria, which may survive and outcompete mitochondrial deficient cells. It would also be useful to indicate, at least in the Discussion, what impact different methods of mitochondrial isolation are expected to have on success in these procedures.</p><p>4) The first data section, “ Mitochondrial delivery into transformed and primary cells”, should be re-worded. The data does not assess delivery INTO cells, as suggested by the prose; rather, the data presents co-association after 2 hours. The subsequent data demonstrates that actual delivery into cells does not correlate with the co-staining shown in this section, and the SEM data indicates that co-incubation simply results in an extracellular coating of mitochondria. The subsequent data clearly show a lack of actual transfer using co-incubation. I believe this is what the authors intended.</p><p>5) There are a few issues with Figure 3. In the titration experiments, the interpretation is not supported. The authors show that co-staining by flow cytometry does not mean mitochondria were taken into recipient cells, so in Figure 3G the right half of the panel is not useful and the 4-fold increase in efficiency is a misrepresentation. The data currently shown is “SIMR colonies per 104 cells that show co-staining with ds-RED”, not “recipient cells”. It is not clear that MitoPunch actually outperforms MitoCeption. The left half of the panel would suggest they perform similarly in this cell type. Truthfully, given the distinct properties of these two methods, it may not be reasonable to try to directly compare their relative efficacy in such a manner. It is sufficient to show they both work well and in a mitochondrial-mass dose-dependent manner, whereas co-incubation fails at all mitochondrial mass concentrations. Given the current state of the field, the new technique is still exciting, even if it has not been tested alongside MitoCeption in a way which allows direct head to head comparisons of efficacy. Future studies may delve deeper into the cell type, conditions, etc, where each technique best performs, but if the authors wish to claim here that MitoPunch is superior, additional data will be needed. It is assumed by the reviewer, but needs to be clarified/confirmed, that in the Figure 3G experiments the same cell number was used.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63102.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>1) Methodologic and technical details are insufficient in the current manuscript.

We additionally clarified that the same number of cells were seeded for each replicate in Figure 3—figure supplement 5.</p></body></sub-article></article>
