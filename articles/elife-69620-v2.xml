when considering dynamics studies or super-resolution imaging. We have recently evolved specific protein-based binders for PSD-95, the main postsynaptic scaffold proteins at excitatory synapses. Since the synthetic recombinant binders recognize epitopes not directly involved in the target protein activity, we consider them here as tools to develop endogenous PSD-95 imaging probes. After confirming their lack of impact on PSD-95 function, we validated their use as intrabody fluorescent probes. We further engineered the probes and demonstrated their usefulness in different super-resolution imaging modalities (STED, PALM, and DNA-PAINT) in both live and fixed neurons. Finally, we exploited the binders to enrich at the synapse genetically encoded calcium reporters. Overall, we demonstrate that these evolved binders constitute a robust and efficient platform to selectively target and monitor endogenous PSD-95 using various fluorescence imaging techniques.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>protein labeling</kwd><kwd>intrabodies</kwd><kwd>fluorescence imaging</kwd><kwd>super-resolution imaging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-13-BS07-0019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mackereth</surname><given-names>Cameron D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-16-CE16-0026</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sainlos</surname><given-names>Matthieu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Dyn-Syn-Mem 787340</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Choquet</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-19-CE11-0025</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chamma</surname><given-names>Ingrid</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Compans</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Engineering new intrabodies allows to develop selective and non-interfering tools for the visualization of endogenous PSD-95 with advanced imaging techniques.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fluorescence microscopy constitutes nowadays an essential method for cell biologists to monitor the localization and function of most proteins. The discovery of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and its application as a gene-fused reporter, together with the progress that followed with the isolation and evolution of variants that span the close-UV to near-IR spectrum with various photo-physical and -chemical properties, have largely contributed to the wide spreading of this approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rodriguez et al., 2017</xref>). Alternative labeling methods such as those relying on engineered enzymes have further expanded the possibilities of imaging approaches by allowing the direct coupling of high-performance organic dyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lavis, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xue et al., 2015</xref>). In parallel, technical breakthroughs in imaging methods have allowed to overcome the diffraction limit and are now enabling optical imaging of biological samples at the nanoscale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sahl et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schermelleh et al., 2019</xref>). However, while these advances have expanded the scope of application of fluorescence imaging techniques, they have also generated a pressing need for improved labeling strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choquet et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Indeed, the capacity to accurately investigate by fluorescence imaging the dynamics of endogenous proteins still constitutes a technical challenge. Antibodies, when available, can only be used against ectodomain-presenting proteins and still suffer from their large size and divalency. In parallel, the main drawbacks of most alternative labeling strategies for proteins (fluorescent protein, enzyme, or tag genetic fusions) are associated with non-physiological regulation of the modified gene expression level and the potential impact of the fusion on the protein of interest function. Recent developments in gene-editing methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bukhari and Müller, 2019</xref>) provide efficient means to circumvent the issue of expression level by directly modifying the endogenous gene, but their implementation is still not straightforward and furthermore intrinsically involves modifying the target protein with a fluorescent tag that can alter its function.</p><p>In this context, with the recent progress in directed evolution techniques, recombinant small domain binders capable of specifically recognizing endogenous proteins without impairing their function constitute a promising avenue for the development of minimally invasive and interfering labeling probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bedford et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Helma et al., 2015</xref>). The increasing diversity in terms of validated molecular scaffolds, such as antibody fragments (scFv or V<sub>H</sub>H) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Muyldermans, 2021</xref>) or other domains (DARPins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boersma and Plückthun, 2011</xref>], monobodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sha et al., 2017</xref>], affimers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tiede et al., 2017</xref>], etc.), provides a large variety of randomized surfaces that can recognize and bind virtually any protein of interest. In addition to their recombinant nature, which facilitates their characterization and allows further engineering – notably to convert them into fluorescent probes – these tools importantly alleviate the need to directly alter the gene of interest. Additionally, their small size allows to bring fluorophores coupled to the engineered evolved domain in close proximity of the targeted protein for advanced imaging techniques.</p><p>Two recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fukata et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gross et al., 2013</xref>) have applied such a strategy to PSD-95, the major postsynaptic scaffold protein at excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheng et al., 2006</xref>), by evolving recombinant binders as key recognition modules for developing imaging probes. PSD-95 plays a key role in organizing receptors, ion channels, adhesion proteins, enzymes, and cytoskeletal proteins at excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Won et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>). As a consequence, up- or downregulation of PSD-95 results in critical alterations in synapse morphology and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Won et al., 2017</xref>). In particular, overexpression of fluorescent protein-fused PSD-95 for imaging purposes is phenotypically marked and leads to an increase in dendritic spine number and size, as well as frequency and amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) and affects synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">El-Husseini et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nikonenko et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang and Lisman, 2012</xref>). PSD-95 constitutes therefore an ideal candidate for developing labeling strategies that do not affect the protein expression levels. By exploiting evolved binders, a single-chain variable fragment (PF11) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fukata et al., 2013</xref>) and a <sup>10</sup>FN3-derived domain/monobody (PSD95.FingR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gross et al., 2013</xref>), the two groups have been able to directly label endogenous PSD-95. However, in both cases, the precise epitopes remain non-characterized, and, furthermore, one of the binders, PSD95.FingR, can also recognize SAP97 and SAP102, two closely related proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gross et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2018</xref>). The latter point may constitute a clear limitation, and, additionally, the lack of defined epitopes questions the possibility of PSD-95 function perturbation.</p><p>Using a phage display selection approach with a <sup>10</sup>FN3-derived library, we have recently isolated and characterized three monobodies targeting PSD-95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rimbault et al., 2019</xref>). The clones were targeted against PSD-95 tandem PDZ domains and showed remarkable specificity for PSD-95, in particular when considering the high-sequence conservation of paralogs (SAP97, SAP102, and PSD-93). Importantly, all the clones recognized epitopes situated outside of the PDZ domain-binding groove in regions not subjected to post-translational modifications. These properties represent a prerequisite to identify binders having a minimal impact on the tandem domain function and consequently on the full-length protein. As such, they constitute ideal candidates to engineer and develop minimally interfering imaging probes to monitor endogenous PSD-95.</p><p>We describe here the exploitation of specific PSD-95 binders as a platform to develop a series of labeling tools for the endogenous synaptic scaffold protein as well as excitatory synapses targeting modules. We first evaluated the potential impact of each evolved <sup>10</sup>FN3 domain binding on PSD-95 function as well as their capacity to be exploited as intrabody-type imaging tools. The selected binders were further engineered to allow their use in various super-resolution imaging (SRI) modalities (stimulated emission depletion [STED], photoactivation localization microscopy [PALM], and DNA-PAINT). Finally, beyond their direct exploitation as PSD-95 reporters, we validated the strategy to use their binding properties to enrich and address protein-based sensors to the postsynaptic density with the genetically encoded calcium reporter GCaMP6/7f (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dana et al., 2019</xref>). We termed the approach ReMoRA (Recombinant binding Modules for minimally interfering Recognition and Addressing of endogenous protein targets) as a sub-class of the intrabody general use with applications in fluorescence imaging where emphasis is set on the absence of interference with the targeted protein function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Impact of Xph15/18/20 on PSD-95 PDZ domains function</title><p>We have recently selected and isolated <sup>10</sup>FN3-derived clones that bind to the tandem PDZ domains of PSD-95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rimbault et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Three of the evolved <sup>10</sup>FN3 domains, which displayed specific recognition of the target, were characterized in depth in particular with respect to the identification of their respective epitope. Two monobodies (Xph15 and Xph20) shared a similar epitope situated on PDZ domain 1 on the opposite side of the surface compared to the canonical functional region of the domain. Indeed, as protein–protein interaction modules, the principal function of PDZ domains is to bind the C-terminus of their protein partner via a defined solvent-exposed groove. The third monobody (Xph18) presented an extended epitope that spread on both domains 1 and 2, also in regions distant from the two binding grooves. As the three evolved binders did not directly block the two PDZ domain-binding sites, we envisaged their use as minimally interfering targeting modules.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Evaluation of the impact of evolved <sup>10</sup>FN3 domains binding on the PDZ domains function.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) PSD-95 domain organization and binding models of the three clones investigated.

We first used in-solution NMR to evaluate whether the PDZ domain-binding properties to cognate ligands were affected by the presence of either of the clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). A peptide derived from the C-terminus of a known PSD-95 PDZ domain binder, the auxiliary AMPA receptor (AMPAR) subunit stargazin (Stg), was titrated against a <sup>15</sup>N-labeled PSD-95 tandem construct containing PDZ domains 1 and 2. In addition, the peptide was titrated against the same <sup>15</sup>N-labeled PSD-95 construct pre-bound with either Xph15, Xph18, or Xph20. A series of 2D <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC spectra were used to follow PSD-95 residues during each titration, and in all cases residues on both PDZ1 and PDZ2 were able to fully interact with the Stg peptide. Qualitatively, each of the reporter residues shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> has similar titration behavior and final crosspeak positions in the <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC spectra, and therefore supports the fact that the peptide binding is generally unaffected by the presence of the binders. Conversely, by looking at residues at the PSD-95 and binder interface, the added Stg peptides also did not detectably affect the binding of the Xph monobodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results confirm the simultaneous binding of both PDZ domain ligand and monobody and indicate that the PDZ domain-binding properties are not detectably modified in the presence of the evolved Xph binders.</p><p>In parallel, we also set up fluorescence polarization assays to determine the binding affinity of representative PSD-95 PDZ domain ligands in the presence or absence of the monobodies. To this end, we used FITC-labeled peptides derived from the last 15 amino acids of stargazin as probes and the recombinant tandem PDZ domains 1 and 2. In order to minimize the effects of varying concentrations of the PDZ domains and the clones, we performed competition assays at constant concentrations of the monobodies, the PDZ domains, and the reporter probe. The potential effect of the evolved <sup>10</sup>FN3 domain binding was first assessed using a divalent ligand titrated with a non-fluorescent divalent competitor both derived from stargazin as a model for complex multivalent interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sainlos et al., 2011</xref>). Competitions performed in the absence of ligand or with a naïve clone (Xph0 that does not bind PSD-95) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rimbault et al., 2019</xref>) were similar to the ones obtained with Xph15 and 20. In contrast, the presence of Xph18 impaired binding of the fluorescent divalent probe. This effect was abolished, in agreement with the NMR observations, by the use of monovalent stargazin-derived probe and competitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results suggest that the observed inhibitory effect results from the conformational constraints imposed on the two domains orientation by Xph18 binding rather than from the blocking or direct impairment of the PDZ domain-binding ability.</p><p>Together, the NMR study and the fluorescence polarization assay indicate that the binding of, on the one hand, Xph clones and, on the other hand, PDZ domain ligands are independent events that are not detectably affected by long-range conformational modifications. However, we note that due to the constraints imposed by Xph18 binding on the conformational flexibility of the two PDZ domains, certain complex interactions may be impaired.</p><p>Next, we investigated whether these properties were preserved in complex cellular environments. We therefore evaluated by a FRET/FLIM assay in cell lines the binding of PSD-95 to its partners (represented here by stargazin) via its PDZ domains in the presence and absence of the monobodies. We used both the recombinant full-length proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>) as well as a reporter system that focused on interactions mediated by PDZ domains 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). In both cases, even at high molar ratio, we could not detect any significant effect on the measured donor lifetime associated with the binding of either Xph15, Xph18, or Xph20. For the full-length PSD-95 system, the median lifetimes obtained in the presence of the three clones, even at a fivefold molar ratio in the transfected plasmids, were within the variability observed in the presence of a naïve clone (Xph0, between 2.0 and 2.1 ns). On the contrary, co-transfection of a soluble PDZ domain (PSD-95 second PDZ domain, termed here competitor) clearly increased the lifetime to 2.3 ns. Results with the FRET probe based on PDZ domains 1 and 2 were comparable, with an absence of significant modification of the probe lifetime in the presence of the monobodies in comparison to a mutant of the probe in which the PDZ domain-binding motif was deleted (Probe off). A moderate effect was observed by statistical analysis in the case of Xph18, which could be attributed to the constraint imposed by its binding to both PDZ domains 1 and 2. In agreement with the NMR and fluorescence polarization experiments, these results therefore indicate that the primary function of PSD-95 PDZ domains as protein–protein interaction modules is not detectably affected by the interaction with any of the three recombinant binders in a model cellular environment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Impact of Xph15/18/20 on PSD-95 function</title><p>The main function of PSD-95 is to organize transmembrane receptors such as glutamate receptors at the postsynaptic density and link them to intracellular signaling molecules. Among these, the PSD-95 PDZ domain-mediated interactions with AMPARs through the TARP auxiliary subunits have been particularly well characterized. We and others have previously shown that impairment of the interactions by genetic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bats et al., 2007</xref>) or chemical means (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sainlos et al., 2011</xref>) resulted in a reduction of AMPAR synaptic currents and increased lateral mobility.</p><p>In order to rule out any possible effect of the monobodies on endogenous PSD-95 properties, we first evaluated in hippocampal neuron primary cultures whether the presence and binding of the Xph monobodies could impact AMPAR organization and function. To this end, and anticipating exploitation of the evolved <sup>10</sup>FN3 domains as fluorescence imaging tools, we expressed the clones as fusions to eGFP in association with the expression regulating system developed for the abovementioned PSD95.FingR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gross et al., 2013</xref>). The probe regulation is achieved by fusion of a transcription repressor and a zinc finger in combination with the incorporation of the corresponding zinc finger-binding motif upstream of the reporter gene in the expression plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). In this system, while eGFP is used to monitor the binding module and its target, the regulation system allows to avoid overexpression of the recombinant binder compared to its endogenous target.</p><p>We first investigated whether the AMPAR-mediated synaptic currents were affected by the presence of the various monobodies. Comparison of control eGFP-infected mouse neurons to neurons infected with Xph15, Xph18, or Xph20 did not reveal any significant difference on spontaneous mEPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–e</xref>). The mean amplitude values were not modified by the presence of any of the PSD-95 binders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, control: 21.3 ± 2.1 pA [n = 19]; Xph15: 24.9 ± 3.9 pA [n = 15]; Xph18: 21.3 ± 2.0 pA [n = 17]; Xph20: 18.0 ± 2.2 pA [n = 16]; mean ± SEM with p&gt;0.4 for the three clones using nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Dunn’s post hoc test).

We note that when similar measurements were performed in transfected rat hippocampal neurons none of the mEPSC parameters that we measured were significantly modified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Rat pyramidal neurons were either infected with eGFP or Xph20-eGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>) and lysed after 14 d of expression. PSD-95 was immunoprecipitated under mild conditions to preserve protein complexes and each sample was trypsin-digested and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. When comparing the two conditions, eGFP or Xph20-eGFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>), the abundance of most identified proteins was globally unaffected (abundance ratio close to 1 and/or low statistical significance with p-values above 0.05). All known PSD-95 partners that were identified in the two independent experiments (~40 identified partners per experiment) fell in that category. Less than 20 proteins showed both a clear change in abundance (absolute log2(abundance ratio) above 1.5) coupled to a significant p-value (below 0.05). None were reported as PSD-95 partner and most were only detected in only one of the two experiments. Only vimentin (Vim) and the glial fibrillary acidic protein (Gfap) were identified in both experiments; however, given their nature and function, the link to PSD-95 seems unlikely. In conclusion, in agreement with absence of detectable effect on AMPA receptors, the PSD-95 interactome appears unaffected by Xph20-eGFP expression.</p><p>Altogether, these experiments indicate that the binding of neither Xph15, Xph18, nor Xph20 affects endogenous PSD-95 function in its native environment as judged by the absence of impact on AMPAR properties and conservation of its interactome. These results are therefore consistent with the nature of each clone’s respective epitope, which are found on regions of PSD-95 not involved in the PDZ domain binding of native cellular protein partners.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Evaluation of Xph15/18/20 as endogenous PSD-95 imaging probes</title><p>The absence of any detectable effect of Xph clone binding on PSD-95 function constituted an obligatory first criterion to consider their use as a non-interfering imaging probe. As the three monobodies comply with this criterion (albeit with some reservation for Xph18), we next focused on confirming their capacity to label endogenous PSD-95 and on evaluating their specific properties as fluorescent probes. First, we assessed the ability of Xph15, 18, and 20 to bind and target a fluorescent protein to PSD-95 in primary hippocampal neuron culture. Neurons were transfected with the previously tested Xph-eGFP fusions (or PSD95.FingR-eGFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gross et al., 2013</xref>], from which the expression vector was derived, as a comparison) chemically fixed after 23–27 days in vitro (DIV) and immunostained for PSD-95 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). For all the binders tested, the eGFP signal was similarly strongly enriched on dendrites at postsynapse-like structures. The objects we observed presented in all cases a mean intensity enrichment ratio compared to the rest of the dendrite around 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>; PSD95.FingR: 6.4 ± 3.0; Xph15: 6.4 ± 1.4; Xph18: 7.4 ± 2.1; Xph20: 8.4 ± 2.1; mean ± SD with p&gt;0.72 by ordinary one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple-comparison tests). This indicates that the four binders behave similarly in their capacity to address a fluorescent protein reporter to specific regions in neuronal cells. We next analyzed in each case how these objects colocalized with the labeling obtained by immunostaining of endogenous PSD-95 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a, c and d</xref>). In general, colocalization percentage values ranged from 0 to 100, which we attribute to the inherent differences of the two staining methods being compared (i.e., expressed reporter vs antibody labeling post-fixation and permeabilization). The colocalization of PSD-95-positive objects detected by antibody immunostaining with the puncta revealed by the four investigated probes was overall strong (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>, PSD95.FingR: 75.4 ± 30.9; Xph15: 98.4 ± 4.8; Xph18: 95.5 ± 11.1; Xph20: 95.2 ± 13.4; mean ± SD with p&lt;0.0001 for PSD95.FingR vs the other binders by ordinary one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple-comparison test), in agreement with reported values for PSD-95.FingR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cook et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gross et al., 2013</xref>). Remarkably, the values obtained for the three Xph clones were significantly higher than for PSD95.FingR. This trend was also visible when considering the colocalization between eGFP and antibody-stained objects, with Xph clones clearly showing a stronger enrichment in high colocalization values compared to PSD95.FingR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, PSD95.FingR: 65.8 ± 38.9; Xph15: 95.7 ± 15.8; Xph18: 92.3 ± 19.2; Xph20: 93.5 ± 16.8; mean ± SD with p&lt;0.0001 for PSD95.FingR vs the other binders by ordinary one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple-comparison test). We interpret this difference as a direct benefit from the specificity of the Xph clones for PSD-95 while PSD95.FingR, which can also bind SAP97 and SAP102, may also report to some extent the presence of these two paralog proteins. Considering the generally strong overlap of the GFP signal with the immunostaining of endogenous PSD-95, we conclude that the three monobodies label PSD-95 efficiently.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Evaluation of monobodies as intrabody fluorescent reporter probes.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Representative epifluorescence images of the eGFP-fused binding modules vs immunostaining of endogenous PSD-95 domain.

We chose the recently described mScarlet-I as one of the brightest red reporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bindels et al., 2017</xref>). Despite several attempts, we failed at expressing the Xph20-mScarlet-I fusion in transfected cultured neurons as a result of a toxicity not observed for the eGFP constructs. Transfer of the Xph20-mScarlet-I fusion into a non-regulated plasmid resulted in non-toxic expression of the probe, albeit at a higher level compared to PSD-95 endogenous expression levels. It therefore led to a homogeneous filling of the whole neuron volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This indicates that the toxicity is here a consequence of the association of mScarlet-I with the regulation system. Replacement of mScarlet-I with another bright monomeric red fluorescent protein, mRuby2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lam et al., 2012</xref>), abolished the observed toxic effect and provided a similar staining compared to Xph-eGFP fusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>While these surprising results suggest that not all fluorescent proteins are compatible with the expression regulation system, they also highlight the critical need to match the target expression levels for imaging applications. In particular, as reported for PSD95.FingR, the expression regulation system applied to the Xph binders allows for long expression schemes without excessive or detectable over-production of the probe. This possibility in turn provides flexibility to handle the timing of the genetically encoded probe delivery without compromising the achieved labeling steady state.</p><p>The binding kinetics of the Xph clones previously evaluated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) showed different but overall rather fast association and dissociation rate constants indicating fast exchanging complexes (half-lives of ~2, 28, and 10 s for Xph15, Xph18, and Xph20, respectively, for the isolated recombinant PSD-95 PDZ domains 1 and 2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rimbault et al., 2019</xref>). These kinetic profiles were also associated with moderate affinities with binding constants in the low micromolar (4.3 and 2.6 µM for Xph15 and 18, respectively) to sub-micromolar range (330 nM for Xph20). We therefore sought to further evaluate how these properties would translate in the context of their use as PSD-95 labeling tools. To this end, we used fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to determine how the different probes interact with their target in its native environment. Fluorescence recovery was measured in photobleached single synapses (Xph objects) in neurons expressing the Xph-eGFP fusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). As expected, on the minute timescale, the three monobodies showed fast exchange rates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) as well as high mobile fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; 75, 71, and 76% for Xph15, Xph18, and Xph20, respectively) compared to the values reported in basal conditions for PSD-95-GFP knock-in (~10% after 60 min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fortin et al., 2014</xref>]) or to the values obtained here with a transfected PSD-95-eGFP (37%). The measured mobile fractions and the half-lives (~16, 71, and 70 s for Xph15, Xph18, and Xph20, respectively) are consistent with the SPR kinetics measurements, with Xph15 being the fastest and Xph18 the slowest. We note that the results we obtained here for the probes account for the behavior of both the free and the PSD-95-bound populations. However, considering the large difference between the values obtained for the probes and for PSD-95, we can reasonably conclude that the Xph-derived probes exchange and are being renewed at a faster rate than their target.</p><p>We have previously shown that the three selected monobodies were specific binders of PSD-95 with no detectable interaction with its paralogs (PSD-93, SAP97, and SAP102). Structural and binding investigations on isolated tandem PDZ domains as well as full-length proteins in model cell line were consistent with the recognition of an epitope unique to PSD-95 (around key residue F119, which is replaced by an arginine in all other paralogs). In order to confirm that these advantageous properties were conserved when used as intrabodies to label endogenous PSD-95 in its native environment, we used a knock-down approach with a short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-targeted against PSD-95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schlüter et al., 2006</xref>). We focused here on the two most promising binders, Xph15 and Xph20. Hippocampal rat neurons were transfected with the anti-PSD-95 shRNA or a control scramble shRNA together with either Xph15-eGFP or Xph20-eGFP. Neurons were fixed after 4–5 d of expression and immunostained for PSD-95. Our experimental conditions were designed in order to avoid potential issues associated with shRNA overexpression and were characterized by heterogeneity in the levels of PSD-95 knock-down. While the conditions with the scramble shRNA led to a labeling very similar to what was obtained previously in its absence, the use of the shRNA against PSD-95 was associated with a clear and consistent loss of signal, in particular no detectable puncta, both for the two Xph intrabodies and the corresponding antibody labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a–c</xref>). PSD-95 knock-down effect manifested itself by an eGFP fluorescence signal almost exclusively nuclear indicating the absence of cytosolic target for intrabodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>) and was quantitatively observed both in detected objects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>) and over entire dendritic segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>) demonstrating the specific recognition of endogenous PSD-95 by Xph15 and Xph20.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Evaluation of Xph15 and Xph20 intrabodies specificity.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Representative epifluorescence images showing Xph15-eGFP (top) and Xph20-eGFP (bottom) expressed in pyramidal neuron together with a scramble shRNA or the shRNA against PSD-95 both associated to a mCherry soluble fluorescent reporter (magenta).

To further characterize this correlation, we co-expressed Xph15-eGFP or Xph20-eGFP with a PSD-95 mScarlet-I fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). Systematic analysis of the two fluorescence signals (eGFP and mScarlet-I) indicated strong correlation, with Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.84 and 0.87 for Xph15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>) and Xph20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>), respectively. These results illustrate the combined efficiency of the two Xph and the regulation system to match the intrabodies’ levels to those of PSD-95.</p><p>Overall, this ensemble of results demonstrates first that Xph15, Xph18, and Xph20 can be used to efficiently recognize and bind endogenous PSD-95 with minimal impact on its function. In addition, the fusion of a fluorescent protein to the monobodies (together with the use of an expression regulation system) allows in this context to dynamically label PSD-95 in live conditions. The resulting labeling of PSD-95 is clearly specific and correlates strongly with the levels of the target protein, as demonstrated for both Xph15 and Xph20. Considering the large epitope recognized by Xph18, which as we have shown leads to a constrained conformation of the tandem PDZ domains, we chose here to only focus on Xph15 and Xph20 that both recognize a smaller epitope restricted to PDZ 1 to further develop the imaging tools and fully ensure minimal interference of the resulting probes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Engineering probes for super-resolution imaging</title><p>The previous experiments validated the use of Xph-derived constructs as imaging probes to monitor endogenous PSD-95. The specific recognition properties of the evolved <sup>10</sup>FN3 domains coupled to the capacity to match their expression levels to those of PSD-95 therefore provide an ideal platform to further elaborate our clones into more advanced probes, in particular for SRI applications. To this end, we modified the GFP reporter part of the probes with systems better adapted for various SRI modalities.</p><p>We first investigated how the probes performed with STED microscopy. STED is a point-scanning method that relies on the simultaneous use of both an excitation and a depletion laser beam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sahl et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vicidomini et al., 2018</xref>). Since the technique is compatible with a number of fluorescent proteins, its implementation is here relatively straightforward. A first attempt to determine whether expression levels were compatible with STED imaging was performed on fixed cultured neurons expressing Xph20-eGFP. Without the need to improve the fluorescent protein part, the results were satisfactory with a clear gain in resolution when comparing STED and confocal imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a and b</xref>).</p><p>In comparison to other imaging techniques, one of the main advantages of STED is the compatibility with live imaging, in particular for dynamic studies. While alternative methods exist to label endogenous PSD-95 post-fixation/permeabilization, live labeling of PSD-95 still remains a challenge for which Xph15 or Xph20 can provide solutions. A major drawback of STED is the high illumination intensities required in particular for efficient depletion that often results in photobleaching of the fluorophore. In this context, the fast-exchanging properties of the probes could be an advantage and allow, by fast renewal of the probes, repeated acquisitions of the same region.</p><p>For live experiments, we therefore used the fastest exchanging binder, Xph15, to fully benefit from maximal probe replacement. In parallel, the fluorescent protein eGFP was replaced by mNeonGreen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shaner et al., 2013</xref>) for its higher quantum yield and improved photostability. The Xph15-derived probe expressed well and provided a labeling similar to the eGFP construct in live dissociated neurons as judged by confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a–c</xref>). Despite the improved properties of mNeonGreen, application of a STED illumination invariably led to significant photobleaching of the area investigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Nevertheless, the imaged area was repopulated over time with fresh probes as could be anticipated from the FRAP experiments. About 70% of the initial fluorescence was recovered in less than 15 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>), allowing the area to be efficiently imaged repetitively. We note however that while the confocal imaging quality was comparable to the one obtained prior to the STED imaging, in that timescale, the STED quality was still noticeably degraded due to the loss of signal. Avoiding the repeated confocal imaging as well as reducing the area of STED imaging could be simple strategies to further improve the fluorescence recovery by limiting the photobleaching associated with unnecessary light exposition and by locally increasing the pool of intact probes vs photodamaged ones.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Evaluation of probes for stimulated emission depletion (STED) imaging.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic representation of fluorescent protein-fused STED probe.

To effectively functionalize our probes with such dyes, we replaced the fluorescent protein by a SNAP-tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Keppler et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>) and used a cell-permeant silicon rhodamine fluorophore (SiR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lukinavičius et al., 2013</xref>) coupled to benzylguanine added prior to the imaging session. The SNAP-tag probe behaved comparably to the eGFP version, and synaptic objects, hallmark of PSD-95 neuronal distribution, could be visualized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). Efficiency of the STED imaging was improved by the use of the brighter SiR dye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f and g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1c and d</xref>). Photostability and dynamic exchange of the probe allowed to perform timelapse acquisitions at about a 1 min (50 s) frequency with minimal impact on the STED signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>), thereby illustrating the advantage of organic dyes over fluorescent proteins for such applications.</p><p>Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) is another strategy used to access spatial resolution below the limit imposed by the diffraction of light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sauer and Heilemann, 2017</xref>). It relies on temporal decorrelation of fluorophore emissions to obtain sparsely located fluorescent entities while keeping the majority of the population in non-emissive states. One strategy to perform SMLM is photoactivation localization microscopy (PALM) based on the use of photoactivatable or photoconvertible fluorescent proteins. To implement this imaging modality, we thus replaced eGFP with the monomeric photoconvertible protein mEos3.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). We considered Xph20 as the binding module for its stronger affinity and slower off-rate kinetics.

The results confirmed that a large majority of the investigated emitters were immobile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a–d</xref>). The reconstructed maps showed a clear enrichment of the probe at synapses as already observed with diffraction-limited imaging techniques and STED. Further analysis of the synaptic objects using the Tesselation-based segmentation method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Levet et al., 2015</xref>) revealed a non-homogeneous distribution with the presence of higher density clusters. The clusters represented about half the number of detections measured for the whole synaptic objects. A tentative estimation of single-emitter contribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1e</xref>, median ~10 detections) suggests the presence of ~200–300 probe copies per synaptic objects. This value is consistent with reported estimations of PSD-95 synaptic copies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sugiyama et al., 2005</xref>) and therefore suggests a close to stoichiometric labeling of the endogenous protein. Morphological analysis of the objects and clusters provided dimensions consistent with previous reports for PSD-95-mEos2 fusions with PALM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nair et al., 2013</xref>) or by STORM by labeling endogenous PSD-95 with antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Compans et al., 2019</xref>) (length: 434.5 ± 39.9 and 178.0 ± 39.3 nm; width: 251.1 ± 39.2 and 99.1 ± 22.4 nm for the objects and clusters, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). Together, these results indicate that Xph20-mEos3.2 provides an accurate snapshot of PSD-95 nanoscale distribution in fixed samples.</p><p>PALM can also be performed on live samples, and single-particle tracking approaches yield in this case information on protein dynamics. This approach is typically achieved with a direct genetic fusion between the protein of interest and a photoconvertible fluorescent protein. Considering the efficiency of the evolved <sup>10</sup>FN3 domain-mediated labeling, we investigated here how this approach could be implemented with Xph20-mEos3.2. Indeed, single emitters are tracked on a timescale over an order of magnitude faster (~500 ms) than the probe-target exchange dynamics (half-life of ~10 s), which should avoid bias linked to the occurrence of particles alternating between PSD-95 bound and unbound states.</p><p>Tracked particles were detected within the whole dendrite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f–h</xref>). As observed previously with other imaging techniques, a strong enrichment of the probe was observed at the synapse when reconstructing the intensity maps corresponding to the accumulation of track coordinates. The probe diffusion coefficient showed a Gaussian-like distribution, which suggests a homogeneous population, with ~80% of particles confined or immobile and only ~20% mobile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6i</xref>). These results are highly similar to those obtained with a mEos2-fused (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chazeau et al., 2014</xref>) or a mVenus-fused PSD-95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fortin et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that, in these conditions, we are essentially detecting probes bound to PSD-95. Indeed, a freely diffusive emitter, such as an unbound probe, would be characterized by faster diffusion coefficients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chazeau et al., 2014</xref>) that could not be detected in these experimental conditions. Importantly, single-particle-tracking-PALM measurements could be repeated over the course of 30 min without detectable differences in the diffusion distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6j</xref>), demonstrating that the method is robust and compatible with hour timescale live investigations such as needed for synaptic plasticity events.</p><p>Considering the compatibility of our probes with STED and PALM, we next investigated their implementation to more recent SRI techniques adapted to the detection of multiple distinct targets. DNA-PAINT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jungmann et al., 2014</xref>) constitutes a powerful alternative approach to STORM or PALM for SMLM, in particular for multiplexing applications, as it allows sequential imaging of different proteins of interest with the same fluorophore. The technique is based on the use of pairs of short complementary oligonucleotides, one strand bound to a target or its probe (docking strand) and the other functionalized with a fluorophore (imager strand), that undergo fast dynamic exchange between the bound and unbound states. In order to couple the docking strand to the Xph-derived probes, we considered here the use of either SNAP- or HaloTag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Los et al., 2008</xref>) to enzymatically create a covalent bound with benzylguanine- or haloalkane-derived oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schlichthaerle et al., 2019</xref>). For the binding module, as for PALM, we chose Xph20 for its stronger affinity.</p><p>Each construct was co-transfected with a soluble eGFP marker in dissociated culture hippocampal neurons and used to implement the DNA-PAINT method after chemical fixation. The self-labeling tags were each reacted with the corresponding docking strand and after removal of the excess material, the Cy3B-derived imaging strand was applied to the samples. A control experiment in which no docking strand was added confirmed the very low level of non-specific binding of the imaging strand in our conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1a</xref>). For the HaloTag fusion, a homogeneous staining of the transfected neurons was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1b</xref>), suggesting a failure either of the target recognition or of the regulation system with this particular engineered enzyme. The reason for this failure was not investigated further. We note that the larger size of the HaloTag (34 kDa vs 20 or 27 kDa for the SNAP-tag and fluorescent proteins, respectively) might impair efficient nuclear entry of the excess fusion protein product. In contrast, and consistently with the STED experiments, the SNAP-tag fusion allowed an efficient labeling with a clear synaptic enrichment comparable to the ones obtained with the other validated fusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Evaluation of SNAP-tag-derived probes for DNA-PAINT super-resolution microscopy.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Probe design and labeling scheme (BG: benzylguanine).

Taking advantage of both their unique paralog-specific recognition properties and their respective epitopes all situated on regions distant from the PDZ domain-binding groove, we have first confirmed that binding to their target was not detectably affecting the PDZ domains nor the full-length protein function. Their use as ReMoRA endogenous PSD-95 probes in the form of fusions to fluorescent proteins was then evaluated in comparison to both antibodies and a similar – but not specific – monobody. The tools were next further engineered to adapt them for SRI applications. We demonstrated that the resulting probes could be exploited with STED, PALM, and DNA-PAINT techniques to provide nanoscale mapping as well as dynamics information on endogenous PSD-95. Finally, we also showed that the binders can be employed to enrich active protein-based modules, such as calcium fluorescent reporters, at the excitatory postsynapse.</p><p>The three monobodies we considered in this study were all selected primarily based on their capacity to discriminate PSD-95 from other strongly homologous paralogs (PSD-93, SAP97, and SAP102). As shown before, this remarkable specificity results from their ability to recognize epitopes situated in regions distant from the targeted PDZ domain-binding groove. Indeed, while the main site of interaction of the PDZ domains with their native protein partners is conserved across paralogs, their sequences are not strictly identical outside of these regions. Consequentially, binding of the PSD-95-specific monobodies does not obstruct the PDZ domain-binding grooves. We show here, however, that while Xph15 and Xph20, which bind exclusively to the first PDZ domain, do not detectably affect the domain nor the full-length protein function, the situation is slightly different for Xph18. Indeed, this evolved <sup>10</sup>FN3 domain presents an epitope that encompasses regions on both PDZ domains 1 and 2. As a result, binding of Xph18 locks the two domains, otherwise free to rotate around a short linker, in a specific conformation. This conformational constraint was only detectably detrimental to the interactions of synthetic divalent PDZ domain ligands. We therefore excluded this binder from imaging applications to avoid potential impact on PSD-95 activity, even if its expression does not seem to affect AMPAR stabilization at synapses nor synaptic currents.</p><p>As previously reported, the Xph15 and Xph20 share very similar epitopes that are not known to engage in any reported PPI with neuronal partners. Importantly, these epitopes are conserved in a number of species (e.g., rodents, human, etc.) and are not subject to post-translational modifications. These features therefore guarantee a large spectrum of applications. Furthermore, we note that in the context of intrabody-like approaches, the <sup>10</sup>FN3 scaffold, from which the binders are derived, is devoid of internal disulfide bonds, typically found, for instance, in antibody fragments, and thereby alleviating the risk of susceptibility to the intracellular reducing environment. Despite the differences in affinities and binding kinetics of Xph15 and Xph20, both allowed an efficient and specific labeling of PSD-95 independently of the associated reporter group (eGFP, mNeonGreen, SNAP-tag, mEos3.2, GCaMP). Xph20, as the tightest binder, should therefore be preferred for most applications. However, the faster binding kinetics of Xph15 can also be exploited to favor rapid renewal of the probes in live conditions, a decisive advantage when photobleaching prevents time-based experiments.</p><p>With the growing access and interest for intrabodies or their synthetic recombinant equivalents, there is a need to develop strategies to adapt the expression level of the probe to its target, in particular in the case of imaging applications. We have opted here for a regulation system developed by the group of Don Arnold for a similar application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gross et al., 2013</xref>). It relies on the use of the excess (unbound) pool of probes to turn off further recombinant gene expression. In other words, the system is efficient if, on the one hand, the targeted protein is not nuclear and, on the other hand, the affinity of the evolved binder for the target is superior to the one of the appended zinc finger for its binding motif incorporated into the expression plasmid. Neuronal proteins that are located on cellular processes (dendrites or axons) are perfectly adapted for this strategy as the inevitable accumulation of fluorescent probes in the nucleus is not problematic for imaging purposes. We have observed here that the regulation system was functional for evolved binding modules with affinities in the 1–0.1 µM range in combination with a highly expressed target such as PSD-95. Indeed, for all probes and imaging techniques the expression profile was consistent with what would be expected from a directly labeled PSD-95 as confirmed by the strong colocalizations observed for the intrabodies and anti-PSD-95 antibody staining, the strong correlation obtained with FP-fused PSD-95 as well as by an estimation of synaptic copy number by PALM consistent with the literature. Furthermore, spt-PALM analysis on the millisecond timescale revealed a major population of probes in a mildly diffusive state, as would be expected from PSD-95-bound reporters.</p><p>We note, however, that while most of the reporter cargos we tried were compatible with this approach, the specific use of mScarlet-I and HaloTag resulted in the failure of the regulation system for reasons that are still unclear. The group that developed the regulation system has demonstrated that two orthogonal zinc finger systems could be used in concert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gross et al., 2013</xref>). Alternative methods to regulate the effective expression levels of the probe in tune with the one of its molecular targets would also be highly valuable for multiplexing applications as well as for systems (target, binder or cargo) outside of the optimal conditions mentioned above. Developing probes that undergo fast degradation unless bound to their target constitutes an interesting alternative that has been successfully used for the nanobody scaffold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gerdes et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Keller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tang et al., 2016</xref>). Another strategy for imaging applications would consist in conditioning the resulting fluorescence rather than the probe stability to its target binding by the development of fluorogenic probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wongso et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We have demonstrated here that the probes could be adapted to comply with a number of fluorescence-based imaging techniques. Besides the advantages of the system to monitor endogenous PSD-95 in live or fixed conditions with standard imaging procedures, SRI approaches can also be readily accessed with adequate probe engineering. Live imaging and protein dynamics investigations can be performed by exploiting STED or spt-PALM techniques. In the case of live STED, hour timescale studies will benefit from the straightforward use of most fluorescent protein fusions, whereas for studies that require a faster temporal resolution (minute timescale), coupling of brighter and more photorobust organic dyes can be achieved by the use of the SNAP-Tag. Precise nanoscale mapping of the protein target is accessed in fixed conditions either by STED with most probes, by PALM with photoswitchable fluorescent proteins such as mEos3.2, or by DNA-PAINT with a SNAP-Tag fusion as an anchoring point for the docking DNA strand. This large variety of imaging techniques applied to endogenous proteins highlights the potential of the labeling strategy compared to more conventional labeling schemes using either antibodies or direct genetic fusions. Importantly, we note that the PSD-95 labeling observed with the different microscopy modalities here was reproducible and largely independent of the method used despite the slight differences associated with technical aspects (signal to noise, acquisition procedure, nature of the dye and its associated effective labeling efficiency, etc.). The strategy can be easily implemented to other imaging techniques, and, for instance, STORM imaging could be achieved using either the SNAP-tag or the eGFP-based probes with respectively a BG or anti-GFP nanobody functionalized with dyes possessing photoswitching properties such as those from the Cy5 cyanine family. Importantly, given the central role of PSD-95 in synaptic function, we anticipate that the probes will open up numerous possibilities for investigations against various neuronal targets by providing straightforward solutions for the monitoring of PSD-95 in the context of multi-proteins studies.</p><p>As mentioned above, two other small recombinant PSD-95 binders have been recently reported by other groups in the context of imaging applications. One is a single-chain variable fragment (scFv), PF11, that was isolated against the palmitoylated form of PSD-95 and used as an intrabody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fukata et al., 2013</xref>). While the epitope was not clearly identified, the study showed recognition by the scFv of a conformational variant of PSD-95 that implied both N-terminal palmitoylation and the C-terminal part of PSD-95. Specificity was confirmed against PSD-93, one of the closest PSD-95 paralogs that also possesses a palmitoylation site in its main isoform. The other binder is a monobody, therefore, in the same synthetic recombinant binder scaffold class as Xph15 and Xph20, isolated from a selection performed against the C-terminal domains of PSD-95 (SH3 and guanylate kinase domains) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gross et al., 2013</xref>). The epitope was also not determined in this study, and the isolated monobody, PSD95.FingR, was shown to also recognize SAP97 and SAP102 paralogs but not PSD-93, a property that was exploited to investigate the role of SAP97/Dlg1 in cell polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2018</xref>). In both cases, affinities were not determined but the binders performed efficiently as intrabody-type probes for endogenous PSD-95. However, the absence of defined epitopes for both PF11 and PSD95.FingR does not allow to convincingly rule out possible perturbations of some of PSD-95 functions when any of the two probes is bound. PSD-95 is indeed a multidomain scaffold protein with a long list of identified partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dosemeci et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Won et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>) as well as numerous post-translational regulation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vallejo et al., 2017</xref>), which complicate evaluation of the impact resulting from a recombinant binder interaction. In addition, recent studies support the idea that the protein should not be viewed as a passive scaffolding element of the synapse but rather as an active actor with a capacity to respond to partners binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rademacher et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>). In this context, we note that the results we obtained with Xph18 illustrate the difficulty to establish with certainty whether a recombinant binder may impact the activity of its target even when the epitope is known. Indeed, while we could demonstrate that this particular monobody had a clear impact on PSD-95 conformation suggesting a plausible modification of its behavior in its native environment, we did not observe detectable perturbation of PSD-95 basic functions in basal conditions.</p><p>In comparison to PF11 and FingR.PSD-95, our study shows that Xph15 and Xph20 constitute valuable complementary molecular tools for standard imaging applications based on their unique specificity profile. They recognize both palmitoylated and non-palmitoylated PSD-95 and can discriminate PSD-95 vs its paralogs. Importantly, they present the net advantage of being characterized with respect to the identity of their respective epitope. While this was critical to clarify the molecular origin of the binders specificity for PSD-95, it also allowed us to relevantly adapt their evaluation in order to confirm the absence of impact of the probes on the target protein function. Critically, Xph15 and Xph20 remarkable specificity, as well as their binding properties, has allowed us to engineer the binders as SRI probes to investigate endogenous PSD-95.</p><p>Besides the use of evolved recombinant binders as a strategy to label endogenous PSD-95 in live conditions, a number of genetic approaches have been reported. They all rely on gene-editing methods and are typically used to generate PSD-95 fluorescent protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Broadhead et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fortin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Willems et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>) or engineered self-labeling enzyme fusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Masch et al., 2018</xref>). Comparatively, their main advantages over expressed exogenous probes are the ideal stoichiometric labeling (one fluorophore per target protein, to be tempered by the notion of effective labeling efficiency of the fluorophore; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Thevathasan et al., 2019</xref>) together, for the knock-in approaches, with the possibility to achieve global labeling.</p><p>In contrast, the ReMoRA or intrabody-based approaches benefit from their ease of implementation by relying on standard cell biology techniques for the genetically encoded probe delivery (transfection, electroporation, or virus-mediated delivery). Indeed, gene-editing methods are still not accessible in routine use to most laboratories and are also not amenable to downstream adaptation to various imaging techniques, the possibilities being imposed by the initial choice of the fluorescent module. The modular design of the recombinant binder-based probes provides in turn a system more adapted to engineering and optimization (binding module, fluorescent system, promoter, etc.). Furthermore, we note that the rapid renewal of the probe obtained with the fast kinetics binders can be advantageous for imaging purposes over genetic modification of PSD-95 as its turnover is slow in basal conditions.</p><p>Finally, if we consider altogether the properties of the tools presented here and compare them to existing probes based on other recombinant PSD-95 binders (PF11 and PSD95.FingR) or to other labeling approaches (e.g., gene editing), we can identify a number of biological applications that cannot be currently achieved and that would now become accessible. Indeed, Xph15- and Xph20-derived probes currently constitute the only genetically encoded systems that allow the strict specific detection of endogenous PSD-95 for live and advanced imaging applications with, in addition, a comprehensive description of their target binding properties (epitopes, affinities and kinetics, absence detectable interference, etc.). The latter aspect is critical for ensuring that the tools can be exploited without modifying PSD-95 regulation and function and in turn not lead to artifactual results regardless of whether PSD-95 is the prime object of the investigation or just used as an excitatory postsynapse marker. This also constitutes unvaluable information for further engineering and molecular tool development. Specificity is the other salient feature of our tools, and along these lines, their full potential will be unlocked with their exploitation for comparative studies of the PSD-95 paralogs. As mentioned above, our tools provide an unprecedented access to endogenous PSD-95-specific labeling strategies that can be used in combination with complementary strategies to label PSD-93, SAP102, or SAP97, either existing ones with their respective limitations (antibodies, FP-fusion, etc.) or, ideally, with new sets of intrabodies that would here be specific for each of the other paralogs. A multiplexed ReMoRA approach to label the PSD-95 paralogs would open numerous possibilities for investigating the respective role of each of these major neuronal actors notably by providing access to advance imaging approaches with minimal interference on the targeted endogenous proteins.</p><p>In conclusion, we provide here a set of powerful probes for targeting PSD-95 with main applications for endogenous protein imaging as well as synaptic enrichment of active protein modules such as activity reporters. In comparison to other similar existing tools, the evolved monobodies described here constitute to this day the only binding modules displaying a strict specificity for PSD-95 regardless of its post-translational modification state. The molecular understanding of their mode of binding comforts our results, indicating undetectable perturbation of PSD-95 function. The probes presented here, which benefit from the simplicity of use of the ReMoRA design, provide direct access to different SRI techniques. We anticipate that beyond the direct benefit for nanoscale mapping and (single molecule) dynamics investigations of endogenous PSD-95, these probes will turn invaluable for investigations that require the implementation of multiplexing imaging strategies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key

Simple normalization was performed as follows: FRAP<sub>t</sub> = <italic>F</italic><sub>t</sub> − <italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub>pb</sub> − <italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub>. The mean spine FRAP curve of each cell was subsequently fitted to a monoexponential model using GraphPad Prism software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Knock-down (shRNA)</title><p>Xph15 or Xph20-eGFP-CCR5TC were co-expressed in E18 rat hippocampal cultures with either PSD-95 shRNA_mCherry or scramble shRNA_mcherry (2 µg of each DNA per condition).

Live staining of rat hippocampal neurons transfected with both cytosolic eGFP and Xph15-SNAP-tag at DIV 10 was adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bottanelli et al., 2016</xref>. Transfected neurons seeded on 18 mm coverslips at DIV 17 were incubated at 37°C in the presence of 2 µl of aliquoted stock solution of the fluorescent ligand BG-SiR diluted in 250 µl of conditioned Neurobasal medium (final 5 µM BG-SiR). After 1 hr incubation, neurons were washed three times with 1 ml of CO<sub>2</sub>-equilibrated Neurobasal medium. Each wash was corresponding to a minimal 15 min incubation time with the fresh medium to ensure removing all excess of unbound fluorescent ligand. Coverslip with neurons was then mounted in a Ludin chamber filled with 600 µl of pre-warmed Tyrode medium.</p><p>Live neurons were imaged with an inverted Leica SP8 STED microscope equipped with an oil immersion objective (Plan Apo 100× NA 1.4), white light laser 2 (WLL2, 470–670 nm, 80 MHz frequency, ca. 200 ps pulse duration), and internal hybrid detectors. A 775 nm pulsed wavelength laser (80 MHz frequency, ca. 600 ps pulse duration) was used to deplete SiR dye excited by the 647 nm laser line. To preserve neuron health, low STED power was used: time-averaged measurements of STED laser power at the focal plane were showing a value lower than 20 mW (using S120C probe from Thorlabs). Other acquisition parameters were 19 nm pixel size; 16 times average per line; bidirectional 400 Hz scan speed. Final images were processed in ImageJ as follows: gentle convolution using convolve plugin with a 3 × 3 kernel (1 1 1, 1 10 1, 1 1 1), slight chromatic correction to align GFP image with STED capture. Gamma correction of 0.5 was applied on neuron large view image to help seeing small synapses stained with SiR.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>(spt)PALM</title><p>Live or fixed (PFA 4%) cells were mounted in a Ludin chamber filled with 1 ml of Tyrode’s solution (in mM): 10 HEPES, 5 KCl, 100 NaCl, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 15 glucose (pH 7.4), and imaged at 37°C.

The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Helge Ewers (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All the reviewers agreed that the probes described here were of general interest to the field of neuroscience and warrant publication in <italic>eLife</italic> as long as certain aspects of the work can further be strengthened as outlined below and in the reviewer comments. Please provide a revised manuscript with a point by point response to the reviewer comments, paying particular attention to the points below:</p><p>1) Reviewers felt that the specificity of the binders in neurons should be better demonstrated. Some ways to validate specificity would be to compare the binders with existing probes like antibodies and compute co-localization ratios as well as to use shRNA knock down approaches.</p><p>2) In line with the point above, reviewers felt that the labeling stoichiometry should be better characterized and described.

At the same time I fully appreciate the focus on possible functional interference and compatibility with high-end microscopy.</p><p>In summary I fully support immediate publication in <italic>eLife</italic> after addressing or clarifying the following major points:</p><p>1) The title promises “potent” and “specific” binders and in the abstract and throughout the manuscript the authors claim to provide “efficient” binders with “strong colocalization” and accordingly the authors conclude “…that the three monobodies label PSD-95 efficiently”.</p><p>Here I was missing the necessary determination of Pearsons and/or Manders coefficients for the introduced probes compared to a genetic stoichiometric label or conventional antibodies. The data and analyses presented in 3a to 3d only determine “% of common pixels within a probe labelled object with PSD95 immostaining” – thus only half of the necessary data/analysis. This appears important as the images in 3a suggest that monobodies, when expressed under regulated conditions, indeed only achieve a fractional binding of the endogenous target. In addition, unregulated overexpression appears to result in “filling the neuron”.</p><p>A complete data analysis should include the information how well the “robe co-localized with the target and how well the target co-localized with the probe ideally for both expression systems.</p><p>2) The authors emphasize that currently available and broadly applied PSD95 targeting affinity proteins (Gross 2013, Fukata 2013) are less well characterized in terms of epitopes and binding mechanism. Since the existing probes have been applied broadly and with great success it would have been helpful to the community to resolve the possible issue of the authors regarding a possible functional interference by including any of the existing monobodies in selected experiments.</p><p>Here it would have been helpful to learn based on what evidences the authors speculate existing antibodies and/or monobodies do display functional interference and specifically interference with receptor binding?</p><p>Using a set of high-end biophysical technologies in a whole array of experiments the authors exclude interference of monobody binding and receptor binding of PSD95. Yet, in its role as central scaffold of the excitatory synapse PSD95 engages in many more critical protein-protein interactions than only the receptors. To this end, I was wondering why the authors did not demonstrate the absence of functional interference and specifically protein-protein-interactions by determining the interactomes of PSD95 in presence and absence of the monobodies in the same way as in the original report and characterization of the monobodies by the same authors in Nat Commun 2019. Along the same lines, the earlier published MS/MS data of monobodies Xph0- versus Xph20- pulldowns do actually suggest the interference of at least one of the monobodies with distinct protein-protein-interactions (PPIs) but not the receptor binding.</p><p>3) The authors evaluate the use of the monobodes in STED (Figure 4 and 6) and PALM (Figure 5). For all these experiments I was missing the necessary comparison with conventional PSD95 probes or a stoichiometric fluorophore tag quantifying to what extend the detections actually correlate to endogenous PSD95. If these experiments were not conducted some of the claims should at least be be tuned down e.g. &quot;close stoichiometric labeling of the endogenous protein” “accurate snapshot of the PSD95 nanoscale distribution” “we are essentially detecting probes bound to PSD95” e.g. by adding “proposing” “suggesting” “indicating” “at least fractional labeling”</p><p>4) The authors claim that they were “… taking advantage of (…) their unique paralog-specific recognition properties…” This appears to be somewhat contradicting their earlier statements (Nat Commun 2019 from the same authors) eg: “If we compare the 10FN3 domain part of our modulators to some of the commercially available PSD-95-specific anibodies, epitopes are also found in fragments that encompass the same surface region targeted by Xph15, Xph18 and Xph20, suggesting shared epitopes that may rely on the same residues to achieve specificity”. Along the same lines it appears counter-intuitive to expect that the reported monobodies are not interfering with any endogenous PPI. Indeed this was also highlighted by the authors in the original report of the monobodies: “Our results suggest that parts of the first PDZ domain of PSD-95 constitute hot-spots for PPI as they appear to be involved in the binding of all the isolated clones.” It will be helpful for the readers of the first report to have this clarified.</p><p>5) Due to the existence of widely applied intrabody-based approaches for the chosen target one might assume the provided probes provide only a limited improvement over the current state-of-the-art. Indeed, the new probes were not applied in this study to answer biological questions that could not be answered with the existing probes. Instead the authors pioneer the application of the probes in high-end imaging. Yet, since the author do speculate about future applications e.g. in their last sentence they my consider do either explain to the non-expert the tremendous challenge of developing a non-interfering probe with specificity in cellular-context or alternatively add e.g. one sentence how future applications such multiplexing imaging strategies will benefit and how they will improve our neurological understanding.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– The specificity of the binders for endogenous PSD-95 should be directly assessed. The authors, state “We interpret this difference as a direct benefit from the specificity of the Xph clones for PSD-95 while PSD95.FingR, which can also bind SAP97 and SAP102, may also report to some extent the presence of these two paralog proteins”. This would indeed be an advantage of the presented binders over PSD95.FingR, but remains unaddressed here. In fact, some images (in particular Figure 3-supp1 panel a) show that the binders also label axons (even with the transcription regulation of the probes) even though PSD-95 has not been described to be localized in axons. How often does this occur? In general, the specificity of these probes for labeling endogenous PSD-95 should be made more convincing, for instance by depleting endogenous PSD-95.</p><p>– All the presented applications merely confirm the extensive existing literature on PSD-95. Could the authors demonstrate an advantage of this probe by showing a conceptual advancement that was not possible before?</p><p>– The use of the probe for anchoring GcaMP at the synapse seems beneficial, but how does this compare to using soluble GcaMP? No analysis of calcium traces is shown to demonstrate the advantage of this approach.</p><p>– The electrophysiology data presented in Figure 2 requires further analysis for it to be fully convincing. Representative traces appear to show differences in amplitude as well as differences in filtering. Additionally, traces for all binders need to be shown. From the cumulative distribution in Figure 2b, it seems that Xph18 leads to an overall increase in mEPSC amplitude. This needs to be tested using an appropriate statistical test on the cumulative distribution to clarify whether the Xph18 values are significantly different. Furthermore, the mean amplitude for Xph20 reveals a tendency to decrease. Since the variation is relatively large, it would be valuable to increase the number of analyzed neurons to confirm this point. Finally, as Xph20 is used later in the manuscript and the data from the recorded neurons is already included in Figure 2, the data on frequency and rise/decay time for Xph20 should be included as well.</p><p>– In Figure 2e, the distribution of diffusion coefficients shows an increase in mobile tracks for the binders but this is not apparent from the quantification in f. Further analysis and statistics on the mobile tracks should be included to clarify this point.</p><p>– In Figure 3, Xph18 labeling is significantly dimmer and labels smaller puncta than the other probes. Quantification of the size of the puncta is required to assess whether this is due to variability or differences in binding/labeling of the probes. In Figure 3b, it is unclear how these values compare to the enrichment of endogenous PSD-95 labeling. Additionally, the quantification of co-localization shown in panels c and d is not clearly described in the methods, and therefore hard to justify. This needs to be clarified, also because the values do not appear to correlate with what is shown in the representative images: the co-localization of PSD95.FingR with PSD-95 labeling seems comparable to what is shown for the binders. The number of included neurons also seem to vary extensively, this should be more equal among the groups to correctly compare the distribution of values in the quantifications.</p><p>– The FRAP experiment in figure 3e, f is based on a very low n of spines, this should be repeated in at least a number of neurons from 2 or more individual cultures. The FRAP experiment reveals a large pool of unbound Xph-derived probes, which can confound analysis of PSD-95. Particularly here it is important to know if this is in the context of the transcriptional repression system. The 80% recovery observed in the FRAP experiments is also contradictory with the 20% mobile pool of Xph-labeled molecules shown in figure 5 PALM experiments. This should be clarified.</p><p>– The STED data in Figure 4f and g show very divergent synaptic structures from other panels showing STED- and PALM-resolved PSDs. Additionally, the zoom-ins in Figure 6 show structures strikingly different from other PSDs throughout the manuscript. These points should be addressed and clarified whether they arise from the probes themselves or the techniques used.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69620.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Reviewers felt that the specificity of the binders in neurons should be better demonstrated.

Since the existing probes have been applied broadly and with great success it would have been helpful to the community to resolve the possible issue of the authors regarding a possible functional interference by including any of the existing monobodies in selected experiments.</p><p>Here it would have been helpful to learn based on what evidences the authors speculate existing antibodies and/or monobodies do display functional interference and specifically interference with receptor binding?</p><p>Using a set of high-end biophysical technologies in a whole array of experiments the authors exclude interference of monobody binding and receptor binding of PSD95. Yet, in its role as central scaffold of the excitatory synapse PSD95 engages in many more critical protein-protein interactions than only the receptors. To this end, I was wondering why the authors did not demonstrate the absence of functional interference and specifically protein-protein-interactions by determining the interactomes of PSD95 in presence and absence of the monobodies in the same way as in the original report and characterization of the monobodies by the same authors in Nat Commun 2019. Along the same lines, the earlier published MS/MS data of monobodies Xph0- versus Xph20- pulldowns do actually suggest the interference of at least one of the monobodies with distinct protein-protein-interactions (PPIs) but not the receptor binding.</p></disp-quote><p>We have focused our work on characterizing the monobodies that we have developed and have not conducted experiments to further characterize the one developed by others. To address the point raised by reviewer 2, we have performed an interactomic analysis of PSD-95 in presence and absence of Xph20 (best binding clone). The results are presented in Figure 2i.</p><p>We note that the earlier proteomic experiments (Nat Commun 2019) were conducted with engineered monobodies that were fused to PDZ domain-binding motifs and for which we therefore expected interference with their capacity to bind their native partners.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors evaluate the use of the monobodes in STED (Figure 4 and 6) and PALM (Figure 5). For all these experiments I was missing the necessary comparison with conventional PSD95 probes or a stoichiometric fluorophore tag quantifying to what extend the detections actually correlate to endogenous PSD95. If these experiments were not conducted some of the claims should at least be be tuned down e.g. &quot;close stoichiometric labeling of the endogenous protein&quot; &quot;accurate snapshot of the PSD95 nanoscale distribution&quot; &quot;we are essentially detecting probes bound to PSD95&quot; e.g. by adding &quot;proposing&quot; &quot;suggesting&quot; &quot;indicating&quot; &quot;at least fractional labeling&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We have not systematically reevaluated every probe variants that would just consist in changing the FP (eGFP, mEos3.2, …) and we therefore base the efficiency of the systems used for STED and PALM on the characterizations performed in prior sections with the eGFP versions. These characterizations have been improved with new experiments in the corrected manuscript version.</p><p>We note that the three examples (&quot;close stoichiometric labeling of the endogenous protein&quot; &quot;accurate snapshot of the PSD95 nanoscale distribution&quot; &quot;we are essentially detecting probes bound to PSD95&quot;) are always done in the manuscript with a clear reference to published results obtained by other techniques or tools that we use as a comparison to our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors claim that they were &quot;… taking advantage of (…) their unique paralog-specific recognition properties…&quot; This appears to be somewhat contradicting their earlier statements (Nat Commun 2019 from the same authors) eg: &quot;If we compare the 10FN3 domain part of our modulators to some of the commercially available PSD-95-specific anibodies, epitopes are also found in fragments that encompass the same surface region targeted by Xph15, Xph18 and Xph20, suggesting shared epitopes that may rely on the same residues to achieve specificity&quot;. Along the same lines it appears counter-intuitive to expect that the reported monobodies are not interfering with any endogenous PPI. Indeed this was also highlighted by the authors in the original report of the monobodies: &quot;Our results suggest that parts of the first PDZ domain of PSD-95 constitute hot-spots for PPI as they appear to be involved in the binding of all the isolated clones.&quot; It will be helpful for the readers of the first report to have this clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>The “unique” properties refer to the fact that they are the only described recombinant domains that can discriminate paralogs. For the interference issue, we have added the interactomics experiments (Figure 2) to extend our analysis capacity beyond chosen canonical binders of PSD-95.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Due to the existence of widely applied intrabody-based approaches for the chosen target one might assume the provided probes provide only a limited improvement over the current state-of-the-art. Indeed, the new probes were not applied in this study to answer biological questions that could not be answered with the existing probes. Instead the authors pioneer the application of the probes in high-end imaging. Yet, since the author do speculate about future applications e.g. in their last sentence they my consider do either explain to the non-expert the tremendous challenge of developing a non-interfering probe with specificity in cellular-context or alternatively add e.g. one sentence how future applications such multiplexing imaging strategies will benefit and how they will improve our neurological understanding.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a paragraph in the Discussion section (p18) to present applications of our tools that cannot be achieved with other current tools.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– The specificity of the binders for endogenous PSD-95 should be directly assessed. The authors, state &quot;We interpret this difference as a direct benefit from the specificity of the Xph clones for PSD-95 while PSD95.FingR, which can also bind SAP97 and SAP102, may also report to some extent the presence of these two paralog proteins&quot;. This would indeed be an advantage of the presented binders over PSD95.FingR, but remains unaddressed here. In fact, some images (in particular Figure 3-supp1 panel a) show that the binders also label axons (even with the transcription regulation of the probes) even though PSD-95 has not been described to be localized in axons. How often does this occur? In general, the specificity of these probes for labeling endogenous PSD-95 should be made more convincing, for instance by depleting endogenous PSD-95.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed additional experiments using shRNA to knock-down endogenous PSD-95. The results are presented in Figure 4a-c. We have also removed what appeared as “axonal staining” in SI fig7 as this is never observed in healthy neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– All the presented applications merely confirm the extensive existing literature on PSD-95. Could the authors demonstrate an advantage of this probe by showing a conceptual advancement that was not possible before?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a paragraph in the Discussion section (p18) to present applications of our tools that cannot be achieved with other current tools.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The use of the probe for anchoring GCaMP at the synapse seems beneficial, but how does this compare to using soluble GCaMP? No analysis of calcium traces is shown to demonstrate the advantage of this approach.</p></disp-quote><p>In agreement with the editorial recommendation, we have focused our efforts on other aspects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The electrophysiology data presented in Figure 2 requires further analysis for it to be fully convincing. Representative traces appear to show differences in amplitude as well as differences in filtering. Additionally, traces for all binders need to be shown. From the cumulative distribution in Figure 2b, it seems that Xph18 leads to an overall increase in mEPSC amplitude. This needs to be tested using an appropriate statistical test on the cumulative distribution to clarify whether the Xph18 values are significantly different. Furthermore, the mean amplitude for Xph20 reveals a tendency to decrease. Since the variation is relatively large, it would be valuable to increase the number of analyzed neurons to confirm this point. Finally, as Xph20 is used later in the manuscript and the data from the recorded neurons is already included in Figure 2, the data on frequency and rise/decay time for Xph20 should be included as well.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed additional experiments in mouse neurons in order to have measurements for all the clones. The results are now presented in Figure 2a-e. The initial data set for Xph15 and Xph18 obtained in rat neurons is presented in SI Figure 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In Figure 2e, the distribution of diffusion coefficients shows an increase in mobile tracks for the binders but this is not apparent from the quantification in f. Further analysis and statistics on the mobile tracks should be included to clarify this point.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the cumulative distribution of instantaneous diffusion coefficients in Figure SI 5 to illustrate the fact that the difference observed for Xph20 corresponds only to slightly different distribution of the mobile populations with no impact on the mobile vs immobile repartition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In Figure 3, Xph18 labeling is significantly dimmer and labels smaller puncta than the other probes. Quantification of the size of the puncta is required to assess whether this is due to variability or differences in binding/labeling of the probes. In Figure 3b, it is unclear how these values compare to the enrichment of endogenous PSD-95 labeling. Additionally, the quantification of co-localization shown in panels c and d is not clearly described in the methods, and therefore hard to justify. This needs to be clarified, also because the values do not appear to correlate with what is shown in the representative images: the co-localization of PSD95.FingR with PSD-95 labeling seems comparable to what is shown for the binders. The number of included neurons also seem to vary extensively, this should be more equal among the groups to correctly compare the distribution of values in the quantifications.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed additional experiments and increased the number of objects analyzed and the number of independent experiments for all conditions in Figure 3b-d. In addition, we have also performed a new set of experiments presented in the new figure 4d-e by analyzing the correlation of the Xph15 and Xph20 probes eGFP signal with the one of a PSD-95-mScarlet-I fusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The FRAP experiment in figure 3e, f is based on a very low n of spines, this should be repeated in at least a number of neurons from 2 or more individual cultures. The FRAP experiment reveals a large pool of unbound Xph-derived probes, which can confound analysis of PSD-95. Particularly here it is important to know if this is in the context of the transcriptional repression system. The 80% recovery observed in the FRAP experiments is also contradictory with the 20% mobile pool of Xph-labeled molecules shown in figure 5 PALM experiments. This should be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>We have repeated and corrected the FRAP experiments with higher spine and cell numbers (Figure 3e-g). For the differences in recovery percentage observed in FRAP and the mobile fraction percentage measurement in spt-PALM, we note that the measurements are not performed on the same time scales (minutes for FRAP and ms for spt-PALM) to be compared to probe-domain complex half-life determined with recombinant proteins (seconds). The difference in time-scale explains that we are not observing the same situation: FRAP and long time-scales reveal the probe capacity to exchange whereas ms time-scale (coupled to a spt-PALM detection bias towards mildly diffusive objects) reflects the probe affinity for its target and stability of the complex in this relatively short time interval. The various time-scales have been clarified in the corrected manuscript every time such notions where critical for the understanding of the results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The STED data in Figure 4f and g show very divergent synaptic structures from other panels showing STED- and PALM-resolved PSDs. Additionally, the zoom-ins in Figure 6 show structures strikingly different from other PSDs throughout the manuscript. These points should be addressed and clarified whether they arise from the probes themselves or the techniques used.</p></disp-quote><p>Throughout this work, the PSD-95 labeling observed with different microscopy modalities was reproducible and largely independent of the method used despite slight differences associated with technical aspects (signal to noise, acquisition procedure, nature of the dye…). The differences mentioned here are typically associated with the technique used and the choice of representation to illustrate the results. We have added a sentence in the discussion to clarify this point:</p><p>p17” Importantly, we note that the PSD-95 labeling observed with the different microscopy modalities here was reproducible and largely independent of the method used despite slight differences associated with technical aspects (signal to noise, acquisition procedure, nature of the dye and its associated effective labeling efficiency…).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
