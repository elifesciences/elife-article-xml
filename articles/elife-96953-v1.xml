In the parasitic protist <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>, a rudimentary actomyosin system consisting of one actin gene and two myosin genes has been retained despite significant investment in the microtubule cytoskeleton. The functions of this highly simplified actomyosin system remain unclear, but appear to centre on the endomembrane system. Here, advanced light and electron microscopy imaging techniques, together with biochemical and biophysical assays, were used to explore the relationship between the actomyosin and endomembrane systems. The class I myosin (TbMyo1) had a large cytosolic pool and its ability to translocate actin filaments in vitro was shown here for the first time. TbMyo1 exhibited strong association with the endosomal system and was additionally found on glycosomes. At the endosomal membranes, TbMyo1 colocalised with markers for early and late endosomes (TbRab5A and TbRab7, respectively), but not with the marker associated with recycling endosomes (TbRab11). Actin and myosin were simultaneously visualised for the first time in trypanosomes using an anti-actin chromobody. Disruption of the actomyosin system using the actin-depolymerising drug latrunculin A resulted in a delocalisation of both the actin chromobody signal and an endosomal marker, and was accompanied by a specific loss of endosomal structure. This suggests that the actomyosin system is required for maintaining endosomal integrity in <italic>T. brucei</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The actin cytoskeleton is a universal feature of eukaryotic cells and plays critical roles in processes such as endocytosis, cytokinesis, and maintenance of cell morphology. Most research has however focused on opisthokonts (principally animals and fungi), and very little is known about the actomyosin system in other branches of the eukaryotic tree, in particular the early branching ones. Recently, it was shown that trypanosomatids – a family of unicellular parasites – are the most divergent eukaryotes that still retain an actomyosin system with associated regulatory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kotila et al., 2022</xref>). Amongst the trypanosomatids, <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> is the most tractable for molecular cell biology investigation. <italic>T. brucei</italic> is an exclusively extracellular pathogen which has evolved mechanisms to resist the harsh conditions within the bloodstream and body fluids of its mammalian hosts and the different but similarly demanding environments within its insect vector, the tsetse fly.</p><p>To evade the mammalian host’s immune system, <italic>T. brucei</italic> bloodstream forms (BSFs) express a surface coat of variable surface glycoproteins (VSGs) consisting of 5 × 10<sup>6</sup> VSG dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bartossek et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cross, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jackson et al., 1985</xref>). This dense glycoprotein coat hides invariant surface proteins from immune recognition, ensuring that host antibodies are generated against the currently presented VSG isoform and not against any invariant surface proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cross, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mugnier et al., 2016</xref>). A glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor attached to each VSG monomer confers high mobility to the VSG coat, facilitating a high rate of antibody clearance by the parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bartossek et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Borges et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hartel et al., 2016</xref>). The directional movement of the trypanosome generates hydrodynamic flow forces on the cell surface that drag VSG-antibody complexes to the posterior region of the cell, where they can be endocytosed, trafficked to the lysosome, and degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Engstler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Link et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Webster et al., 1990</xref>). Thus, <italic>T. brucei</italic> persistence inside the mammalian host is intrinsically connected to its endocytic trafficking capacity.</p><p>All endo- and exocytic processes in <italic>T. brucei</italic> occur through the flagellar pocket, a small invagination of the plasma membrane located near the posterior pole of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grünfelder et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grünfelder et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lacomble et al., 2009</xref>). Measurements of the kinetics of VSG endocytosis and recycling revealed that the VSG cell surface pool is turned over within 12 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Engstler et al., 2004</xref>). Surface-bound antibodies are internalised and colocalise with lysosome markers within 2 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Engstler et al., 2007</xref>). These rates are very high, especially considering that exo- and endocytosis are limited to only 5% of the total cell surface area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Engstler et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, not only is the flagellar pocket situated in the posterior part of the cell, but the entire endosomal apparatus responsible for membrane recycling is also localised to that region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Engstler et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Field and Carrington, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grünfelder et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Link et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>It was recently shown that the endosomal system of <italic>T. brucei</italic> has a remarkably complex architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Link et al., 2023</xref>). Rather than being divided into separate compartments, the system forms an interconnected membrane network. Within this network, distinct endosomal functions are grouped into membrane subdomains that are enriched with well-known markers associated with early (TbRab5A), late (TbRab7), and recycling endosomes (TbRab11). While this structure might explain the efficient membrane recycling seen in trypanosomes, the mechanisms responsible for maintaining its stability are not yet understood. One candidate for stabilising and organising this membrane network is the actomyosin system.</p><p>The actomyosin system of <italic>T. brucei</italic> is very reduced, consisting of one actin gene and two myosin genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">García-Salcedo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Spitznagel et al., 2010</xref>). This stands in contrast to its elaborate and highly structured subpellicular microtubule cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Robinson et al., 1995</xref>). Although the exact functions of the reduced actomyosin system in <italic>T. brucei</italic> are not understood, the retention of a minimal system (along with regulatory proteins) suggests an essential function that the microtubule cytoskeleton cannot recapitulate. Previous work on <italic>T. brucei</italic> actin showed that its depletion in BSFs resulted in a rapid cell division arrest, loss of endocytic activity, and ultimately cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">García-Salcedo et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>T. brucei</italic> filamentous actin has not been visualised by phalloidin binding. This suggests that filamentous actin in trypanosomes may be short and dynamic, as is the case in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schmitz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schüler et al., 2005</xref>), and was recently shown in the related trypanosomatid parasite <italic>Leishmania</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kotila et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>To date, the only experimental characterisation of trypanosome myosins was reported by Spitznagel and coworkers in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Spitznagel et al., 2010</xref>). That study focused on Tb927.4.3380 (TbMyo1), which belongs to the ubiquitous class I myosin family. Class I myosins are smaller than conventional (class II) myosins, and do not self-associate into dimers or bipolar filaments. The functions of class I myosins vary from the regulation of membrane tension to participation in endo- and exocytosis, intracellular trafficking, and cell migration (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Diaz-Valencia et al., 2022</xref>). The myosin domain structure usually consists of a conserved motor domain with ATP- and actin-binding regions, a variable number of IQ (calmodulin-binding) motifs which activate the protein in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner, and a cargo-binding tail domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Masters et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Trivedi et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In BSF <italic>T. brucei</italic> cells, TbMyo1 partially colocalised with endocytic cargo, late endosomes, and the lysosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Spitznagel et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, the depletion of TbMyo1 resulted in the inhibition of cargo uptake and an enlargement of the flagellar pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Spitznagel et al., 2010</xref>). These findings supported a proposed function in endocytic trafficking. Although a direct colocalisation of actin and TbMyo1 was not demonstrated, the depletion or drug-induced disruption of actin resulted in a decreased and more diffuse TbMyo1 signal. It remains unclear, however, what kind of motor activity TbMyo1 has and whether it functions primarily as a tether or a transporter.</p><p>The other <italic>T. brucei</italic> myosin (Tb927.11.16310; TbMyo21, sometimes also referred to as Myo13) is part of the kinetoplastida-specific class XXI family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Foth et al., 2006</xref>). In <italic>Leishmania</italic>, knockdown of the class XXI myosin was reported to be lethal, with defects in flagellar assembly and a loss of intracellular trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Katta et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Katta et al., 2010</xref>). This critical role for Myo21 in <italic>Leishmania</italic> has led to interest in it as a potential drug target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Trivedi et al., 2020</xref>).

To detect endogenous TbMyo1, two anti-TbMyo1 antibodies were generated against the tail domain (amino acids 729–1168) of the protein. The specificity of these antibodies was validated using two transgenic cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

TbMyo21 was found to have extremely low expression levels in both BSF and procyclic life cycle stages, however. In addition, the protein could not be confidently localised using widefield microscopy and RNAi experiments showed that it appeared to be non-essential for BSF cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, all further experiments were conducted on TbMyo1.</p><p>To determine what proportion of TbMyo1 was associated with the cytoskeleton, a two-step biochemical fractionation was carried out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Cells expressing cytosolic green fluorescent protein (GFP) were sequentially fractionated using the non-ionic detergents digitonin and IGEPAL. Digitonin preferentially solubilises the plasma membrane and leads to the release of the cytosolic fraction (SN1), while IGEPAL solubilises the organelle fraction (SN2). Samples were subsequently analysed by immunoblotting with fraction-specific marker proteins. As expected, the cytosolic GFP (~27 kDa) was efficiently extracted by digitonin and partitioned into the SN1 fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, top panel). The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) luminal chaperone BiP (~80 kDa) was not extracted by digitonin and mostly partitioned into the P1 fraction, but was subsequently solubilised by IGEPAL and partitioned into the SN2 fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, middle panel). The cytoskeleton-associated paraflagellar rod proteins TbPFR1 and TbPFR2 (~69 and 72 kDa) were not solubilised by either detergent and partitioned into first the P1 and then subsequently into the P2 fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, bottom panel, magenta). Interestingly, around half of the TbMyo1 (~130 kDa) partitioned into the SN1 fraction, indicating that there is a substantial cytosolic pool.

Each class of myosins has its own kinetic properties, and consequently can function as either an active motor or a more static tether in vivo. The kinetic properties of TbMyo1 have not been investigated to date, so it was unclear whether it moved quickly or slowly on actin. To measure the velocity at which TbMyo1 can translocate actin, full-length recombinant TbMyo1 was purified and in vitro actin filament gliding assays were performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Based on sequence analysis, TbMyo1 is predicted to consist of a large motor domain (cyan), a single calmodulin-binding IQ motif (yellow) and a membrane-binding FYVE-domain (magenta) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The full-length protein was expressed in insect cells and purified, with most of the TbMyo1 eluting as a single peak with associated calmodulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). For the in vitro gliding assays, the purified TbMyo1 was biotinylated, immobilised via streptavidin onto a glass surface, and incubated with Alexa488-phalloidin-labelled filamentous actin at 2 mM ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

TbMyo1 had previously been suggested to overlap with the endosomal system, but this work was conducted using non-physiological cargoes (lectins) as markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Spitznagel et al., 2010</xref>). Here, the physiological cargoes BSA and transferrin were used. The BSA signal was mainly found in a single globular cluster in the posterior region of the cell, which seemed to partially overlap with TbMyo1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3DI</xref>). The transferrin signal was more widely distributed and seemed to have a more substantial overlap with TbMyo1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3DII</xref>). Surprisingly, despite the clear visual overlap of cargo marker and TbMyo1 signals, the correlations were very weak (ρ = 0.17 and 0.20, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This might be because colocalisation can be measured in different ways, and correlation is not the same as co-occurrence (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aaron et al., 2018</xref>). Correlation measures whether two distinct signals change in a similar manner within an overlapping area, while co-occurrence measures the extent of the overlapping area between the two signals.

While low concentrations (0.2 μM) of LatA showed a slight delocalisation of the chromobody signal, high concentrations (2 μM) resulted in a strong delocalisation or even loss of the chromobody signal.

Importantly, the TbMyo1 distribution was the same in uninduced and induced cells, indicating that its localisation was not affected by the expression of the chromobody. Of note, the colocalising area was often up to 1 μm away from the kinetoplast/flagellar pocket region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>) and only a minority of cells showed a signal for either TbMyo1, actin, or both adjacent to the kinetoplast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6FI,II</xref>).

The EP1-GFP fluorescence in the controls was concentrated in the posterior region of the cell and revealed a variable number of high-intensity signals, surrounded and connected by weaker signals. In contrast, the effects of LatA incubation on the EP1-GFP signal mirrored its effects on the chromobody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). After 1 hr of LatA incubation, 50% of the cells displayed morphological changes, including swelling of the cell body in the posterior part and even complete rounding of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). After a 2 hr incubation with LatA, only 10% of the cells exhibited a typical morphology. At longer incubation times, no cells displaying a normal morphology were observed. These morphological changes were accompanied by a redistribution of the EP1-GFP fluorescence signals. Instead of being confined to the posterior region, the EP1-GFP signals increasingly spread throughout the entire cytoplasm. Examination of the ultrastructure of the endosomal system at early timepoints (≤60 min LatA incubation) revealed a complete loss of endosomal integrity, resulting in large membrane vesicles filling the space between the flagellar pocket and the lysosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). The preservation of the Golgi complex structure in its entirety, as well as the continuing invagination of clathrin-coated pits and presence of clathrin-coated vesicles at the flagellar pocket, underscored the specificity of this phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). It is noteworthy that even after 30–60 min of LatA incubation, which led to the complete disruption of the endosomal system, the parasites remained motile. Moreover, an enlargement of the flagellar pocket was not observed in most cells during this period.</p><p>To test whether TbMyo1 also contributed to endosomal system morphology, experiments were carried out using the TbMyo1 RNAi cell line. Depletion of TbMyo1 caused a very penetrant phenotype, with most of the cells already rounded-up after 24 hr of induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These rounded-up cells are not phenotypically informative, but the cells with a less deranged morphology were still capable of internalising BSA and trafficking it to a lysosome-adjacent compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Depletion of TbMyo1 was confirmed by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Population growth curves matched previously published results and indicated that 24 hr post-induction was an appropriate starting point for phenotypic investigation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Spitznagel et al., 2010</xref>).

As in the LatA experiments and consistent with the BSA uptake experiments, clathrin-coated vesicles in the cytoplasm and clathrin patches on the flagellar pocket membrane were frequently observed, suggesting that endocytosis was not strongly affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

TbMyo21 exhibited minimal expression in both BSF and procyclic form cells, however, and no detrimental growth effects were apparent upon depleting TbMyo21 in BSF cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), consistent with previously published high-throughput data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alsford et al., 2011</xref>). It remains possible that TbMyo21 might be important only in cell cycle stages that cannot be cultivated in vitro, such as epimastigotes. Due to its exceedingly low expression levels and non-essential role in BSF <italic>T. brucei</italic>, TbMyo21 is unlikely to be a viable drug target, in contrast to its homologue in <italic>Leishmania</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Trivedi et al., 2020</xref>). Subsequent efforts in this study focused on the characterisation of TbMyo1. Of note, preliminary data indicate downregulation of TbMyo1 expression in the procyclic life cycle stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>), consistent with earlier proteomic experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tinti and Ferguson, 2022</xref>). This finding differs with the previous study, where no change in TbMyo1 expression levels was observed after differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Spitznagel et al., 2010</xref>). The discrepancy is most likely due to the stronger signal obtained in the present study with the new anti-TbMyo1 antibodies, although a more rigorous experiment using a loading control with identical expression levels in the two life cycle stages is still needed. This nonetheless suggests that the actomyosin system is not as critical for the viability of procyclic cells, which have a much lower rate of membrane trafficking than the BSF life cycle stage.</p><p>The biochemical fractionation data indicated that around half of the TbMyo1 was in the cytosolic fraction, while the remaining portion exhibited a strong association with the cytoskeleton fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The substantial cytosolic fraction of TbMyo1 could potentially indicate the molecules adopting an auto-inhibited ‘foldback’ configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yang et al., 2009</xref>). This is speculation, however, and needs to be tested in future in vitro assays. The existence of a large cytosolic fraction at steady state might also suggest that TbMyo1 is very dynamic, with a high turnover on the organelles it is associated with.</p><p>The in vitro motility assays indicated that TbMyo1 can translocate filamentous actin with a mean translocation velocity of 130 nm/s, which is significantly faster than the approximately 10–50 nm/s measured for some mammalian class I myosins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Giese et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pyrpassopoulos et al., 2012</xref>). This relatively high velocity might indicate that TbMyo1 is participating in intracellular trafficking of BSF <italic>T. brucei</italic> and functioning as an active motor rather than a static tether. It should be stressed, however, that this study has not investigated any of TbMyo1’s biochemical or mechanical activities in vivo, so this remains a hypothesis for now. The in vitro motility assay conditions obviously do not replicate the highly complex and dynamic cytoplasmic environment within a trypanosome cell, and multiple regulatory mechanisms, binding partners, and maybe even membrane interactions (see below) will all come into play.</p><p>Earlier studies examining the localisation of TbMyo1 primarily concentrated on the endocytic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Spitznagel et al., 2010</xref>), with little attention given to its potential association with the biosynthetic route. Nevertheless, neither widefield microscopy nor SIM displayed any notable overlap between TbMyo1 and markers of the biosynthetic pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). The close juxtaposition of endoplasmic reticulum exit sites (ERES) and the Golgi apparatus in <italic>T. brucei</italic> could provide a rationale for why a motor protein like TbMyo1 might be dispensable for mediating transport between these organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sealey-Cardona et al., 2014</xref>). While myosins have often been localised to the Golgi in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Avisar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buss et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Perico et al., 2021</xref>), these cell types typically have multiple Golgi apparatuses and a more intricate coordination of secretory pathways.</p><p>Recently, a potential mechanism was discussed in which secretory material in <italic>T. brucei</italic> might move in bulk from the Golgi to the endosomal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Link et al., 2023</xref>). The secretory material would subsequently travel alongside recycled endocytic cargo from the endosomal system to the flagellar pocket and from there to the surface plasma membrane. In this model, it is the endosomal network that serves as a central sorting hub for both secretory and endocytic cargo. Maintenance of its complex three-dimensional morphology might therefore be critical to efficient function, and this is a process that the TbMyo1 and actin could plausibly contribute to.</p><p>The actomyosin system has often been associated with membrane manipulation in different organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Costa et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eitzen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Khatibzadeh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Khanal Lamichhane et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, it has recently been shown that in <italic>Drosophila</italic> endosomes can organise F-actin and that endosomal actin can affect subcellular tube growth and integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ríos-Barrera and Leptin, 2022</xref>). Thus, it could be that the actomyosin system either generates or helps maintain the architecture of the trypanosome endosomal system. Furthermore, the predicted FYVE domain in the TbMyo1 tail domain is predicted to mediate binding to PI(3)P lipids, which are enriched in endosomal membranes in other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Marat and Haucke, 2016</xref>). Preliminary data indicate that this FYVE domain can indeed specifically bind to PI(3)P (C. Veigel and F. Zierhut, unpublished observations). So far, nothing is known about the lipid composition of endosomal membranes in trypanosomes, but the presence of a FYVE domain and the enrichment of TbMyo1 at endosomal membranes suggests PI(3)P lipids in the endosomes of trypanosomes too. If so, the expression of the FYVE domain conjugated to GFP might be a useful tool to visualise PI(3)P-enriched membranes in <italic>T. brucei</italic>. It should be stressed that the present study has not rigorously investigated a direct functional role for TbMyo1 in endomembrane function, and any associations that are drawn based on the data here are necessarily speculative. Further experiments using the TbMyo1 RNAi cell line will be needed to explore this point in more detail.</p><p>In contrast to the results with the biosynthetic markers, physiological endocytic cargo (BSA, transferrin) visually colocalised with TbMyo1, but the correlations were weak (<italic>ρ</italic> = 0.17 and 0.20, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This highlights a potentially important point which is often glossed over in colocalisation analyses – correlation and co-occurrence are different concepts, although both are measures of colocalisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aaron et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, it is possible for two signals to be strongly correlated even if they do not exhibit much spatial overlap/co-occurrence. Conversely, and as here, two signals can exhibit strong overlap/co-occurrence but low correlation. A possible explanation for the low correlation between TbMyo1 and endocytic cargo might be due to topological differences in the signal origin. While TbMyo1 binds to the endosomal membranes from ‘outside’ (the cytosolic side), the cargo is located in the endosome lumen. Closer examination of some of the data used for these analyses revealed that there are many pixels with a value of 0 for transferrin/BSA and a nonzero value for TbMyo1 and vice-versa. The incidence of zero-versus-nonzero values in the two channels will have lowered the correlation coefficient, and in this sense, the correlation coefficients are giving a hint of what the immuno-electron microscopy later confirmed: that the TbMyo1 and cargo are present in the same locations (i.e. cargo-containing endosomes), but in different proportions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Apart from its endosomal localisation, another intriguing observation stemming from the electron microscopy data was the predominant presence of TbMyo1 signals within the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This agrees with the fractionation results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and reaffirms that TbMyo1 has a substantial cytosolic portion under steady-state conditions. However, it is important to note that the actin filaments of trypanosomes have not yet been observed by electron microscopy. Recently, advanced techniques like cryo-transmission electron microscopy and cryo-electron tomography have been applied to explore and visualise actin in other cell types (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jung et al., 2020</xref>). It would be intriguing to test these techniques for visualising actin in trypanosomes.</p><p>Interestingly, there was also a clear glycosomal localisation of TbMyo1, which was further confirmed by CLEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). TbMyo1 was previously found in a glycosomal proteome obtained by mass spectrometry (see Supplementary Material, Table S2, proteins only detected in BSFs in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vertommen et al., 2008</xref>), providing independent validation of the ultrastructural localisation observed here. Glycosomes are related to peroxisomes and are used to compartmentalise glycolysis in kinetoplastids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crowe and Morris, 2021</xref>). While a connection to the cytoskeleton has been described as a requirement for peroxisome function, inheritance, and maintenance in plants, yeast, and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Neuhaus et al., 2016</xref>), nothing has been reported regarding a connection to the cytoskeleton for glycosomes in trypanosomatids. This link between glycosomes and TbMyo1 was unexpected and merits further investigation.</p><p>The results from the CLEM experiments underscored the proximity between TbMyo1 and the lysosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). The consistent localisation of TbMyo1 at or close to the endosomal network and lysosomes, coupled with the fact that neither TbMyo1 nor actin accumulated near the flagellar pocket, suggests that the actomyosin system in trypanosomes primarily functions in post-endocytic trafficking events. This encompasses activities related to trafficking within the endosomal system, movement to and from it, or transport to the lysosome. Transport to the lysosome could conceivably be achieved by TbMyo1 interacting with the class II clathrin-coated vesicles that mediate this traffic. Further support for this interpretation comes from the colocalisation studies using antibodies against the endosomal marker proteins TbRab5A, TbRab7, and TbRab11. TbMyo1 exhibited partial overlap with TbRab5A (early endosomes) and TbRab7 (late endosomes), while no overlap was observed with TbRab11 (recycling endosomes). These results support the idea that TbMyo1 is implicated in post-endocytic processes rather than engaging in recycling events.</p><p>Actin and TbMyo1 were both previously localised to the posterior region of <italic>T. brucei</italic> using polyclonal antibodies in the 2004 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">García-Salcedo et al., 2004</xref> and 2010 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Spitznagel et al., 2010</xref>. studies, respectively, and the latter paper also showed that disruption of actin using either RNAi or LatA resulted in a more diffuse TbMyo1 signal. Until now, however, TbMyo1 and actin had not been imaged simultaneously in <italic>T. brucei</italic>. Here, the actin cytoskeleton was visualised using an inducible anti-actin chromobody, which enabled colabelling with TbMyo1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The ability to observe actin distributions in living trypanosome cells will undoubtedly be invaluable for future studies of its intracellular dynamics, although further optimisation is still required. The overnight inductions used here are undoubtedly excessive, and some cells with abnormal morphology could be observed at low frequency. It will be important in the future to do a time-course experiment to determine the shortest incubation time required for maximal expression of the chromobody. As TbMyo1 is a motor protein, the strong overlap with actin was expected and suggests that actin is highly decorated with TbMyo1. Nevertheless, the number and intensity of signal spots varied from cell to cell. Coupled with the relatively high velocity measured of TbMyo1 on actin, this suggests that the actomyosin system in <italic>T. brucei</italic> is highly dynamic. The obvious next step would be the acquisition of the dynamics of the different endosomal marker proteins and the cytoskeleton in vivo.</p><p>One particular topic that would be worth revisiting in light of the data collected here is the role of trypanosome actin in endocytosis. It was surprising that no strong or consistent signal was seen for either TbMyo1 or actin at the flagellar pocket, and it might be possible that neither are essential for endocytosis to occur. Recent work in mammalian cells has suggested that actin is recruited to endocytic sites primarily when endocytosis stalls, and a similar mechanism could conceivably be at work here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jin et al., 2022</xref>). Regardless, it seems clear that the primary focus and function of trypanosome actin and TbMyo1 is centred on the endosomal system.</p><p>After confirming TbMyo1’s capability to translocate actin and characterising its localisation and overlap with actin, the final question was whether the actomyosin system played a role in maintaining the intricate and continuous nature of the endosomal network. EP1-GFP-expressing cells have previously served as a reliable tool for endosomal system analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Engstler and Boshart, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Link et al., 2023</xref>). In this study, the response of these cells to LatA treatment was analysed to test the actomyosin system’s contribution to maintaining the integrity of endosomal membranes. As LatA results in the depolymerisation of the filamentous actin that TbMyo1 binds to, the phenotypic effects observed are due to compromised function of both actin and TbMyo1. Prolonged treatment led to an increasing proportion of cells exhibiting anomalous morphologies, including swelling of the endosomal membranes, and eventually culminating in a rounded cellular form. The observation of clathrin-coated vesicles at the flagellar pocket as well as the preserved Golgi ultrastructure in the experiment once again suggest a very precise role for the actomyosin system in <italic>T. brucei</italic>. This role is likely directly involved in maintaining the integrity of the endosomal system in BSF cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Lama pacos</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pAC-TagRFP</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ChromoTek (Proteintech)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">acr</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">See ‘Materials and methods’ for a description of subcloning</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Rabbit anti-TbMyo1(729–1168) polyclonal</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2411, 2412</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1:5000-1:10,000 for immunoblotting; 1:500-1:2000 for immunofluorescence</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">REVERT Total Protein Stain</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">LI-COR</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">926-11011</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Wash and Destaining solutions made in-house</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Digitonin, ultra-pure</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Merck</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CAS 11024-24-1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">See ‘Materials and methods’</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Latrunculin A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CAS 76343-93-6</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">See ‘Materials and methods’</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and cell lines</title><p><italic>T. brucei</italic> monomorphic BSF parasites (Lister strain 427, antigenic type MITat 1.2, clone 221) were cultured in HMI-9 medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hirumi and Hirumi, 1989</xref>) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin.

In brief, both were dissolved in 80% ethanol pH 2.0 and mixed in a 20:1 ratio. 100 µl of the PEG-biotin solution was spread on each coverslip and incubated for 30 min at 70°C. Afterwards, the coverslips were washed with ethanol, dried under an air stream, and flow chambers were assembled. C-terminal biotinylated myosin was specifically bound via streptavidin to the functionalised glass surface. Subsequently, the surface of the experimental chamber was blocked with 0.5 mg/ml BSA in assay buffer (25 mM imidazole, 25 mM KCl, 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EGTA, pH 7.4) for 3 min. After washing the chamber with assay buffer, Alexa488-phalloidin-labelled rabbit skeletal actin filaments were introduced into the flow cell.

The cells were again pelleted by centrifugation (1000 × <italic>g</italic>, 2 min, RT) and subsequently resuspended in 0.5 ml ice-cold vPBS containing EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche). 0.5 ml ice-cold 8% (v/v) paraformaldehyde solution in vPBS containing EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche) or ice-cold 8% (v/v) paraformaldehyde solution/0.2% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in vPBS containing EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche) was added to the resuspended cells. Glutaraldehyde was omitted if a subsequent antibody labelling was performed. The suspension was mixed 1–2 times by inversion and was placed on ice for 10 min.

To allow cells to equilibrate in the monomer solution (8.625% [w/v] sodium acrylate, 20% [w/v] acrylamide, 0.075% [w/v] bisacrylamide, 2 M NaCl in PBS), 1 ml was added and incubated for 5 min at RT. 100 μl of monomer solution, supplemented with 2 μl 10% (v/v) APS and 2 μl 10% (v/v) TEMED, was briefly vortexed and a 70 μl drop was placed on a piece of parafilm. Coverslips were transferred with cells facing down onto the drop. The polymerisation was allowed to proceed for 20 min at RT in the dark. The resulting gel was peeled off the parafilm and transferred into a 12-well plate, with the coverslip at the bottom. For digestion, 1 ml digestion buffer (0.8 M guanidine HCl, 0.5% [v/v] Triton X-100, 1× TAE buffer) was mixed with 10 μl proteinase K (6 U/ml) and added to gels.

Excitation light was selected by using Y3 (545/25 nm), GFP (470/40 nm), and A4 (360/40 nm) bandpass filter cubes (Leica Microsystems). The power density, measured at the objective focal plane with a thermal sensor head (S175C, Thorlabs), was respectively 0.749 ± 0.086, 0.557± 0 .069, and 0.278 ± 0.076 W/cm<sup>2</sup> for the three filters. Emitted light was collected at ranges of 605/70 (Y3), 525/50 nm (GFP), and 470/40 nm (DAPI). The individual exposure times and camera gains were adjusted according to the different samples. The mNG-tagged samples required extremely long exposure times (2 s per z-section). RNAi samples (induced and control) were imaged using identical settings. Differential interference contrast (DIC) was used to visualise cell morphology. 3D recordings of each field of view were obtained using 40 Z-slices (step size = 0.21 μm). Fields of view were selected in the DIC channel in order to blind the user to the fluorescence signal and subjectively select for cells with optimum morphology.

One significant limitation is the reliance on spatial association data, such as colocalization of TbMyo1 with various cellular components-or the absence thereof-to infer functional relationships. Although these data suggest potential interactions, the authors do not confirm functional or direct physical interactions.</p><p>While TbMyo1's localization is informative, the authors do not directly demonstrate its biochemical or mechanical activities in vivo, leaving its precise role in cellular processes speculative. Direct assays that manipulate TbMyo1 levels, activity, and/or function, coupled with observations of the outcomes on cellular processes, would provide more definitive evidence of the protein's specific roles in <italic>T. brucei</italic>. A multifaceted approach, including genetic manipulations, uptake assays, kinetic trafficking experiments, and imaging, would offer a more robust framework for understanding TbMyo1's roles. This comprehensive approach would elucidate not just the &quot;what&quot; and &quot;where&quot; of TbMyo1's function but also the &quot;how&quot; and &quot;why,&quot; thereby deepening our mechanistic insights into <italic>T. brucei's</italic> biology.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is absolutely correct that the study lacks data on direct or indirect interactions between TbMyo1 and its intracellular partners, and this is an obvious area for future investigation. Given the generally low affinities of motor-cargo interactions, a proximity labelling approach (such has already been successfully used in studies of other myosins) would probably be the best way to proceed.</p><p>The reviewer is also right to highlight that a detailed mechanistic understanding of TbMyo1 function in vivo is currently lacking. We feel that this would be beyond the scope of the present work, but have included some new data using the TbMyo1 RNAi cell line (Figure S5), which are consistent with our previous findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this work, Link and colleagues have investigated the localization and function of the actomyosin system in the parasite <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>, which represents a highly divergent and streamlined version of this important cytoskeletal pathway.

The overnight inductions used here are almost certainly excessive, and shorter induction times would be expected to minimise any detrimental effects. We have noted these points in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The Garcia-Salcedo EMBO paper cited included the production of anti-actin polyclonal antibodies that appeared to work quite well. The localization pattern produced by the anti-actin polyclonals looks similar to the chromobody, with perhaps a slightly larger labeling profile that could be due to differences in imaging conditions. I feel that the anti-actin antibody labeling should be expressly mentioned in this manuscript, and perhaps could reflect differences in the F-actin vs total actin pool within cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Implemented. We have explicitly mentioned the use of the anti-actin antibody in the Garcia-Salcedo paper in the revised Results and Discussion sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors showed that disruption of F-actin with LatA leads to disruption of the endomembrane system, which suggests that the unique configuration of this compartment in <italic>T. brucei</italic> relies on actin dynamics. What happens under conditions where endocytosis and endocyctic traffic is blocked, such as 4 C? Are there changes to the localization of the actomyosin components?</p></disp-quote><p>Another excellent question! We did not analyse the localisation of TbMyo1 and actin under temperature block conditions, but this would definitely be a key experiment to do in follow-up work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Along these lines, the authors suggest that their LatA treatments were able to disrupt the endosomal pathway without disrupting clathrin-mediated endocytosis at the flagellar pocket. Do they believe that actin is dispensable in this process? That seems like an important point that should be stated clearly or put in greater context.</p></disp-quote><p>Whether actin plays a direct or indirect role in endocytosis would be another fascinating question for future enquiry, and we do not have the data to do more than speculate on this point. Recent work in mammalian cells (Jin et al., 2022) has suggested that actin is primarily recruited when endocytosis stalls, and it could be that a similar role is at play here. We have noted this point in the Discussion. The observation of clathrin vesicles close to the flagellar pocket membrane and clathrin patches on the flagellar pocket membrane itself in the LatA-treated cells might suggest that some endocytic activity can occur in the absence of filamentous actin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Note from the Reviewing Editor:</bold></p><p>During discussion, all reviewers agreed that the role of TbMyo1 in vivo in endomembrane function had not been directly demonstrated. This could be done by testing the endocytic trafficking of (for example) fluorophoreconjugated TfR and BSA in the existing Myo1 RNAi line, using wide-field microscopy. Examining the endosomes/lysosomes' organization by thin-section EM would be even better. The actin signal detected by the chromobody tends to occupy a larger region than the MyoI. It's therefore conceivable that actin filamentation and stabilization via other actin-interacting proteins create the continuous endosomal structure, while MyoI is necessary for transport or other related processes.</p></disp-quote><p>These are all excellent points and very good suggestions. We have now incorporated new data (supplemental Figure S5) that includes BSA uptake assays in the TbMyo1 RNAi cell line and electron microscopy imaging after TbMyo1 depletion – the results are consistent with our earlier observations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>- Figure S2E. This panel is supposed to show the downregulation of TbMyo1 in the PCF compared to BSF but there is no loading control to support this claim. This is important because the authors mention in lines 381-383 that this finding conflicts with the previous study (Spitznagel et al., 2010). The authors also indicate in the figure legend that there is 50% less signal but there is no explanation about this quantification.</p></disp-quote><p>Good point. Equal numbers of cells were loaded in each lane, but we did not have an antibody against a protein known to be expressed at the same level in both PCF and BSF cells to use as a loading control. Using a total protein stain would have been similarly unhelpful in this context, as the proteomes of PCF and BSF cells are dissimilar. The quantification was made by direct measurement after background subtraction, but without normalisation owing to the lack of a loading control. This makes the conclusion somewhat tentative, but given the large difference in signal observed between the two samples (and the fact that this is consistent with the proteomic data obtained by Tinti and Ferguson) we feel that the conclusion is valid. We have clarified these points in the figure legend and Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- It is mentioned in the discussion, as unpublished observations, that the predicted FYVE motif of TbMyo1 can bind specifically PI(3)P lipids. This is a very interesting point that would be new and would strengthen the suggested association with the endosomal system mainly based on imaging data.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is – potentially – a very exciting observation and it is an obvious direction for future enquiry.</p><p>The data are preliminary at this stage and will form the basis of a future publication. Given that the predicted FYVE domain of TbMyo1 and known lipid-binding activity of other class I myosins makes this activity not wholly unexpected, we feel that it is acceptable at this stage to highlight these preliminary findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors use the correlation coefficient to estimate the colocalization (lines 223-226). Although they clearly explain the difference between the correlation coefficient and the co-occurrence of two signals, I wonder if it would not be clearer for the audience to have quantification of the overlapping signals. Also, it is not mentioned on which images the correlation coefficient was measured. It seems that it is from widefield images (Figures 3E and 6E), and likely from SIM images for Figure 3C but the resolution is different. Are widefield images sufficient to assess these measurements?</p></disp-quote><p>With hindsight, and given the different topological locations of TbMyo1 and the cargo proteins (cytosolic and lumenal, respectively) it would probably have been wiser to measure co-occurrence rather than correlation, but we would prefer not to repeat the entire analysis at this stage. The correlations were measured from widefield images using the procedure described in the Materials &amp; Methods. These are obviously lower resolution than confocal or SIM images would be, but are still of value, we believe. One further point – upon re-examination of some of the TbMyo1 transferrin (Tf) and BSA data, we noticed that there are many pixels with a value of 0 for Tf/BSA and a nonzero value for TbMyo1 and vice-versa. The incidence of zero-versus-nonzero values in the two channels will have lowered the correlation coefficient, and in this sense, the correlation coefficients are giving us a hint of what the immuno-EM images later confirm: that the TbMyo1 and cargo are present in the same locations, but in different proportions. We have added this point to the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- It would be good to know if the loss of the endosomal system integrity (using EBI) is the same upon TbMyo1 depletion than in the latrunculin A treated parasites.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree! We have now included new data (Figure S5) that suggests endosomal system morphology is altered upon TbMyo1 depletion. We would predict that the effect upon TbMyo1 depletion is slower or less dramatic than upon LatA treatment (as LatA affects both actin and TbMyo1, given that TbMyo1 depends upon actin for its localisation).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Conversely, it would be of interest to see how the localization of TbMyo1 changes upon latrunculin A treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>This experiment was done in 2010 by Spitznagel et al., who observed a delocalisation of the TbMyo1 signal after LatA treatment. We have noted this in the Results and Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor corrections:</p><p>- Line 374: Figure S1 should be Figure S2.</p></disp-quote><p>Implemented (many thanks!).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Panel E of Figure S2 refers to TbMyo1 and should therefore be included in Figure S1 and not S2.</p></disp-quote><p>We would prefer not to implement this suggestion. We did struggle over the placing of this panel for exactly this reason, but as the samples were obtained as part of the experiments described in Figure S2, we felt that its placement here worked best in terms of the narrative of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure S2F: the population of TbMyo21 +Tet seems lost after 48 h although the authors mention that there is no growth defect.</p></disp-quote><p>Good eyes! We have re-added the panel, which shows that there was no growth defect in the tetracycline-treated population.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Fig 1 vs. Figure 3: The biochemical fractionation experiments have been well-controlled, showing that 40% of TbMyo1 is found in both the cytosolic and cytoskeletal fractions, with only 20% in the organelle-associated fraction. The conclusion is supported by the experimental design, which includes controls to rule out crosscontamination between fractions. However, does this contrast with the widefield microscopy experiments, where the vast majority of the signal is in endocytic compartments and nowhere else?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. There are three factors that probably explain this. First, given that the actin cytoskeleton is associated with the endosomal system, a large proportion of the material partitioning into the cytoskeleton (P2) fraction is probably localised to the endosomal system (a fun experiment would be to repeat the fractionation with addition of ATP to the extraction buffer to make the myosin dissociate and see whether more appeared in the SN2 fraction as a result). Second, the 40% of the TbMyo1 that is cytosolic is distributed throughout the entire cellular volume, whereas the material localised to the endosomes is concentrated in a much smaller space, by comparison, and producing a stronger signal. Third, the widefield microscopy images have had brightness and contrast adjusted in order to reduce “background” signal, though this will also include cytosolic molecules. We hope these explanations are satisfactory, but would welcome any additional thoughts from either the reviewer or the community.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The section title 'TbMyo1 translocates filamentous actin at 130 nm/s' could mislead readers by not specifying that the findings are from an in vitro experiment with a recombinant protein, which may not fully reflect the cell's complex context.

We have now included additional data (supplemental Figure S5) using the TbMyo1 RNAi cells and the results are consistent with our earlier observations and interpretations. It is worth noting too that at least for electron microscopy studies of intracellular morphology, the slower onset of an RNAi phenotype and the asynchronous replication of <italic>T. brucei</italic> populations make observation of direct (early) effects of depletion challenging – hence the preferential use of LatA here to depolymerise actin and trigger a faster phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I found that several declarative statements within the main text may not be fully supported by the overall evidence.

We have noted that this statement is speculative, and emphasised that being an active motor does not automatically mean that it is involved in intracellular traffic – it could instead be involved in manipulating endosomal membranes. We have noted too that the close proximity between TbMyo1 and the lysosome (Figures 3-5) could be important in this regard. The lysosome is not contiguous with the endosomal system, and it is possible that TbMyo1 is working as a motor to transport material (class II clathrin-coated vesicles) from the endosomal system to the lysosome.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 493-496: Does this mean that endocytosis from the FP does not require actin? This would be hard to explain considering the phenotypes observed in the original actin RNAi work.

Although RNAi of actin was lethal, the phenotype appears less penetrant than that seen following depletion of the essential endocytic cofactor clathrin (based on the descriptions in Garcia-Salcedo et al., 2004 and Allen et al., 2003). BigEye phenotypes occur in BSF cells whenever there is some perturbation of endomembrane trafficking and are not necessarily a direct consequence of depletion – this is why careful investigation of early timepoints following RNAi induction is critical.</p></body></sub-article></article>
