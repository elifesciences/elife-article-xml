effects are not entirely clear. AMPK inhibits fatty acid synthesis and promotes fatty acid oxidation by phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) 1 at Ser<sup>79</sup> and ACC2 at Ser<sup>212</sup>. Using mice with Ser<sup>79</sup>Ala/Ser<sup>212</sup>Ala knock-in mutations (ACC DKI) we find that inhibition of ACC phosphorylation leads to reduced appetite in response to fasting or cold exposure. At sub-thermoneutral temperatures, ACC DKI mice maintain normal energy expenditure and thermogenesis, but fail to increase appetite and lose weight. We demonstrate that the ACC DKI phenotype can be mimicked in wild type mice using a ghrelin receptor antagonist and that ACC DKI mice have impaired orexigenic responses to ghrelin, indicating ACC DKI mice have a ghrelin signaling defect. These data suggest that therapeutic strategies aimed at inhibiting ACC phosphorylation may suppress appetite following metabolic stress.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Appetite</kwd><kwd>cold</kwd><kwd>AMPK</kwd><kwd>acetyl-CoA carboxylase</kwd><kwd>fasting</kwd><kwd>thermogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1068813 and 1085460</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Galic</surname><given-names>Sandra</given-names></name><name><surname>Steinberg</surname><given-names>Gregory R</given-names></name><name><surname>Kemp</surname><given-names>Bruce E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001804</institution-id><institution>Canada Research Chairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Steinberg</surname><given-names>Gregory R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>J Bruce Duncan Endowed Chair in Metabolic diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Steinberg</surname><given-names>Gregory R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1084344</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andrews</surname><given-names>Zane B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Victorian Government Operational Infrastructure Support Scheme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Infrastructure</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kemp</surname><given-names>Bruce E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders played no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A single mutation in acetyl-CoA carboxylase blocking AMPK regulation inhibits food intake in mice in response to cold exposure or fasting causing them to lose weight.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>There are 1.9 billion adults overweight or obese worldwide, placing them at increased risk of developing type two diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease and cancer (World Health Organization, Fact Sheet N°311, <italic>Obesity and overweight</italic>). Weight gain develops as a consequence of an imbalance between the individual’s energy intake and energy expenditure, as occurs with over nutrition and sedentary life styles. Current weight loss strategies are typically aimed at generating a negative energy balance through calorie restriction (dieting) or increases in energy expenditure (exercise). In recent years brown fat thermogenesis has emerged as a potential alternative to exercise to increase energy expenditure in humans and has led to increased interest in the development of pharmacological activators of thermogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cypess and Kahn, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Whittle et al., 2011</xref>). However, weight loss strategies aimed at prolonged negative energy balance typically fail due to compensatory increases in appetite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doucet et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sumithran et al., 2011</xref>). The underlying molecular mechanisms by which increases in energy demand are coupled to increased caloric intake are not fully understood. Thus, gaining a better understanding of these mechanisms may reveal new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of obesity.</p><p>The serine/threonine kinase AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a well-recognized regulator of whole-body energy balance. AMPK is activated by intracellular energy depletion induced by muscle contraction, nutrient deprivation and hypoxia and acts to restore ATP levels by inhibiting anabolic energy-consuming and promoting catabolic ATP-generating pathways. Factors that lead to activation of AMPK increase appetite by promoting orexigenic neuropeptide expression in the hypothalamus, including agouti-related transcript (AgRP), neuropeptide Y (NPY), orexins and melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), while suppressing anorexigenic signals, such as proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Claret et al., 2007</xref>). AMPK activation simultaneously reduces energy expenditure by suppressing sympathetic outflow to brown adipose tissue and reducing heat dissipation associated with thermogenesis, with the final goal to achieve energy balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">López et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martínez de Morentin et al., 2014</xref>). However, the AMPK substrates involved in these specific responses remain unclear, due to AMPK’s pleiotropic effects on metabolic pathways and cross-talk with other energy sensors, including Sirt1 and mTOR.</p><p>One of the most widely reported AMPK functions is the regulation of lipid metabolism through phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) at Ser<sup>79</sup> and ACC2 at Ser<sup>212</sup>. ACC1 Ser<sup>79</sup>/ACC2 Ser<sup>212</sup> phosphorylation inhibits the production of malonyl-CoA, a substrate for fatty acid synthase (FAS) and precursor for the de novo synthesis of palmitate. In addition, malonyl-CoA is a potent inhibitor of the mitochondrial carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT1) and limits fatty acids β-oxidation. Inhibition of ACC activity by AMPK has previously been proposed as an essential step in the regulation of the appetite and thermogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrews et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">López et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martínez de Morentin et al., 2014</xref>). We generated a mouse line with alanine knock-in mutations of ACC1 Ser<sup>79</sup> and ACC2 Ser<sup>212</sup> (ACC DKI mice) that render ACC activity and malonyl-CoA production insensitive to AMPK. We report that ACC1 Ser<sup>79</sup>/ACC2 Ser<sup>212</sup> phosphorylation is selectively important for promoting food intake and determining fuel utilization under cold stress, while AMPK-regulated energy expenditure and capacity for thermogenesis are independent of AMPK-ACC signaling. Furthermore, our results show that inhibition of ACC1 Ser<sup>79</sup>/ACC2 Ser<sup>212</sup> phosphorylation leads to ghrelin insensitivity and indicate that increased food intake in response to metabolic stress requires intact ghrelin receptor-mediated activation of the AMPK-ACC pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Inhibition of ACC1 Ser<sup>79</sup>/ACC2 Ser<sup>212</sup> phosphorylation increases adipose tissue lipid synthesis capacity, but does not promote adiposity</title><p>Changes in lipid metabolism in adipose tissue are known to have profound effects on whole body energy homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lodhi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vernochet et al., 2012</xref>). To gain insight into the importance of ACC1 Ser<sup>79</sup>/ACC2 Ser<sup>212</sup> phosphorylation for body mass regulation, we assessed ACC enzyme activity and lipid metabolism in adipose tissue of wild-type and ACC DKI mice. Activity of ACC1, the main ACC isoform in murine adipose tissue, was increased in brown and subcutaneous inguinal white fat of ACC DKI mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and correlated with increased lipogenesis in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting an increased propensity for lipid accumulation in ACC DKI adipose tissue. In contrast, inhibition of ACC Ser<sup>79</sup>/ACC2 Ser<sup>212</sup> phosphorylation did not affect the capacity for <sup>14</sup>C-palmitate oxidation in brown or subcutaneous fat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To assess the impact of increased adipose tissue lipogenesis on body mass regulation, we monitored weekly body weights of male mice on standard chow diet and housed at room temperature (18–20°) from 3 to 30 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We found that ACC DKI mice tended to be leaner than age-matched wild-type mice from 15 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) with a small reduction in total adiposity at older age as determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Furthermore, measurements of individual fat pad weights indicated that the reduced adiposity was due to changes in white fat mass, as brown fat mass was similar between genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). These data suggest the presence of a mechanism, by which loss of ACC1 Ser<sup>79</sup>/ACC2 Ser<sup>212</sup> phosphorylation may confer an overall negative energy balance leading to modest reductions in adiposity over time, despite promoting increased capacity for lipid synthesis in isolated tissue.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32656.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Inhibition of ACC1 Ser<sup>79</sup>ACC2 Ser<sup>212</sup> phosphorylation increases adipose tissue lipid synthesis, but does not promote adiposity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) ACC1 activity in brown fat and subcutaneous fat of 12–15 week old male mice (n = 9).

We housed mice individually and measured metabolic parameters continuously for the duration of 72 hr using indirect calorimetry. Thermogenesis contributes significantly to overall metabolic rate at temperatures below thermoneutrality (8% increase in energy expenditure per 1°C drop in temperature below 28°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Virtue et al., 2012</xref>) and AMPK has previously been implicated in regulating the capacity of brown fat for heat generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">López et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martínez de Morentin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Martínez de Morentin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mottillo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Whittle et al., 2012</xref>).

At sub-thermoneutral temperatures wild-type mice increased their food intake to meet the energy demands of thermogenesis required to maintain body temperature. In contrast, ACC DKI mice showed no increases in appetite and, regardless of the degree of cold exposure, consumed the same amount of food as if housed at thermoneutrality. Given the sharp increase in energy expenditure required for heat generation at lower temperatures, ACC DKI mice would be expected to suffer an energy imbalance that becomes greater depending on the degree of cold exposure.</p><p>The increased metabolic rate at cold exposure is supported by an increase in substrate mobilization, with brown fat being largely responsible for determining the substrate utilization profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartelt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stanford et al., 2013</xref>). ACC DKI mice showed reduced respiratory exchange ratio (RER) at temperatures below 28°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G-I</xref>), indicating that in response to the reduced energy intake, ACC DKI mice oxidized fat at the expense of carbohydrate. Furthermore, measurement of the expression profile of metabolic genes in brown fat of mice housed at 14°C for 72 hr revealed a significant upregulation of genes involved in fatty acid β-oxidation and a concomitant reduction of lipogenic genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>), suggesting that brown fat of ACC DKI mice has undergone specific metabolic adaptations for greater utilization of fatty acids after cold stress. This difference in RER appeared to be a specific response to the cold exposure, as ACC DKI mice housed at thermoneutral conditions showed either no difference when compared to wild-type littermates or a reversal to preferential utilization of carbohydrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H and I</xref>). Consistent with reduced oxidation of lipids, ACC DKI mice had significantly elevated serum triglyceride levels when housed at thermoneutrality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>), while an acute exposure to 30°C also revealed increased plasma non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Together with the increased capacity for fatty acid synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), this indicates that in the absence of metabolic stress, inhibition of ACC1 Ser<sup>79</sup>/ACC2 Ser<sup>212</sup> phosphorylation may indeed predispose to increased adiposity.</p><p>ACC DKI mice also showed a strong tendency for reduced ambulatory activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2, C–E</xref>), particularly at 14°C, which may have been a consequence of reduced food-seeking behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sakkou et al., 2007</xref>) associated with the reduced appetite in ACC DKI mice. However, at sub-thermoneutral temperatures, changes in activity levels have been shown to contribute little to total daily energy expenditure as most of the energy expended is due to brown fat thermogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Virtue et al., 2012</xref>).

While the short-term cold exposure increased c-Fos staining in multiple nuclei across the hypothalamus, we could not detect any genotype differences in neuronal activation in hypothalamic areas, known to be involved in the regulation of thermogenesis and energy expenditure, such as the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), paraventricular nucleus (PVN) or ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2, A,B</xref>). However, we found the most apparent reduction of c-Fos-positive cells specifically in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of ACC DKI mice at 4°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The ARC of the hypothalamus is considered the primary nutrient-sensing center regulating appetite by responding to nutritional and hormonal cues from the periphery. To investigate whether ACC DKI mice may have altered peripheral signals following temperature stress, we measured plasma concentrations of metabolic hormones of mice housed at cold stress or thermoneutrality for 72 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Exposure of mice to either 14°C or 28°C did not change overall plasma leptin concentrations and the amounts were similar in wild-type and ACC DKI mice with both conditions. In contrast, plasma insulin and ghrelin concentrations responded to temperature stress in a reciprocal manner. While there was no genotype difference in the plasma levels of insulin, the increase in plasma ghrelin was exacerbated in cold-exposed ACC DKI mice, suggesting a potential defect in the response to the ghrelin signal in these mice.</p><p>Ghrelin is an orexigenic hormone secreted from the endocrine cells of the stomach that has been well described during the fasting-feeding transition, whereby the plasma ghrelin concentration increases with fasting and decrease immediately after a meal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cummings et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tschöp et al., 2001</xref>). Ghrelin has previously been reported to increase food intake through AMPK activation in the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrews et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">López et al., 2008</xref>). To further explore the possibility that ghrelin action may be affected in ACC DKI mice, we investigated the appetite response of mice after an overnight fast, when ghrelin signaling would be expected to be most relevant. We found that ACC DKI mice consumed significantly less food after a 5 hr period of refeeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This correlated with decreased hypothalamic mRNA expression of the orexigenic neuropeptides <italic>Npy</italic> and <italic>Agrp</italic>, whereas expression of the anorexigenic <italic>Pomc</italic> and <italic>Cartpt</italic> was similar between genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In contrast, we did not detect any difference in the weekly <italic>ad libitum</italic> food intake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), suggesting that, similar to our previous observations during cold exposure, the effects of the knock in mutation on appetite only become apparent after a metabolic challenge, such as an overnight fast.</p><p>To gain insight into the potential endocrine signals responsible for the appetite difference after fasting, we measured plasma concentrations of ghrelin and the anorexigenic leptin and insulin, all of which have previously been suggested to regulate AMPK activity and food intake during fasting and refeeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">López et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Minokoshi et al., 2004</xref>). Leptin and insulin concentrations decreased after overnight fasting without significant differences between genotypes at either fasted or <italic>ad libitum</italic> fed conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). In contrast, plasma ghrelin was significantly increased in fasted ACC DKI mice, comparable to the increase observed during cold exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Together these results show that in addition to increasing energy intake during cold exposure, AMPK-ACC signaling also contributes to the orexigenic response to fasting, as another form of metabolic stress. Both conditions are accompanied by a rise in plasma ghrelin levels, which is exacerbated in ACC DKI mice, suggesting that ghrelin signaling may be the pathway responsible for the reduced appetite response in these mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>ACC DKI mice show reduced sensitivity to the orexigenic actions of exogenous ghrelin</title><p>To assess ghrelin sensitivity of ACC DKI mice, we subsequently analyzed food intake and neuropeptide expression following exogenous ghrelin administration.

To investigate whether AMPK phosphorylation of ACC is also required for ghrelin’s chronic effects, we administered ghrelin (30 µg/day/mouse) to wild-type and ACC DKI mice over a period of 14 days using osmotic mini-pumps as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrews et al., 2008</xref>). Mice were housed at room temperature during the experiment. We found that after one week of ghrelin treatment, wild-type mice started to gain weight and reached a maximum of up to 4% increase in body mass when compared to saline-treated controls at day 12 of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). In contrast, ACC DKI mice did not show any significant changes in body mass throughout the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Accumulated food intake also increased in ghrelin-treated wild-type mice from day 5 of osmotic pump implantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), however the 24 hr daily intake difference between genotypes was not sufficient to conduct pair feeding. We also investigated the effect of prolonged ghrelin treatment on adipose tissue gene expression and found no difference in the expression of thermogenic and oxidative genes in brown fat of ghrelin-treated wild-type and ACC DKI mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), indicating that ghrelin’s suppressive effect on thermogenesis does not require ACC1 Ser<sup>79</sup>/ACC2 Ser<sup>212</sup> phosphorylation. Of all the lipogenic genes examined in epididymal white fat, only <italic>Fas</italic> mRNA expression was significantly reduced in ACC DKI tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, analysis of adiposity and lean mass by NMR or measurements of subcutaneous and epididymal fat pad mass showed no significant differences between genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1, D–G</xref>), suggesting that the effect of reduced <italic>Fas</italic> expression may have been offset by the increased ACC activity in ACC DKI fat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Furthermore, the difference in body weight was therefore likely due to the small, but accumulated difference in food intake. At day 14 of the treatment, we placed ghrelin-treated wild-type and ACC DKI mice into metabolic cages for 24 hr at 21°C for measurement of metabolic parameters. 12 hr accumulated food intake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) and 12 hr average RER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>) were reduced during the dark cycle in ACC DKI mice, while energy expenditure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>) and ambulatory activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>) were comparable to wild-type. This is similar to the phenotype seen after cold exposure, when plasma ghrelin concentrations are elevated, suggesting that the reduced food intake and preference for lipid utilization in ACC DKI mice may have been a consequence of reduced ghrelin sensitivity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Inhibiting ghrelin signaling reduces food intake and RER in wild-type but not ACC DKI mice</title><p>To further investigate whether defects in ghrelin signaling may be responsible for the metabolic changes observed in ACC DKI mice during cold exposure, we treated wild-type and ACC DKI mice with saline or the ghrelin receptor (GHSR1a) antagonist [D-Lys<sup>3</sup>]-GHRP-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asakawa et al., 2003</xref>) (6.7 μmol/kg), twice daily at the onset of the dark and light phase and measured metabolic parameters by indirect calorimetry.

For example, adiposity, RER, insulin sensitivity and hepatic glucose production are similar in high-fat fed wild-type and ACC DKI mice. Food intake has not been examined, but given that high-fat feeding is known to decrease AMPK activity in the hypothalamus and other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lindholm et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Martin et al., 2006</xref>), it is possible that the effect of the DKI mutation on appetite is lost under these conditions.</p><p>We initially confirmed that ACC DKI mice fed a high-fat diet at standard animal house temperatures from 6 weeks of age for up to 15 weeks gained weight at a similar rate to wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). We next measured the average 24 hr food intake over four consecutive days and found no difference between genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Accumulated food intake in response to an acute intraperitoneal injection with ghrelin (1 µg/g body weight) was also similar between wild-type and ACC DKI mice at 2 hr or 5 hr after treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). It is important to note that regardless of the genotype, ghrelin treatment failed to elicit a statistically significant increase in food intake from saline control and overall intake after ghrelin injection was approximately 5-fold lower when compared to ghrelin-induced intake of chow-fed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This is in agreement with previous reports showing that ghrelin is unable to induce a hyperphagic response in diet-induced obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gardiner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Perreault et al., 2004</xref>) and that this effect may be specifically due to ghrelin resistance in NPY/AgRP neurons in the ARC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Briggs et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>We also investigated the appetite response to an overnight fast in ACC DKI and wild-type mice fed a high-fat diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>).

There was an approximately 5-fold reduction in the overall intake when compared to the response in chow-fed animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), indicating that, similar to the response to ghrelin, high-fat feeding attenuates fasting-induced hyperphagia independently of the DKI mutation.</p><p>These data show that the effect of the DKI mutation on appetite are lost with diet-induced obesity and confirm our overall conclusion that AMPK phosphorylation of ACC is of little consequence for appetite regulation during energy surplus, but is an important signaling step under conditions of energy deficit.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>ACC1 Ser<sup>79</sup>/ACC2 Ser<sup>212</sup> phosphorylation is reported in nearly all studies of AMPK physiology and used as a surrogate readout of AMPK activation, leading to the conclusion that this signaling step is required for most functions attributed to AMPK. Using the ACC DKI mouse model we have found that contrary to what was previously assumed, ACC1 Ser<sup>79</sup>/ACC2 Ser<sup>212</sup> phosphorylation is not required under conditions of reduced AMPK activity, such as with increases in thermogenesis and energy expenditure or leptin-induced suppression of food intake. Instead, AMPK phosphorylation of ACC is indispensable for increases in appetite in response to metabolic stress and orexigenic signaling, such as cold exposure, fasting and ghrelin stimulation. It becomes apparent that AMPK is capable of engaging different immediate downstream substrates to mediate these effects.</p><p>A number of factors, such as estradiol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martínez de Morentin et al., 2014</xref>), nicotine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Martínez de Morentin et al., 2012</xref>), BMP8B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Whittle et al., 2012</xref>) and thyroid hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">López et al., 2010</xref>) have been shown to inhibit hypothalamic AMPK to reduce sympathetic activity to brown fat. Most of these studies imply AMPK regulation of ACC phosphorylation as an underlying mechanism. However, our results show that the regulation of thermogenic capacity and energy expenditure by AMPK can be mediated independently of ACC Ser<sup>79</sup>/ACC2 Ser<sup>212</sup> phosphorylation and may involve other downstream substrates. These processes may include phosphorylation of transcription factors with subsequent effects on gene expression or reductions of cellular lipid content through substrates other than ACC, such as inhibition of FAS activity.</p><p>In contrast, our study confirms that AMPK phosphorylation of ACC is important for increasing appetite. However the importance is limited to effects induced by metabolic stress, such as starvation or short-term cold exposure, whereas the <italic>ad libitum</italic> feeding control can be achieved independently of ACC phosphorylation. Furthermore, our results reveal that the ACC phosphorylation appears to be specifically relevant for the regulation of orexigenic responses. Anorexigenic factors, such as refeeding, leptin or diet-induced obesity, a condition characterized by increased plasma leptin concentrations, are associated with reduced hypothalamic AMPK activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lindholm et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Martin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Minokoshi et al., 2004</xref>). Consequently, the effect of AMPK phosphorylation and inhibition of ACC would be expected to be diminished under these conditions. Suppression of food intake by leptin has previously been suggested to require ACC activation, as administration of the ACC allosteric inhibitor TOFA prevented leptin’s anorectic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gao et al., 2007</xref>). Our results suggest that the ACC activation status in response to leptin can be regulated by other means than ACC1 Ser<sup>79</sup>/ACC2 Ser<sup>212</sup> phosphorylation. Such effects could stem from transcriptional increases in ACC expression or increases in allosteric activators of ACC, such as the TCA cycle intermediate citrate. However, none of these have previously been reported in the literature to occur specifically in response to leptin.</p><p>In contrast, the effects of the orexigenic hormone ghrelin on food intake and neuropeptide expression were significantly blunted in ACC DKI mice, showing that of ACC1 Ser<sup>79</sup>/ACC2 Ser<sup>212</sup> phosphorylation by AMPK is an important component of ghrelin signaling and cannot be fully compensated for by other means. However, ghrelin-induced food intake was not completely abolished in ACC DKI mice, suggesting that other pathways must contribute to the ghrelin response. mTOR signaling is a good candidate to mediate this effect, as it has previously been shown to mediate the orexigenic actions of ghrelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lage et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stevanovic et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Given ghrelin’s well accepted role in providing an orexigenic stimulus during fasting and the reduced sensitivity of ACC DKI mice to exogenous ghrelin treatment, it is plausible that the reduced feeding response of ACC DKI mice after a fast may at least in part be due to impaired ghrelin signaling. Whether the ghrelin insensitivity may also be the underlying mechanism for the reduced appetite after cold exposure is less clear. Studies in mice deficient for ghrelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sun et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wortley et al., 2004</xref>), the acylated form of ghrelin (ghrelin O-acyl transferase knockout mice) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhao et al., 2010</xref>) or the ghrelin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sun et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zigman et al., 2005</xref>) have failed to show an effect of ghrelin signaling on spontaneous feeding at standard animal house temperatures and there are conflicting reports with regards to its effect on RER. However, there is evidence that similar to our findings in ACC DKI mice, ghrelin’s effect on appetite may be more apparent under conditions of prolonged negative energy balance. For example, both ghrelin- and ghrelin receptor knockout mice show attenuated feeding in response to repeated overnight fasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abizaid et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, the increase in appetite and rebound weight gain after diet-induced weight loss has been shown to be ghrelin dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Briggs et al., 2013</xref>). Under subthermoneutral conditions, mice lacking preproghrelin (which is processed to acyl-ghrelin, desacyl-ghrelin and obestatin) are unable to regulate sleep and body temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Szentirmai et al., 2009</xref>). However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no reports on the effect of ghrelin- or ghrelin receptor deficiency on feeding during prolonged cold exposure. Consistent with our findings in mice, plasma ghrelin has been reported to increase after exposure to cold ambient temperature in rats and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stengel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tomasik et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, our data show that the use of a ghrelin receptor antagonist reproduces many of the metabolic features of ACC DKI mice at cooler temperatures, such as the reduced food intake, reduced RER and unaltered energy expenditure, indicating that ghrelin receptor signaling may be mediating the increase in appetite during cold stress.</p><p>We cannot exclude that in addition to ghrelin signaling, inhibition of ACC phosphorylation may affect other orexigenic pathways. For example, adiponectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kubota et al., 2007</xref>) and endocannabinoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kola et al., 2005</xref>) have also been shown to promote feeding by increasing AMPK activity in the hypothalamus, albeit with additional effects on POMC expression, which we did not observe in our study. Furthermore, it is also possible that signaling initiated by peripheral metabolites may be dysregulated in ACC DKI mice. However, glucose and other metabolites, such as lactate or citrate have all been associated with inhibition of AMPK activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cesquini et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cha and Lane, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wolfgang et al., 2007</xref>). These metabolic signals would therefore be expected to lead to a reduction in ACC1 Ser<sup>79</sup>/ACC2 Ser<sup>212</sup> phosphorylation in wild-type tissue mimicking the effect of the DKI mutation and diminishing any differences in phenotype. We have observed such a redundancy of ACC phosphorylation for appetite control in mice fed a high-fat diet, another condition characterized by low hypothalamic AMPK activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Martin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Minokoshi et al., 2004</xref>). Obesity is also associated with ghrelin resistance in NPY/AgRP neurons in the ARC leading to reduced ghrelin- and fasting-induced appetite response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Briggs et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gardiner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Perreault et al., 2004</xref>). It is possible that the reduced AMPK activity and ACC1 Ser<sup>79</sup>/ACC2 Ser<sup>212</sup> phosphorylation under these conditions is a contributing factor for the diminished ghrelin response, as AMPK/ACC mediated fatty acid oxidation has previously been shown to be an important activator of NPY/AgRP neuropeptide expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrews et al., 2008</xref>). However, food intake in both, wild-type and ACC DKI mice was inhibited beyond the values seen in ACC DKI on chow diet, suggesting that the high-fat feeding may overwhelm the effect of ACC phosphorylation by an additional mechanism downstream or independent of the DKI effect.</p><p>These results emphasize that the signaling step of ACC1 Ser<sup>79</sup>/ACC2 Ser<sup>212</sup> phosphorylation is most relevant under conditions of metabolic stress and increased AMPK activity. In <italic>ad libitum</italic> fed mice, reductions in appetite and RER were only apparent at sub-thermoneutral temperatures and were sufficient to prevent an increase in adiposity in these mice despite their propensity for enhanced lipid synthesis in peripheral tissues. Under sufficient metabolic stress the anorexigenic effect of the ACC DKI mutation can dominate over the lipogenic effects in the periphery, but this balance would be expected to shift towards increased fat accumulation in the absence of stress at thermoneutrality. As emphasized previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Karp, 2012</xref>), these results show that the environmental temperature is an important factor that needs to be taken into consideration to correctly interpret metabolic experiments in mice and would be of particular importance when investigating the role of stress-activated enzymes, such as AMPK.</p><p>In summary, our data identify AMPK phosphorylation of ACC as an important pathway for the regulation of feeding and fuel utilization under metabolic stress. While low ambient temperature and dieting are means to generate negative energy balance, their long-term effectiveness for body weight management is low due to increases in appetite. One year after weight loss 30–35% of patients regain the lost weight and after 5 years 50% will return to their previous body weight and often exceed it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wadden et al., 2004</xref>). The weight regain after diet-induced weight loss has been attributed to increased circulating ghrelin concentrations and restored ghrelin receptor sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Briggs et al., 2013</xref>). Specific inhibition of ACC1 Ser<sup>79</sup>/ACC2 Ser<sup>212</sup> phosphorylation may have the potential to reduce ghrelin receptor signaling and alleviate the hunger signal associated with calorie restriction thereby aiding in long-term weight loss management after diet-induced weight loss.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (Mus musculus)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Acaca</italic></td><td valign="top">NA</td><td valign="top">MGI:108451; Ensembl:ENSMUSG00000020532</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (Mus musculus)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Acacb</italic></td><td valign="top">NA</td><td valign="top">MGI:2140940; Ensembl:ENSMUSG00000042010</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (Mus Musculus, males)</td><td valign="top">ACC DKI</td><td valign="top">doi: 10.1038/nm.3372</td><td valign="top">MGI:5780965; MGI:5780967</td><td valign="top">C57BL/6-Acaca<sup>tm1.1Grst</sup>, C57BL/6-Acacb<sup>tm1.1Grst</sup>; maintained in B.E.

Brains were collected and post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and placed in 30% sucrose overnight before coronal sections were taken at 30 μm on a cryostat. After quenching endogenouse peroxidases with 1% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, sections were blocked with 2% normal goat serum and incubated with rabbit anti-c-Fos antibody (ABE457; Millipore, Billerica, MA) overnight at 1: 1000. After several washes, the sections were incubated for 2 hr with biotinylated swine anti-rabbit antibody (E0353, Dako) at a dilution of 1:500 at room temperature, then washed and incubated with avidin-biotin complex (Vectastain, Vector laboratories, Burlingame, CA). c-Fos immunoreactivity was visualized after diaminobenzidine (DAB) reaction for 2 min. Images were taken with 100x magnification using a Leica DM 2000 light microscope and relayed with an Olympus DP72 camera. For quantification of c-Fos immunoreactivity, the number of c-Fos positive cells within a constant and defined frame was counted from 3 to 5 consecutive sections per mouse brain using ImageJ software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Food intake experiments</title><p>For assessment of fasting-induced food intake, food was removed at 1600 hr and returned to the cage the next day at 0900 hr. Food intake was measured over the following 5 hr. For leptin-induced food intake, mice were fed ad libitum throughout the experiment. Mice were injected intraperitoneally twice daily, at the onset of the dark and light phase with leptin (1 μg/g body weight) and 24 hr food intake measured over two consecutive days. Food intake measurements in response to saline injections two days prior to the experiment were used as controls. Recombinant leptin used for intraperitoneal injections was from Lonza (#450–31, Tullamarine, Australia). For acute ghrelin-induced food intake, mice were injected intraperitoneally with saline or ghrelin (1 μg/g body weight) and food intake measured 2 hr after injection. 4 days later mice that received saline were treated with ghrelin and those that received ghrelin were treated with saline and data from both experiments were combined. To determine the plasma ghrelin concentration achieved after acute ghrelin treatment, whole blood was collected 1 hr after intraperitoneal injection with ghrelin (1 μg/g body weight) or with an equivalent volume of saline and processed for analysis by ELISA as described below. For chronic ghrelin treatments, ghrelin (30 μg/day/mouse at 0.5 μl/h for 14 days) or saline was delivered using osmotic minipumps (Alzet, Cupertino, CA) implanted subcutaneously on the dorsal body surface. Food intake and body weight was recorded daily at approximately 1000 hr for 14 days. At day 14 mice were placed into comprehensive mouse metabolic monitoring system for 24 hr for indirect calorimetry. The following day, mice were culled and blood and tissues taken for biochemical analyses. Synthetic <italic>n</italic>-octanoylated mouse ghrelin peptide used for in vivo treatments was supplied by Purar Chemicals (Doncaster, Australia) and purified using low pressure C18 reversed-phase chromatography (0.1% TFA buffer with a 0–60% acetonitrile gradient).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Metabolic studies</title><p>Body composition analysis was performed by nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (Whole Body Composition Analyzer, EchoMRI, Houston, TX).

Mice were fed a standard chow diet ad libitum and kept on a 12 hr light/dark cycle at 14°C, 21°C or 28°C with O<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> consumption and production, food intake and ambulatory activity measured continuously for 72 hr after a 24 hr acclimatization period. At the end of the metabolic measurements, mice were culled and bloods and tissues taken for biochemical analyses. For metabolic studies using ghrelin receptor inhibition, baseline metabolic parameters were measured in mice maintained at 21°C for 24 hr. Mice were subsequently injected intraperitoneally with 6.7 μmol/kg [D-Lys<sup>3</sup>]-GHRP-6 (ab141148, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) or equivalent volume of saline twice daily at the onset of the light and dark phase and metabolic parameters measured for 24 hr at 21°C followed by 24 hr at 14°C. For plasma hormone measurements, whole blood was collected using the submandibular method into tubes containing K<sub>3</sub> EDTA and treated with AEBSF (final concentration of 1 mg/ml). Plasma was acidified with HCl (final concentration of 0.05 N) and hormone concentrations analyzed by ELISA using kits from Millipore for leptin (EZML82K) and acylated ghrelin (EZRGRA90K), Mercodia (Uppsala, Sweden) for insulin (#10-1247-01), Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) for thyroxine (EIAT4C) and Abnova (Taipei, Taiwan) for norepinephrine and epinephrine (KA3767). Plasma non-esterified fatty acids (#279–75401) and triglycerides (#290–63701) were measured using colorimetric assays from Wako (Osaka, Japan). For tissue norepinephrine content measurements, brown fat was weighed and homogenized in 0.01 N HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 4 mM Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>s</sub>O<sub>5</sub> and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C.

The data support the conclusion that inhibition of ACC phosphorylation leads to reduced appetite in fasting and cold exposure, in spite of maintaining body temperature in the cold. Impaired responsiveness to ghrelin is demonstrated in these double knockin mice as well, supporting your conclusion that ghrelin signaling requires these phosphorylation sites in ACC.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There are a few issues we would like you to address in submitting a revised version of your manuscript.

In reality most obese individuals are in constant positive energy balance and so would targeting this pathway have any utility in the clinic? Use of ghrelin antagonists are already available. Secondly, the interpretation of some of the data is clouded by lack of expected responses in control mice. For example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> there was no significant effect of ghrelin on food intake in WT Mice? Also there was not a change in AMPK activity. Also related to the claimed ghrelin resistance, DKI mice had increased circulating ghrelin levels and so why did this not compensate for the block in ghrelin action. In the experiments where ghrelin was injected, what were the circulating levels of ghrelin in both groups of mice?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32656.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There are a few issues we would like you to address in submitting a revised version of your manuscript.

This becomes clinically relevant when obese individuals are exposed to conditions that confer a negative energy balance, such as occurs with calorie restriction during dieting regimens or increased energy expenditure (cold exposure). Diet-induced weight loss is known to correlate with increased plasma ghrelin concentrations (Cummings DE, et al. (2002), N Eng J Med 346:1623-1630) and restored ghrelin sensitivity in hypothalamic NPY/AgRP neurons (Briggs DI, et al. (2013)). In addition, it has been shown that the rebound weight gain after calorie- restriction is ghrelin dependent (Briggs DI, et al. (2013)) and that reducing circulating ghrelin concentrations is an effective strategy to lower post-dieting increases in food intake and suppress body weight rebound (Chen VP, et al. (2017), PNAS 114: 10960-10965).</p><p>Based on our findings we anticipate that inhibition of ACC phosphorylation may reduce weight loss-induced increases in hypothalamic ghrelin sensitivity and help prevent increases in appetite and rebound weight gain after calorie restriction. Therefore, this pathway may be clinically relevant to millions of obese or overweight people trying to prevent rebound weight gain after diet-induced weight loss. We have expanded the last paragraph of the Discussion to clarify potential clinical applications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Secondly, the interpretation of some of the data is clouded by lack of expected responses in control mice.

We have now investigated the activity of AMPK α2, which has been reported to be the predominant isoform expressed in neurons (Turnley AM, et al. (1999), J Neurochem 72:1707-1716) and better represents the change in AMPK activity in ghrelin-responsive neurons. The new data set is now presented alongside the AMPK α1 activity in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>. The activity of AMPK α2 is approximately 5-fold lower than the activity of AMPK α1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also related to the claimed ghrelin resistance, DKI mice had increased circulating ghrelin levels and so why did this not compensate for the block in ghrelin action.</p></disp-quote><p>We propose that the defect in ghrelin signalling in the ACC DKI mutant mice is downstream of the ghrelin receptor. Increasing extracellular concentrations of ghrelin may therefore not be able to compensate as the signal cannot be efficiently transduced to downstream effectors. This implies that ACC Ser78/Ser212 phosphorylation is an obligatory signalling component of the ghrelin receptor pathway.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the experiments where ghrelin was injected, what were the circulating levels of ghrelin in both groups of mice?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now measured the plasma ghrelin concentrations in mice 1 h after intraperitoneal injection with 1 μg/g body weight ghrelin or equivalent volume of saline. We have found that this dose resulted in an approximately 3.3-fold increase in plasma ghrelin, when compared to saline-injected controls. Overall, the plasma ghrelin levels achieved after exogenous ghrelin administration reached on average 1.5-fold of the fasting-induced ghrelin concentrations.
