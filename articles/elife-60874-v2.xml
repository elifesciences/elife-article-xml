We recorded electroencephalogram during food choices while participants responded naturally or regulated their choices by attending to health attributes or decreasing attention to taste attributes. Using a drift diffusion model, we predicted the time course of neural signals associated with AVC and EA. Results suggested that event-related potentials (ERPs) correlated with the time course of model-predicted taste-attribute signals, with no modulation by regulation. By contrast, suppression of frontal and occipital alpha power correlated with the time course of EA, tracked tastiness according to its goal relevance, and predicted individual variation in successful down-regulation of tastiness. Additionally, an earlier rise in frontal and occipital theta power represented food tastiness more strongly during regulation and predicted a weaker influence of food tastiness on behaviour. Our findings illuminate how regulation modifies the representation of attributes during the process of EA.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>decision making</kwd><kwd>cognitive self regulation</kwd><kwd>brain oscillations</kwd><kwd>drift diffusion models</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN-2016-05641</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hutcherson</surname><given-names>Cendri A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001804</institution-id><institution>Canada Research Chairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hutcherson</surname><given-names>Cendri A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007224</institution-id><institution>Connaught Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hutcherson</surname><given-names>Cendri A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Alpha oscillations represent an intermediate stage of evidence accumulation that is influenced by self-regulation in value-based decision making.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neuroeconomic theories of decision making suggest that value-based decisions can be captured by a process involving several distinct computations, including both attribute valuation and evidence accumulation (EA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rangel et al., 2008</xref>). For example, when we decide what to eat for lunch, we might consider attributes like how tasty or healthy a food is, our dieting goals, current hunger levels, and so forth. Each of these attributes constitutes evidence for or against eating the food, with different attributes given differential weight depending on a person’s momentary goals. To choose, current models assume that noisy neural representations of this attribute-based evidence may serve as the input to a process of sequential EA over time until sufficient evidence has accumulated to pass a decision threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Forstmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Based on this model of choice, recent work has argued that attempts to regulate dietary behaviour may operate in part by altering the weights given to specific attributes during food choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hutcherson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sullivan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tusche and Hutcherson, 2018</xref>). For example, dieting goals could be accomplished either by down-regulating the influence of hedonic attributes like tastiness, up-regulating the influence of attributes like healthiness, or both. Yet the precise computational route by which this up- and down-regulation occurs, and why some people succeed or fail to regulate effectively, remains unclear. Here, we took a computational decision neuroscience approach to this problem, linking computational predictions to observed neural data, to ask two questions. First, how do the computations contributing to a choice change when people regulate their behaviour by increasing or decreasing the influence of different attributes? Second, which of these changes predict success or failure in altering food consumption?</p><p>Sequential accumulation models provide a behaviourally and biologically plausible approach to study these questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Forstmann et al., 2016</xref>) that appears to capture patterns of choice, response time, and neural activity with remarkable accuracy. For example, in the perceptual decision-making domain, electroencephalogram (EEG) studies have shown that decrements in the power of alpha (9–12 Hz) and theta (4–8 Hz) oscillations correlate with the predicted build-up of evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">van Vugt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Werkle-Bergner et al., 2014</xref>). Analyses of event-related potentials (ERPs) also show that the P300 component elicited by oddball stimuli in auditory and visual paradigms satisfies the characteristics of an EA signal (decision variable) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">O'Connell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Twomey et al., 2015</xref>). Parallel to this, in the value-based decision-making domain, EEG and MEG studies have found that model predictions about the temporal dynamics of EA during decisions correlate with both parietal and frontal theta and alpha (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hunt et al., 2012</xref>), and with beta (18–20 Hz) and gamma (40–80 Hz) oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Polanía et al., 2014</xref>). Given that value-based decision making engages multiple cognitive processes and involves communication across different regions, these diverse results are perhaps not surprising. However, they raise important questions about what precise computations these EEG dynamics represent, and whether and how these signals might be altered by up- and down-regulating the influence of food attributes on choice.</p><p>These questions are vital for understanding the underlying regulatory mechanisms in value-based decision making since it could target multiple distinct phases of the EA process. Although considerable evidence suggests that self-regulation during decision making modifies choices by changing the influence of attributes on behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hare et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hare et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hutcherson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sullivan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tusche and Hutcherson, 2018</xref>), it is unclear how such changes are accomplished neurally. For example, observed decreases in the influence of food tastiness on behaviour could be accomplished either by abolishing attribute representations of tastiness or by preventing the incorporation of such representations into the EA process. If the former is true, regulation should directly influence the neural representation of an attribute such as tastiness (perhaps early on in the decision process), whereas if the latter is true, the neural representation of an attribute might remain intact and only the later stages of decision making, when the attribute is incorporated into EA, should change. Unfortunately, fMRI studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hare et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hutcherson et al., 2012</xref>) cannot dissociate the neural representations of attributes and EA with the necessary temporal resolution for testing these distinct processes.</p><p>EEG studies provide some clues in this regard, although they also leave open a number of questions. For example, some research suggests that when instructed to attend to food healthiness, the amplitude of a fronto-central ERP component around 300–500 ms post-food stimulus correlated more strongly with food healthiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Harris et al., 2013</xref>). However, it is unclear whether this ERP component represents changes to early attribute representations or changes to their subsequent weight in the EA process. Moreover, while regulation reduced <italic>behavioural</italic> sensitivity to <italic>tastiness</italic> considerations, ERP amplitude in the same time window correlated with tastiness regardless of regulatory effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Harris et al., 2013</xref>). This leaves open the question of how the influence of <italic>tastiness</italic> on behaviour was suppressed.</p><p>Given previous research that clearly links oscillatory dynamics to EA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hunt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Polanía et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">van Vugt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Werkle-Bergner et al., 2014</xref>), and more ambiguous evidence linking value representations to fronto-central ERPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Harris et al., 2013</xref>), we took a model-based approach to determine whether part of the answer to these questions might lie in the functional role of oscillations in incorporating attribute values into the EA process. More specifically, we asked subjects to make food choices naturally or under two regulation conditions. In the HEALTH condition, designed to increase the influence of the healthiness attribute and, secondarily, decrease the influence of the tastiness attribute, we asked subjects to explicitly focus on healthy eating. In the DECREASE condition, designed to decrease the influence of the <italic>tastiness</italic> attribute on choice without strongly modifying the influence of the healthiness attribute, we asked participants to decrease their desire and craving for foods generally.</p><p>We used a computational model of choice to first fit the behavioural data, and then simulated the predicted dynamics of both attribute representation and EA during food choice under the three conditions. These simulations suggested that the computations associated with attribute values and EA follow distinct temporal trajectories. Then, we identified both ERP and oscillatory correlates of tastiness and healthiness representations during self-regulation and asked whether and how the time course of these correlates resembled the simulated computational dynamics of both attribute representation and EA during natural and regulated choices. Finally, we asked whether and how changes in these oscillatory dynamics correlated with individual differences in regulatory success, as measured by changes in model parameters. Our results suggested that the time course of ERPs correlated more strongly with model-based predictions for attribute representations, while suppression of alpha oscillatory activity correlated better with model-based predictions for EA signals. Importantly, regulation had a larger effect on the alpha-correlate of tastiness compared to the ERP-correlate of tastiness, and this effect appeared to be mediated by an increase in the power of theta oscillations in the early stages of decision formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Subjects performed a food choice task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) in which they decided whether or not they wanted to consume different foods, while focusing on one of three goals: respond naturally to all foods (NATURAL), focus on healthy eating (HEALTH), or focus on decreasing desire for all foods (DECREASE; see Materials and methods for a more detailed description of the task).

Post-hoc paired t-tests showed that weight on tastiness decreased to a similar extent in HEALTH (t (49) = −7.42, p&lt;0.001) and DECREASE (t (49) = −6.18, p&lt;0.001) compared to NATURAL. By contrast, while the weight on healthiness (<italic>w<sub>healthiness</sub></italic>) significantly increased in both HEALTH and DECREASE compared to NATURAL (HEALTH: t (49) = 9.38, p&lt;0.001; DECREASE: t(49) = 3.56, p&lt;0.001), it was significantly larger in HEALTH compared to DECREASE (t(49) = 7.12, p&lt;0.001). In addition, the value constant (<italic>ValConst</italic>) was more negative in DECREASE compared to NATURAL (t(49) = −4.11, p&lt;0.001) and HEALTH (t(49) = −6.09, p&lt;0.001), and more negative in NATURAL compared to HEALTH (t(49) = −2.38, p=0.02). Thus, while both strategies decreased the influence of tastiness on choice, HEALTH focus specifically increased the influence of healthiness, and DECREASE resulted in a decrease in value that is non-specific to tastiness or healthiness.</p><p>Regulation also influenced other parameters of the model beyond attribute weights. In particular, it changed the decision threshold (<italic>trs</italic>: F(2,98) = 25.45, p&lt;0.001) and non-decision time (<italic>ndt</italic>: F(2,98) = 4.69, p=0.01). Notably, we found little evidence that regulation affected starting point biases (<italic>spbias</italic>: p&gt;0.05), suggesting that most of the effects of regulation occurred during post-stimulus processing rather than in pre-stimulus preparation. Post-hoc paired t-tests on significant effects showed that decision threshold was higher in DECREASE compared to NATURAL (t(49) = 6.0, p&lt;0.001) and HEALTH (t(49) = 3.67, p&lt;0.001) and in HEALTH compared to NATURAL (t(49) = 4.87, p&lt;0.001).

Follow-up tests confirmed this hypothesis: we found that alpha signal was sensitive to tastiness for different durations on trials where the participant responded quickly compared to trials where they responded slowly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a, b</xref>).</p><p>Next, we conducted a further test of the idea that the <italic>alpha-correlate of tastiness</italic> relates to EA by examining response-locked data in fast and slow decisions. Prior research suggests that signals related to EA build-up gradually and peak just prior to the time of response, regardless of whether that response occurs quickly or slowly (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">O'Connell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Twomey et al., 2015</xref>). We thus theorized that we should observe a gradual build-up in alpha sensitivity to tastiness that peaks just prior to the time of response for both fast and slow responses. As expected, we found that alpha signals at taste-sensitive channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, top left) showed a build-up of correlation with tastiness in NATURAL trials that peaked just before the time of response both when decisions were made quickly and when they were made slowly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c, d</xref>). Intriguingly, this analysis also revealed an additional significant correlation with healthiness in taste-sensitive channels prior to the response on slow trials in the NATURAL condition, but not on the fast trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3e, f</xref>). The time courses of these signals correlated with the simulated time course of response-locked EA (r = −0.73, p&gt;0.05), albeit failing to reach full significance based on our a priori criteria.</p><p>Finally, we asked whether the average alpha power (as opposed to correlation with tastiness) reached a fixed value just prior to the response for fast and slow RTs, as would be expected if this signal produces the response directly. Although we found that raw alpha signals in this region did build gradually, peaking in the time before response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), they did not always reach a fully clear and consistent value, as might be predicted if these signals provided the final trigger for the motor response.</p><p>Taken together, these findings suggest that, while the <italic>alpha-correlate of tastiness</italic> shows patterns consistent with some form of EA, it may represent an intermediate stage of EA based on value that is then passed on to other mechanisms that accumulate evidence for a particular motor response.

Strikingly, and in contrast to alpha power, which tracks tastiness in the NATURAL condition but not regulation conditions, we found a single pattern matching our significance criterion: theta power at channels over occipital and frontal areas was positively correlated with tastiness early in the trial (200–500 ms) in both HEALTH (t(49) = 3.46, p=0.005; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a, b</xref>, top left) and DECREASE (t(49) = 2.8, p=0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a, b</xref>, top-right) conditions independently.

This control process might be responsible for reducing the influence of tastiness attribute representations (which we observed in ERP signals) on the EA process (observed in alpha oscillations). This interpretation predicts that, despite theta correlating with tastiness, the magnitude of this correlation should actually be <italic>negatively</italic> associated with regulation-induced decreases in the weight on tastiness, and that theta and alpha signatures might also be related. These predictions were confirmed. We found that subjects with greater increases in the <italic>theta-correlate of tastiness</italic> between 200 and 500 ms showed greater <italic>decreases</italic> in the weight on tastiness (Δ<italic>w</italic><sub>tastiness</sub>), and this was independently true for the contrast of both HEALTH (Pearson r = –0.36, p=0.01) and DECREASE (Pearson r = –0.29, p=0.04) vs. NATURAL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>).

However, the neurocomputational process by which they achieve this modulation remains unclear. Using a computational model of attribute valuation and EA, we found distinct correlates of attribute construction and EA that also showed differential effects of regulation. Whereas a fronto-central ERP component matched the predicted time course of attribute-related computations and tracked the tastiness of a food regardless of regulatory focus, alpha power recorded from frontal and occipital areas of the scalp correlated more strongly with the predicted time course of EA and tracked variation in the tastiness of food only when subjects naturally decided what foods to eat: the tastier the food, the lower the alpha power. When subjects regulated their responses in a way that reduced the behavioural influence of tastiness, this function was compromised, that is, alpha no longer tracked tastiness values. Moreover, changes in alpha, but not changes in the ERP, predicted individual differences in successful down-regulation of the influence of tastiness on choice across two different regulatory strategies. Finally, we found an earlier rise in theta power at frontal and occipital areas of the scalp that did not correlate with model-predicted time courses but predicted regulatory success. Importantly, this signal correlated positively with food tastiness only when subjects regulated their decisions, and the more it did so, the greater the <italic>decrease</italic> in the influence of food tastiness on subjects’ choices. This was true for both regulatory strategies. Taken together, our findings paint a nuanced portrait of the processes occurring during the regulation of value-based decision making. They suggest that regulation reduces the behavioural influence of tastiness not by disrupting early, stimulus-locked representations of tastiness, but by using a theta-related regulatory mechanism to disrupt the incorporation of tastiness into alpha-related EA processes.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Functional significance of alpha suppression in EA</title><p>A main question concerns the processes that the alpha signal might represent in this context. One possibility is that this signal represents the final accumulated evidence for an integrated value signal that directly triggers a motor response. We think this is unlikely for several reasons. First and foremost, averaged alpha power failed to show the kind of clear rise to a fixed bound just before the time of response, as has been observed in both ERP and alpha power in motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">O'Connell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Steinemann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Twomey et al., 2015</xref>). Second, the scalp distribution of alpha signals for tastiness and healthiness signals did not correspond perfectly, suggesting the possibility of distinct neural sources (although the poor spatial resolution prevents us from reaching a definitive conclusion). Finally, an integrated value signal should have shown robust sensitivity to both tastiness and healthiness according to the goals. Yet encoding of healthiness in alpha power was somewhat inconsistent. In health-sensitive channels, healthiness encoding occurred prior to the fastest decisions only in the HEALTH condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3g</xref>). In taste-sensitive channels, healthiness encoding occurred during the slowest decisions only in the NATURAL condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3f</xref>). Taken together, our findings suggest that the signals we observed might represent an intermediate stage of EA and leave somewhat ambiguous whether they are more consistent with an accumulation of an integrated evidence signal or instead accumulation of evidence about specific attributes. Further research, perhaps using combined EEG-fMRI, might help to resolve these important questions.</p><p>Beyond the question of what information this alpha signal represents, it is also important to consider the significance of this signal occurring in alpha oscillations, as opposed to other frequencies. Suppression of alpha oscillations, also called the event-related desynchronization of alpha, is widely known to reflect active information processing involving release from inhibition, perception, and attention and appears to be driven by cortico-cortical networks across frontal and parietal brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Foxe and Snyder, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Klimesch, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Klimesch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Samaha et al., 2018</xref>). The degree of alpha suppression also predicts success in tasks where a higher level of cortical excitation is required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Klimesch et al., 2007</xref>), while inducing transient changes in alpha activity by external stimulation leads to predictable changes in cognitive performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Klimesch et al., 2003</xref>). This literature strongly supports our observation that alpha suppression correlated with food attributes, that is, with tastiness when deciding naturally and with healthiness when focusing on health, and also correlates with behavioural evidence of regulatory success (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a–d</xref>).</p><p>Other work also supports the idea that prefrontal and posterior alpha suppression correlate with EA, although such studies have focused on perceptual decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kloosterman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">van Vugt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Werkle-Bergner et al., 2014</xref>). This work suggests that alpha suppression may relate to the control of cortical excitability in relation to accumulation of sensory evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kloosterman et al., 2019</xref>) in line with the proposed role for alpha in regulation of inhibition: increase in alpha power (synchronization) reflects inhibition and decrease in alpha power (desynchronization) reflects release from inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Klimesch, 2012</xref>). Yet the precise role of alpha suppression in representation of <italic>value</italic> during EA is not clear. Here, we found a striking similarity between the time course of alpha-correlates of tastiness and healthiness and the representation of these attributes in the simulated neural signals predicted by the best-fitting parameters of the DDM, particularly the EA signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e, f</xref>). One possibility, then, is that tastier foods may typically result in exactly this kind of release from inhibition, potentiating approach-related responding, but that this process is disrupted during regulation.</p><p>In this respect, it is interesting to speculate on the meaning of differences we observed between the relationship of alpha suppression to the influences of tastiness and healthiness on behaviour. While the <italic>alpha-correlate of tastiness</italic> showed a strong presence in occipital and frontal areas and correlated independently in both regulatory conditions with individual differences in down-regulation of tastiness, the <italic>alpha-correlate of healthiness</italic> was comparatively less consistent: it showed a more limited presence in posterior regions and did not correlate with up-regulation of healthiness across subjects. It is possible that this is simply due to lack of power to detect significant findings. Alternatively, we speculate that the HEALTH condition may activate both down-regulation of tastiness and up-regulation of healthiness. In combination with the relative <italic>dominance</italic> of the tastiness attribute in behaviour, this joint set of effects could result in a weaker <italic>alpha-correlate of healthiness</italic> or more variable dynamics in EA that are not fully captured by our model. For example, recent work from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maier et al., 2020</xref> demonstrates complex effects of self-regulation on the dynamics of attention to healthiness and tastiness, which we have not incorporated in our model here. Future work will be required to tease apart these potential explanations. Overall, however, the close relationship between the DDM time course and alpha suppression indicates a quantifiable role for alpha suppression and its disruption during self-regulation.</p><p>Our results also indicated that alpha-correlates of tastiness and healthiness corresponded more closely with the predicted time course of EA, while ERP signals corresponded more closely to the predicted time course of attribute construction. Importantly, although alpha oscillations were sensitive to regulatory goal, ERP signals were not. This suggests that one function of alpha suppression may be to facilitate the translation of fronto-central attribute value signals into behavioural responses. When this alpha signal is disrupted, the influence of the frontal-central ERP on behaviour is likewise suppressed. Future work, perhaps focusing on inter-area neural synchrony and connectivity, might provide additional tests of this intriguing hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Functional significance of theta in self-regulation</title><p>Over the past several years, a consensus has emerged in the field that theta oscillations in the frontal cortex reflect cognitive control and integration of resources for cognitive control (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cavanagh and Frank, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mas-Herrero and Marco-Pallarés, 2016</xref>). Midfrontal theta, in particular, activates in response to any informative event or stimulus that conveys a need for behavioural adjustment or shift of attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cavanagh and Frank, 2014</xref>) and recruits regions underlying different cognitive operations to realize this need for control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mas-Herrero and Marco-Pallarés, 2016</xref>). Posterior theta oscillations, on the other hand, may instead reflect the encoding of new information by the hippocampus in several memory operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Axmacher et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Klimesch, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Scholz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Staudigl and Hanslmayr, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tesche and Karhu, 2000</xref>).</p><p>By contrast, evidence for the functional significance of the lateral frontal and posterior theta oscillations we observed in this task has not converged on a unified account. There is scattered evidence that early parietal and occipital theta oscillations correlate with value in high conflict choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hunt et al., 2012</xref>) and with cognitive load during mental calculation and multitasking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). On the other hand, frontal theta in value-based decisions also shows sensitivity to emotional stimuli and efficient sensory integration in different studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cavanagh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nayak et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tosun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zavala et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Our findings may help to shed light on these inconsistencies. Notably, the <italic>theta-correlate of tastiness</italic> in our study appeared in both regulation conditions, but not unregulated decisions, around the same time, with a shared occipital component, and a similar though not identical frontal component (although the rough spatial resolution of EEG prevents us from making strong conclusions about whether such differences imply distinct neural sources). In other words, we observed stronger theta-correlates on precisely those trials which might be hardest to regulate (i.e. trials with tastier foods). This suggests that the theta-correlate of tastiness may represent an inhibitory control mechanism that helps to gate the impact of the constructed attribute that was reflected by front-central ERPS and prevent it from integrating into the processes reflected by alpha at frontal and posterior sites. Future studies that are more specifically targeted towards examining the relationships between ERPs, theta, and alpha oscillations, and deploy simultaneous EEG-fMRI to obtain better localization of the source of these signals, will be needed to confirm this idea. Brain stimulation techniques could further investigate whether disruption of early theta power causes impairments in regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Processes reflected by the ERPs and oscillatory power</title><p>As mentioned above, a striking finding of our study pointed to an important difference between the oscillatory and ERP signatures of attribute value construction and EA. While previous perceptual decision-making studies have found that ERPs, in particular the P300 at centro-parietal electrodes, reflect the EA process predicted by DDM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">O'Connell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Twomey et al., 2015</xref>), our study found correlates of attribute values in ERPs with a more frontal distribution. These ERPs did not reflect the regulated integration of attributes to the EA process, instead coding for taste attribute values regardless of condition, consistent with prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Harris et al., 2013</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first report to suggest a differentiation in the computational functions reflected by ERP and oscillatory signals during value-based choice, although such distinctions have been previously reported in other cognitive processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hajihosseini and Holroyd, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Holroyd et al., 2012</xref>). Future work, perhaps in conjunction with fMRI, will be needed to confirm this distinction and to tie it to different neural mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Comparisons to previous work on value and regulation</title><p>Our findings contribute to a growing but still scant EEG literature on the neural representation of components of value in the EA process. While some studies have examined modulation of EEG during self-control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Harris et al., 2013</xref>), and other studies have examined oscillatory correlates of EA itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hunt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">van Vugt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Werkle-Bergner et al., 2014</xref>), ours is the first study to date to combine the two approaches. In this respect, it is informative to compare our results to previous work. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Harris et al., 2013</xref> reported an early attentional ERP component in occipital areas (N170) that was enhanced in successful self-control and later centro-parietal ERP components localized to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex that were sensitive to the overall value and tastiness and healthiness attributes. Similarly, in our study, we found two temporally distinct oscillatory signatures corresponding to valuation (alpha suppression around 600 ms post-stimulus) and regulation (theta enhancement around 200 ms post-stimulus). While a direct comparison of these two sets of findings is not possible due to differences in the study design and analysis, we speculate that the early EEG predictors of regulation observed in our study as well as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Harris et al., 2013</xref> might indicate a common oscillatory mechanism (occipital theta power) that controls the processing of attributes in the service of regulation. We also speculate that the later components of attribute value represented by alpha suppression in our study reflect the <italic>controlled</italic> integration of sensory evidence by areas involved in decision making and response selection.</p><p>Importantly, while we do observe neural signatures consistent with EA signals in our study, our results fail to replicate some previous reports in the literature finding a distinct gamma (46–64 Hz) signature of value-based EA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Polanía et al., 2014</xref>) at parietal and fronto-polar sites prior to response. Intriguingly, gamma phase coherence in this prior study revealed fronto-parietal connectivity during value-based decisions and not perceptual decisions. To test specifically whether we replicated this finding, we examined oscillatory power in the NATURAL condition averaged over all channels and specifically at Fz and Pz channels, but did not find an enhancement of gamma in relation to our pre-food 200 ms baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4a</xref>). To test whether this is due to higher variability in gamma phase in food-locked analysis, we also tested response-locked oscillatory power in relation to the pre-food baseline, but failed to find a significant increase in gamma power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4b</xref>).</p><p>We speculate that these discrepancies may be due to differences in the cognitive and memory demands presented by the different task paradigms. For example, our subjects make an accept/reject response to one food stimulus, whereas in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Polanía et al., 2014</xref>, they responded by choosing one of two food stimuli presented on the upper or lower side of the screen while a scrambled version of each image was displayed by their side (Figure 1A in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Polanía et al., 2014</xref>). This more complex paradigm might elicit higher frequency responses due to differences in visual and spatial processes. Alternatively, it is possible that the choice between two items vs. accepting or rejecting a single item, although behaviourally comparable in terms of the decision value, might require distinct working memory processes. Future work directly comparing different modes of choice (e.g. single-item vs. binary or multi-item choice) will be needed to resolve some of these questions.</p><p>In addition to gamma signals, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Polanía et al., 2014</xref> found that fronto-central low-beta (18–20 Hz) power was also negatively correlated with EA. Similarly, we also observed suppression of low-beta power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>), though to a lesser degree compared to alpha power. A full match to the single-trial value-based predictions of our DDM model regarding EA only occurred with alpha suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e, f</xref>) and did not match responses in the beta range. Notably, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Polanía et al., 2014</xref> did not examine frequencies below 15 Hz or look for the kind of trial-by-trial variation in value that we identify here, making a direct comparison of our results to theirs difficult.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taken together, our results highlight the potential for model-based analyses to lend new insight into the neural mechanisms underlying self-regulation in value-based decision making. Our findings corroborate previous accounts suggesting that alpha suppression tracks EA and further suggest that alpha suppression may represent an identifiable signature indicating the integration of value-based attributes into the EA process during both regulated and unregulated choices. By contrast, we found a representation of attribute values in ERPs that was not affected by regulation. Our study is also the first to our knowledge to find evidence that theta oscillations might play a role in inhibiting the influence of attribute values on EA, independent of regulation strategy. These findings point to the importance of understanding the distinct neural mechanism by which this inhibition occurs and may represent a target of future work to enhance the effectiveness of self-regulation in dietary choice.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>We recruited 66 participants from the University of Toronto Scarborough research participation system and flyers posted on campus.

Each of the 60 food stimuli appeared three times throughout the blocks in a single condition (i.e. 180 trials per condition) in order to avoid confounding memory or value effects across conditions. At the beginning of each block, one of three sets of instructions corresponding to each condition was presented on the screen for 5 s.</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p><bold>NATURAL: </bold>RESPOND NATURALLY; for the next set of trials, we would like you to RESPOND NATURALLY.

To minimize eye movements, the food stimulus was centred and filled only 20% of the screen.

Participants had 4 s to decide. Following response, a randomly jittered 1–2 s inter-trial interval appeared. To ensure that subjects followed the correct instruction throughout every block, we signalled the conditions with a colour code: NATURAL = green, DECREASE = yellow, and HEALTH = red. A coloured frame appeared around the written instructions at the beginning of each block and the fixation cross at the beginning of each trial appeared in the colour corresponding to the condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>Post-choice attribute rating task</title><p>In addition to providing a second set of liking ratings for foods after the regulation task, subjects also rated the food stimuli from the SRCT for tastiness and healthiness on a scale of 1–6 (<italic>very untasty</italic> to <italic>very tasty</italic> and <italic>very unhealthy</italic> to <italic>very healthy</italic>).

Data were then re-referenced to averaged channels in order to enable comparison with previous EEG studies of value-based decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Harris et al., 2013</xref>). We identified bad channels by visual inspection and replaced them by interpolation. To centre the data, average amplitude for each channel was subtracted from each data point on that channel. Data were then segmented from 1 s prior to the presentation of the food stimulus to 1.5 s after the presentation of the food stimuli. Average amplitude over a baseline window starting from 200 ms before the presentation of food stimulus was subtracted from all time points in the segment. Independent component analysis (ICA) was then performed on concatenated segments. Components associated with ocular and muscle artefacts or channel noise were identified based on their time and frequency information and removed.

We carried out the modelling in three stages. First, we performed basic estimation of model parameters using the HDDM package (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Second, we used the estimated parameter fits in our custom-written codes to simulate the time courses of three hypothesized neural signals during each trial: representation of the tastiness attribute construction process, representation of the healthiness attribute construction process, and representation of the EA process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a, b</xref>). Finally, we estimated the effects of subjects’ tastiness and healthiness ratings on these simulated signals using a series of regression analyses at each time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). We describe each of these steps in more detail below.</p><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Drift-diffusion model (DDM)</title><p>The DDM included six parameters per condition: three parameters related to drift rate (i.e. evidence/value formation) in each trial (weights on tastiness, <italic>w<sub>tastiness</sub></italic>, healthiness, <italic>w<sub>healthiness</sub></italic>, as well as a constant <italic>ValConst; total drift = w<sub>tastiness </sub>* tastiness + w<sub>healthiness </sub>* healthiness+ValConst</italic>), and three additional parameters: decision threshold (<italic>trs</italic>), starting point bias (<italic>spbias</italic>), and non-decision time (<italic>ndt</italic>) representing post-stimulus perceptual and pre-response motor processes. HDDM uses hierarchical Bayesian estimation to identify the best-fitting parameters simultaneously for individual subjects and on the group level, assuming individual subjects’ parameters are drawn from the group distribution. To estimate the joint posterior distribution of all parameters (individual and group parameters), we had HDDM sample 11000 iterations after an initial burn-in period of 1000 samples using Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. Best-fitting parameters were computed as the mean for that parameter averaged over the posterior distribution across all chains. We then used the HDDM posterior predictive check functions to inspect the posterior distribution of the parameters and the subject responses times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1e</xref>). We also found that the average simulated posterior predictive response times were significantly correlated with the observed response times across subjects and conditions (mean r = 0.46; t(49) = 17.1, p&lt;0.001). Both the posterior predictive checks and the correlation analyses thus confirmed that the model provided a good fit to the data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>Model-simulated neural signals</title><p>Following identification of best-fitting model parameters, we used the subject and condition-specific parameter values to simulate the expected time course of three signals on each trial: (1 and 2) the expected <italic>attribute construction signals</italic> related to tastiness and healthiness; and (3) the expected <italic>EA signal</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Each signal was computed from food onset to response time using individual subject parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). For signals related to attributes, the functions on each trial resembled a boxcar with onset immediately following termination of the perceptual part of the non-decision time (i.e. the estimated non-decision time parameter minus 80 ms to account for motor preparation time that occurs before response), offset immediately upon response, and a height equivalent to the attribute value on each trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>; blue and red lines). The EA signal, in contrast, accumulates gradually from just after termination of the perceptual non-decision time until the response, with an average slope equal to the integrated value of the choice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>; black lines). This approach thus allowed us to construct three simulated time courses: a predicted trial-by-trial time course for the neural representation of the tastiness attribute construction (taste-AC) signal, a predicted trial-by-trial time course for the neural representation of the healthiness attribute construction (health-AC) signal, and a predicted trial-by-trial time course for the integrated EA signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a, b</xref>). To produce a more stable prediction of the signals on each trial, we constructed 1000 simulated datasets for each subject and took the average across these simulations. We performed this averaging step over multiple simulations because each individual simulation is slightly different due to the random noise in attribute and EA signal formation. Thus, averaging together a large number of simulations produces more stable results. These simulated signals represent hypothetical time courses that are based on fundamental assumptions of the DDM and test to what extent these assumptions capture particular aspects of EEG dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-3"><title>Attribute contributions to model-simulated neural signals</title><p>Finally, we asked how these signals might appear in neural data when locked to onset of the food. For example, to determine the expected time course of a neural signal representing the tastiness attribute (i.e. taste-AC), within each condition (i.e. NATURAL, HEALTH, DECREASE), we computed a separate regression for each time point <italic>t</italic> = 0 to 2000, (i.e. from food onset to 2000 ms afterwards), using the average model-simulated trial-by-trial taste-AC signal at that time point as the dependent variable, and the subject’s trial-by-trial tastiness and healthiness ratings, as well as RT, as predictors. We included RT in the model to control for the possible shared variance between attribute ratings and RT in the attribute construction and EA signals, so that the model coefficients are only driven by strength of evidence and not their secondary effect on RT. We applied this same procedure to determine effects of tastiness, healthiness, and RT on the simulated healthiness signal as well as the simulated EA signal (Model 1).<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mtable columnalign="left left" columnspacing="1em" rowspacing="4pt"><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mspace width="1em"/><mml:mspace width="1em"/><mml:mspace width="1em"/><mml:mo>≅</mml:mo><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mspace width="1em"/><mml:mspace width="1em"/><mml:mspace width="1em"/><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>The resulting <italic>b(t)<sub>tastiness</sub></italic> and <italic>b(t)<sub>healthiness</sub></italic> coefficients at each time point represent when and to what extent we would expect to observe an association between (1) the tastiness ratings and a neural signal computing tastiness, (2) healthiness ratings and a neural signal computing healthiness, and (3) tastiness and healthiness ratings and a neural signal performing a process of weighted EA, over and above the association of these ratings with RT and with each other.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Michael Frank as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: James Cavanagh (Reviewer #1); Peter R Murphy (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers and reviewing editor have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Both reviewers expressed enthusiasm for the overarching rationale of this paper and agree that it addresses an important topic that would be of considerable interest to the <italic>eLife</italic> readership. However, as you will see, the two reviewers also identified a number of very substantial issues relating to the general clarity of the manuscript and the informativeness of the analysis approach which may limit the extent to which firm conclusions can really be drawn regarding the mechanisms underlying value-based decision-making. Below you will see that the reviewers have suggested a considerable number of revisions that we would deem necessary before the paper could be considered for publication. If you are willing to complete these revisions, and/or provide a detailed rebuttal where relevant, the paper will be subjected to a further detailed second-round review. As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that substantial revisions are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This work by HajiHosseini and Hutcherson investigates the self-regulation of choices about whether to accept or reject different varieties of food. Participants made choices either according to their natural preference, with an emphasis on healthiness, or by intentionally decreasing their desire for food. Choice behaviour across these three contexts was modelled via the drift diffusion model, and decision-relevant signals from the model were correlated with frequency-specific signals in scalp EEG data. The main findings are that suppression of alpha-band power during decision formation was correlated with tastiness and healthiness of food items in contexts where these attributes were most relevant to the choice, which is partially consistent with model-predicted evidence accumulation signals; and, post-stimulus theta power selectively encoded food tastiness in contexts where the influence of this attribute on choice was suppressed</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1. Manuscript Clarity and Missing Details</p><p>(A) There are major issues with clarity throughout the report. This is primarily due to a lack of description of how the multiple stages of modeling were performed, but there are stylistic deficits as well.</p><p>(B) Lines 82-85: This should be a section of stating competing hypotheses, but it is hard to understand how these ideas – as described here – differ from each other and how they could be tested. This is a missed opportunity for providing additional clarity.</p><p>(C) The lack of display for things like RT and choice per condition, as well as DDM parameters is another missed opportunity for enhanced clarity (1/2 of pg. 10, most of pg. 11). Figure 2c is particularly frustrating to not know the average RT for each condition. There is currently little information provided by which to judge the quality of the model fits. All that is provided is in Figure S1 – but how the figure should be interpreted is unclear, and from what I can tell it provides no indication as to how well the model fits RT distributions (as opposed to just mean RT and choice percentages).</p><p>(D) On line 263, it details how the parameter was the mean of the posterior distribution, but it isn't clear if this individual level distribution is in any way constrained by the group level distribution, which would help protect against over-fitting.</p><p>(E) The fitted parameters need to be reported (and ideally, plotted). Of particular importance, currently there is no indication of the signs or magnitudes of the fitted weights given to the tastiness and healthiness attributes, only analyses of differences in weights.</p><p>(F) I would welcome a better explanation of how the weights given to different attributes are i) applied to the subject-specific food ratings, and ii) combined to yield a single drift rate for a given stimulus.</p><p>(G) It is not clear at all how the DDM params, taste and health params, and EEG are all fit together. Figure 2 caption details how these attribute estimates are &quot;based on DDM structure&quot;, but it isn't clear how these boxcars are integrated into the EA signal, or how they are fit together to yield the curves in Figure 2c. The authors note that there were 1000 simulated datasets, but what varied between them?</p><p>(H) The cross correlations between parameters should be detailed at every level of the model. Co-linearity would be a major issue to avoid, and it seems inevitable in some cases like comparing attribute regressions to EA regressions (where EA is based on some combination of attributes). Without resolution of this issue, Figure panels 3d-e are not interpretable.</p><p>2. Analysis Approach</p><p>(A) The authors' chosen approach to identify decision signals in the EEG data is indirect and in my opinion of limited value. The issue here is using a correlation of model-estimated (Figure 2c) and observed (Figure 3a,b) signal trajectories to make inferences about the possible functional characteristics of the neural signals in question: When the model-estimated trajectories for both 'decision evidence' and 'evidence accumulation' (EA) signals are themselves highly similar, then they will necessarily yield highly similar correlations with any neural signal (in the case of the alpha suppression signal, both |r|&gt;0.9) and provide very limited insight about what the neural signal might reflect. A more fruitful approach would surely be to exploit the fundamental differences that are predicted of evidence and EA signals: in particular the fact that, in the model at least, the former are expected to be essentially static during decision formation while the latter are expected to exhibit several dynamical properties (in build-up rate scaling with evidence strength, peak latency tracking response time, and stereotyped amplitude at response) that clearly demarcate the two types of signal. Identifying the latter properties in the alpha suppression signal would therefore provide far more compelling support for the proposal that this signal reflects evidence accumulation.</p><p>(B) Interpretation of alpha suppression effects. The above point is also relevant when considered in light of existing knowledge about alpha suppression during decision formation. Many studies have reported alpha suppression in the post-stimulus, pre-response period of decision-making tasks, though this response is rarely directly identified with the evidence accumulation process itself; rather, alpha suppression, at least over posterior scalp, tends to be identified with a kind of gating or release from inhibition process (including in papers cited by the authors). If such a process is in some sense sensitive to RT (which has been observed with alpha suppression), then it would perhaps not be surprising if it showed the characteristics observed for alpha suppression presently in Figure 3a,b (assuming RT correlates especially strongly with tastiness in the NATURAL condition and healthiness in the HEALTH condition, both of which are I believe supported by the behavioural modelling). In short, I think the meaning of the alpha suppression findings is currently unclear.</p><p>(C) In both Figures 3 and 4, the topographic distributions of the reported effects are by and large quite different between the different experimental conditions. This casts doubt on the notion that the reported signals reflect the same neural processes subject to contextual modulations, and raises further questions as to how the different results should be interpreted.</p><p>(D) Modelling. Was the 6-parameter model tested against any other model parameterizations? This can be critical for not over-fitting the data with params that aren't beneficial (e.g. starting point bias), This issue dovetails with the lack of clarity concerns noted above: starting point tends to soak up variance due to asymmetrical thresholds, suggesting both thresholds are enhanced during choice, but the RT distributions aren't shown so this remains unknown. It would be great to see these distributions so the difference between attribute vs. neutral distributions could be visually assessed for skew vs. kurtotic changes. Overall there are quite many free parameters (18) being fit to a relatively low number of trials (540; 180 per condition) per subject, and the model fits may suffer from overfitting. I would encourage the authors to fit more constrained models and identified the most parsimonious fit via model comparison.</p><p>(E) What is the purpose of the DECREASE condition? The instructions for this condition struck me as being very much open to interpretation, and indeed it seems to have led to some counterintuitive results (an increase in the weight given to healthiness in this condition, and generally increased decision bounds). Generally, if the instruction is to 'decrease my desire for food', why don't I just refuse every food item I am presented with?</p><p>Minor Revisions:</p><p>(A) It is surprising that the introduction doesn't include O'Connell's work on P3b slope and drift rate (line 95) (e.g. The classic P300 encodes a build‐to‐threshold decision variable, EJN). With the estimated value attributions peaking around 542 ms, this seems like it might relate to the slope to the P3b. Of course, this is all conjecture since neither the RTs nor the ERPs are shown, but I suggest that the authors utilize the similar correlation strategy with the raw EEG to see if it corresponds with known ERP component activities that have previously been linked to these same DDM constructs.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60874.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1.

Unfortunately, fMRI studies (Hare et al., 2009; Hutcherson et al., 2012) cannot dissociate the neural representations of attributes and evidence accumulation with the necessary temporal resolution for testing these distinct processes”.</p><p>We have also added a summary of how our results partially provide evidence for these hypotheses in lines 120-125.</p><p>“Our results suggested that the time course of ERPs correlated more strongly with model-based predictions for attribute representations, while suppression of alpha oscillatory activity correlated better with model-based predictions for evidence accumulation signals.

After fitting and verifying with posterior predictive checks that these parameters provided a reasonable fit to the data (Figure 2—figure supplement 1e), we used the individual fitted parameters to create the 3 predicted time courses, for each subject, for each trial. These time courses represented simulated tastiness and healthiness attribute construction (AC) signals, as well as simulated evidence accumulation (EA) signals. We used the attribute weights and intercepts (combined with subject-specific health and taste ratings) to create the simulated drifts on each trial, using non-decision time and threshold to simulate the onset and offset of the evidence accumulation process, and starting point bias to simulate its starting value (lines 698-713; Figure 2b). We used 1000 simulations of each trial, with random Gaussian noise added to the attribute signals at each time point and carried forward into the accumulation signal (line 713-719). We then took the average of these simulations over all 1000 simulations to construct a single predicted time-course on each trial, for each subject. Then we conducted regressions with the average trial-by-trial simulated attribute construction or evidence accumulation signal at each time point as the dependent variable, and healthiness, tastiness, and RT on each trial as predictors, in order to find the predicted contribution of these attributes to the simulations of taste and health attribute constructions (AC) and evidence accumulation (EA) signals (Figure 2c; lines 721-742).

We have taken a number of approaches to address it.</p><p>First, the reviewer is correct that the correlation between the representation of tastiness/healthiness in the attribute construction time-courses and evidence accumulation time courses is quite high (Pearson’s r ranging from.88 to.96 across all conditions). To address this issue, we used a method described in Lenhard and Lenhard (2014) for comparing the strength of correlation between related/dependent measures to determine whether the attribute construction or EA signals showed a higher correspondence to the observed EEG time course of the ERP and alpha-correlates of tastiness and healthiness (lines 224-227, 274-279, and 321-324; Figure 3b, and 4e,f).</p><p>In addition, based on other suggestions in this review, we sought to control for other correlated variables such as RT. Following their advice, we assessed the correlation between RT and tastiness and healthiness ratings using <italic>RT ~ b0 + b<sub>tastiness</sub>*tastiness + b<sub>healthiness</sub>*healthiness</italic> which confirmed their prediction that RT and tastiness are indeed moderately correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Contribution of tastiness (left) and healthiness (right) to RT in all conditions.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-60874-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>To control for this shared variance, we have revised our Model 1 and Model 2 to include RT as a predictor, so that the tastiness and healthiness contributions to the simulated signals and EEG are calculated over and above their effect on RT and on each other (line 728-734 and 756-765).</p><p>Importantly, controlling for RT actually strengthened our conclusions, showing that after accounting for collinearity, the correlation between model and attribute construction time courses in ERP data |r<sub>erp-AC</sub>| is significantly larger than the correlation with the evidence accumulation time course |r<sub>erp-EA</sub>| (Figure 3b). In contrast, the correlation between alpha power and the model-predicted time course of evidence accumulation |r<sub>alpha-EA</sub>| is significantly larger than the correlation with the predicted time course of attribute construction signals |r<sub>alpha-AC</sub>| (Figure 4e-f).</p><p>Finally, in supplementary analyses described below (see response to Essential revisions #2A, point 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>), we examined the match between the rate of change/derivative of tastiness representations in alpha power and the rate of change/derivative of the tastiness representations in the simulated AC/EA signals, since the time course of the derivatives for attribute and evidence accumulation time-courses are less correlated than the main signal. Although this analysis showed a reduced correlation between the tastiness correlates of alpha slope and simulated signals (|Pearson’s r| ranging from.41 –.71) compared to our original analysis (which we think is likely due to noise), it confirms a significantly stronger relationship between the time course of trial-by-trial alpha power and the EA signal than with the attribute construction signal. In combination, we hope that these analyses show that our findings are robust across different ways of analyzing the data, and all confirm the idea that the correlates of alpha power that we observe more closely match the expected EA signal.</p><fig id="sa2fig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>a) time course of contribution of tastiness to alpha slope of change (red line) plotted against time course of contribution of tastiness to slope of simulated tastiness attribute construction (AC, dashed black line) and slope of simulated evidence accumulation (EA, dotted black line) signals, b) time course of contribution of healthiness to alpha slope of change (blue line) plotted against time course of contribution of healthiness to slope of simulated healthiness attribute construction (AC, dashed black line) and slope of simulated evidence accumulation (EA, dotted black line) signal; Shaded error bars show within-subject standard error of the mean.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-60874-resp-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Analysis Approach</p><p>(A) The authors' chosen approach to identify decision signals in the EEG data is indirect and in my opinion of limited value. The issue here is using a correlation of model-estimated (Figure 2c) and observed (Figure 3a,b) signal trajectories to make inferences about the possible functional characteristics of the neural signals in question: When the model-estimated trajectories for both 'decision evidence' and 'evidence accumulation' (EA) signals are themselves highly similar, then they will necessarily yield highly similar correlations with any neural signal (in the case of the alpha suppression signal, both |r|&gt;0.9) and provide very limited insight about what the neural signal might reflect. A more fruitful approach would surely be to exploit the fundamental differences that are predicted of evidence and EA signals: in particular the fact that, in the model at least, the former are expected to be essentially static during decision formation while the latter are expected to exhibit several dynamical properties (in build-up rate scaling with evidence strength, peak latency tracking response time, and stereotyped amplitude at response) that clearly demarcate the two types of signal. Identifying the latter properties in the alpha suppression signal would therefore provide far more compelling support for the proposal that this signal reflects evidence accumulation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and suggestions.</p><p>1) We agree with the reviewer that isolating the effects of attributes on attribute construction and evidence accumulation signals based on the correlation of time courses faces challenges. However, it is important to note that our aim in this study was to highlight the strengths of model-based analysis of EEG oscillations. Therefore, we designed our analysis steps based on model predictions of the time course dynamics (simulated signals) as opposed to selection of a priori time windows and channels to test for specific decision parameters. The hypothesis-driven parts of our analyses were the fundamental assumptions of DDM about the integration of attribute values with the evidence accumulation process (the boxcars and EA signals in Figure 2b). This is the reason why we employed the joint significance criterion (lines 783-791) that assures the latency of maximum contribution of attributes to ERP and alpha (the peak and trough of the waveform in Figures 3a and 4a,b respectively) occurs +/- 100 ms around the peak latency contribution of attributes to the simulated AC and EA signals (Figure 2c) at channels where we found the ERP-correlate of tastiness and alpha-correlates of tastiness and healthiness. In fact, our revised analysis shows that based on these criteria, alpha power correlates of tastiness and healthiness are significantly closer to the model predictions of the taste-EA signal compared to model predictions of the taste-AC signal (z = 4.09, p&lt;.001) and health-AC signal respectively (z = 4.17, p&lt;.001; lines 274-276 and 321-324; Figure 4e,f), whereas ERP data are significantly closer to the model predictions of the taste-AC signal compared to the taste-EA signal (z = 2.55, p=.005; lines 224-227; Figure 3b).</p><p>2) In addition, we followed the reviewer’s advice and investigated the relationship between attributes and the slope/build-up rate of change in alpha power by applying Model 2 to the derivative of alpha power at each time point. To parallel our original simulation, we did this by simulating the derivative/instantaneous slope of contributions of attributes to tastiness and healthiness attribute construction and EA signals and compared the model simulation against data (derivative of power) at channels that we identified as encoding alpha correlates of tastiness and healthiness (marked channels in Figure 4 c, top-row). We found that time courses of attribute contribution to alpha power derivative/slope are also correlated with their model counterparts although this analysis is, perhaps not surprisingly, slightly noisier, resulting in slightly lower correlations. Nevertheless, these analyses also show a striking correspondence between the model-predicted time course of evidence accumulation and the observed signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>). In addition, this correlation is significantly stronger for the evidence accumulation compared to the attribute construction signal for tastiness (|r<sub>taste(alpha-EA)</sub>|&gt;|r<sub>taste(alpha-AC)</sub> |; z = 1.82, p=.03), although it fails to reach significance for healthiness (p&gt;.05).</p><p>3) Based on the reviewer’s advice, we also studied whether the peak latency of alpha suppression, averaged across trials in the NATURAL condition, in channels where we found the alpha-correlate of tastiness tracks RT in trials with slow, medium, and fast response times. We found that alpha power in fast trials reached its trough earlier than the slower trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4A</xref>) bearing resemblance to the previous findings that argued P300 carried an evidence accumulation signal (O’Connell, Dockree, and Kelly, 2012; Twomey, Murphy, Kelly, and O’Connell, 2015). As the signal of our interest was in fact contribution of attribute rating to alpha power (like b<sub>tastiness</sub>) in these channels, we followed up by running Model 2 on slow and fast trials separately, which we think is a cleaner and more rigorous test of our hypotheses than simply averaging signal over all trials; Note that we used only 2 response speed bins to avoid inadequate number of observations in the regression model. The results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4A</xref>, B) showed that our alpha-correlate of tastiness indeed scaled with RT, lasting longer for slow trials compared to fast trials (all conditions split by fast and slow RTs are shown in Figure 4—figure supplements 1). By contrast, the same analysis on the ERP-correlate of tastiness did not show such relationship with response time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4C</xref>, D). These results lend extra support to our interpretation that the alpha-correlate of tastiness represents evidence accumulation whereas the ERP-correlate of tastiness represents a choice-insensitive attribute construction process.</p><fig id="sa2fig4"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Alpha-correlates of tastiness and healthiness in NATURAL condition for fast (a) and slow (b) trials; ERP-correlates of tastiness and healthiness for fast (c) and slow (d) trials.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-60874-resp-fig4-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Although we think that the taste-correlation by RT analyses are more sensitive, we also performed the exact test requested by the reviewer and studied whether averaged alpha power in the same channels reached a stereotyped amplitude prior to response across slow and fast trials. We found that alpha power started to build up between 400 to 200 ms before the response, and reached a peak at roughly 200-300ms before the response. However it did not reach a clearly unique bound across slow and fast trials (Figure 4—figure supplement 2B). These results suggest that the signal we observe is likely not the final evidence accumulation leading directly to the motor response (which we suspect resides in motor circuits), but rather an intermediate stage of evidence accumulation displaying some but not all functional properties of the modelled DDM signal.</p><p>Interestingly, when we ran our Model 2 on response-locked alpha power separately for fast and slow trials, we found the predicted sensitivity to tastiness right before the response was present for both trial types (Figure 4—figure supplement 3E, F). However, we also found that in slow trials, the alpha sensitivity to tastiness followed an elongated pattern, and further showed some more significant sensitivity to healthiness (Figure 4—figure supplement 3F). In health-sensitive channels on slow trials, in contrast, alpha sensitivity to healthiness is weaker and farther from the response time (Figure 4—figure supplement 3G, H). We suspect these results might indicate arbitration or oscillation between attention to attributes that is not explicitly modeled in the standard drift diffusion model we employ here, but that has been shown to be potentially important in other work from our own labs and others (e.g., Maier, Raja Beharelle, Polanía, Ruff, and Hare, 2020; Sullivan, Hutcherson, Harris, and Rangel, 2015). This oscillation in attention likely creates more variability in the neural signal across trials, perhaps contributing to the pattern we see in Figure 4—figure supplement 3F, H. We are currently working on developing more sophisticated models of attribute sampling based on these ideas, and hope to use the current data to test those ideas. However, we think they are beyond the scope of the current paper, and so have chosen to continue using the more canonical DDM to model our results.</p><p>Taking stock of these results together, we think that they suggest that our alpha-correlate of tastiness represents accumulation of evidence but perhaps at an intermediate level before the final motor response. Therefore it is affected by the variability and distribution of response times and regulation across trials, but does not show the full pattern of expected responses if it is the final stage of evidence accumulation for response selection. We have thus now added some of these speculations in the Results (lines 290-315) and Discussion (lines 388-405) sections of the revised manuscript.</p><p>In the Results section, we write:</p><p>“Next, we conducted a further test of the idea that the alpha-correlate of tastiness relates to evidence accumulation, by examining response-locked data in fast and slow decisions. […] Such architecture would be consistent with observations from other work finding evidence for multiple evidence accumulation mechanisms working at different stages to determine the final choice (e.g., Steinemann, O’Connell, and Kelly, 2018).”</p><p>And in the Discussion section, we now write:</p><p>“A main question concerns the processes that the alpha signal might represent in this context. […] Further research, perhaps using combined EEG-fMRI, might help to resolve these important questions.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(B) Interpretation of alpha suppression effects. The above point is also relevant when considered in light of existing knowledge about alpha suppression during decision formation. Many studies have reported alpha suppression in the post-stimulus, pre-response period of decision-making tasks, though this response is rarely directly identified with the evidence accumulation process itself; rather, alpha suppression, at least over posterior scalp, tends to be identified with a kind of gating or release from inhibition process (including in papers cited by the authors). If such a process is in some sense sensitive to RT (which has been observed with alpha suppression), then it would perhaps not be surprising if it showed the characteristics observed for alpha suppression presently in Figure 3a,b (assuming RT correlates especially strongly with tastiness in the NATURAL condition and healthiness in the HEALTH condition, both of which are I believe supported by the behavioural modelling). In short, I think the meaning of the alpha suppression findings is currently unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer’s point, we tested the correlation between RT and tastiness and healthiness in different conditions and revised our regression models to control for this shared variance across attribute ratings and RT (see response to Essential revisions #1H). Including RT in Model 1 and Model 2 ensures that our results on the contribution of attribute values to oscillatory power and simulated time courses are not driven by RT. Notably, we continue to find effects of tastiness and healthiness that correlated with model-predicted time courses (Figure 4e,f), independent of and controlling for RT. We thus think that this is unlikely to explain our effects.</p><p>In addition to the effect of regulation, in the revised manuscript, we also tested the alpha-correlate of tastiness for slower and faster responses and found that this correlate was scaling with RT so that it lasted longer in slow trials compared to fast trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4A</xref>, B). We believe that these findings together provide more clarification and support to our interpretation of the alpha-correlate of tastiness.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(C) In both Figures 3 and 4, the topographic distributions of the reported effects are by and large quite different between the different experimental conditions. This casts doubt on the notion that the reported signals reflect the same neural processes subject to contextual modulations, and raises further questions as to how the different results should be interpreted.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the distribution of these effects is not fully consistent across the different conditions and attributes. This issue pertains both to the alpha and theta oscillations.</p><p>For alpha signals, we now acknowledge this issue in the discussion, lines 393-395 and 432-436. Other than possible lack of statistical power, we consider some possibilities for this lack of consistency. In Figure 4c (Figure 3 in the original manuscript), we present the correlates of tastiness and healthiness in the NATURAL and HEALTH conditions respectively. It is possible that the representations of tastiness and healthiness are actually different; tastiness is perhaps perceived through available food features whereas healthiness might be inferred according to features and a priori knowledge. This could lead to differences in the neural encoding of these attributes, or their representation in evidence accumulation signals. In fact, our revised interpretation of the alpha-correlates of tastiness and healthiness is that they likely present an intermediate stage of integration of attribute representations to the evidence accumulation signal and therefore might be driven by distinct sources (see lines 290-315 in the Results section and lines 388-405 in the Discussion section for details on how we describe this in the manuscript).</p><p>For theta signals, the evidence is a bit less clear as we acknowledge in lines 465-466 of Discussion. In Figure 5b (Figure 4 in the original manuscript), we present the theta- correlate of tastiness that is associated with suppression of tastiness in HEALTH and DECREASE conditions. While there is some overlap in the sensors that code for tastiness in the two conditions, there are also distinct topographies. We think these differences may be due to the distinct cognitive processes occurring in the two conditions, which might result in recruitment of both overlapping and distinct regulatory mechanisms. For example, suppression of tastiness by theta might be a more general process in DECREASE as subjects are instructed to decrease their desire for food independent of its tastiness and healthiness, while in the HEALTH condition, this suppression might be a by-product of focusing on healthiness. In sum, we think that the difference in distributions of alpha-tastiness and healthiness correlates and theta-tastiness correlate across the two regulation conditions may be driven by real neural differences. We have acknowledged this more thoroughly in the Discussion section on lines 437-446 and 472-484, and point to the need for further work (in particular, the added value of simultaneous EEG-fMRI versions of this paradigm) for resolving these issues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(D) Modelling. Was the 6-parameter model tested against any other model parameterizations? This can be critical for not over-fitting the data with params that aren't beneficial (e.g. starting point bias), This issue dovetails with the lack of clarity concerns noted above: starting point tends to soak up variance due to asymmetrical thresholds, suggesting both thresholds are enhanced during choice, but the RT distributions aren't shown so this remains unknown. It would be great to see these distributions so the difference between attribute vs. neutral distributions could be visually assessed for skew vs. kurtotic changes. Overall there are quite many free parameters (18) being fit to a relatively low number of trials (540; 180 per condition) per subject, and the model fits may suffer from overfitting. I would encourage the authors to fit more constrained models and identified the most parsimonious fit via model comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this concern. We have now included the RT distribution in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 (see response to Essential revisions #1C). Regarding the number of parameters, we included the 3 regression parameters (w<sub>tastiness</sub>, w<sub>healthiness</sub>, ValConst) as they were essential to explore our question of interest (i.e. changes in value as a function of regulation). Threshold and non-decision time were also essential to form the DDM model traces. Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we also fitted a different model that included the 5 parameters mentioned above but excluded the starting point bias parameter. The average DIC across the three conditions was 14878 for the 5-parameter model and 14520 for the 6-Parameter model indicating the better fit of the 6-parameter model. We have not reported this comparison in the manuscript in order not to interrupt the flow but we can alternatively include it in the supplementary material if reviewers find it necessary. Also, note that in HDDM, it is not possible to fit a model <italic>without</italic> a value constant. However, in the previous version of our paper, using custom-written scripts, we also found that models that did not include a constant performed considerably worse. Thus, we believe the model we present is the minimum model required to fully account for the data.</p><p>We also note that the number of parameters we use to fit each condition is consistent with other published work in value-based decision making, but with an even larger number of trials. For example, we refer the reviewer to previous research from our own lab e.g., Hutcherson, Bushong, and Rangel (2015-<italic>Neuron</italic>), Tusche and Hutcherson (2018- <italic>eLife</italic>), as well as others e.g., Maier et al. (2020- <italic>Nature Human Behaviour</italic>) where models with a similar number of parameters have been used with similar task designs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(E) What is the purpose of the DECREASE condition? The instructions for this condition struck me as being very much open to interpretation, and indeed it seems to have led to some counterintuitive results (an increase in the weight given to healthiness in this condition, and generally increased decision bounds). Generally, if the instruction is to 'decrease my desire for food', why don't I just refuse every food item I am presented with?</p></disp-quote><p>The reason for including this condition is two-fold. First, we followed up on previous studies which have used this more general approach to regulating food craving (e.g., Kober et al., 2010; Hutcherson et al., 2012). Second, an appealing aspect of this condition is that it decreases the tastiness weight without necessarily changing the healthiness weight. Thus, it provides a useful comparison to the HEALTH focused condition, because it reduces the taste weight using an alternative strategy, while having comparatively smaller impact on the healthiness weight. We have made the logic for the inclusion of this condition clearer in the introduction (lines 105-111). Note also that participants clearly did <italic>not</italic> simply refuse all foods in this condition, which we believe likely results from our instruction to participants to always indicate their true preference after regulating, even if that was inconsistent with the instruction, and with the fact that this was an incentivized task in which, if the participant said no to everything, they would go hungry during the 30-minute waiting period after completion of the study. This instruction, combined with the behavioural results and model fits (which indicate a good fit to behaviour in this condition) suggest that our participants were indeed continuing to evaluate foods in this condition, and were partially successful in decreasing their desire for foods. They did this largely by reducing the effect of tastiness on their choices while not increasing the effect of healthiness as strongly. Note also that the small increase in healthiness weight is actually not wholly counterintuitive: a large portion of the food stimuli used in this study were unhealthy foods, so increasing the health weight might naturally reduce the overall value of most of these foods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Revisions:</p><p>(A) It is surprising that the introduction doesn't include O'Connell's work on P3b slope and drift rate (line 95) (e.g. The classic P300 encodes a build‐to‐threshold decision variable, EJN). With the estimated value attributions peaking around 542 ms, this seems like it might relate to the slope to the P3b. Of course, this is all conjecture since neither the RTs nor the ERPs are shown, but I suggest that the authors utilize the similar correlation strategy with the raw EEG to see if it corresponds with known ERP component activities that have previously been linked to these same DDM constructs.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this neglect. We have now included the reference. In the previous version of the manuscript, we had mainly focused on the oscillations as there was less clarity in the literature about their role in attribute value construction and evidence accumulation. Following the reviewer’s comment, we tested stimulus-locked ERPs in correlation with our models. While we did not find a correlate of healthiness that meets our significance criterion, we found frontal and central (CPz, FC1) and parietal (P7, P9, P10) channels where contribution of tastiness to ERPs was continuously significant ~400-700 ms post food stimulus and the time course of the simulated contribution of tastiness to tastiness signal was correlated (&gt;.85) with the ERPs (Figure 3). We found that strikingly, this ERP-correlate of tastiness matched closely with the tastiness attribute signal as opposed to the EA signal (z = 2.55, p = .005; Figure 3b). This finding was very valuable in relation to our research question as it provides complementary evidence on the existence of distinct neural signatures of attribute value construction and EA in the EEG signal. Therefore we decided to re-organize the manuscript in order to report these findings. We want to thank the reviewer for this suggestion, since we think it has made the manuscript considerably more interesting and informative.</p><p><bold>References</bold>:</p><p>Hutcherson, C., Plassmann, H., Gross, J.
