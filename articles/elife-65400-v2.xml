medicine, but the mechanisms underlying their effects remain ill-defined. Though routine anesthesia is safe in healthy individuals, instances of sensitivity are well documented, and there has been significant concern regarding the impact of VAs on neonatal brain development. Evidence indicates that VAs have multiple targets, with anesthetic and non-anesthetic effects mediated by neuroreceptors, ion channels, and the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Here, we characterize an unexpected metabolic effect of VAs in neonatal mice. Neonatal blood β-hydroxybutarate (β-HB) is rapidly depleted by VAs at concentrations well below those necessary for anesthesia. β-HB in adults, including animals in dietary ketosis, is unaffected. Depletion of β-HB is mediated by citrate accumulation, malonyl-CoA production by acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and inhibition of fatty acid oxidation. Adults show similar significant changes to citrate and malonyl-CoA, but are insensitive to malonyl-CoA, displaying reduced metabolic flexibility compared to younger animals.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>anesthesia</kwd><kwd>fatty acid oxidation</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>neonate</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>ketogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM133865</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sedensky</surname><given-names>Margaret M</given-names></name><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>Simon C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM118514</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morgan</surname><given-names>Philip G</given-names></name><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>Simon C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00GM126147</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>Simon C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100003138</institution-id><institution>Mitochondrial Research Guild</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>Simon C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Volatile anesthetics impair hepatic tricarboxylic acid cycle function in adult and neonatal mice, with citrate accumulation driving a neonate-specific inhibition of beta-oxidation and ketosis through their increased relative sensitivity to malonyl-CoA.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Volatile anesthetic agents (VAs) have been routinely used for general anesthesia for over 150 years; their development represented a major advance in human medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Whalen et al., 2005</xref>). Despite their prevalence, the precise targets of VAs, and mechanisms underlying their pleiotropic effects, are largely undefined. While most intravenous anesthetics appear to work through one or a small number of functional targets, such as neuroreceptors, VAs have been shown to interact with and impact a wide range of molecules and physiologic functions. Competing hypotheses currently exist to explain the precise anesthetic mechanisms of VAs, but general disruption of membrane bound proteins, either selectively or en masse, is a common feature among favored models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Weinrich and Worcester, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Herold et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sidebotham and Schug, 1997</xref>).</p><p>In addition to their desired neurologic effects (e.g. analgesia, paralysis, amnesia, and sedation), VAs have a range of both beneficial and detrimental off-target effects in various organ systems, including immune modulation, tumor enhancement, and cardioprotection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stollings et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sekandarzad et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lorsomradee et al., 2008</xref>). As in the case of anesthesia, the mechanisms underlying VA effects in non-neuronal tissues are enigmatic more often than not. Defining the mechanisms of VA action in a given setting is complicated by the diverse physiologic and molecular effects of VAs – it has been remarkably difficult to isolate and define individual mechanistic pathways involved in the effects of VAs. Experimental approaches to studying VAs are hampered by their weak interactions with targets and the limitations of volatile (gaseous), poorly water soluble, agents, which together preclude many of the tools used to study intravenous anesthetic agents.</p><p>Routine anesthesia with VAs is considered to be safe in healthy individuals, but anesthetic sensitivity and toxicity have been demonstrated in certain clinical populations defined by either age or genetic makeup. In many cases, the precise underpinnings of hypersensitivity remain poorly understood. Known sensitive populations include those with genetic defects in mitochondrial electron transport chain complex I (ETC CI), which lead to profound hypersensitivity to VAs, or individuals with mutations in the ryanodine receptor RYR1, who can experience malignant hyperthermia upon exposure to VAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Niezgoda and Morgan, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rosenberg et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, in recent years, there has been a recognition that neonatal mammals, and developing invertebrate animals, are sensitive to CNS damage as a result of extended or repeat exposure to VAs; this concept of potential anesthetic induced neurotoxicity represented a paradigm shift in pediatric anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Johnson et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Na et al., 2017</xref>). While the clinical relevance of paradigms used to study these phenomena are an area of active debate, and many distinct mechanisms have been proposed to mediate these toxic effects of VAs, it is clear that VA exposure can induce CNS injury under certain conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Johnson et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McCann and Soriano, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johnson et al., 2019b</xref>). Mechanistic studies defining the differential effects of VAs on neonates versus older animals have not been available.</p><p>Here, we identify a surprising and previously undocumented metabolic effect of VAs specific to neonatal animal. Our data reveal both the mechanism of this effect and the nature of the difference between the neonatal and adolescent mice in response to VA exposure.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Metabolic status of neonatal mice is rapidly disrupted by volatile anesthesia exposure</title><p>Neonatal mice (post-natal day 7, P7) are in a ketotic state compared to adolescent (post-natal day 30, PD30) or young adult (P60) animals, as has been previously reported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johnson et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bougneres et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cotter et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Williamson, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Edmond et al., 1985</xref>).

To further investigate this phenomenon, we assessed β-HB levels as a function of exposure time in P7 mice (see Materials and methods). Exposure to isoflurane resulted in an extremely rapid reduction in circulating β-HB, with an effect half-life of less than 12 min and a significant reduction compared to baseline by 7.5 min of exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). After reaching a valley of ~1 mM by 30 min of exposure, β-HB remained low to 2 hr. Littermate neonates removed from their parents and placed in control conditions (conditions matching anesthesia exposed, but in ambient air, see Materials and methods) show a slight decrease in β-HB at 30 min followed by a time-dependent increase in blood β-HB up to 2 hr. Pairwise comparisons of isoflurane- and control-exposed animals demonstrates highly significant reductions in β-HB in the isoflurane-exposed group at each timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). 1.5% isoflurane also led to a significant increase in lactate by 60 min (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; see also ETC CI).</p><p>While isoflurane rapidly depleted circulating ketones in neonates, isoflurane anesthesia had no impact on this circulating ketone in older (P30) animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>).

Following an initial increase in glucose in the 1.5% isoflurane-exposed pups, blood glucose falls more rapidly in isoflurane-exposed animals than in controls; both groups are significantly lower than baseline by 60 min and continue to fall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Blood glucose levels are lower in the isoflurane group than fasted (control treated) pups at 60 and 120 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), falling to ~35 mg/dL by 2 hr of isoflurane exposure, substantially below the ~100 mg/dL observed in controls. In contrast to neonates, isoflurane anesthesia has no impact on circulating glucose levels in 30 day old animals exposed for up to 2 hr; glucose is also maintained over this time in control-exposed animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I–J</xref>).</p><p>We considered the possibility that VA-induced changes to circulating metabolic hormones may underlie the changes observed, but analysis of key factors (see Materials and methods) ruled out this possibility. Insulin, glucagon, and related factors were significantly altered by 30 min of VA exposure, but the directionality of changes was inconsistent with driving the observed changes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> for details). Furthermore, both 1.5% and 1% isoflurane induced similar changes by 30 min, while metabolic effects on glucose and lactate are differential between these doses (see below).</p><p>We also considered the potential impact of oxygen levels in these exposures. In accordance with standard practice in pre-clinical rodent studies, VAs were delivered using 100% oxygen as a carrier gas. To test whether oxygen exposure acutely impacted β-HB or glucose levels, we exposed P7 neonates to 100% oxygen without anesthesia, finding that oxygen alone had no impact on either circulating β-HB or glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>β-HB loss contributes to hypoglycemia in neonates exposed to 1.5% isoflurane</title><p>Glucose and β-HB are two key circulating metabolic substrates in neonates; a reduced availability of one of these factors might lead to an increased demand for the other. Given that progressive hypoglycemia follows the rapid loss of β-HB, we hypothesized that this reduction in β-HB may contribute to a subsequent acceleration of glucose depletion. To explore this possibility, we tested whether β-HB supplementation could attenuate the loss of circulating glucose or whether exogenous glucose could prevent β-HB loss. Intraperitoneal (IP) injection with 2 g/kg of glucose at the start of anesthetic exposure substantially raised blood glucose levels at each measured timepoint, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K,L</xref>), but did not attenuate β-HB loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M,N</xref>). Conversely, an IP bolus of β-HB (20 µmol/g) at the start of isoflurane exposure, which significantly increased blood β-HB levels compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1O,P</xref>), led to a partial but significant attenuation of isoflurane-induced hypoglycemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Q–R</xref>). At 1 hr, β-HB-treated mice have blood glucose levels not significantly different from baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Q</xref>), and at 2 hr, glucose levels in β-HB-treated mice are midway between those of isoflurane-exposed and control-exposed animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Q</xref>), indicating that β-HB loss contributes to anesthesia-induced hypoglycemia in neonates.</p><p>Notably, exogenous β-HB was not sufficient to fully reverse the hypoglycemia in animals exposed to 1.5% isoflurane for 120 min. Interestingly, β-HB is depleted without hypoglycemia in animals exposed to 1% isoflurane for 120 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Given that lactate is significantly increased by 1.5%, but not 1%, isoflurane exposure, as described above, these data indicate that VA-induced hypoglycemia is predominantly driven by a shift toward anaerobic glucose metabolism, which is significantly less efficient in ATP yield, while maintaining circulating β-HB can attenuate the effects by providing an alternate fuel source.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Effects of VAs on dietary-induced ketosis</title><p>We next considered the possibility that VAs may affect dietary ketosis or fasting-induced ketogenesis.

Extending the exposure length, we found there is a similar absolute value increase in β-HB between 60 and 240 min whether neonates are control or 1.5% isoflurane exposed (the isoflurane group at a much lower point at 60 min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Three enzymatic reactions in the TCA cycle are directly regulated by this redox pair, and increased NADH/NAD+ inhibits TCA cycle flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tretter and Adam-Vizi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martínez-Reyes and Chandel, 2020</xref>). TCA cycle impairment can lead to cataplerosis, the removal of TCA cycle intermediates via production of amino acids to prevent mitochondrial matrix accumulation of TCA cycle intermediates. It can also impair pyruvate entry into the TCA cycle, with a concomitant increase in lactate production. Consistent with these data, plasma and liver amino acid profiling, which was obtained with the acyl-carnitine data, revealed a specific increase in the anaplerotic/cataplerotic amino acids alanine and asparagine/aspartate (indistinguishable by the mass-spectrometry method) in liver and alanine in plasma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–F</xref>); levels of other amino acids decreased. These data provide strong evidence of cataplerosis in the face of impaired TCA cycle function in isoflurane-exposed animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ratnikov et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Owen et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>To directly assess whether isoflurane exposure leads to TCA cycle perturbations, we next performed targeted metabolomics of TCA cycle and glycolytic metabolites from liver of P7 animals exposed to 30 min of 1% isoflurane or control conditions. While glycolytic intermediates were largely unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), lactate was significantly increased, additional evidence of a TCA cycle backup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In glycolysis, only phosphoenolpyruvate was significantly changed (reduced), though the implications of this finding are unclear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). Pyruvate was unchanged, and the majority of TCA cycle intermediates show only non-significant trends upward. However, critically, citrate and isocitrate showed a striking and significant elevation in the 1% isoflurane-exposed group, with citrate increased 100% by isoflurane exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J–Q</xref>). These data demonstrate that even brief exposure to the 1% isoflurane results in marked, yet specific, changes to hepatic TCA intermediates in P7 neonates.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Mechanism of VA-induced β-HB depletion in neonates</title><p>In addition to driving lactate increases and cataplerosis, accumulation of the TCA cycle intermediate citrate has been shown to regulate FAO through citrate-mediated activation of ACC. Acetyl-CoA availability and high citrate drive ACC activity; ACC produces the potent CPT1 inhibitor and fatty acid synthesis precursor malonyl-CoA, providing a FAO rheostat linked to citrate and acetyl-CoA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Muoio, 2014</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In normal conditions, this rheostat provides a switch between fat metabolism and synthesis linked to energetic status of the TCA cycle and acetyl-CoA. Considering together the impact of isoflurane on acyl-carnitines and citrate, we next considered the possibility that TCA cycle inhibition, accumulation of citrate, production of malonyl-CoA, and subsequent inhibition of FAO at CPT1 may be driving the VA-induced depletion of β-HB in P7 neonates. Consistent with this model, targeted metabolomic analysis confirmed that very low-dose 0.2% isoflurane for 30 min, which depletes β-HB (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), results in a significant increase in hepatic malonyl-CoA in P7 neonates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Mechanism of β-HB depletion in neonates.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Hepatic malonyl-CoA concentrations in P7 neonates exposed to 30 min of 0.2% isoflurane or control conditions. *p&lt;0.05 by pairwise t-test.

We administered 5 mg/kg etomoxir, a potent and irreversible pharmacologic inhibitor of CPT1, or 100 𝜇mol/kg malonyl-CoA, the endogenous inhibitor generated by ACC, to P7 neonatal pups by IP injection and assessed circulating β-HB following treatment. Strikingly, both etomoxir (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) and malonyl-CoA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) led to a rapid and robust depletion of blood β-HB levels, similar to VA exposure. These data clearly demonstrate that acute FAO inhibition leads to depletion of blood ß-HB in neonates, consistent with VAs impacting circulating β-HB through the citrate/ACC/malonyl-CoA/CPT1 pathway.</p><p>Finally, to directly assess causality of this pathway in this metabolic effect of VAs, we treated P7 neonatal animals with the ACC inhibitor ND-646 prior to 1% isoflurane exposure to determine whether inhibition of the enzyme responsible for malonyl-CoA production could attenuate the depletion of β-HB induced by VA exposure. ND-646 acts by binding to ACC and mimicking an inhibitory phosphorylation site, which prevents enzyme dimerization; however, already dimerized ACC is resistant to inhibition, and citrate activates ACC through other mechanisms, so a full rescue of β-HB levels in this instance was not anticipated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Park et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Svensson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2019</xref>). We performed this experiment using two slightly different paradigms: (1) comparison of animals treated for 15 min with ND-646 with or without simultaneous exposure to 1% isoflurane and (2) pre-treatment of animals for 15 min with either ND-646 or vehicle solution followed by exposure to 1% isoflurane (i.e. a pre-treatment with ND-646). In each case, mice from individual litters were equally distributed between treatments. In paradigm 1, ß-HB levels were not lower in mice treated with ND-646 then exposed to isoflurane when compared to animals treated with ND-646 but not exposed to isoflurane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). In paradigm 2, β-HB was significantly higher in animals pre-treated with ND-646 compared to those pre-treated with vehicle solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p><p>We observed that the recommended buffer used to deliver ND-646 (10% DMSO/40% PEG400/5% Tween-80/1X PBS) lowered baseline β-HB in these experiments, so performed one final treatment by diluting ND-646 in 100% DMSO directly into 1× PBS at the moment before injection (see Materials and methods). For this experiment, we treated P16 animals, the age where β-HB is highest (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We used three litters, evenly distributing animals between treatments. In this experiment, we found that β-HB levels dropped slightly over time in the ND-646-treated mice, but that treatment again significantly attenuated the drop caused by exposure to isoflurane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Taken together, these data provide causal evidence that ACC driven generation of malonyl-CoA and a resulting inhibition of FAO drives the loss of blood in VA-exposed neonatal mice (for reference, see model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6O</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Causes of neonatal specificity</title><p>Given these data, we next sought to further define the mechanisms of the neonatal specificity of the β-HB depletion resulting from VA exposure. We first performed targeted metabolomic analysis of malonyl-CoA and TCA cycle intermediates in adult (P30) mice fed a ketogenic diet, which we had found have high β-HB levels insensitive to VAs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We postulated that adult mice may have higher basal levels of malonyl-CoA or citrate relative to neonates, resulting in a relative insensitivity to changes induced by VAs. Adult mouse malonyl-CoA levels are not significantly different compared to neonates at baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref> – see legend), while exposure to 30 min of 1% isoflurane results in a significant increase in malonyl-CoA in livers of adult mice on a ketogenic diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Furthermore, hepatic citrate concentrations trend lower in adults compared to neonates, with no difference between diet groups, while 30 min of 1% isoflurane significantly raised citrate in both dietary conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). These data reveal, unexpectedly, that the impact of isoflurane on hepatic citrate and malonyl-CoA is as robust in P30 animals as in neonates. The metabolic impact of VAs is the same at both ages at this point in the citrate/malonyl-CoA/CPT1 pathway.</p><p>Next, we treated ketogenic P30 mice with etomoxir and malonyl-CoA at the same doses used in neonates to determine whether β-HB production is less sensitive to regulation through CPT1 at this age. Treatment with the potent and irreversible CPT1 inhibitor etomoxir resulted in a rapid reduction in circulating β-HB, as seen in neonates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). In striking contrast, treatment with malonyl-CoA had no impact on β-HB levels in ketogenic adults, with β-HB trending upward to 30 min. Together with the findings that citrate and malonyl-CoA are robustly increased by isoflurane in adults as in neonates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G–H</xref>), these data show that FAO regulation through CPT1 plays the same overall role in β-HB in ketogenic adults as in neonates, but that adults are insensitive to regulation of FAO by the endogenous inhibitor malonyl-CoA, providing a striking contrast to the impact of malonyl-CoA in neonates.</p><p>These findings indicate that the age specificity of blood β-HB depletion in response to exposure to VAs is the result of a rapid metabolic flexibility in neonates not present in adult animals. Based on this, and our model that the regulation of β-HB is mediated by increased citrate in the presence of abundant acetyl-CoA, we reasoned that β-HB levels should be acutely impacted by glucose administration, which feeds acetyl-CoA and the TCA cycle. This response would be the same in both neonates and adults, but neonates should be more sensitive to regulation by glucose compared to adults. Consistent with this model, we found that 2 g/kg IP glucose, but not 1 or 0.5 g/kg, results in a rapid depletion of blood β-HB in P30 ketotic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K,L</xref>). In neonates, blood β-HB was still depleted at glucose doses of 1 or 0.5 g/kg, while the effect was attenuated by 0.2 mg/kg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6M,N</xref>). Neonates are between 4- and 10-fold more sensitive to acute metabolic changes in glucose availability, strongly supporting our models for the actions of VAs and the age specificity of their effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6O</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Role of ETC CI</title><p>VAs have been shown to impair ETC function and directly inhibit ETC CI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kayser et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hanley et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bains et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kayser et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Olufs et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zimin et al., 2018</xref>). ETC CI inhibition leads to an increased NADH/NAD+ ratio, which can impair TCA cycle flux at the reversible steps where NADH is generated and NAD+ is consumed (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6N</xref>). Given these data, we performed various experiments aimed defining the precise role ETC CI inhibition and NADH redox shifts which mediate the effects of VAs, as detailed below:</p><p>First, we assessed NADH and NAD+ in liver of control and isoflurane-exposed animals (P7 and P30) through targeted metabolomics, finding no differences in NAD+, NADH, or the ratio between the two (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The NAD+ precursor nicotinamide riboside (NR) has been found to attenuate multiple outcomes arising from ETC CI impairment in vitro and in vivo, through rescue of NAD redox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schöndorf et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Walker and Tian, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goody and Henry, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Felici et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cantó et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). To further test the role NADH/NAD+ in the rapid depletion of β-HB, we injected P7 neonates with saline or 500 mg/kg NR, a dose reported to acutely increase NAD+ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hong et al., 2018</xref>), 30 min prior to exposure to 1% isoflurane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). NR failed to attenuate the loss of β-HB, but, rather, seemed to exacerbate the effect.</p><p>Given the caveats of measuring redox molecules, we further considered the role of ETC CI using pharmacologic and genetic approaches. Treatment of P7 neonates with 0.5 mg/kg rotenone led to lactate and glucose changes similar to that seen with 1.5% isoflurane, but β-HB was unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Lowering the dose to 0.1 mg/kg resulted in no overt effects on blood metabolites by 30 min, while increasing to 5 mg/kg led to an increase in all measured metabolites, including β-HB.</p><p>Finally, we assessed β-HB levels in P17 neonatal control and <italic>Ndufs4</italic> (KO) mice.

Our data provide important new insights into the impact of VAs in neonates and a particularly sensitive population. Ketone bodies are critical metabolites in neonatal and infant mammals, accounting for as much approximately 25% of basal neonatal energy consumption, while ketone consumption rates in neonate brain are four times, and infants five times, that of adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bougneres et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kraus et al., 1974</xref>). In the process, we have also demonstrated that short-term exposure to low-dose VAs results in substantial perturbations to hepatic metabolism, including leading to elevated citrate and malonyl-CoA, even in adult mice and irrespective of diet. These data have shed fresh light on the physiologic effects of VAs, but significant questions remain unanswered, which will require further study.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>ETC CI</title><p>Together, these data suggest that ETC CI inhibition may play a role in mediating some metabolic effects of VAs, such as VA-induced lactate production, but the precise role of ETC CI in β-HB regulation remains uncertain. Tissue specificity in drug actions may play a role in the differences between VAs and rotenone, with VAs preferentially impairing function in β-HB producing, vs consuming, tissues, or differences in the pharmacokinetics/dynamics of inhibition. The precise nature of ETC CI inhibition may also be distinct, with differential metabolic effects confounding the impact of rotenone. The <italic>Ndufs4</italic> (KO) data may indicate that chronic reduction in ETC CI function leads to compensatory increases in β-HB output. Each of these questions will need to be addressed in order to fully understand the role of ETC CI in the metabolic effects of VAs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Direct target of VAs</title><p>ETC CI may play a key role in the accumulation of citrate and subsequent metabolic changes, as discussed. Aconitase and IDH are responsible for the conversion of citrate to isocitrate and isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate, respectively. The energetically costly IDH reaction is most sensitive step of the TCA cycle to regulation by NADH redox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gabriel et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Khallaf, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 1999</xref>). Accordingly, the TCA cycle block at this NAD+ consuming step is consistent with altered NADH/NAD+ homeostasis within the mitochondria resulting from ETC CI inhibition. However, our data did not support a model whereby citrate is increased as a result of ETC CI inhibition. It is possible that VAs directly impair mitochondrial TCA cycle enzymes – the lack of detectable NADH redox shifts in liver and failure of rotenone or <italic>Ndufs4</italic> deficiency to mimic VAs seem to support this possibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Additional studies are needed to resolve the direct target of VAs in this setting.</p><p>While our data do not reveal the identity of the direct target of VAs in this paradigm, we successfully uncoupled sedation from the hepatic citrate/malonyl-CoA/FAO/ß-HB pathway. Moreover, since they occur at such low doses, these off-target effects cannot be avoided by simply turning down the dose of anesthetic. Whether any metabolic effects of VAs in neurons are similarly uncoupled from sedation remains to be determined.</p><p>The underpinnings of the age-related change in responsiveness to malonyl-CoA will require further study. The most likely culprit is CPT1, which has three isoforms – CPT1a, CPT1b, and CPT1c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">He et al., 2012</xref>). CPT1a is predominant most tissues, including liver, but is absent from muscle and brown adipose tissue, where CPT1b is the main form; CPT1c is expressed in the brain and appears to play a role in feeding behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yamazaki et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lavrentyev et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Price et al., 2002</xref>). Any development-related changes in CPT1 expression, isoform preference, or post-translational modifications modulating activity could lead to the altered sensitivity to malonyl-CoA and would provide intriguing insight into the developmental regulation of FAO and ketone production. Similarly, while genetic defects in CPT1 and CPT2 have been shown to underlie pathogenic responses to VAs, including rhabdomyolysis, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and even acute renal failure and cardiac arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benca and Hogan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wieser et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cornelio et al., 1980</xref>), the role of CPT1 has not been directly probed in relation to anesthesia in normal patients or in genetic mitochondrial disease. Further study of CPT1 in these settings seems warranted given its importance in the impact of VAs on neonatal metabolism.</p><p>We have shown that a 30 min exposure to isoflurane broadly depletes acyl-carnitines in neonatal liver without reducing total free fatty acid levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). However, while the impact VAs on acyl-carnitine production is similar between individual FA species, VAs may differentially impact FAs of different lengths at other steps in their metabolism. Consistent with this possibility, a small panel of long-chain FA acyl-CoA and acyl-carnitines shows that the impact of isoflurane on acyl-CoAs is mixed: VA exposure has no impact on C20:4 and C18 acyl-CoA levels, while C14, C16, and C20 acyl-CoAs are reduced to a degree similar to that of their respective acyl-carnitines (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Accordingly, while we can confidently state that VAs disrupt acyl-carnitine production and interfere with FAO at this step, the precise impacts of VAs on the metabolic fates of individual FA species and FAO intermediates remain undefined.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Anesthesia-induced neurotoxicity</title><p>Our findings raise the important question of whether the depletion of circulating β-HB contributes to the neurotoxic effects of volatile anesthetic exposure in neonatal animals. In a pilot group, we found that administering 2 µmol/g β-HB by IP injection immediately prior to an anesthesia exposure (4 hr exposure with 2 hr recovery, as we have done previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johnson et al., 2019b</xref>]) significantly reduced the number of cleaved caspase-3-positive nuclei in at least one brain region, cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Further studies should aim to characterize the scope of these effects on markers of damage and neurocognitive outcomes and test alternative ketone-raising intervention strategies. Additional studies aimed at probing the relationship between β-HB and anesthesia-related neurotoxic outcomes in both neonatal and non-neonatal models are warranted.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Beyond mice</title><p>Available evidence indicates that our findings will extend to other rodent models, and possibly to higher mammals, including humans.

Furthermore, levels of hepatic and intestinal CPT1 and HMG-CoA synthase, which is involved in ketogenesis, have been shown to be high during the neonatal period in these rats and rapidly decline at weaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asins et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Serra et al., 1993</xref>), suggesting that the mechanism of action we have uncovered is similar in these species.</p><p>Similarly detailed data are unavailable for human neonatal and pediatric populations, but human neonates are known to be hyperketotic compared to adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Laffel, 1999</xref>), and neonatal ketone body turnover has been shown to be as high in neonates as in adults who have been fasting for multiple days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bougneres et al., 1986</xref>). These findings underlie estimates that ketone provide as much as 25% of circulating energy requirements in neonatal humans. Further study is needed to define the normal concentrations β-HB in healthy human newborns and infants as a function of age and to assess whether exposure to volatile anesthetics similarly depletes β-HB in human neonatal patients.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Experimentally important non-anesthetic effects of VAs</title><p>Our data have major implications to any research utilizing anesthesia prior to assessing metabolic end points. We have clearly demonstrated that exposure to VAs has a rapid and significant impact on many metabolites including β-HB, citrate, malonyl-CoA, and acyl-carnitines. Some of these extend to adult animals and are likely to occur in other vertebrates, including humans, as well. Our data indicate that great caution should be used when considering the use of VAs in experiments involving metabolic endpoints, as even brief exposure at low dose can have striking metabolic consequences.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ethics statement and animal use</title><p>All experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Seattle Children’s Research Institute (Seattle, WA).

Each blood value measurement therefore represents a single animal euthanized at the timepoint designated. Animals were rapidly euthanized by decapitation, and blood was analyzed immediately. Point-of-care blood data (glucose, β-HB, and lactate) collected from animals aged P17 or older were collected using a minimally invasive tail-prick method, with multiple measures taken from the same animals during time-course data collection.</p><p>Except where indicated otherwise, blood glucose was measured using a Prodigy Autocode glucose meter (product #51850–3466188), blood β-HB was assessed using a Precision Xtra XEGW044 meter with β-HB assay strips, and blood lactate was measured using Nova Biomedical assay meter (Product #40828). Each of these meters was assessed for accuracy and precision across relevant blood metabolite concentration ranges, and all were found to be sufficiently reliable for the comparisons in this study (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). All three meters showed good read to read consistency (low SEM between individual reads of the same concentration) and strong linearity of reads throughout the relevant range. The lactate meter became inaccurate at concentrations higher than 5 mM, but given that samples only fell in this range in extreme treatments, and this limitation would only act to amplify the already significant increases in lactate we report and have no impact on the overall outcome, we did not apply any corrections. None of the findings in this manuscript would be impacted by adjusting to compensate for the variances from actual values of any of these point-of-care meters, so no adjustments were applied, and the biological variance in far outweighs the technical variance of these devices.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Sample collection and storage</title><p>All tissues and blood collected for metabolite analysis were flash-frozen in liquid-phase nitrogen and stored at −80°C, or in dry ice (during shipment), until use.

The rational for this approach was based on the calculation that four replicates per group is needed for an 80% power to detect changes of 30% or greater in groups with a 15% sigma.

Specifically, control treatment conditions were pooled where possible (for nearly all anesthesia exposures), increasing the overall power of each comparison to controls; the desired replicate number was reduced to three in instances where changes were already highly significant upon collecting three samples; additional replicates were included when strong trends were apparent after four replicates were collected; as many blood values as possible were collected from mice used for tissue collection/metabolomics datasets to maximize their purpose, leading to increased replicate numbers in additional instances.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>Volatile anesthetics are widely used and generally safe but neonates are an at risk group for side effects. Ketone bodies such as β hydroxybutyrate account for a proportionately larger source of energy for neonates vs adults and in this manuscript by Stokes et al. the authors show that volatile anesthetics lower β hydroxybutyrate in neonate compared to adult mice providing a novel insight into potential mechanism of action of these volatile anesthetics.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Mechanisms underlying neonate specific metabolic effects of volatile anesthetics&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) The scatter in some of your glucose measurements is substantial. In looking at papers reviewing the performance of POC glucose meters, I found that the Prodigy Autocode received rather poor marks for reliability as compared with lab measurements. I would suggest that you perform a series of calibration measures against a reference lab with blood samples. You might consider placing this information in the supplementary material.</p><p>2) The authors provide compelling evidence for why VAs cause a drop in BHB levels. An interesting corollary is if the drop in BHB is related to the neural apoptosis that VAs cause in neonates. As the authors found BHB can be IP injected to rescue BHB levels, would such a treatment impact VA induced neural apoptosis? This experiment would provide evidence that ketone metabolic abnormalities the authors delineate are functionally related to neonatal VA toxicity.</p><p>3) The authors find no evidence that NAD/NADH or ETC function are perturbed by subanesthetic doses of VA. Similarly, the authors find that directly blocking the ETC genetically or pharmacologically does not cause a drop in neonatal BHB levels. Yet, the authors still speculate that ETC inhibition and redox imbalance underlay VA-induced citrate accumulation by potentially altering IDH flux. I think the manuscript would be stronger if the authors either rewrote the discussion to make it clearer that the underlying defect that causes citrate accumulation is unclear but seems unlikely to be caused by altered ETC function.</p><p>4) The evidence that the authors provide for a functional block in fatty acid oxidation in newborn livers upon VA exposure is based on measuring acylcarnitine abundance and thus is an indirect measure of fatty acid oxidation flux. As this is key to the authors model, direct measurement of fatty acid oxidation rate would be ideal and bolster the authors model.</p><p>5) The ND-646 experiments are quite nice for mechanistically testing if ACC activity is required for VA block of ketogenesis. However, in figure 6D, ketone levels are on average ~1.5mM, whereas ketone levels in neonates throughout the manuscript are ~2mM. Does this indicate that ND-646 on its own impacts neonate ketone levels. An experiment as in 1C comparing neonate BHB levels +/- ND-646 overtime would be crucial to determine if this compound has effects on BHB levels independent of VA.</p><p>6) ND-646 only partially rescues (to ~1mM) neonate BHB levels upon VA exposure. Is this due to VA-independent effects (see comment 4) or because the drug only partially blocks ACC or because enhanced ACC activity is only partially responsible for the BHB decrease? Measuring malonyl-CoA levels in the liver +/-ND-646 +/- VA would help determine if the partial response is just due to partial blockage of ACC. If the malonyl-CoA increase is fully blocked by ND-646, it would be good for the authors to note that the proposed boost in liver ACC activity is only partially response for the metabolic phenotype they observe and perhaps speculate in the discussion for other mechanisms by which VA exposure may regulate BHB levels in neonates.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65400.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) The scatter in some of your glucose measurements is substantial. In looking at papers reviewing the performance of POC glucose meters, I found that the Prodigy Autocode received rather poor marks for reliability as compared with lab measurements. I would suggest that you perform a series of calibration measures against a reference lab with blood samples. You might consider placing this information in the supplementary material.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their attention to detail. In preliminary studies we tested multiple glucometers and found that the Prodigy Autocode performed well compared to competitors. We ultimately chose to use this particular meter due to its relatively strong performance as well as the cost and availability of test strips. We are able to confidently report that the scatter is driven by animal-to-animal variability, rather than any deficits in the meter.</p><p>We have included our quality control assessment of the Prodigy Autocode meter as Figure S8. To expand upon this reviewer’s comment, we also included our quality control assessments of the ß-HB meter and the lactate meter, also in Figure S8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors provide compelling evidence for why VAs cause a drop in BHB levels. An interesting corollary is if the drop in BHB is related to the neural apoptosis that VAs cause in neonates. As the authors found BHB can be IP injected to rescue BHB levels, would such a treatment impact VA induced neural apoptosis? This experiment would provide evidence that ketone metabolic abnormalities the authors delineate are functionally related to neonatal VA toxicity.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up this important point. While a full exploration of the role of ketones in neuronal damage caused by VA exposure is beyond the scope of this current manuscript, we performed a preliminary exploration of this topic and have included the data as Figure S7, and mention them in the discussion. In these preliminary studies, we found that administration of BHB by IP injection prior to anesthetic exposure does appear to attenuate CNS apoptosis using the paradigm we’ve previously published.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors find no evidence that NAD/NADH or ETC function are perturbed by subanesthetic doses of VA. Similarly, the authors find that directly blocking the ETC genetically or pharmacologically does not cause a drop in neonatal BHB levels. Yet, the authors still speculate that ETC inhibition and redox imbalance underlay VA-induced citrate accumulation by potentially altering IDH flux. I think the manuscript would be stronger if the authors either rewrote the discussion to make it clearer that the underlying defect that causes citrate accumulation is unclear but seems unlikely to be caused by altered ETC function.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment, and apologize for the ambiguity. Our goal in the discussion is to convey precisely what the reviewer states – that the proximal cause of citrate accumulation is unknown but ETC inhibition at complex I is unlikely – with the one clarification of specifying CI, as we only targeted CI in these experiments. We have revised our discussion to improve clarity as recommended (see Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The evidence that the authors provide for a functional block in fatty acid oxidation in newborn livers upon VA exposure is based on measuring acylcarnitine abundance and thus is an indirect measure of fatty acid oxidation flux. As this is key to the authors model, direct measurement of fatty acid oxidation rate would be ideal and bolster the authors model.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this important note. We believe the concern revolves around our lack of clarity in specifying that our findings show a functional block in fatty acid oxidation at the reaction catalyzed by CPT1 (this specific step emphasized), without investigating FAO metabolism in terms of the metabolic flux of individual fatty acid species. Further analysis of individual fatty acid species flux will be of great interest, but it will require years to develop and implement appropriate in vivo assays, and is beyond the scope of the current manuscript. Accordingly, we have modified the text to clarify.</p><p>In addition to revising the text to clarify, we have added a note to the discussion and an additional supplemental figure (Figure S6) which support the important points the reviewer’s alluded to – that our data do not preclude differential effects on individual fatty acid species, and an impact of VAs on other steps of FAO cannot be ruled out. We hope this clarification and additional text/data satisfactorily clarify the limits of our findings.</p><p>The text (added to the discussion) is as follows:</p><p>“We have shown that a 30-minute exposure to isoflurane broadly depletes acylcarnitines in neonatal liver without reducing total free fatty acid levels (Figure 3). However, while the impact VAs on acyl-carnitine production is similar between individual FA species, VAs may differentially impact FAs of different lengths at other steps in their metabolism. Consistent with this possibility, a small panel of long-chain FA acyl-CoA and acyl-carnitines shows that the impact of isoflurane on acyl-CoA’s is mixed: VA exposure has no impact on C20:4 and C18 acyl-CoA levels, while C14, C16, and C20 acyl-CoA’s are reduced to a degree similar to that of their respective acyl-carnitines (see Figure S6). Accordingly, while we can confidently state that VAs disrupt acyl-carnitine production and interfere with FAO at this step, the precise impacts of VAs on the metabolic fates of individual FA species and FAO intermediates remain undefined.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The ND-646 experiments are quite nice for mechanistically testing if ACC activity is required for VA block of ketogenesis. However, in figure 6D, ketone levels are on average ~1.5mM, whereas ketone levels in neonates throughout the manuscript are ~2mM. Does this indicate that ND-646 on its own impacts neonate ketone levels. An experiment as in 1C comparing neonate BHB levels +/- ND-646 overtime would be crucial to determine if this compound has effects on BHB levels independent of VA.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this thoughtful comment, which raises an important point we had not addressed in our study in the initial submission. In following up on their question, we found the buffer used in the ND-646 studies, not ND-646 itself, lowered ketone levels. We repeated these experiments using a different dosing method, finding the impact of ND-646 is the same, while the new buffer/injection method minimally impacts BHB alone. Furthermore, we were able to achieve this effect using a reduced dose of ND-646. This new data is as describe in the revised text: “We observed that the recommended buffer used to deliver ND-646 (10% DMSO/40% PEG400/5% Tween-80/1X PBS) lowered baseline ß-HB in these experiments, so performed one final treatment by diluting ND-646 in 100% DMSO directly into 1XPBS at the moment before injection (see Methods). For this experiment, we treated P16 animals, the age where ß-HB is highest (see Figure 2). We used three litters, evenly distributing animals between treatments. In this experiment, we found that ß-HB levels dropped slightly over time in the ND-646 treated mice, but that treatment again significantly attenuated the drop caused by exposure to isoflurane (Figure 6F-G).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) ND-646 only partially rescues (to ~1mM) neonate BHB levels upon VA exposure. Is this due to VA-independent effects (see comment 4) or because the drug only partially blocks ACC or because enhanced ACC activity is only partially responsible for the BHB decrease? Measuring malonyl-CoA levels in the liver +/-ND-646 +/- VA would help determine if the partial response is just due to partial blockage of ACC. If the malonyl-CoA increase is fully blocked by ND-646, it would be good for the authors to note that the proposed boost in liver ACC activity is only partially response for the metabolic phenotype they observe and perhaps speculate in the discussion for other mechanisms by which VA exposure may regulate BHB levels in neonates.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment, and apologize for our failure to adequately introduce this compound in the original version of the manuscript – the partiality of the effect was not unexpected given the mechanism of action of this drug and complex mechanism by which ACC is regulated. Briefly, ACC is inhibited when phosphorylated by AMP activated kinase, a post-translational modification which prevents dimerization and activity. ND-646 binds at the site of this phosphorylation and mimics the regulatory phosphorylation. However, ACC activity can be induced by high citrate through independent mechanisms, and already dimerized ACC is resistant to acute inhibition by ND-646. Accordingly, our findings support a role for ACC in regulating ketogenesis in these neonatal animals, but there is no pharmacologic agent available which would be expected to completely block the citrate induced activity of ACC. Targeted genetic manipulation will be needed to further probe this model.</p><p>We have added a brief summary of this, with references, to the revised manuscript: “ND-646 acts by binding to ACC and mimicking an inhibitory phosphorylation site which prevents enzyme dimerization; however, already dimerized ACC is resistant to inhibition, and citrate activates ACC through other mechanisms, so a full rescue of ß-HB levels in this instance was not anticipated (32-35).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
