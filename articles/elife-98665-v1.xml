Multinucleated osteoclasts are formed by the fusion of precursor cells, and larger cells – generated by an increased number of cell fusion events – have higher resorptive activity. We find that osteoclast fusion and bone resorption are promoted by reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling and by an unconventional low molecular weight species of La protein, located at the osteoclast surface. Here, we develop the hypothesis that La’s unique regulatory role in osteoclast multinucleation and function is controlled by an ROS switch in La trafficking. Using antibodies that recognize reduced or oxidized species of La, we find that differentiating osteoclasts enrich an oxidized species of La at the cell surface, which is distinct from the reduced La species conventionally localized within cell nuclei. ROS signaling triggers the shift from reduced to oxidized La species, its dephosphorylation and delivery to the surface of osteoclasts, where La promotes multinucleation and resorptive activity. Moreover, intracellular ROS signaling in differentiating osteoclasts oxidizes critical cysteine residues in the C-terminal half of La, producing this unconventional La species that promotes osteoclast fusion. Our findings suggest that redox signaling induces changes in the location and function of La and may represent a promising target for novel skeletal therapies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>osteoclast</kwd><kwd>cell fusion</kwd><kwd>lupus La protein</kwd><kwd>redox</kwd><kwd>skeleton</kwd><kwd>reactive oxygen species</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1k99-HD110609-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Whitlock</surname><given-names>Jarred M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural Research Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chernomordik</surname><given-names>Leonid</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000124</institution-id><institution>Office of Research on Women's Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>884515</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chernomordik</surname><given-names>Leonid</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Molecular and biochemical approaches in primary human cells illustrate how a nuclear RNA-binding protein is shifted to the surface of osteoclasts – setting their size and biological activity.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The integrity of our bones throughout life depends on tightly regulated coordination between the bone-forming activity of osteoblasts and the bone-resorbing activity of osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McDonald et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolamperti et al., 2022</xref>). A variety of genetic and age-related skeletal disorders are linked to a disbalance in osteoblast–osteoclast functional coupling that commonly results in excessive bone resorption and/or insufficient synthesis and mineralization of bone.</p><p>Multinucleated osteoclasts are formed by the fusion of mononucleated precursor cells, and, in most cases, cells with more nuclei (i.e., generated by a larger number of fusion events) have higher resorptive activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Piper et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Møller et al., 2020</xref>). We recently demonstrated that both osteoclast fusion and bone resorption are controlled by an unconventional, low molecular weight form of La protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Whitlock et al., 2023</xref>). La (SSB small RNA-binding exonuclease protection factor La, Gene ID 6741, NCBI GENE), an abundant, ubiquitous protein in eukaryotes, exists primarily as a phosphorylated, nuclear species that plays essential functions in the maturation of RNA polymerase III transcripts, particularly tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wolin and Cedervall, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maraia et al., 2017</xref>). However, we discovered that La is dephosphorylated, proteolytically cleaved, and delivered to the surface of osteoclasts during multinucleation. Surface-associated La promotes cell–cell fusion and increased resorptive capacity in osteoclasts. When osteoclasts reach a mature size appropriate for their biological activity, fusion stops. Completion of the fusion process coincides with the removal of surface-associated La, suggesting that the changes in the surface La amounts effectively set the size and biological activity of osteoclasts. The mechanisms that trigger the radical switch in the location and function of La from nucleus to cell surface; and from ubiquitous RNA chaperone to an osteoclast-specific fusion regulator – remain to be understood.</p><p>Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) represents a common biological switch for proteins with multiple functions in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dishman and Volkman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu and Jeffery, 2020</xref>). Excessive levels of ROS during oxidative stress eventually lead to irreversible damage of biological systems and tissues and have been linked to diverse diseases in many physiological systems, including the skeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Forman and Zhang, 2021</xref>). However, transient, moderate increases in ROS levels, referred to as redox signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schieber and Chandel, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lennicke and Cochemé, 2021</xref>) or a mild oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ďuračková, 2010</xref>), play important roles in diverse cellular differentiation processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Forman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wilson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Domazetovic et al., 2017</xref>). Intracellular ROS signaling commonly induces the formation of disulfide bonds, drives structural and oligomeric transitions, and promotes the unconventional secretion of some proteins lacking a signal peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Urano et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kwak et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cruz-Garcia et al., 2020</xref>). Alternatively, a transition in the redox state of cysteine residues can also be triggered merely by protein trafficking changes that shifts the localization of a protein from the cytosol (typically reducing) to the extracellular environment (typically oxidizing) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gilbert, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ottaviano et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Like many other physiological processes, bone remodeling and, more specifically, osteoclast formation depend on ROS signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Domazetovic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). Receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL)-induced differentiation of osteoclast precursors quickly generates transient ROS signaling in differentiating osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2005</xref>), and many bone diseases, including osteoporosis, have been linked to perturbations in ROS signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Domazetovic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Reis and Ramos, 2021</xref>). Moreover, application of oxidizing reagents, such as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, promotes osteoclast formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Suda et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agidigbi and Kim, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lean et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garrett et al., 1990</xref>). In contrast, cell-permeable antioxidants block RANKL-induced ROS production and inhibit osteoclast formation and bone resorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sanders et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao and Picklo, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Recent biochemical studies demonstrate that oxidizing conditions and intracellular redox signaling elicit conformational transitions and oligomerization of La protein and promote its nucleus-to-cytoplasm shuttling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berndt et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berndt et al., 2021b</xref>). Here, we tested the hypothesis that La’s unique regulatory role in osteoclast multinucleation and function is controlled by an ROS switch in La trafficking and function. Using antibodies that recognize reduced vs oxidized species of La, we found that nuclear La and cell surface La in differentiating osteoclasts to represent reduced and oxidized species of the protein, respectively. Oxidized La species at the surface of osteoclasts promoted their fusion and increased multinucleation. Suppressing ROS signaling in osteoclast precursors inhibited the appearance of La in the cytoplasm and at the surface of osteoclasts and suppressed fusion during osteoclast formation. Addition of the C-terminal half of La – the region required for promoting osteoclast fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Whitlock et al., 2023</xref>) – to the extracellular surface of osteoclasts rescued this inhibition but only if critical La cysteine residues were available for oxidation. Our data suggest that transient ROS signaling induces a shift from reduced to oxidized La species and plays a critical role in directing the delivery of La to the surface of osteoclasts and promoting multinucleation and subsequent resorptive function of these syncytial bone remodelers. Our findings suggest that redox transition and, more specifically, La cysteine oxidation may represent promising targets for therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating osteoclast-dependent bone resorption in skeletal pathologies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Osteoclast fusion depends on an oxidized form of surface La</title><p>To mechanistically evaluate the transition from osteoclast precursors to multinucleated osteoclasts, we incubated primary human monocytes with recombinant macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and then with M-CSF and recombinant RANKL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Whitlock et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asagiri and Takayanagi, 2007</xref>). While the time course and efficiency of multinucleated osteoclast formation vary from donor to donor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Whitlock et al., 2023</xref>), on average, we observed the appearance of small, multinucleated syncytia 2 days after RANKL application and fusion rapidly increased over the next 2 days, resulting in mature, resorption competent osteoclasts at 4–5 days post-RANKL addition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Whitlock et al., 2023</xref>). Previously, we demonstrated that the cell fusion stage of multinucleated osteoclast formation depends on La trafficking to the surface of the osteoclasts at days 2–4 post-RANKL application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Whitlock et al., 2023</xref>); however, the mechanisms that trigger La’s trip to the osteoclast surface and what molecular requirements must be met for its unconventional fusion role there remained open questions.</p><p>To address open questions concerning La’s surface trafficking and molecular function in osteoclast multinucleation, we evaluated the redox state of La in fusing osteoclasts using recently validated monoclonal α-La antibodies that recognize oxidized La (clone 7B6) or reduced La (clone 312B), or do not distinguish between these La species (Pan, clone 5B9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berndt et al., 2021a</xref>). At the time of fusion, immunofluorescence analysis of La’s localization in permeabilized osteoclasts with pan α-La antibody demonstrated that La is present in both the cytoplasm and nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). In stark contrast, the cytoplasmic/plasma membrane-associated pool was recognized by the α-La antibody that recognizes oxidized La species, while the α-La antibody that recognizes reduced La species recognized the nuclear protein pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Under non-permeabilizing conditions – focusing on the exofacial surface of the plasma membrane – we readily observed La at the surface of fusing osteoclasts (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Whitlock et al., 2023</xref>). We find that this surface pool of La is dramatically enriched in oxidized, rather than reduced, La species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). In further support of this conclusion, we found that application of the membrane-impermeable reducing reagent Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP) dramatically decreased the recognition of surface La by the α-La antibody that recognizes the oxidized species and increased the recognition of surface La by the α-La antibody that recognizes the reduced species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b, c</xref>). In contrast, TCEP had no effect on the ability of the pan α-La antibody to recognize surface La (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b, c</xref>) or on the surface detection of La with another α-La antibody (Abcam #75927) that we have used previously to evaluate La at the surface of fusing osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Whitlock et al., 2023</xref>) and now found to recognize both reduced and oxidized species of La (data not shown). These findings indicate that the surface pool of La that manages osteoclast size and resorptive function is primarily composed of an oxidized La molecular species. Interestingly, TCEP treatment did not dissociate cell surface La from plasma membrane, suggesting that the reduced species of La retains its ability to associate with the plasma membrane.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Oxidized La decorates the surface of osteoclasts during multinucleation.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Representative immunofluorescence (top) and differential interference contrast (DIC, bottom) confocal micrographs of permeabilized primary human osteoclasts.

As in earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Whitlock et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Verma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Verma et al., 2018</xref>), we uncoupled the cell fusion stage of osteoclast formation from pre-fusion differentiation processes using lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), a reversible inhibitor of an early stage of membrane rearrangement required for osteoclast fusion. LPC was applied for 16 hr following 2 days of RANKL elicited osteoclastogenesis. Ready-to-fuse cells, which could not fuse in the presence of LPC, rapidly fused after LPC wash out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a, b</xref>). As we demonstrated previously with another pan α-La antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Whitlock et al., 2023</xref>), pan α-La antibody 5B9 applied at the time of LPC removal inhibited synchronized osteoclast fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a, b</xref>). Similarly, α-La antibodies that recognize the oxidized species inhibited fusion, while antibodies that recognize the reduced La species had no effect on fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a, b</xref>).

This mechanism enriches our recent identification of La protein as a regulator of the cell–cell fusion stage of osteoclast formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Whitlock et al., 2023</xref>) and highlights the role of osteoclast ROS signaling in directing fusion machinery to the surface of osteoclast progenitors. While the reduced species of La functions as an essential nuclear RNA chaperone, oxidized La shifts to the cytoplasm and shuttles to the surface of the osteoclasts. It is this specialized oxidize species of cell surface-associated La that promotes osteoclast fusion and bone resorption.</p><p>The transition from reduced to oxidized species of La is accompanied by many changes in the protein structure, including an oxidation-induced oligomerization of the protein, a loss of almost half of its helical content, and a change in accessibility of epitopes recognized by conformation specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berndt et al., 2021a</xref>). Our data show that La belongs to a category of fold switching proteins that change functions in response to the cellular environment, more specifically, oxidizing and reducing intracellular conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim and Porter, 2021</xref>). In addition to direct changes in the structure of La caused by its oxidation, ROS can influence La function in osteoclast fusion by indirect effects. Formation of multinucleated osteoclasts involves the caspase 3-cleaved, non-phosphorylated species of La (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Whitlock et al., 2023</xref>) and ROS can influence La properties by activation of both caspase 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2019</xref>) and PP2A-like phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cicchillitti et al., 2003</xref>), previously reported to dephosphorylate La Ser366 before La cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rutjes et al., 1999</xref>). Indeed, while our finding that NAC inhibits dephosphorylation of La can indicate that redox-dependent changes in La’s conformation are required for the dephosphorylation of the protein, it can also be explained by the ROS dependence of PP2A activity. In both scenarios, redox signaling promotes intracellular La modifications and trafficking that delivers the fusion-promoting species of La to the surface of cells.</p><p>We still do not know how cell surface La promotes osteoclast fusion and why the oxidized species of La is functional in this unique cellular context. For many viral and intracellular fusion processes, remodeling of membrane bilayers in fusion is thought to be driven by the conformational energy released at the time and place of fusion in the restructuring of fusion-promoting proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weber et al., 1998</xref>). Finding that La acquires an oxidized conformation already in cytoplasm rather than at the cell surface at the time of fusion argues against the hypothesis that redox restructuring of La directly contributes to membrane remodeling. Furthermore, our finding that La association with the cell surface does not change after reducing oxidized La with TCEP argues against the hypothesis that La oxidation is merely required for its association with the surface of osteoclasts.</p><p>Our data, which indicate that fusion competence in osteoclast precursors depends on ROS signaling, can be, at least partially, explained by the oxidation-dependent changes in the structure of La protein and its nucleo-cytoplasmic-cell surface shuttling. Formation of disulfide bonds; re-localization of normally nuclear proteins to the cytoplasm, extracellular medium, and cell surface; and dramatic changes in function in response to transient increases in ROS concentrations have been well described for other nuclear chaperones, in particular, high mobility group Box 1 (HMGB1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kwak et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). Like La, HMGB1 has three cysteines and mild HMGB1 oxidation generates disulfide bonds that stabilize homodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kwak et al., 2020</xref>). Homodimerization by formation of disulfide bonds is also a pre-requisite for the unconventional secretion of Fibroblast Growth Factor 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Prudovsky et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The specific pathway(s), by which RANKL-induced increases in ROS levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2005</xref>) shift the redox state of La and facilitate its unconventional secretion, remain to be clarified. Moreover, we hope to explore the contributions of related pathways like the production of nitric oxide (NO) and other reactive nitrogen species. In the case of HMGB1, the secretion of the protein, allowing it to act as a signaling molecule outside the cell, in addition to ROS, depends on NO signaling mediated by NO binding of one of a cysteine thiol in protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). Interestingly, like redox signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Domazetovic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2005</xref>), NO signaling promotes osteoclastogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nilforoushan et al., 2009</xref>) and the translocation of La protein to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berndt et al., 2021b</xref>). More work is needed to explore the contributions of NO signaling to La function in osteoclasts and to compare the molecular mechanisms that deliver these two redox-, fold-, and function-shifting proteins, La and HMGB1, to the cell surface and extracellular medium.</p><p>In conclusion, in this study, we identified redox signaling as a molecular switch that redirects La protein away from the nucleus, where it protects precursor tRNAs from exonuclease digestion, and toward its separable function at the osteoclast surface, where La regulates the multinucleation and resorptive functions of these managers of the skeleton.</p><p>Proteins involved in osteoclastogenesis represent potential therapeutic targets for treating bone loss diseases. Finding that osteoclast La promotes bone resorption by acting not only at a different location but also in a different conformation from in comparison to the species of La that carries out its essential and ubiquitous RNA chaperoning functions (cell surface vs nucleus and oxidized vs reduced form), may help in minimizing off target effects of La targeting treatments.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents</title><p>Human M-CSF and RANKL were purchased from Cell Sciences (Catalogue # CRM146B and CRR100B, respectively).

In brief, since regardless of the sequence of fusion events, the number of cell-to-cell fusion events required to generate syncytium with <italic>N</italic> nuclei is always equal to N − 1, we calculated the fusion number index as Σ(Ni − 1) = Ntotal − Nsyn, where Ni = the number of nuclei in individual syncytia and Nsyn = the total number of syncytia. We normalized the number of fusion events to the total number of nuclei (including unfused cells) to control for small variations in cell density from dish to dish and image to image. In contrast to traditional fusion index measurements, this approach gives equal consideration to fusion between two mononucleated cells, one mononucleated cell and one multinucleated cell and two multinucleated cells. In traditional fusion index calculations, fusion between two multinucleated cells does not change the percentage of nuclei in syncytia. If instead one counts the number of syncytia, a fusion event between two multinucleated is not just missed but decreases the number of syncytia. In contrast, the fusion number index is inclusive of all fusion events.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Synchronization of osteoclast fusion</title><p>Osteoclast fusion was synchronized as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Verma et al., 2014</xref>.

In a recently published manuscript, the investigators found that osteoclast multinucleation and resorptive activity are regulated by a de-phosphorylated and proteolytically cleaved form of the La protein that is present on the cell surface of differentiating osteoclasts. In the present work, the authors build upon these findings to determine the physiologic signals that regulate La trafficking to the cell membrane and ultimately, the ability of this protein to promote fusion. Building upon other published studies that show (1) that intracellular redox signaling can elicit changes in the confirmation and localization of La, and (2) that osteoclast formation is dependent on ROS signaling, the authors hypothesize that oxidation of La in response to intracellular ROS underlies the re-localization of La to the cell membrane and that this is necessary for its pro-fusion activity. The authors test this hypothesis in a rigorous manner using antioxidant treatments, recombinant La protein, and modification of cysteine residues predicted to be key sites of oxidation. Osteoclast fusion is then monitored in each condition using fluorescence microscopy. These data strongly support the conclusion that oxidized La is de-phosphorylated, increases in abundance at the cell surface of differentiating osteoclasts, and promotes cell-cell fusion. A strength of this manuscript is the use of multiple complementary approaches to test the hypothesis, especially the use of Cys mutant forms of La to directly tie the observed phenotypes to changes in residues that are key targets for oxidation. The manuscript is also well written and describes a clearly articulated hypothesis based on a precise summation of the existing literature. The findings of this manuscript will be of interest to researchers in the field of bone biology, but also more generally to cell biologists. The data in this manuscript may also lead to future studies that target La for bone diseases in which there is increased osteoclast activity. Weaknesses of the first version of the manuscript were minor and predominantly related to data presentation choices and some statistical analyses. These weaknesses were comprehensively addressed in the revised manuscript, and therefore the study has increased clarity and rigor.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.98665.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>Bone resorption by osteoclasts plays an important role in bone modeling and homeostasis. The multinucleated mature osteoclasts have higher bone-resorbing capacity than their mononuclear precursors. The previous work by authors has identified that increased cell-surface level of La protein promotes fusion of mononuclear osteoclast precursor cells to form fully active multinucleated osteoclasts. In the present study, the authors further provided convincing data obtained from cellular and biochemical experiments to demonstrate that the nuclear localized La protein where it regulates RNA metabolism was oxidized by redox signaling during osteoclast differentiation and the modified La protein was translocated to osteoclast surface where it associated with other proteins and phospholipids to trigger cell-cell fusion process. The work provides novel mechanistic insights into osteoclast biology and provides a potential therapeutic target to suppress excessive bone resorption in metabolic bone diseases such as osteoporosis and arthritis.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Increased intracellular ROS induced by osteoclast differentiation cytokine RANKL has been widely studied in enhancing RANKL signaling during osteoclast differentiation. The work provides novel evidence that redox signaling can post-translationally modify proteins to alter the translocation and functions of critical regulators in the late stage of osteoclastogenesis. The results and conclusions are mostly supported by the convincing cellular and biochemical assays,</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Lack of in vivo studies in animal models of bone diseases such as postmenopausal osteoporosis, inflammatory arthritis, and osteoarthritis reduces the translational potential of this work.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.98665.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Leikina</surname><given-names>Evgenia</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">BETHESDA</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Whitlock</surname><given-names>Jarred M</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bethasda</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Melikov</surname><given-names>Kamran</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">BETHESDA</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Wendy</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">BETHESDA</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bachmann</surname><given-names>Michael P</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Dresden</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chernomordik</surname><given-names>Leonid</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>NICHD, NIH</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bethesda</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) When introducing the different antibody clones recognizing Pan, oxidized, or reduced forms, please clearly indicate which clone number belongs to which form.</p></disp-quote><p>- We see where the original language could be confusing. Please see our new introduction to the antibodies used.</p><p>“we evaluated the redox state of La in fusing osteoclasts using recently validated monoclonal α-La antibodies that recognize oxidized La (clone 7B6) or reduced La (clone 312B), or do not distinguish between these La species (Pan, clone 5B9)”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) &quot;Finding that the surface La pool, which promotes multinucleation in osteoclasts, is an oxidized species...&quot; I would suggest rewording as &quot;...is enriched in oxidized species&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>- Agreed. We have edited the sentence as follows.</p><p>“Finding that the surface La pool, which promotes multinucleation in osteoclasts, is enriched in an oxidized species raised the question”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Although not necessary to support the conclusions of the manuscript, it would be interesting to know if the application of La194-408 to osteoclast progenitors following NAC treatment results in the rescue of La staining at the cell surface, or if this exogenous La is acting independently from cell surface association.</p></disp-quote><p>- We agree that this is an interesting idea. We previously demonstrated that we could add La 1-375 to osteoclast progenitors following RANKL addition and promote osteoclast fusion. We also demonstrated that La 1-375 under these conditions enriched La surface staining (PMID: 36739273)</p><p>- Therefore, we hypothesize that La 194-408 would act similarly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Is the confirmation of La modified by the conversion of Cys 232 and 245 to alanine? What about the potential to form oligomers?</p></disp-quote><p>- To directly answer the Reviewer’s question – we simply do not know and do not have a simple way to test this. To speculate, the differential recognition of La that is reduced vs oxidized by the antibodies used here (specifically clone 312b vs clone 7b6) suggests that some conformational change is taking place when redox signaling modifies La in osteoclasts. Moreover, in Supp. Fig. 4b, we show that recombinant La 194-408 does form a small amount of dimer under our conditions while La 194-408 Cys 232 and 245 to Ala does not. These data together weakly support that La, when converted from reduced to oxidized forms or when we artificially Cys 232 and 245 to Ala, undergoes some conformational and oligomeric change. However, we are not comfortable making</p><p>such claims in the manuscript currently and prefer to investigate this with more rigor and comment in the biological significance of these potential changes in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) &quot;In conclusion, in this study, we identified redox signaling as a molecular switch that redirects La protein away from the nucleus, where it protects precursor tRNAs from exonuclease digestion, and towards its osteoclast-specific function at the cell surface...&quot; I would suggest rewording this sentence given that there is no evidence that the function of oxidized La at the cell surface is osteoclast-specific. This phenomenon could be applicable to other cell types and other biological processes.</p></disp-quote><p>- The Reviewer makes a good point here, that we very much appreciate. We hoped to communicate that this was a unique function of La that was different from the well-recognized role this protein plays in RNA metabolism, but somewhat overstated past our intention. Please see where we have modified this statement to read:</p><p>“In conclusion, in this study, we identified redox signaling as a molecular switch that redirects La protein away from the nucleus, where it protects precursor tRNAs from exonuclease digestion, and towards its separable function at the osteoclast surface, where La regulates the multinucleation and resorptive functions of these managers of the skeleton.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) In methods, the definition of TCEP is missing a closed parenthesis sign.</p></disp-quote><p>- Thank you, corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) In methods under &quot;Cells&quot; there is a missing superscript in 1x106 cells/ml. Presumably, this is 1x10e6.</p></disp-quote><p>- Thank you, corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Please provide the sequences of primers used for RT-PCR in this study.</p></disp-quote><p>- Understood. Please see where a table of all primer sequences used has been added to the Methods under the Transcript Analysis section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) In methods, &quot;Bone resorption&quot; should be relabeled given that the osteoclasts are plated on calciumphosphate plates and not on a bone surface.</p></disp-quote><p>- Thank you. Please see where in the Methods both the title and all references to “bone resorption” in the method description have now been changed to “mineral resorption”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) In several figures, it would be more appropriate to correct for multiple comparisons in the statistical analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>- We appreciate this concern. Please see where Fig. 2b,c; Fig. 3 b,c; Fig. 4d; Fig. 5b,d; and Fig. 6d have been reanalyzed using paired one-way ANOVAs corrected for multiple comparisons. Now all data where t-tests are used to evaluate statistical significance are only evaluating differences between 2 values and all experiments considering 3+ values are compared using one-way ANOVAs corrected for multiple comparisons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) Figure 5: Panels D and E are flipped relative to the legend. Please also define the reagent used for ROS signal in the legend.</p></disp-quote><p>- Thank you. D and E are now corrected and we added “(Grey = CellRox Dye)” to the end of the legend for Fig. 5a.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) Supplemental Figure 5c: in the control condition, why are some nuclei not staining with the reduced La antibody?</p></disp-quote><p>- Great question, direct answer – we simply do not know.</p><p>Longer answer, this image is in fact representative and not exclusive to the reduced La antibody (clone 312b). When we look at La staining in mature, multinucleated osteoclast nuclei at later timepoints post fusion using even pan antibodies, we find that its localization to the nuclei of syncytial osteoclasts is not uniform, but that nuclear La preferentially enriches in some mature osteoclast nuclei and seems to be excluded from others. This may suggest that – akin to myonuclei in skeletal muscle – osteoclast nuclei in a syncytium are not all equal. However, we are far, far away from being able to make any conclusions from the data we have.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(13) Figure 7 legend: consider breaking this legend up into multiple sentences.</p></disp-quote><p>- Thank you for the suggestion. The legend for Figure 7 has been rewritten.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Can the authors use the official name of La protein in NCBI GENE and PROTEIN?</p></disp-quote><p>- While some in the field refer to lupus La protein as La protein, we choose to refer to it simply as La, as is common throughout the Lupus La Protein literature. It is our opinion that continuously referring to a protein as a name + the word protein throughout the manuscript is unnecessary and alters the flow of our manuscript’s points.</p><p>Thanks. We have included the official name of human La in NCBI GENE (SSB small RNA binding exonuclease protection factor La, Gene ID 6741, NCBI GENE) into the revised text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The references 26 and 27 are not representative. The pioneering work from Mundy, Chambers, and Almeida (PBMID 2312718, 15528306, and 24781012) should be cited.</p></disp-quote><p>- Thanks. We have added these 3 references to better acknowledge these significant contributions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) It is hard to understand Figure 2. What are the white arrows in Figure 2a pointed to? In Figure 2b, what do the columns a-LA(Red), a-La (Pan), and a-La (Ox) mean, treatment, or staining? Figure 2c, the legend &quot;conditions where surface proteins are oxidized (TCEP) seems to be &quot;deoxidized.</p></disp-quote><p>- We agree. We now realized this legend was rather confusing. It has been edited to read</p><p>“(a) Representative fluorescence and DIC confocal micrographs of primary human osteoclasts following synchronized cell-cell fusion where hemifusion inhibitor was left (Inhibition), removed (Wash) or removed but the α-La antibodies indicated were simultaneously added.</p><p>Cyan=Hoechst Arrows=Multinucleated Osteoclasts (b) Quantification of a.” • Thanks. 2c has now been corrected to “reduced” rather than the errant “oxidized”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) How do authors normalize bone resorption, % of total area?</p></disp-quote><p>- We normalized to a separate, paired well where monocytes are differentiated to precursors (MCSF), but no RANKL is added. We have added this omitted information to the methods sections for our mineral resorption assay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Figure 5. There are two legends (b). In Figure 5c RT-qPCR, the DC-STAMP or OC-STAMP and mature osteoclast marker calcitonin receptor should be included.</p></disp-quote><p>- Thank you. There were several problems with Figure legend 5 that both you and Reviewer #1 brought our attention to. We have now corrected these errors.</p><p>- We understand the Reviewer’s interest in these markers. However, our point is that the steadystate transcript levels of two well recognized osteoclast differentiation factors and the fusion regulator La, which our manuscript focuses on, are not significantly altered by NAC treatment at these later, fusion associated timepoints. While DC-STAMP, OC-STAMP, and Calcitonin would be interesting, we believe they are outside the scope of this manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
