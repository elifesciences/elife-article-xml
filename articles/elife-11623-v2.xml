As these proteins are still being made, they are captured by a “signal recognition particle” (or SRP); this molecular machine then guides the newly forming protein to the cell’s membrane. SRPs are found in all living organisms on Earth and contain several different proteins and a short RNA molecule. However, a few species belonging to the archaeal domain of life did not seem to contain an identifiable gene for the RNA component of the SRP.</p><p>Now Plagens et al. have sought to solve the mystery of the “missing” component of this essential protein-targeting machine.

Further experiments revealed that the correct sequence order is restored in mature SRP RNA molecules by the two ends of the molecule being linked to form a circle. These RNA circles are made by the cellular machinery that normally removes the unneeded sections from other RNA molecules (called transfer RNAs).</p><p>Circular RNA is much more stable at high temperatures and does not degrade easily, and Plagens et al. suggest that this particular arrangement is therefore especially advantageous for this species.

SRP binding can arrest the elongation of nascent peptide chains and targets the ribosome-nascent chain complexes to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (in Eukaryotes) or the plasma membrane (in Bacteria and Archaea). The SRPs consist of one central SRP RNA molecule and different SRP proteins. Eukaryotes harbor six SRP proteins, Bacteria have one SRP protein and archaeal SRPs are formed by an approximately 300 nt long SRP RNA and the two proteins SRP19 and SRP54 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Römisch et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernstein et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhuiyan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cusack et al., 2000</xref>). The SRP RNA is pivotal for the structure and function of all SRPs. Archaeal and eukaryotic SRP RNAs are similar and usually contain eight helical elements that fold into a small Alu-domain and a large S-domain that are connected by an extended linker region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Batey, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gundelfinger et al., 1983</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). SRP19 binds to the tips of helices 6 and 8 in the S-domain, which form strictly conserved tertiary RNA interactions(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hainzl et al., 2002</xref>). The SRP RNA adopts a conformation that exposes a SRP54-binding site in helix 8 (h8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Rose and Weeks, 2001</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). SRP54 is essential for (i) the recognition and binding of the signal sequence at the ribosome, and (ii) for the GTP-dependent interaction with the SRP receptor of the archaeal plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Luirink et al., 1994</xref>). Intriguingly, few species of the archaeal genus <italic>Thermoproteus</italic> (e.g. <italic>Thermoproteus tenax</italic> and <italic>Thermoproteus uzoniensis</italic>) do not contain canonical SRP RNAs and SRP RNA genes are not annotated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Siebers et al., 2011</xref>). Genes encoding standard SRP19 (TTX_2083) and SRP54 (TTX_0615) proteins are present and signal sequences can be identified for secretory proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>).

Subsequently, we searched the sequence reads for minimal conserved SRP RNA features. SRP RNA molecules are highly structured and contain several conserved structural features but only few absolutely conserved sequence segments. These sequences include a conserved SRP54 binding motif in helix 8b and a GNAR tetraloop motif connecting helix 6. We identified these short motifs in an intergenic region between the genes TTX_0683 (pyruvate phosphate dikinase [ppdK]) and TTX_0684 (protein phosphatase [ppa]). The prediction of RNA folding for this intergenic sequence revealed a high potential for extended helical regions, which prompted us to analyze this region in more detail. We utilized the obtained RNA-Seq reads to identify the 5'- and 3'-termini of a 309 nt long highly structured RNA transcript. The alignment of this RNA molecule with other archaeal SRP RNA molecules that are annotated in the SRP database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Rosenblad, 2003</xref>) highlighted the presence of several conserved structural features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, the location of the 5'- and 3'-termini of this newly discovered SRP RNA was shifted from the standard location in helix 1 in the small Alu-domain to a region close to a functionally important loop in the large S-domain. This indicates that <italic>Thermoproteus</italic> species with ‘missing’ SRP RNA genes contain permuted SRP RNA sequences in which the transcripts’ termini have been shifted by over 100 nucleotides and the order of sequence motifs has been rearranged. We identified a similar permuted SRP RNA gene in <italic>T. uzoniensis</italic> and noticed that nucleic acid sequence variations do not occur in conserved regions of the SRP RNA and in most cases do not disrupt the structure of the SRP RNA (i.e. G-C base pairs are replaced by G-U or A-U basepairs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Sequence reads that mapped to the termini regions of the <italic>T. tenax</italic> SRP RNA revealed unmapped parts consisting of sequences of the distant end, which indicates that these reads span ligated 5'-and 3'-termini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The observed ligation sites are identical and restore the loop at the tip of helix 8 in the permuted SRP RNA. Thus, mature SRP RNAs exist as circular molecules. The RNA-Seq reads also revealed that SRP RNA precursor transcripts contain a 23 nt long leader sequence upstream of the ligated mature 5'-termini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). A TATA box promoter element (5′-TTAATA-3′) is present 26 nt upstream of the transcription start site in both <italic>T. tenax</italic> and <italic>T. uzoniensis</italic>. Additionally, we detected a C/D box sRNA gene adjacent of the permuted SRP RNA gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Northern Blot analyses verified the presence of the SRP in <italic>T. tenax</italic> total RNA preparations, and revealed three distinct bands that were reproduced with two different probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Full-length in vitro transcripts of the SRP RNA (linear and circularized with T4 RNA ligase) were run as size markers. The observed migration of this highly structured transcript was identical to the total RNA signal and suggests that the two prominent bands represent the circular form of the SRP RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11623.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Identification of a permuted circular SRP RNA.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Illumina Hiseq2000 example reads are mapped to the <italic>T. tenax</italic> reference genome (top sequence) and indicate the transcription start site (TSS) of SRP RNA precursors or contain the circularization junction.

DEAE binding assays supported the presence of standard SRP protein recruitment.

We investigated both sites in more detail. The canonical termini of archaeal SRP RNA molecules are located in helix 1 of the small Alu-domain. This helix is absent in the <italic>T. tenax</italic> SRP RNA. It has been suggested that the main function of this helix is to prevent the unfolding of the SRP RNA under the extreme growth conditions of hyperthermophiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zwieb, 2005</xref>). Thus, the replacement of this helix with a continuous sequence in a circular RNA molecule would provide improved RNA stability and a potential evolutionary advantage. The high stability of circular RNA molecules is also a likely explanation for the observed low RNA-Seq coverage as only few SRP RNA fragments were amenable to adapter ligation during RNA-Seq library preparation.</p><p>The occurrence of RNA termini near the tip of helix 8 is more problematic for the functionality of the SRP RNA. Ligation of these RNA ends guarantees the presence of a canonical loop in this region. However, this ligation reaction requires the presence of clearly defined termini as all sequenced circularization junctions were found to be identical. Thus, we investigated if the observed precursor transcripts might be subjected to endonucleolytic processing to generate mature RNA ends. We observed that the 23 nt long leader sequence of the primary transcript can fold with extended trailer sequences into a so-called bulge helix bulge (BHB) motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). A similar motif is also present at the termini of the permuted <italic>T. uzoniensis</italic> SRP RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). BHB elements are structural motifs found in intron-containing transfer RNAs (tRNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Thompson and Daniels, 1988</xref>). A BHB consists of a central four base pair helix that is flanked by at least one three nt unpaired bulge. These structures are recognized by the tRNA splicing endonuclease that cleaves the bulge sequences and recruits the tRNA ligase RtcB to join the tRNA sequences and circularize the intron sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Popow et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Englert et al., 2011</xref>). The presence of a BHB motif suggests that RtcB could be responsible for SRP RNA circularization, if the <italic>T. tenax</italic> splicing endonuclease specifically recognized the identified BHB motif. It should be noted, that <italic>T. tenax</italic> contains a record number of 48 introns in 46 tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chan and Lowe, 2009</xref>). These introns are processed by a tRNA splicing endonuclease that belongs to a family of heterotetrameric enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Randau et al., 2005</xref>). This family shows the most relaxed BHB substrate recognition mechanism and does not rely on the recognition of tRNA sequences for cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Yoshinari et al., 2009</xref>). We produced recombinant <italic>T. tenax</italic> splicing endonuclease (TTX_1594, catalytic subunit and TTX_1893 structural subunit, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and could verify specific cleavage of the proposed BHB motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

It has been argued that the fragmentation of tRNAs genes can provide a selective advantage during evolution as tRNA genes frequently serve as viral integration sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Randau and Söll, 2008</xref>). The presence of efficient tRNA splicing machinery that can deal with large-scale tRNA intron transposition is required to maintain functionality of a permuted SRP RNA. Thus, it is plausible that permuted SRP RNA genes are derived from an ancestral variant with simple BHB introns. The mechanism of archaeal genome rearrangement events is not known. However, it should be noted that C/D box sRNA genes have previously been observed in the vicinity of split genes and are also located near the permuted SRP RNA gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Randau, 2012</xref>). The potential mobility of C/D box sRNA gene sequences will be subject of future investigations. In conclusion, genome rearrangement events near non-coding RNA genes can result in novel maturation pathways of universal RNA molecules. One example is the observed occurrence of permuted and circularized SRP RNA molecules whose increased stability should provide a selective advantage.</p><sec id="s1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s1-1"><title>Cell culture and RNA preparation</title><p>Cells of <italic>T. tenax</italic> Kra1 (DSM 2078) were a kind gift of R.

To generate the SRP S-domain RNA constructs (WT, Open, GNAR, h8b), two forward and reverse complementary DNA oligonucleotides with 15 bases overhangs were synthesized (Eurofins MWG Operon, Germany <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1B</xref>).

However, RNase R resistance might also be observed for the highly structured linear SRP RNA with its four nucleotide 3’ overhang as it was shown that “duplex RNAs with no overhang or with a 4-nucleotide overhang bind extremely poorly to RNase R and are inactive as substrates”. (Vincent, H.A. and Deutscher, M.P., Substrate recognition and catalysis by the exoribonuclease RNase R, J Biol Chem 2006, 281, 29769-29775). We sequenced the termini ligation site in hundreds of unique reads in independent RNA-Seq datasets (available at GEO database GSE72127) and consider this to be conclusive evidence.</p></body></sub-article></article>
