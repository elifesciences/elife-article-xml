remains unknown. In this study, we developed a new method of observing the fusion of individual late endosomes and lysosomes by using mouse yolk sac visceral endoderm cells that have huge endocytic vesicles. We found that there were two distinct fusion modes that were differently regulated. In homotypic fusion, two late endosomes fused quickly, whereas in heterotypic fusion they fused to lysosomes slowly. Mathematical modeling showed that vesicle size is a critical determinant of these fusion types and that membrane fluctuation forces can overcome the vesicle size effects. We found that actin filaments were bound to late endosomes and forces derived from dynamic actin remodeling were necessary for quick fusion during homotypic fusion. Furthermore, cofilin played a role in endocytic fusion by regulating actin turnover. These data suggest that actin promotes vesicle fusion for efficient membrane trafficking in visceral endoderm cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>late endosome</kwd><kwd>lysosome</kwd><kwd>fusion</kwd><kwd>actin</kwd><kwd>yolk sac visceral endoderm</kwd><kwd>mouse embryo</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI (17024006)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Masu</surname><given-names>Masayuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI (JP22H04926)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koike</surname><given-names>Seiichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007449</institution-id><institution>Takeda Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022039209</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koike</surname><given-names>Seiichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>There are two distinct modes of late endosome fusion in the mouse yolk sac visceral endoderm cells and actin dynamics plays a role in regulating vesicle fusion.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic cells contain numerous organelles that are separated from the cytoplasm by a lipid bilayer. Exchange of proteins, lipids, and metabolites between the organelles occurs through vesicle budding and fusion. To date, theoretical and computer biophysics have modeled several steps in the process of membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chernomordik and Kozlov, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lu and Guo, 2019</xref>). The priming of membranes is followed by the merger of the outer leaflet of the membranes to establish a hemifusion stalk. The stalk then expands into a hemifusion diaphragm and the merger of the inner leaflets leads to the formation of a fusion pore, which expands and allows content mixing. Recently, the hemifusion stage was observed in live cells, providing strong evidence of the hemifusion model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Studies utilizing time-lapse microscopic observation of live cells, however, have revealed that membrane behavior after pore formation is unexpectedly divergent. For example, in giant endosomal vesicles in cells overexpressing constitutively active Rab5 protein, two different types of membrane fusion were observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Roberts et al., 1999</xref>). In ‘explosive’ fusion, which is commonly seen in cells, the fusion pore expanded quickly. In contrast, in ‘bridge’ fusion, the pore did not expand; instead, one vesicle gradually shrank and disappeared over time as the result of the transfer of its vesicle content into another vesicle. In homotypic vacuole fusion in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae,</italic> vacuole membranes fused at the vertices instead of a central pore expanding radially, and then a boundary membrane between the two docked vacuoles was released into the vacuole lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2002</xref>). Because pore dynamics determine the rate of content mixing, they have significant effects on the trafficking efficiency of cargo molecules. However, how different modes of membrane deformation are induced and whether the distinct fusion modes are exchangeable remain unknown.</p><p>Membrane deformation is generally controlled by membrane-associating proteins as well as by several physical parameters including the vesicle volume, membrane area, bending energy, and osmotic energy in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Farsad and De Camilli, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lipowsky, 1991</xref>). Actin and its regulating proteins, via interaction with the membrane, exert physical forces on and cause fluctuation in the membrane, which eventually leads to membrane deformation by modification of the physical parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Salbreux et al., 2012</xref>). Actin produces forces in two different manners. First, assembly of branched actin filaments, nucleated from the membrane surface by actin nucleators such as the actin-related protein 2/3 (Arp2/3) complex and formins, provides pushing forces on the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goley and Welch, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Svitkina, 2018</xref>). Second, actin generates pulling forces through myosin-driven sliding of actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Svitkina, 2018</xref>). Both forces play roles in induction of membrane deformation during vesicle fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ebrahim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ma et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tran et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Uenishi et al., 2013</xref>). Many experiments have been carried out to elucidate the roles of actin in vesicle fusion through manipulation of actin dynamics by use of specific drugs or gene modifications. These experiments gave rise to different results depending on the experimental conditions. For example, polymerization or stabilization of actin enhanced membrane fusion in some experiments but inhibited it in others (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eitzen, 2003</xref>). These different results imply that the regulation mechanisms of vesicle fusion by actin filaments are more complex than previously assumed. Moreover, how the actin forces contribute to the fusion modes remains unknown, as does how the force generated by actin polymerization or by actin-dependent motor proteins contributes to membrane deformation during fusion.</p><p>In this study, we utilized mouse yolk sac visceral endoderm (VE) cells as a model system for addressing the above questions. VE cells play a critical role in the maternofetal exchange of nutrients before the establishment of a chorioallantoic placenta: they vigorously endocytose maternal proteins, hydrolyze the proteins in lysosomes, and supply the resultant products to the developing embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bielinska et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jollie, 1990</xref>). Reflecting this high endocytic activity, VE cells are characterized by huge endosomal vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bielinska et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kawamura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Koike et al., 2009</xref>). These properties of VE cells enable us to observe endosomal dynamics including vesicle fusion. Previously, by using a whole embryo culture system combined with specific pharmacologic inhibitors for intracellular signaling molecules, we showed that actin dynamics regulated by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptors and the Rho-ROCK-LIM kinase pathway are required for the formation of huge lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Koike et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Here, we show that late endosomes of VE cells exhibit different modes of fusion with target organelles depending on their targets: they undergo homotypic fusion with late endosomes in an explosive fusion-like manner and heterotypic fusion with lysosomes in a bridge fusion-like manner. Our mathematical modeling predicts that the vesicle size is a critical determinant of the fusion types and that membrane perturbation overcomes the size effects. We provide evidence that actin filaments are associated with late endosomes and that actin dynamics generate forces promoting vesicle fusion of endosomes for efficient membrane trafficking.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Endocytic vesicles in mouse yolk sac VE cells</title><p>To visualize endosomal vesicles in yolk sac VE cells, an embryonic day 8.5 (E8.5) whole embryo was labeled with a fluorescent membrane probe, FM1-43, and subsequently stained with organelle markers. The embryo was put on a glass-bottom dish, and VE cells were observed by use of confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These observations revealed that different types of endosomal vesicles were aligned from the apical to the basal area in the supranuclear portion of VE cells, reflecting the repeated fusion and enlargement of vesicles as they migrated deeper into the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). In the most superficial portion (within 0.5–1 μm of the apical surface; designated as zone 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), fuzzy FM1-43 staining was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The small vesicles in this zone were positive for EEA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), indicating that they were early endosomes.

The time course of the numbers of labeled vesicles in each zone showed that endocytosed transferrin was rapidly transported from early endosomes to lysosomes via late endosomes in VE cells, as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Richardson et al., 2000</xref>).

Because a previous paper reported that late endosomes were engulfed by lysosomes in E6.5 mouse VE cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kawamura et al., 2012</xref>), we examined the mechanism of the disappearance of late endosomes in more detail using different approaches. First, we used differential labeling of late endosomes and lysosomes. When whole embryos were incubated with rhodamine-dextran for 20 min and subsequently pulse-labeled with Alexa 488-transferrin for 5 min, lysosomes and late endosomes were labeled with dextran and transferrin, respectively, at the time of observation (15 min after transferrin labeling). In a diminishing late endosome, the fluorescence intensity of transferrin in the vesicle increased initially and then decreased quickly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>). At the same time, the rhodamine-dextran in the adjacent lysosome entered the late endosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>), indicating that the vesicular contents of the late endosomes and lysosomes were mixed. Second, using electron microscopy, we observed pore formation between a late endosome and a lysosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). These data suggest that the disappearance of late endosomes is a consequence of fusion with the underlying lysosomes, but not of engulfment in E8.5 embryos. This type of fusion, so-called bridge fusion, described in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nicot et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Roberts et al., 1999</xref>), occurred as a result of the slow mixing of vesicular contents through a narrow fusion pore. Actually, heterotypic fusion was slower than homotypic fusion and was completed within 90–250 s (154.8±1.4 s, n=25), and the fusion time (the time required from membrane fusion to disappearance of the vesicle) did not correlate with the vesicle size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). The size of the labeled late endosomes at this time point (10.1±8.1 μm<sup>2</sup>, n=256) was larger than that at 5 min after labeling (6.7±6.2 μm<sup>2</sup>, n=242), indicating that larger late endosomes tended to undergo heterotypic fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, see also below). However, the size of the late endosomes that underwent heterotypic fusion (10.2±9.2 μm<sup>2</sup>, n=34) did not differ from that of the total late endosomes at 15 min after labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), indicating that the size of late endosomes is not the sole trigger for heterotypic fusion.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Heterotypic fusion between late endosomes and lysosomes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Time-lapse imaging of VE cells.

According to thermodynamics, the deformation of a physical object proceeds as its free energy decreases. The free energy of a vesicle consists of two terms: bending energy and osmotic energy. The bending energy, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, is the integral of the square of the mean curvature all over the surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Helfrich, 1973</xref>). The osmotic energy is the product of the osmotic pressure difference between the inside and the outside of the vesicle, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mi>Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, and the vesicle volume, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mi>V</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>.

To examine the relationship between actin filaments and endocytic vesicles, actin filaments were visualized by use of Alexa 488-phalloidin. Endocytic vesicles were visualized by immunostaining with anti-mouse IgG because IgG is endocytosed from the maternal tissue in utero and can be stained without incubation of embryos in vitro for the pulse labeling of endosomes. In VE cells, strong signals were detected to be associated with the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). In addition, in zone 1, fuzzy cytoplasmic staining was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), which appeared to correspond to the actin meshwork in the terminal web. In zone 2, small punctates and short filaments were detected in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and were bound to the surface of late endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, B’ and B’’</xref>) and infrequently to lysosomes in zone 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, C’ and C’’</xref>). Optical cross-sectional images and 3D reconstruction showed that several rod-like actin filaments, extending from the apical side of VE cells into the cytoplasm, surrounded and held the late endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–F</xref>). These data indicate that most actin punctates observed in the x-y plane correspond to the cross-sectional images of actin filaments extending in the apical-to-basal direction. In addition, when a fusion protein of an actin-bundling protein, fascin-1, with a red fluorescent protein was expressed in VE cells by electroporation, fascin-1 was highly colocalized with the actin punctates, suggesting that most of the actin punctates surrounding the late endosomes were bundled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Actin filaments are associated with late endosomes in VE cells.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Confocal images of E8.5 mouse embryos stained with Alexa 488-phalloidin and anti-mouse IgG.

Because high levels of actin overexpression led to the deterioration of cell functions (see white arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>), cells expressing low levels of EGFP-actin were selected for analysis: those selected cells were normal in morphology and endocytosis (see white arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Punctate signals of EGFP-actin were seen on the late endosomal membrane similarly to those observed in Alexa 488-phalloidin labeling. Time-lapse imaging showed that some new spots had appeared, others had disappeared, and two actin spots were unified on the membrane surface of endocytic vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). To examine the turnover rate of actin spots in VE cells, we performed fluorescence recovery after a photobleaching (FRAP) assay. After EGFP-actin on a late endosome was photobleached, recovery of its fluorescence was measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Recovery of actin spots on late endosomes occurred more rapidly than the control recovery measured at the cell surface (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 29.0 s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–E</xref>). Especially, the recovery of actin spots in the apical area of late endosomes was faster than in the basal area (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 11.5 s in the apical area vs. t<sub>1/2</sub> = 18.9 s in the basal area; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and E</xref>). These results indicated that actin turnover on the surface of late endosomes was dynamically regulated, with a tendency to be more active in the apical area than in the basal area. The time-lapse images showed that when late endosomes moved in an x-y plane in zone 2, spots of EGFP-actin were always at the rear-end of the endosomes along the moving direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, n=13).

Treatment with cytochalasin D (a cell-permeable inhibitor of actin polymerization) for 5 min significantly changed the distribution of actin filaments. High-resolution imaging analysis using a deconvolution technique showed that phalloidin-positive filamentous structures decreased and instead actin aggregation was observed in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The treatment reduced the frequency of homotypic fusion in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). In addition, it altered the speed and mode of the fusion.

After membrane fusion, two endosomes remained in a peanut shape for a long time, indicating slower neck expansion than that in the control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). FM 1–43 labeling revealed that the membranes were rapidly fused, whereas it took a long time for the gourd-shaped vesicles to form a large round vesicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Furthermore, the total fluorescence intensity of EGFP-actin on late endosomes significantly increased transiently after pore formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>), indicating that actin filaments were polymerized temporarily, not simply distributed differently.

When the fluorescence intensity of Alexa 546-phalloidin- and YFP-cofilin-positive filaments was quantitated along the apical-basal axis of late endosomes in zone 2, cofilin was slightly abundant in the apical region, whereas the phalloidin signal was stronger in the basal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). Note that the possibility that overexpression of YFP-cofilin changed the distribution of actin filaments cannot be excluded. EGFP-actin on a late endosome showed that treatment of E7.5 whole embryos with the S3 peptide (15 μg/ml) for 24 h resulted in a decrease in radially extended actin filaments in the apical area of zone 2, whereas the actin filaments extending along the apical-basal axis appeared unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>).

These results indicate that cofilin distributes with actin filaments on late endosomes and regulates actin dynamics on late endosomes. Finally, the roles of cofilin in late endosomal fusion were investigated. After treatment with the S3 peptide for 24 hr, Alexa 488-transferrin-labeled vesicles were observed by use of time-lapse imaging.

In homotypic fusion, once a membrane pore is formed between two late endosomes, the pore quickly expands and a single fused vesicle is formed. In contrast, in heterotypic fusion, the pore does not expand; instead, the late endosome gradually shrinks and disappears over time as the result of a transfer of its vesicle content into lysosomes. Two different types of actin are associated with the late endosomal membrane in VE cells: the actin filaments that extend along the apical-to-basal axis and the filaments that are radially polymerized from the membrane. Cofilin, an actin-binding protein that severs and depolymerizes actin filaments, activates actin turnover. In the apical region, late endosomes receive squeezing forces via active actin modification by cofilin and Arp2/3, which leads to homotypic fusion in an explosive mode.

Our findings resemble the previous observation that early endosomes were distributed along with actin cables and that Arp2/3-dependent small cloud-like patches protruded from the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Morel et al., 2009</xref>). Actin is reportedly distributed around vesicles in different patterns. In addition to the well-known interaction of vesicles with actin rails in directional vesicle transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Titus, 2018</xref>), actin was localized at the vertex ring in vacuole fusion in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2002</xref>) and entirely surrounded phagosomes in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liebl and Griffiths, 2009</xref>). Advanced microscopy techniques have clarified the fine structure of actin, which is assembled into polyhedron-like lattices around vesicles in exocrine glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ebrahim et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>We observed strong actin signals as patches on late endosomes in the focal planes on confocal microscopy. Three-dimensional reconstruction showed that most of these patches represent the cross-section of rod-shaped actin filaments extending from the apical side into the cytoplasm in VE cells. In addition to these patches, some signals seem to represent actin filaments extending radially from membranes. Furthermore, we showed that Arp3-positive actin spots appeared in the site opposite to that of endosome movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>) like a comet tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goley and Welch, 2006</xref>), that Arp3-positive actin spots were asymmetrically distributed and temporarily polymerized in the distal region during endosomal fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F and G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>), and that Arp2/3 inhibition reduced homotypic fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). These results suggest that radial actin filaments polymerized by Arp2/3 generate force for homotypic fusion in VE cells. This notion is compatible with the findings of previous reports that the radial filaments were nucleated and extended with Arp2/3-dependent branches on the lateral membrane of endosomes to push vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goley and Welch, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Svitkina, 2018</xref>). Given that nucleation and Arp2/3 activities are regulated by nucleation-promoting factors (NPFs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goley and Welch, 2006</xref>), the activity of NPFs and membrane fusion processes are likely tightly linked to accurate membrane fusion. Differential regulation of NPF activity may give rise to different patterns of actin surrounding vesicles and membrane dynamics. Future investigation is necessary to elucidate how the NPF activity is spatially and temporally regulated on membranes.</p><p>Actin filaments distribute on endosomes in various patterns depending on the cell types. However, why cells show different patterns of actin filament distribution on vesicles and whether different distribution patterns of actin filaments have different functions remain unclear. In this study, by taking advantage of the large size of endosomes, we found that there are two different types of actin filament distribution on the surface of late endosomes in VE cells and that these actin filaments regulate different aspects of membrane fusion, movement, and endosomal distribution. Taken together, these data suggest that different patterns of actin filament distribution on vesicles have various effects on specific functions of vesicles.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Actin regulates membrane behavior after pore formation</title><p>In this study, we found that the membranes of late endosomes behave differently depending on the fusion mode. In homotypic fusion, the fusion pore formed between docked endosomal vesicles expanded quickly and the fusion was completed within 20-30 s (explosive fusion, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In contrast, in heterotypic fusion with lysosomes, the pore opened very slowly and late endosomes gradually shrank in diameter and disappeared over 1-2 min (bridge fusion, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Using mathematical modeling, we showed that vesicle size is an important factor determining the fusion mode. When the size of the vesicle becomes larger, the free energy for neck relaxation decreases and the pore is kept small. Our modeling predicted that the late endosomes are large enough to allow bridge fusion to occur, although they exhibit explosive fusion in vivo. Similarly, homotypic fusion in an explosive mode was observed in very large vesicles, such as vacuoles in yeast, endosomal vesicles in coelomocytes of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and secretory granules in the salivary glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Masedunskas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2002</xref>). These observations indicate that vesicle size is not the sole factor determining the fusion mode. Lipid composition, a well-known parameter affecting its bending modulus, is also involved, but the effect on fusion mode may be less dominant when compared with the vesicle size effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Simson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Faizi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ridolfi et al., 2021</xref>). One of the critical factors other than vesicle size that determine the fusion mode is membrane fluctuation. We found that homotypic fusion was converted to bridge-like fusion after cytochalasin D treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), which suggests that actin dynamics around vesicles cause fluctuation and affect the fusion modes. This finding can be successfully explained by introducing minor modifications in our mathematical modeling so that a larger fluctuation can shift the fusion mode from bridge to explosive fusion.</p><p>VE cells vigorously endocytose maternal proteins and supply the digested products to the developing embryo to support embryonic development. This seems to be why VE cells have such huge endosomal and lysosomal vesicles. However, larger vesicle size leads to the reduction in the vesicle fusion speed and subsequent nutrient trafficking efficiency. If vesicle size were the only factor determining the fusion mode, this disadvantage would occur, but if fluctuation is taken into account, it can be overcome, as shown in our mathematical modeling, and the forces generated by actin are thought to be responsible for increasing the rate of vesicular trafficking. This idea is supported by previous reports that knockout mice of actin-related genes (e.g. <italic>Arc</italic> and <italic>Myh9</italic>) showed abnormal VE cells and embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Conti et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>In heterotypic fusion, late endosomes fused with lysosomes in a bridge-like manner. This may be because lysosomes are too large in comparison with late endosomes and actin accumulation on the lysosomal membrane is scarce, resulting in insufficient force of actin for explosive fusion. Bridge fusion was previously observed in live cells only when giant vesicles were artificially generated by gene modification, for example, in endosomes enlarged by expression of constitutively active Rab5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Roberts et al., 1999</xref>) and lysosomes enlarged in the intestinal cells of <italic>ppk-3</italic>-deleted <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nicot et al., 2006</xref>). These findings suggest that the enlargement of these vesicles exceeds the intrinsic forces of actin to induce explosive fusion.</p><p>Like homotypic fusion, heterotypic fusion is also dependent on actin, as shown by reduction in fusion frequency upon cytochalasin D treatment. Intriguingly, in heterotypic fusion, NM II, myosin V, and stabilized actin filaments, but not Arp2/3, were required, indicating a distinct contribution of actin to heterotypic fusion when compared with homotypic fusion. We showed that, consistent with the well-known roles of myosin V in trafficking of lysosomes, ER, melanosomes, and synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hammer and Sellers, 2011</xref>), myosin V facilitates the directional transport of late endosomes towards lysosomes along stabilized actin filaments that serve as a rail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Moreover, our results indicate that NM II, which is primarily responsible for generating contractile force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Svitkina, 2018</xref>), partially contributes to heterotypic fusion. It is well established that NM II facilitates the constriction of the membrane into the plasma membrane after membrane pore formation in exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ebrahim et al., 2019</xref>) in cooperation with actin depolymerization by cofilin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Miklavc et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, our data showed that actomyosin appeared not to form a lattice on the surface of endosomes for the contraction and that cofilin did not show a robust influence on heterotypic fusion. Rather, actin stabilization tended to promote heterotypic fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>). These data suggest that NM II may contribute to heterotypic fusion through a different mechanism from that of exocytosis. NM II is also implicated in the movement of the nucleus along with cell migration, which is akin to a ‘conveyor-belt’ by the sliding of the nuclear membrane along the actin filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gomes et al., 2005</xref>). Further investigation is necessary to elucidate the mechanisms by which NM II transports late endosomes along actin filaments.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Determination of fusion targets</title><p>Late endosomes, which fuse frequently with neighboring late endosomes, shift the target of fusion towards lysosomes. What triggers the transition of the fusion targets? We found that larger endosomes tend to fuse with lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Thus, one possibility is that the larger endosomes located in the basal position have a higher opportunity to fuse with lysosomes than do the smaller endosomes in the more apical portion. However, upon treatment with jasplakinolide, even smaller endosomes distributing in the more apical area underwent heterotypic fusion with lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>), thus suggesting rather that the size and the position of vesicles are not the sole factors and that the different dynamics of actin shift the fusion modes. Furthermore, we showed weaker actin polymerization/depolymerization activity in the basal area as compared with that in the apical area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), a decrease in the frequency of homotypic fusion but not of heterotypic fusion induced by S3 peptide treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F and G</xref>), a decrease in radially extending actin filaments by S3 peptide treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>), and an increase in actin filaments on endosomes in the basal area as compared with in the apical area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). These findings support the notion that cofilin-dependent regulation of actin polymerization/depolymerization may play a critical role in determination of the fusion target. In parallel with VE cells, it was shown that cofilin was specifically distributed in the apical area of epithelial cells and was highly active under the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Morris et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vitriol et al., 2013</xref>).

Furthermore, early endosomes located close to the plasma membrane fuse frequently when compared with late endosomes located at the perinuclear region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gruenberg et al., 1989</xref>). Taken together, higher dynamics of actin filaments regulated by cofilin at the cell peripheral area may increase the fusion frequency in many cells.</p><p>In this study, we developed a method of observing and manipulating late endosomes in VE cells.

Embryos were incubated in 100 nM LysoTracker Red (Molecular Probes) or 12 μM FM 1–43 (Molecular Probes) in 0.1% BSA/DMEM at 37 °C for 5 min. For tracing endocytic vesicles, embryos were incubated with 20 μg/ml Alexa Fluor 488-labeled transferrin (Molecular Probes) or 100 μg/ml dextran rhodamine B 70,000 MW (Molecular Probes) at 37 °C for 5 min.

To test the effects of actin inhibitors, embryos were incubated with 0.01–1 μM cytochalasin D (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.01–1 μM jasplakinolide (Calbiochem), 20 μM CK666 (Calbiochem), 10 μM pentachloropseudilin (AOBIOUS), 10 μM blebbistatin (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 μM MyoVin-1 (Calbiochem), and 10 μM 2,4,6-triiodophenol (Tokyo Chemical Industry) for 5 min, and the same drugs were added to the medium during observation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Image acquisition and analysis</title><p>For high-resolution imaging, the samples on the glass-bottom dish were mounted with ProLong Glass (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Images were captured by use of a TCS SP8 laser confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems) equipped with an HC PL APO CS2 100×/1.40 OIL objective (Leica). Alexa Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 594 dyes were excited at 488 and 594 nm of a supercontinuum white light laser, respectively. The emitted fluorescence was sequentially detected by use of HyD-SMD detectors through a spectral separation module (505–550 nm for Alexa Fluor 488 and 605–700 nm for Alexa Fluor 594). The pinhole size was set at 0.40 Airy units (60.7 μm). The pixel size and <italic>z</italic>-step were set at 45 nm and 182 nm, respectively. The acquired images were processed using the Lightning deconvolution algorithm on LAS-X software (Leica). Three-dimensional reconstructions of the images were carried out on NIS-Elements software (Nikon) or Imaris software (Bitplane).</p><p>An embryo was placed on a glass-bottom dish (No.1S thickness, Matsunami Glass), and confocal fluorescent images were obtained by use of an LSM510 laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with a C-APOCHROMAT 63 x/1.2 W Korr objective lens (Carl Zeiss) and a pinhole set to 1.0 AU. Images of zone 2 and zone 3 were taken by focusing on the z-axis where late endosomes and lysosomes occupied the largest area in the observation field, respectively. To compare endosomal sizes, the area of all intact endosomes in each image was measured by use of Image J. Time-lapse images were obtained by collecting 40 images with time intervals of 5 or 10 s at room temperature. The series of images of the confocal z-stacks were obtained with a lateral resolution of 1024x1024 pixels and a scanning depth of 6–8 μm with 13–17 layers and 0.5 μm intervals. To quantify fusion frequency, the number of membrane fusion events in the 400 s time-lapse images was counted, and the number of fusions per minute a single late endosome underwent was calculated. To compare the time required for single fusion processes, fusion time was defined as follows. For homotypic fusion, fusion time was defined as the time from the start of membrane fusion of two late endosomes until the formation of a single, round vesicle. For heterotypic fusion, fusion time was defined as the time from when the late endosomes began to shrink until they disappeared as the result of absorption by a lysosome.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Electroporation of whole embryos</title><p>The electroporation of whole embryos was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Koike et al., 2009</xref>). An E7.5 embryo was inserted into a small hole of an agarose mold (2% agarose/PBS, 7x7 mm) placed in Hanks buffered saline solution (HBSS). The solution bathing the embryos was then replaced with HBSS containing 2 mg/ml DNA. Three square electric pulses (30 V, 50ms duration, 1 pulse/s) were delivered to the agarose mold by use of an electroporator (CUY21, Nepa Gene) and a 10 mm electrode (CUY650P10, Nepa Gene). After electroporation, the embryo was rinsed with HBSS and cultured as described in the previous section. Rab7, nonmuscle myosin IIA, and myosin Va subcloned into a pEGFP-C2 expression vector (Clontech), Arp3 subcloned into a pEGFP-N1 expression vector (Clontech), fascin-1 subcloned into a pmRFP-C1 expression vector (Clontech), pEGFP-Actin (BD Biosciences), and YFP-cofilin (kind gifts of Dr Kensaku Mizuno) subcloned into the pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech) were used.

The EGFP-actin-electroporated embryo was observed by use of a 63 x objective lens. For the bleaching, an ROI was drawn around a late endosome (4 μm x 4 μm) or cell boundary and was bleached by use of a 488 nm laser beam for 8 bleach iterations at 100% intensity, and fluorescence recovery into the bleached area was monitored. To calculate the percentage of recovery after photobleaching, the intensity profiles for the actin filaments in the bleached area, a background region, and the whole cells were collected. The background was subtracted from all the data, and the intensity of the whole cells was used to correct for fluorescence loss during image acquisition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Electron microscopy</title><p>E8.5 mouse embryos were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde and 2% PFA in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) overnight.

At the onset of the connection, the membrane shape has rotational symmetry for the axis through the centers of the mass of 2 vesicles and the connection point. We assume that the succeeding shape relaxation also holds the rotational symmetry, because some sort of asymmetric force is necessary to violate the rotational symmetry, which is a more complicated problem than can be discussed here.</p><p>For further simplification, we only consider membrane shapes that have a constricted <italic>neck</italic> region, and introduce 2 shape parameters: the neck width, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf61"><mml:mi>w</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, and the area ratio between both sides of the neck, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf62"><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>. The constricted neck region is the trace of the connection event and the time evolution of the 2 parameters expresses the approximate deformation processes of 2 vesicle fusions as follows. Just after fusion, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf63"><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf64"><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the area ratio between the 2 vesicles. The relaxation of the neck (“explosive” fusion) is expressed by the increase in <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf65"><mml:mi>w</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>. The absorption of smaller vesicle by the larger one (“bridge” fusion) is expressed by the decrease in <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf66"><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, while <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf67"><mml:mi>w</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> remains small.</p><p>Membrane shapes confined by the shape parameters still display a variety.

The typical shape must be more energetically stable than atypical shapes having the same shape parameter values. We choose the shape having the minimum free energy as the typical shape.

The mathematical modeling suggests that vesicle size critically influences the mode of fusion. Further investigations reveal that actin filaments are dynamically associated with late endosomal membranes, and are oriented in the x-y plane and along the apical-basal axis. Actin and Arf2/3 were shown to appear at the rear end of the endosomes along the moving direction suggesting polymerization of actin may provide force for the movement of endosomes.

The major issues are outlined below:</p><p>(1) The authors indicate that Zone 1 is within approximately 1 μm of the apical surface. What are the distances of Zone 2 and Zone 3 from this surface? It would be better if the authors could provide an explanation or hypothesis that explains the early endosomes, late endosomes, and lysosomes are not intermixed but separated along the z-axis.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this important issue. Following the comments, we have added an explanation about the depth of early endosomes, late endosomes, and lysosomes to the text (lines 123-124, 127-128, and 130-131). We have also created a new figure showing their positions in VE cells (Figure 1–figure supplement 1B).</p><p>Because endosomes go deeper and mature with repeated fusion and enlargement after endocytosis, early endosomes, late endosomes, and lysosomes are aligned along the z-axis, though the separation is not complete. In confocal microscopic observation, endolysosomal vesicles in VE cells are largely separated into different layers because they are huge and occupy a large space, and as a result, do not exist with much overlap. We have added the explanation to the text (lines 121-122).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors compared the size distribution of the late endosomes that underwent fusion with that of the total late endosomes in the observed area 5 min after labeling (Figure 2C). A similar quantification analysis should also be analyzed 15 min after labeling (Figure 3G).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the appropriate request. We have added the data showing the size distribution of the late endosomes that underwent fusion at 15 min after labeling, to Figure 3G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) While 3D reconstructions of actin filament patterns under normal conditions are presented (Figures 4 E-F), comparable analyses using cells treated with Cytochalasin D, Jasplakinolide, or S3 peptide needs to be performed.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested by the referee, we have performed additional experiments to show 3D reconstructions of actin filaments on late endosomes after pretreatment with cytochalasin D, jasplakinolide, and S3 peptide. We show the data in new figures: Figure 7–figure supplement 1A, Figure 7–figure supplement 2, and Figure 9–figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors should provide a clear description of how they quantified the fusion frequency. Why does the fusion frequency appear very low? Why do Cytochalasin D and jasplakinolide show different effects on heterotypic fusion?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this important issue. We have added the description of how the fusion frequency was quantified to the Materials and Methods (lines 643-645). Briefly, we counted the number of membrane fusion events and the number of late endosomes in the 400-s time-lapse images, and then calculated how many times a single late endosome underwent fusion per minute. The apparent fusion frequency is low because it is expressed in terms of frequency per vesicle per minute.</p><p>As for the different effects of cytochalasin D and jasplakinolide on heterotypic fusion, we already discussed this in the manuscript (lines 537-558). In short, actin filaments extending in the apical-to-basal direction are relatively static and late endosomes receive sliding forces along the apical-basal axis by means of myosins (e.g., myosin V and myosin II) in heterotypic fusion. Thus, depolymerization of actin filaments by cytochalasin D treatment reduces heterotypic fusion, and conversely stabilization of actin filaments by jasplakinolide increases heterotypic fusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The authors need to analyze the distribution of actin filaments during homotypic fusion post-Cytochalasin D treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested by the referee, we have performed additional experiments to show the distribution of actin filaments during homotypic fusion of late endosomes after pretreatment with cytochalasin D. We show the data in a new figure: Figure 7–figure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Clarification is needed on whether overexpressing YFP-Cofilin led to the deterioration of cell functions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comments. As the reviewer pointed out, overexpression of cofilin can change cellular functions and actin architectures in cells (Aizawa et al., 1997; Popow-Wozniak et al., Histochem. Cell Biol., 2012, (138) 725-36). Although we did not observe apparent morphological changes of VE cells after YFP-cofilin expression, we cannot exclude the possibility that YFP-cofilin overexpression affected the distribution of actin filaments. Therefore, we have described this possibility in the text (lines 425-426).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Although the authors report that the S3 peptide does not affect heterotypic fusion, a reduction in average heterotypic fusion frequency post-treatment was detected (Figure 9G). The authors need to perform a statistical analysis of the quantification performed in Figure 9G.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this misleading graph representation. Because S3 peptide treatment did not change the fusion frequency significantly, we simply did not mark statistical significance in the previous graph. To clarify this point, we have added the label “n.s.” (not significant) to Figure 9G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) The authors need to provide the potential functional significance of apically extended actin filaments in positioning late endosomes in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We observed 3 different types of actin filaments in the apical region of VE cells (Figure 5). First, the actin mesh in zone 1, which does not interact directly with late endosomes, may function as a barrier preventing enlarged late endosomes from flowing backward from zone 2 to zone 1. Second, actin filaments extending from the apical to the basal direction on the surface of late endosomes are necessary for the movement of late endosomes toward lysosomes in a myosin-dependent manner. Third, the radial branched filaments on the surface of late endosomes temporarily polymerize in an Arp2/3-dependent manner and regulate the lateral movement of late endosomes. This actin organization coordinately regulates the position of late endosomes. We have added this explanation to the Discussion (lines 483-491).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) What is the effect or physiological significance of the transition in fusion models?</p></disp-quote><p>In material transport in cells, explosive fusion that completes membrane fusion quickly is more efficient and physiologically advantageous than slow bridge fusion. On the other hand, larger vesicle size is more effective in membrane trafficking than smaller size because large vesicles can transport a large amount of cargo molecules. However, as our mathematical modeling predicts, an increase in vesicle size leads to bridge fusion and decreases the transportation rate. Actin forces can resolve these conflicting effects because they convert the fusion mode from bridge to explosive in late endosomes in VE cells</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) I am confused about how to study heterotypic fusion between late endosomes and lysosomes using only transferrin labeling.</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry for any confusion this may have caused. Indeed, at first, we discovered that late endosomes shrank and disappeared after labeling of endocytic vesicles with transferrin only (Figure 3A). However, subsequently, we speculated that this disappearance was the result of heterotypic fusion with lysosomes, and to prove this possibility, we developed a double-labeling method in which late endosomes and lysosomes were labeled with 2 different colors (Figure 3B). In short, VE cells were incubated with dextran rhodamine for 20 min and subsequently pulse-labeled with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled transferrin for 5 min: when VE cells were observed, dextran rhodamine was already transported to lysosomes, whereas Alexa Fluor 488-labeled transferrin was still present in late endosomes, enabling the two vesicles to be observed separately.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) It is concerning that there are several points that are not fully explained regarding microscopic image analysis.</p><p>(a) How were zones 1, 2, and 3 defined and how were the zones determined at each observation? Did the authors determine the zones subjectively based on the approximate size of the vesicles and the passage of time, or statistically by measuring endosomes from images of whole cells? The authors should describe this and also provide the approximate z-directional thickness of each of zones 1, 2, and 3.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this important issue, which is also raised by Reviewer #1. We initially analyzed the distribution and size of early endosomes, late endosomes, and lysosomes in VE cells by use of vesicle-specific markers (Figure 1B). Thereafter, at each observation, we determined the zones based on the characteristic size of the vesicles and time after labeling of endocytic vesicles. Especially, images of zone 2 and zone 3 were taken by focusing on the z-axis where late endosomes and lysosomes occupied the largest area in the optical slice images, respectively (lines 636-639). As for the z-directional thickness of each zone, we have added a description to the text (lines 123-124, 127-128, and 130-131) and also created a new figure showing their positions in VE cells (Figure 1–figure supplement 1A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(b) Regarding &quot;vesicle size&quot; measured from confocal microscopy images: Does &quot;vesicle size&quot; mean surface area or maximum cross-sectional area? In any case, the authors should describe how and what area of the vesicles was measured from the images. The mathematical model used the surface area of the vesicle as a parameter. Better to be consistent.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the important questions. As the reviewer pointed out, the cross-sectional area of endosomes varies depending on the focal plane. To ensure uniformity of the focal plane across different images, we took the images by focusing on the z-axis where late endosomes (zone 2) or lysosomes (zone 3) occupied the largest area in the image. In the focal plane, we measured the size of all intact, unfragmented endosomes. We have now added this explanation to the Method section (lines 636-639).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(c) The authors showed several time-lapse imaging data without a description of what &quot;0 s&quot; is the starting time of. For example, &quot;0 s&quot; in Figures 2A, B, 3A, and B, may have different meanings. Other data should be carefully examined and described.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the inadequate description. As the reviewer pointed out, each panel has a different meaning of &quot;0s.&quot;Therefore, we have added explanation of the meaning of “0s” to the relevant figure legends (Figure 2A, B; Figure 3A, B; Figure 6A, F; Figure 7A, E, F; Figure 8A, Figure 6–figure supplement 1C, Figure 7–figure supplement 1B, Figure 7–figure supplement 3, Figure 7–figure supplement 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(d) The meaning of &quot;fusion time&quot; in Figures 2D and 3F is unclear. Although it was speculated that the authors estimated it from the change in shape of the vesicles, how it was measured should be described.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the inadequate description. To indicate more clearly, we have added an explanation of the &quot;fusion time&quot; to the legend of Figures 2D and 3F (lines 898-899 and line 923, respectively).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The structure of the paragraph starting on line 158 is inappropriate. The authors state in line 159 that &quot;this disappearance appeared to result from fusion of late endosomes with the underlying lysosomes&quot;. However, no hetero-fusion was observed here, only the disappearance of vesicles. The authors should mention that hetero-fusion occurred only after analysis of Figure 3CD.</p><p>This reviewer thinks it is natural to state in this order: first, the disappearance of transferrin-positive vesicles was observed (Figure 3A). Such vesicles became dextran-positive as the transferrin signal began to disappear (Figures 3 B ,C, D). Thus, this is thought to indicate that hetero-fusion has occurred.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer's comment and have rewritten the text following the reviewer's suggestion (lines 163-165, 176-180).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The mathematical model estimated that the vesicle size of 0.22-1.0 [𝜇𝑚2] is the size to switch the fusion mode. Since this is close to the size of endosomes in general cells, the authors may be able to discuss the generality of the fusion mode theory. It is up to the author to respond to this suggestion or not.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comments. As our mathematical model depends on the assumption that the osmotic pressure is constant, late endosomes in VE cells, exhibiting a swollen morphology, may have higher osmotic pressure compared with endosomes in other cells and if so, the predicted vesicle size when the fusion mode switches may differ. Thus, we have decided not to mention the relationship between the vesicle size and fusion mode switching.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) In Line 302 the authors mentioned &quot;These results indicated that actin spots on the surface of late endosomes were dynamically regulated, especially in the apical area.&quot; However, the t-halves of 11.5s and 18.9s are only slightly different and of the same order, so it would be too much to say that dynamic regulation of actin occurs specifically in the apical region from a difference of this magnitude. The authors should weaken their arguments. It would be good to do a statistical test for significance between the FRAP data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this important issue. To highlight the significant difference in the FRAP assay, we have added a new panel showing the statistical analysis of the halftime of recovery of each region of VE cells (Figure 6E). These data indicate that a significance difference in the halftime of recovery (t1/2) between actin spots in the apical and basal regions of zone 2. However, following the reviewer’s comment, we have weakened the description of the FRAP assay results (lines 310-312).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The discussion section is rather redundant. It could be shortened to be more concise instead of repeating the results.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comments. We have shortened the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments</p><p>In Figure 2C, the statistical test method was not described in the legend.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comments. We have added the data of the statistical test to the figure legend of Figure 2C (lines 895-896).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3G does not look like a normal distribution, so the t-test is inappropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comments. We have changed the statistical analysis method and used the Mann-Whitney U test. For the same reason, we have changed the analysis method shown in Figure 2C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is Figure 5D the image of zone 1 because it is close to the apical plane? If so, are the IgG-positive structures early endosomes rather than late endosomes? This seems inconsistent with the data in Figure 1.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comments. The round vesicles observed in this panel are the late endosomes in zone 2. Because most of the internalized fluorescence marker has moved to the late endosomes in zone 2 at this time point (5 min after chasing), early endosomes are not labeled in this image. We have added a dotted line to the x-z axis image (the second top panel) to indicate the depth of the x-y axis image (top panel) in Figure 5D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6B appears to have little or no fluorescence recovery. Is this a typical example? It is also unclear if this is an apical or basal example.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comments. This image is a typical example. We focused on the dot structures on the surface of late endosomes rather than the fluorescence intensity over the entire photobleached area. To prevent misunderstanding, we have added arrowheads to highlight the actin dot structures that we were analyzing. The FRAP data shown in Figure 6B were obtained at the apical region of zone 2. We have also added this information to the figure legend.</p></body></sub-article></article>
