chaperone in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and similar to other Hsp70s, its activity relies on nucleotide- and substrate-controllable docking and undocking of its nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and substrate-binding domain (SBD). However, little is known of specific features of the BiP conformational landscape that tune BiP to its unique tasks and the ER environment. We present methyl NMR analysis of the BiP chaperone cycle that reveals surprising conformational heterogeneity of ATP-bound BiP that distinguishes BiP from its bacterial homologue DnaK. This unusual poise enables gradual post-translational regulation of the BiP chaperone cycle and its chaperone activity by subtle local perturbations at SBD allosteric ‘hotspots’. In particular, BiP inactivation by AMPylation of its SBD does not disturb Hsp70 inter-domain allostery and preserves BiP structure. Instead it relies on a redistribution of the BiP conformational ensemble and stabilization the domain-docked conformation in presence of ADP and ATP.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Hsp70</kwd><kwd>allostery</kwd><kwd>AMPylation</kwd><kwd>methyl NMR</kwd><kwd>domain docking</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/M021874/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhuravleva</surname><given-names>Anastasia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The molecular chaperone BIP from the endoplasmic reticulum is fine-tuned postranslationally through the thermodynamic and kinetic alterations in its conformational ensemble of functionally and structurally distinct physiological forms.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an essential organelle in eukaryotic cells responsible for folding and maturation of the majority of secreted and membrane proteins. An immunoglobulin heavy-chain binding protein (BiP; also known as GRP78 and HSP5A) is the only Hsp70 chaperone in the ER. BiP binds to the majority of unfolded and misfolded proteins in this organelle to promote their folding and prevent aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araki and Nagata, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vincenz-Donnelly and Hipp, 2017</xref>).</p><p>BiP belongs to the highly conserved Hsp70 chaperone family and shares about 60% of its sequence identity with <italic>E. coli</italic> Hsp70 (DnaK) and human cytosolic Hsp70s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2017</xref>).

The SBD, which in turn, is made of a β-sandwich domain (βSBD) and a α-helical lid (αLid), binds to unfolded protein substrates, while the NBD is an ATPase that regulates the affinity of substrate binding to the SBD by using energy from ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mayer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mayer, 2013</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29430.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Two main functional conformations of BiP.</title><p>Ribbon representation of the structure of the ATP-bound BiP (PDB 5e84 [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yang et al., 2015</xref>]), referred as the domain-docked conformation, and ADP-bound, which was modeled from the structures of the isolated NBD (PDB 5evz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hughes et al., 2016</xref>]) and (D) SBD (PDB 5e85 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yang et al., 2015</xref>]) and referred as the domain-undocked (U) conformation.

Our mechanistic understanding of the Hsp70 functional cycle comes mainly from structural and dynamic characterization of bacterial Hsp70, DnaK. In DnaK, ATP binding favors a compact, domain-docked, linker-bound conformation, which has low ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhuravleva et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kityk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Qi et al., 2013</xref>). Substrate binding to this state stabilizes a transient domain-undocked, linker-bound state, which has enhanced ATPase activity, efficient (fast) substrate binding and release kinetics, and low substrate affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhuravleva et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lai et al., 2017</xref>). ATP hydrolysis (converting ATP to ADP), results in stabilization of the domain-undocked, linker-unbound state, which has high substrate affinity, but very slow and inefficient substrate binding and release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertelsen et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Swain et al., 2007</xref>). In turn, ADP-to-ATP exchange converts the chaperone back to the transient ATP- and substrate-bound conformation that results in substrate release in the ATP-bound state so that the entire cycle can start again.</p><p>In the domain-undocked (ADP-bound) conformation, the two Hsp70 domains behave independently and are structurally identical to the isolated NBD and SBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhuravleva et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertelsen et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Swain et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, left). Remarkably, for a number of different Hsp70s, X-ray and NMR structures of the isolated domains (including those for BiP) are almost identical, independent of ligand-bound status and organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mayer and Kityk, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wisniewska et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, recent X-ray structures of ATP-bound DnaK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kityk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Qi et al., 2013</xref>) and human BiP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yang et al., 2015</xref>) revealed only subtle differences in the domain-docked conformation for these two chaperones: In both structures the interdomain linker binds to the NBD; the βSBD and NBD are docked to each other with the αLid detached from the βSBD and interacting with the NBD; whilst the βSBD is opened, making the βSBD pocket solvent accessible and ready to bind to a client protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yang et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, right). Despite this structural similarity, the functional activity of different Hsp70s, including DnaK and BiP, varies very significantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behnke et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonomo et al., 2010</xref>) in response to differences in the protein-folding environment for different Hsp70s and the wide range of variations in substrates and their specificity. Consequently, the fundamental molecular mechanisms that underlie these functional differences without significant structural variations between different Hsp70s remain unknown.</p><p>Growing evidence has suggested that Hsp70 chaperones are extremely flexible in solution and crystallographic data have provided only ‘end-point’ snapshots of the chaperone landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhuravleva et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhuravleva and Gierasch, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhuravleva and Gierasch, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Marcinowski et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhattacharya et al., 2009</xref>). In turn, transitions between these ‘end-point’ states and chaperone conformational dynamics have been recently hypothesized to be key factors that control the Hsp70 functional cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhuravleva et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kityk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhuravleva and Gierasch, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kityk et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, a thermodynamic distribution between different DnaK conformations, and thus its ATPase activity and substrate binding and release, are under precise adjustments by regulatory regions (allosteric ‘hotspots’) that enable regulation of DnaK conformational transitions. Even subtle perturbations (such as amino-acid substitutions or ligand binding) at these allosteric hotspots have been shown to affect and fine-tune the DnaK conformational cycle and adjust its chaperone activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhuravleva et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhuravleva and Gierasch, 2015</xref>). Remarkably, many allosteric hotspots are not fully conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting a plausible molecular mechanism for functional diversity within the Hsp70 family as well as for real-time regulations of Hsp70 activity post-translationally, for example, through covalent modifications and/or interactions with co-chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhuravleva et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kityk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhuravleva and Gierasch, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kityk et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmad et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mapa et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>However, until now our ability to assess this hypothesis has been hampered by limited experimental information on the chaperone cycle of eukaryotic Hsp70s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Marcinowski et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mapa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sikor et al., 2013</xref>). In this study, we addressed this challenge and deployed methyl nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to characterize the allosteric cycle for the ER member of the Hsp70 family BiP. We identified key conformational features that distinguish this ER chaperone from DnaK (and potentially other Hsp70s), and elucidated how the BiP conformational landscape is regulated posttranslationally by AMPylation of its βSBD.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Construct design to ‘trap’ individual steps of the BiP allosteric cycle</title><p>To characterize individual steps of the BiP chaperone cycle, we used ITC to obtain thermodynamic fingerprints of nucleotide binding and induced conformational transitions, as well as methyl NMR to monitor conformational changes with atomistic details (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tugarinov and Kay, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ruschak and Kay, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rosenzweig and Kay, 2014</xref>). All of the experiments were performed using a well-established variant of wild-type (WT) BiP (referred as BiP* in this paper), in which Thr 229 was mutated to Gly to slow down protein ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wei et al., 1995</xref>). This substitution avoids complications for the ATP-bound BiP coming from sample heterogeneity upon ATP hydrolysis and allowed us to ‘trap’ BiP in the ATP-bound conformation. The T229G variant of BiP has been extensively characterized in the literature and retains WT-like conformational features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wei et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wei and Hendershot, 1995</xref>). To monitor BiP conformational changes in the presence of different ligands and distinguish long-range conformational perturbations from local effects of ligand binding, we used the ‘divide-and-conquer’ approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ruschak and Kay, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gelis et al., 2007</xref>) that we had previously adopted for characterization of the <italic>E. coli</italic> BiP homolog DnaK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhuravleva et al., 2012</xref>). To ‘trap’ and characterize individual conformational transitions, we compared full-length (FL), two-domain BiP with its isolated nucleotide-binding domain (T229G variant, referred as NBD*). To elucidate the role of the linker in BiP conformational transitions, we compared the NBD* constructs with and without the interdomain linker (residues 1–417 and residues 1–413, respectively).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Thermodynamic features of the BiP allosteric cycle</title><p>Our ITC data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) showed that nucleotide binding to BiP occurred with weaker µM affinity than for DnaK and in general agreed with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wei and Hendershot, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Macias et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lamb et al., 2006</xref>). In our hands, ATP binding to BiP* was near 7-fold more preferable than ADP binding (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, upon truncation of the interdomain linker and SBD, ATP affinity of the isolated NBD* decreased more than nine times as compared with FL BiP*. However, the truncation of the SBD only (i.e., without the linker truncation) results in a diminished effect (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

When the spectrum of ATP-bound FL BiP* was overlaid with the spectrum of the ATP-bound isolated NBD* (residues 1–413) and isolated SBD, peaks from the isolated NBD and SBD spectra were almost perfectly overlapping with one set of FL peaks. This set of peaks in the FL BiP spectrum was assigned to the ATP-bound domain-undocked (U) conformation. The second set of FL peaks had distinct chemical shifts from those observed in the spectra of the isolated NBD and SBD. This set of peaks was assigned to the ATP-bound domain-docked (D) conformation. To obtain populations of the domain-docked and -undocked BiP conformations, three representative non-overlapping NBD peak doublets were selected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, grey box) and then the ratio of U and D peak intensities was calculated for each doublet (Materials and methods for details).

Such slow motions (and thus a large activation energy of the domain docking process) is not unexpected, given that domain docking is a multistep process that requires very large structural rearrangements (e.g., the αLid displacements are on a scale of ~10 nanometers, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kityk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Qi et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, domain docking in DnaK is a significantly faster process as reported by a characteristic linear peak-walking pattern in DnaK NMR spectra, observed upon the gradual population of the domain-docked conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhuravleva et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Similar to DnaK, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhuravleva et al., 2012</xref>) binding of the model peptide substrate (P2: HTFPAVL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Marcinowski et al., 2011b</xref>]) to ATP-bound BiP* destabilized domain docking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). As demonstrated previously, ATP- and substrate-bound DnaK* (a T199A ATPase deficient variant of DnaK) co-exists as a conformational ensemble of the ADP-like domain-undocked conformation with the interdomain linker exposed to the solvent and a transient linker-bound domain-undocked conformation that enables substrate interaction in the FL chaperone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhuravleva et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lai et al., 2017</xref>). In turn, ATP-induced binding of the inter-domain linker to the DnaK NBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) has been shown to be essential for efficient ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Swain et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vogel et al., 2006</xref>) and domain docking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhuravleva et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lai et al., 2017</xref>). To examine whether ATP also favors linker binding to the BiP NBD, we performed the NMR analysis of two isolated NBD* constructs, NBD*(1-417) that retains the four highly conserved hydrophobic linker residues LVLL, and NBD*(1-413) that does not. Our analysis revealed that ATP-binding to the isolated BiP NBD* affects interdomain linker conformation. Indeed, ATP binding to NBD*(1-417) results in large chemical shift perturbations for the C-terminal linker residue Leu417 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In turn, the comparison of methyl NMR spectra of NBD*(1-417) and NBD*(1-413) in the presence of ADP and ATP revealed that the LVLL linker truncation results in significant chemical shift perturbations for ~25% of isoleucine NBD* residues in the presence of ATP, but not in the presence of ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These results suggested that ATP-induced linker binding alters NBD conformation. Finally, all domain-undocked peaks in the spectrum of ATP-bound FL BiP* were perfectly overlapped with the NBD*(1-413) spectrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, right), while chemical shift perturbations were found when the spectrum of the FL protein was overlaid with the NBD*(1-417) spectrum. Taken together, these observations clearly demonstrate that similar to DnaK, ATP binding to the isolated BiP NBD favors linker interactions with the NBD and the presence of the linker and ATP results in allosteric changes in the NBD. The same two-way communication between the interdomain linker and the nucleotide-binding site was observed for the DnaK NBD, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhuravleva and Gierasch, 2011</xref>) and can be attributed to ATP-induced binding of the interdomain linker to the NBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Indeed, in our hands, AMPylation of WT BiP* was incomplete (~60%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">Figure 5—figure supplement 7</xref>). To achieve sample homogeneity, we also performed the experiments on the V461F BiP* variant, which made AMPyaltion near 100% efficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">Figure 5—figure supplement 7</xref>). While, as discussed above, the V461F substitution itself considerably favores domain docking in the presence (~67%) and in the absence (~49%) of ATP, its AMPylation further stabilizes the domain-docked conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). As a result, AMPylated BiP*-V461F predominantly (&gt;80%) adopts the domain-docked conformation in the presence of either ATP or ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Remarkably, no chemical shift differences were observed in methyl NMR spectra for the peaks corresponding to the BiP domain-docked conformation, regardless either the BiP* or its V461F variant were ATP-bound and non-AMPylated, ATP-bound and AMPylated or ADP-bound and AMPylated. Moreover, then the domain-docked conformation became predominantly populated for the AMPylated V461F variant, the methyl spectra of ADP-bound and ATP-bound conformation were almost identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>), while only a few minor (local) chemical shift perturbations were observed in amide NMR spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). These results are in excellent agreement with the biochemical and structural study of AMPylated BiP, where linker-specific proteolysis and X-ray crystallography was used to demonstrate that, in the absence of ATP, AMPylation stabilizes the structurally same domain-docked BiP conformation that is normally observed upon ATP binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Preissler et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Post-translational fine-tuning of the BiP conformational equilibrium provides the precise thermodynamic control of nucleotide binding</title><p>To examine how perturbations of the domain-docked/undocked equilibrium affects thermodynamics of nucleotide binding, we plotted the free energy of ATP and ADP binding versus the free energy difference between the domain-docked and -undocked conformations (the free energy of docking) for the BiP* (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>) and its AMPylated and non-AMPylated V461F variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata2">Figure 5—source data 2</xref>). Our results demonstrate that stabilization of the domain-docked conformation gradually increases the ADP and ATP binding energy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This correlation between the free energies of domain docking and nucleotide binding can be quantitatively rationalized by considering kinetics and thermodynamics of the multistep ATP-induced conformational transitions in the BiP molecule. The simplest model, in which the BiP co-exists as an ensemble of two thermodynamically distinct states, was suitable to fit the experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In this model the observed binding constant is equal to a population-weighted sum of the nucleotide binding constants for the domain-docked and -undocked conformations. The best agreement with the experimental data was achieved when ATP (ADP) binding constants were 800 nM (7 μM) and 1 nM (1.5 μM) for the domain-undocked and –docked states, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>Intriguingly, while the ADP-bound and ATP-bound domain-docked conformations are structurally almost identical, these two domain-docked conformations are thermodynamically different. First, domain docking dramatically favors only ATP binding, while ADP affinity is significantly less affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Moreover, only ATP but not ADP binding to the AMPylated V461F variant is entropically driven (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata2">Figure 5—source data 2</xref>), suggesting that domain docking is not responsible for the favorable entropic contribution to the free energy of ATP binding. This observation agrees well with the fact that ATP binding to the isolated BiP NBD* is also predominantly entropically driven (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>); but it is quite opposite to what has been previously observed for DnaK(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhuravleva et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhuravleva and Gierasch, 2015</xref>), where ATP-binding largely affects conformational dynamic of the SBD and thus, was entropically driven only for the two-domain protein, but not for the isolated NBD. We speculate that this difference in BiP and DnaK thermodynamics of ATP binding is implied by differences in communication between the NBD subdomains. It has been shown previously that the number of structural elements (i.e., salt bridges and a hydrophobic patch) connecting the NBD subdomains, varies between different Hsp70s and control the Hsp70 rate of nucleotide release (and their chaperone activity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brehmer et al., 2001</xref>). In DnaK, very strong communication between NBD subdomains apparently ‘lock’ the NBD in one ATP-bound conformation and thus, restrict its conformational flexibility. In turn, weaker communication between the BiP NBD subdomains results in the roughness of the NBD conformational landscape and enhanced NBD conformational flexibility in the presence of ATP.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The molecular mechanisms that underlie functional differences between different Hsp70s without significant structural variations between different family members have remained largely unknown. Whilst recent crystallographic descriptions of the ATP-bound states gave an impression that different Hsp70s adopt the same domain-docked and domain-undocked states, growing experimental evidence suggests that in solution each chaperone has a complex conformational landscape and co-exists as a heterogeneous ensemble of several conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhuravleva et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Marcinowski et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mapa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sikor et al., 2013</xref>). In this study, we adopted the methyl NMR ‘divide-and-conquer’ approach to characterize thermodynamic and structural features of the conformational landscape for the ER Hsp70 chaperone BiP.

Similar to DnaK, ATP binding to BiP favors NBD interactions with the interdomain linker and stabilizes domain docking. However, in contrast to DnaK, ATP-bound BiP co-exists in solution as an ensemble of two functional states: the domain-docked conformation (D) and an ADP-like (but ATP-bound) domain-undocked conformation (U), interconverting on the relatively slow (hundred millisecond–sub-second) time-scale. Substrate binding stabilizes the linker-unbound, domain-undocked conformation (U), while a small fraction of the domain-docked conformation (D) also co-exists in solution. Interestingly, interactions between the interdomain linker and NBD are only observed for the isolated NBD or for the domain-docked FL BiP, suggesting that the linker-bound conformation (I) is only transiently populated upon domain undocking. As expected, in the ADP-bound state, BiP adopts the linker-unbound, domain-undocked conformation (U). However, ATP binding is not essential for BiP to adopt the domain-docked conformation. This conformation is significantly populated upon AMPylation or other local perturbations of its βSBD even in the ADP-bound state, indicating that for BiP the linker-bound conformation is transiently populated even in the absence of ATP.</p><p>We hypothesize that the enhanced conformational heterogeneity of BiP enables post-translational regulation of BiP activity and function. Our findings illustrate that local perturbations of the BiP SBD via ‘soft’ single-site amino acid substitutions enable allosteric controlling of the BiP conformational ensemble (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, right). Moreover, the key regulation of BiP activity in vivo by AMPylation of Thr518 relies on the same allosteric mechanism: AMPylation of the SBD domain shifts the conformational equilibrium toward the domain-docked conformation either in the presence of ATP or ADP. This AMPylation-induced stabilization of the domain docking entirely rationalizes the experimentally observed effects of AMPylation on BiP function (Preissler S., Ron D., et al., personal communication, 2017, a co-submitted manuscript). As expected from AMPylation-induced stabilization of the docked state, which is inefficient for ATP hydrolysis and substrate binding, AMPylation promotes fast substrate release and prevents stimulation of ATP-hydrolysis by J-domain containing co-chaperones that observed experimentally by Ron and colleagues. Moreover, our allosteric model also explains enhanced protection of the interdomain linker from proteolysis and linker-promoted oligomerization observed for AMPylated BiP in the presence of both ADP and ATP (Preissler S., Ron D., et al., personal communication, 2017, a co-submitted manuscript).</p><p>Our results demonstrate that local perturbations in the BiP SBD fine-tune the pre-existing conformation ensemble populated upon binding to the certain ligands: For example, in the presence of ATP the I437V and I538V substitutions shift the thermodynamic equilibrium in the ensemble of the equally populated domain-docked and -undocked conformation toward the domain-undocked conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, blue arrows), while the V461F and I526V substitutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) as well as AMPylation of Thr518 favors the domain-docked conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, red arrows). An evident correlation between the free energy of nucleotide binding and domain docking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) validates that populations of the domain-docked and -undocked conformations observed in NMR spectra indeed quantitatively represent thermodynamically relevant conformational distributions in the BiP functional ensemble.</p><p>Intriguingly, local perturbations in the BiP SBD may also overpower conformational effects of nucleotide binding without decoupling of inter-domain and intra-domain allosteric transitions. For example, the V461F substitution and AMPylation of Thr518 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, red arrows) results in significant population of the domain-docked conformation even in the absence of ATP, whilst ATP binding has been previously suggested to be an essential step of domain docking in DnaK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhuravleva et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhuravleva and Gierasch, 2011</xref>). Astonishingly, local SBD perturbations in the BiP SBD preserve the inter-domain allostery in BiP and may also complement each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This possibility to combine effects of different SBD perturbations apparently provides an elegant tactic for the gradual real-time fine-tuning of BiP function <italic>in vivo</italic> by covalent post-translational modifications and interactions with co-chaperones and other members of the ER protein quality control system.</p><p>While mounting evidence suggests that BiP activity is linked to neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer progression and anticancer drug resistance, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schönthal, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dudek et al., 2009</xref>) these tunable properties of the BiP conformational landscape are particularly interesting because they potentially provide new opportunities to develop BiP-specific allosteric drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nussinov and Tsai, 2013</xref>) to enable precise modulations of BiP activity. Our findings also suggest that different members of the Hsp70 family apparently fine-tune their function evolutionally and post-translationally through adjustments of their conformational landscape rather than by altering chaperone structure. More broadly, our findings present experimental evidence that highlights the role of conformational dynamics in allosteric regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wrabl et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guo and Zhou, 2016</xref>) of complex multidomain systems such as molecular chaperones.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Expression and purification of FL BIP and its NBD</title><p>The hamster BiP with a non-cleavable N-terminal 6x-His-tag was cloned into the pET28a vector.

We further assigned two peak doublets using the I145V and I371V single-point mutants. Both residues are located away from the nucleotide-binding site: Ile 145 is located near the NBD-αLid interface and directly reports on domain docking, while Ile 371 is located near the interface between NBD subdomains IIA and IIB, and thus reports on long-range conformational transitions in the NBD. Peak intensities were obtained using the parabolic method implemented in CcpNmr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vranken et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Skinner et al., 2016</xref>).

Hsp70s consist of an N-terminal nucleotide binding domain and a C-terminal substrate binding domain and their activity relies on ATP- and protein substrate-controllable docking and undocking of these domains. Based on a methyl NMR analysis of BiP, this study reveals a surprising conformational heterogeneity of ATP-bound BiP that distinguishes BiP from DnaK. This property allows regulation of the BiP chaperone cycle by post-translational modifications such as AMPylation. Interestingly, BiP inactivation by AMPylation of its substrate binding domain stabilizes the domain-docked conformation independent of the specific nucleotide bound.</p><p>Major point to be addressed in the revised manuscript:</p><p>1) The following important conclusion is not represented in the manuscript, although it is supported by the data: The authors show, for the first time, that the NMR-observed conformations (docked vs. not-docked) are thermodynamically relevant in a quantitative way. This is validating earlier work from the Gierasch and other NMR labs, as well as establishing the base for future work by the authors. This conclusion should be stressed in the revised manuscript. This point refers to the following results:</p><p>&quot;Next, to examine how AMPylation affects thermodynamics of nucleotide binding, we performed ITC measurements for the AMPylated and non-AMPylated V461F BiP* variant. ATP affinity increased from Kd of 800 nM for BiP* (that populated 53% of the domain-docked conformation) to Kd of 210 nM for the V461F variant (66% of the domain-docked conformation), and finally to Kd of 70 nM for the AMPylated V461F BiP (89% of the domain docked conformation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>).&quot;</p><p>Plotting the free energy of ATP binding for these 3 results versus the free energy of the Docking/Undocking percentages results in a very good correlation with a slope of 1.1.

As the reviewers suggested, we added the plot and table that show the correlation between the free energy of ATP binding and the free energy of domain docking for BiP* and its non-AMPylated and AMPylated V461F variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata2">Figure 5—source data 2</xref>) in the revised version of the manuscript). Additionally, we made the same analysis for the free energy of ADP binding. The observed correlation between the free energies of nucleotide binding and domain docking was fitted using a two-state equilibrium model, in which the BiP co-exists as an ensemble of two thermodynamically distinct states, the domain-docked and -undocked. AMPylation and the V461F mutation shift the conformational equilibrium between these two states and thus, tune thermodynamics of nucleotide binding. We added a new Results section: “Post-translational fine-tuning of the BiP conformational equilibrium provides the precise thermodynamic control of nucleotide binding<bold>”</bold> as well as a new Materials and methods section: “Analysis of the thermodynamic linkage between domain docking and nucleotide binding”. As reviewers suggested, we also highlighted the fact that the observed correlation between thermodynamics of nucleotide binding and domain docking validates that BiP conformations observed by NMR indeed represent thermodynamically relevant conformational distributions in the BiP functional ensemble (Discussion, fifth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other questions raised by the reviewers:</p><p>2) Too many figures of chemical shift differences are shown.

Materials and methods: Is the His tag on the C or N terminus? Was it cleaved off?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing this out. In this study all FL BiP and NBD constructs have a noncleavable 6x-His-tag as it has been shown previously that the N-terminal His-tag does not perturb BiP function (Wei &amp; Hendershot., JBC, 270(1995): 26670-26676. We added these details on Materials and methods (subsection “Expression and purification of FL BIP and its NBD”, first paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Re. Discussion: With respect to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.

Fair enough for DnaK, where the entropy gain is much less for binding of ATP to the NBD alone. But not for BiP, where the binding of ATP to the NBD is still dominated by entropy gain. Any suggestions?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers raised a very interesting and important question! We don’t think that the current study provides enough experimental information to unambiguously answer this intriguing question. However, we speculate that weaker communication between NBD subdomains may cause the conformational heterogeneity of the ATP-bound NBD (please see a new Results section “Post-translational fine-tuning of the BiP conformational equilibrium provides the precise thermodynamic control of nucleotide binding”, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Why is the conversion between the D and U states in the ATP-bound conformation slow? Any idea?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this question, we estimated the time-scale of domain docking in BiP using slow exchange limit with the respect to the chemical shift differences between the two conformations. We found that the transition should be significantly slower than 50 ms, which is not completely unexpected, given that domain docking is a multistep process that requires very large structural rearrangements. We discussed this in the revised version of the manuscript: subsection “Conformational features of the BiP allosteric cycle”, third paragraph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Do the authors understand why the population of the U state is so much higher in BiP compared to DnaK?</p></disp-quote><p>It has been previously demonstrated that even subtle (one amino-acid) perturbations in the DnaK sequence can cause very significant redistributions in the chaperone conformational ensemble (Zhuravleva, A., Clerico, E. M. and Gierasch, L. M. Cell 151, 1296-1307(2012)). To this end, one should expect very different populations of the U and D conformations for BiP, which share only ~60% sequence identity with DnaK. Consequently, the differences between DnaK and BiP are likely to rely on a cumulative effect from aminoacid differences between these two Hsp70s. Interestingly, our data revealed that the BiP conformational landscape has not only unique thermodynamic but also kinetic features. Particularly, the transition between the docked and undocked conformations is significantly slower in BiP as compared with DnaK. We described these observations in the revised manuscript, Subsection “Conformational features of the BiP allosteric cycle”, third and last paragraphs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Why is there a perfect resonance overlap in the isolated NBD and FL-BiP spectra in the D state? Wouldn't someone expect that in the docked state some NBD residues would be affected giving rise to different chemical shifts?</p><p>8) How were the D and U states assigned?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. In the presence of ATP, two sets of peaks were observed in the NMR spectrum. For each peak doublet, one peak that overlaps perfectly with the corresponding peak from the spectrum of the isolated NBD, was assigned to the domain-undocked (U) conformation. The almost perfect overlapping between peaks for FL BiP and its isolated NBD suggests that the chemical environment in the FL protein and its isolated domain is very similar. On the contrary, the second peak from the FL doublet had distinct chemical shifts from the corresponding isolated NBD peak. This suggests that the second conformation of the ATP-bound FL BiP is significantly different from the conformation of the isolated NBD. We assigned these peaks to the domain-docked (D) conformation. We modified the Materials and methods (“Analysis of populations of the domain-docked and domain-undocked conformations” in the revised manuscript) and the legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. To further clarify and validate the assignments of the domaindocked and –undocked conformations, we produced the isolated SBD and recorded methyl NMR spectrum for this construct. We made a new version of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>that shows now methyl NMR spectra of two main functional conformations of FL BiP, domain-docked and -undocked, overlaid with the spectra of the isolated NBD and SBD. As expected, the spectra of the isolated NBD and SBD were overlapped almost perfectly with the spectrum of ADP-bound, but not ATP-bound FL BiP. Finally, two of three doublets, which were used to calculate the populations of the domain-docked and -undocked conformations, were assigned to Ile residues 145 and 371 by mutagenesis.</p></body></sub-article></article>
