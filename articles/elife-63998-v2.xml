Here, we show that gut microbe-targeted inhibition of the trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) pathway protects mice against the metabolic disturbances associated with diet-induced obesity (DIO) or leptin deficiency (<italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic>). Small molecule inhibition of the gut microbial enzyme choline TMA-lyase (CutC) does not reduce food intake but is instead associated with alterations in the gut microbiome, improvement in glucose tolerance, and enhanced energy expenditure. We also show that gut microbial CutC inhibition is associated with reorganization of host circadian control of both phosphatidylcholine and energy metabolism. This study underscores the relationship between microbe and host metabolism and provides evidence that gut microbe-derived trimethylamine (TMA) is a key regulator of the host circadian clock. This work also demonstrates that gut microbe-targeted enzyme inhibitors have potential as anti-obesity therapeutics.</p></abstract><kwd-group

residing in the human intestine represent a critical environmental factor that influences virtually all aspects of human health and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brown and Hazen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sonnenburg and Bäckhed, 2016</xref>). Our gut microbiome plays a central role in vital processes such as energy harvest from our diet, entraining our immune system during early life, xenobiotic metabolism, and the production of a diverse array of small molecule metabolites that are essential to human life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brown and Hazen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sonnenburg and Bäckhed, 2016</xref>). Although the microbiome field has uncovered many correlative relationships with human health and disease, there are few examples whereby alterations in the gut microbiome have been causally linked. One of the earliest relationships established between gut microbes and human disease was the link between alterations in gut microbial phyla (Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes) and obesity susceptibility, and the microbial transplantation studies revealing obesity susceptibility as a transmissible trait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bäckhed et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ley et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Turnbaugh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Turnbaugh et al., 2009</xref>). Specifically, obese mice harbor gut microbial communities with enhanced capacity to harvest energy from indigestible carbohydrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Turnbaugh et al., 2006</xref>), and transplantation of either cecal contents or feces from either obese mice or humans is sufficient to promote obesity and related insulin resistance in germ-free mouse recipients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bäckhed et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ley et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Turnbaugh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Turnbaugh et al., 2009</xref>). There is also accumulating evidence that antibiotic exposure in early life can predispose children to become overweight or obese later in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ajslev et al., 2011</xref>), and antibiotic treatment in mice prior to weaning increases obesity and related insulin resistance in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cho et al., 2012</xref>). It is interesting to note that nearly all diseases where obesity is a predisposing comorbidity (diabetes, liver disease, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and diverse cancers) have been shown to have a clear gut microbiome link (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Canfora et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aron-Wisnewsky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brown and Hazen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Knauf et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Marques et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McQuade et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Although there is now ample evidence that gut microbes play a contributory role in the development of obesity and related metabolic disorders, obesity-targeted drug discovery to this point has focused solely on targets encoded by the human genome. Our knowledge is rapidly expanding regarding what types of microbes are associated with obesity and related disorders, including the repertoire of microbe-associated molecule patterns they harbor and the vast array of metabolites that they produce. However, there are very few examples where this information has been leveraged into therapeutic strategies. The microbiome-targeted therapeutic field has primarily focused on either prebiotic or probiotic approaches, yet thus far these approaches have resulted in very modest or non-significant effects in obesity-related disorders in human studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aron-Wisnewsky et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asgharian et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Reijnders et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Madjd et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Koutnikova et al., 2019</xref>). As an alternative microbiome-targeted approach, we and others have begun developing non-lethal selective small molecule inhibitors of bacterial enzymes with the hopes of reducing levels of disease-associated microbial metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Roberts et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gupta et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Organ et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Orman et al., 2019</xref>). We have recently shown that small molecule inhibition of the gut microbial transformation of choline into trimethylamine (TMA), the initial and rate-limiting step in trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wang et al., 2011</xref>), can significantly reduce atherosclerosis, thrombosis, and adverse ventricular and kidney remodeling in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Roberts et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gupta et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Organ et al., 2020</xref>). Since 2011 the gut microbe-associated TMAO pathway has been associated with many human diseases associated with obesity including atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Koeth et al., 2013</xref>), thrombosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>), chronic kidney disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bell et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tang et al., 2015</xref>), heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Trøseid et al., 2015</xref>), cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bae et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Xu et al., 2015</xref>), and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Miao et al., 2015</xref>). Given the fact that obesity is a comorbidity in all of these human diseases, here we set out to determine whether selective small molecule inhibition of the gut microbial choline transformation into TMA, a metabolic activity catalyzed by the microbial choline TMA lyase CutC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Craciun and Balskus, 2012</xref>), can protect against metabolic disturbance in preclinical mouse models of obesity. Although there is clear evidence that TMAO can directly impact cell signaling in host platelets and immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Seldin et al., 2016</xref>), it is still incompletely understood how the TMAO pathway is mechanistically linked to obesity-related cardiometabolic diseases. It is well appreciated that manipulation of the gut microbiome can impact obesity in part via rewiring of the host circadian clock, and reciprocally it has been shown that an intact circadian clock in the host can impact oscillatory behavior of gut microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Org et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Seldin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Thaiss et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liang et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we hypothesized that gut microbe-driven TMA production may serve as a high fat diet (HFD)-induced signal that integrates diet-microbe-host interactions to shape obesity-related circadian dysfunction and metabolic disturbance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Microbial choline TMA lyase inhibition protects mice from obesity development</title><p>To assess whether small molecule inhibition of gut microbial TMA production can protect mice from obesity, we treated mice with the non-lethal mechanism-based bacterial choline TMA lyase inhibitor iodomethylcholine (IMC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Roberts et al., 2018</xref>). This small molecule inhibitor exhibits potent in vivo inhibition of the gut microbial choline TMA lyase enzyme CutC, lowering host plasma TMAO levels &gt;90% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Roberts et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gupta et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Organ et al., 2020</xref>). Designed as a suicide substrate mechanism-based inhibitor, past studies reveal that the vast majority of IMC is retained in bacteria and excreted in the feces with limited systemic exposure of the drug in the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Roberts et al., 2018</xref>). When administered in an HFD, IMC effectively reduces levels of both the primary product of CutC TMA and the host liver-derived co-metabolite TMAO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a and b</xref>). IMC was effective in blunting diet-induced obesity (DIO) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), without altering food intake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). DIO mice treated with IMC also showed improvements in glucose tolerance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>), exhibited marked reductions in plasma insulin levels in fed mice but not under fasting conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>) and had significant reductions in fat mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>,d). It is important to note that the ability of IMC to reduce adiposity was specific to high fat feeding and was not seen in low fat-fed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>,d). Also, IMC treatment did not significantly alter intestinal fatty acid absorption or hepatic steatosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref>,f and 3). Next, we administered IMC to hyperphagic leptin-deficient (<italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic>) mice in a chow-based diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g–l</xref>). As expected, IMC effectively lowered both TMA and TMAO levels in <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g and h</xref>). Quite unexpectedly, IMC dramatically protected <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> mice from body weight gain, where some of the drug-treated mice were 15–20 g lighter than control <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>). Notably, IMC-driven protection from obesity was not associated with decreased food intake, which was paradoxically higher overall in IMC-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j</xref>). Instead, IMC treatment promoted large increases in energy expenditure through both the light and dark cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1l</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4a-c</xref>) Although IMC effectively reduced body weight and adiposity in <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> mice, this was not associated with improvements in glucose tolerance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1k</xref>). Given these striking results in DIO and <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> obesity progression models, we next wanted to determine if IMC could likewise provide obesity protection in mice with established obesity (i.e., a treatment regimen). To test this, we fed C57BL/6 J mice HFD for 6 weeks to allow for mice to reach obese conditions (body weights ranging from 35 to 40 g) and then initiated IMC treatment. Although IMC did not promote weight loss, it did effectively reduce the trajectory of weight gain and improved glucose tolerance in this obesity treatment model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4d, f</xref>). During the early phases of this obesity treatment study, IMC-treated mice again exhibited unexpected increased food intake compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4e</xref>). It is important to note that long-term IMC treatment did not promote either liver or renal toxicity, as shown by normal plasma enzyme levels as well as normal tissue histology in liver and adipose depots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5a-e</xref>). To more comprehensively understand the global effects of choline TMA lyase inhibition on white adipose tissue (WAT) gene expression, we performed unbiased RNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4g-j</xref>). Principal coordinate analysis (PCA) of RNA expression profiles showed clear separation of adipose gene expression between HFD control vs. HFD with IMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4g</xref>). The most differentially expressed genes altered by IMC were enriched in common pathways of adipogenesis, fatty acid metabolism, inflammation, and cytokine signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4i</xref>). Collectively, these data demonstrate that gut microbe-targeted choline TMA lyase inhibition can protect mice from obesity and selectively reorganize host adipose tissue gene expression.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Small molecule choline trimethylamine (TMA) lyase inhibition improves obesity.</title><p>Panels (<bold>a–f</bold>) and (<bold>g–l</bold>) represent data from control and iodomethylcholine (IMC)-treated high fat diet (HFD)-fed and <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> mice (chow-fed), respectively.

Therefore, we next examined whether IMC treatment was associated with alterations in choline utilizers and other members of the gut microbiome community that may contribute to improvement in obesity-related metabolic disturbances. IMC treatment in HFD-fed mice resulted in significant restructuring of the cecal microbiome at every taxonomic level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–e</xref>). PCA of microbial taxa revealed distinct clusters, indicating that IMC promoted restructuring of the cecal microbiome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). At the phylum level, HFD-fed IMC-treated mice had large increases in Verrucomicrobia and Bacteroidetes, and significant reductions in Firmicutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b and c</xref>). Of note, the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes, which has been correlated with obesity in both humans and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bäckhed et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ley et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Turnbaugh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Turnbaugh et al., 2009</xref>), is significantly reduced by IMC treatment of the HFD-fed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Performance of linear discriminant analysis coupled with effect size measurements (LEfSe analysis) revealed that IMC promoted significant reductions in the proportions of the taxa Desulfovibrionaceae, Butyrovibrio, Bilophia, Peptococcaceae, and Dorea, and increases in Odoribacter, Roseburia, and several members of the Clostridiaceae family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). We also examined whether the proportions of cecal genera were significantly correlated with plasma TMA, body weight, and glucose tolerance in DIO mice, and found that increases in <italic>Akkermansia</italic> and reductions in <italic>Bilophila</italic> were significantly correlated with plasma TMA level, and similar yet non-significant trends were found with body weight and glucose tolerance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). Remarkably, IMC rapidly reorganized the gut microbiome within 48 hr of the first drug exposure, and similar changes were seen after 6 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a, b</xref>) and a chronic treatment of 20 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Similar to HFD-fed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–e</xref>), IMC also significantly altered the cecal microbiome in <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f-i</xref>).

In this circadian study, IMC treatment effectively lowered circulating TMA and TMAO at every time point, yet there were still highly rhythmic low levels of plasma TMA and TMAO observed, possibly originating from microbial metabolism of non-choline (i.e., carnitine, γ-butyrobetaine, betaine, trimethyllysine) nutrient sources via microbial enzymes that are not inhibited by IMC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wallrabenstein et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a, d</xref>).

It is tempting to speculate that the circadian oscillations in skeletal muscle are highly drug responsive due in part to the fact that the TMA receptor <italic>Taar5</italic> oscillates there (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c, d</xref>) to sense TMA and is not a ‘direct’ result of IMC per se, but rather an effect of IMC on gut microbial production of TMA. Critically, IMC does not alter the expression of core clock genes in areas of the central nervous system like the olfactory bulb where <italic>Taar5</italic> is abundantly expressed throughout the day and does not oscillate diurnally. Also, in mice fed a HFD to induce obesity, we found that IMC treatment significantly altered the oscillatory patterns of key host metabolic hormones insulin, leptin, and adiponectin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2a-c</xref>), which is likely to play a modulatory role in downstream lipid metabolic phenotypes.

These reports show that even at the phylum level, bacterial communities oscillate in a highly circadian manner, and gut microbe community oscillation can impact host metabolic rhythms that are linked to human disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Org et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Seldin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Thaiss et al., 2014</xref>). However, there is almost nothing known regarding what regulates this diurnal rhythm in gut microbial communities. Here, we demonstrate that microbial production of TMA, as modulated by the choline TMA lyase inhibitor IMC, has striking effects on circadian oscillations in gut microbial communities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a-c</xref>). PCA revealed distinct group clusters, indicating that IMC promoted restructuring of the cecal microbial community composition in a circadian manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>).

Collectively, these data demonstrate that gut microbial production of TMA may be an important cue to impact the diurnal oscillations in gut microbial community structure and metabolic function in the host.</p><p>To understand how choline TMA lyase inhibition altered host metabolic processes in an unbiased way, we performed untargeted plasma metabolomics across a 24 hr period in IMC-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This large circadian metabolomics dataset was initially evaluated for any large-scale trends utilizing selective paired ion contrast analysis (SPICA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liu et al., 2019</xref>) to identify key zeitgeber (ZT) time points where IMC elicited the most significant alterations in the plasma metabolome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). SPICA was utilized based on its unique ability to highlight subtle changes in the metabolome via analysis of metabolite pairs, which vastly reduces normalization issues endemic to mass spectrometry derived small molecule datasets (i.e., untargeted metabolomics). This approach delivers a more comprehensive picture of the overall metabolomic signature in TMA-regulated host circadian clock compared to the traditional single-metabolite oriented metabolomic data tools. Although there were clear IMC-induced metabolomic alterations at every time point, the most significant alterations were seen during the ZT10 to ZT14 transition, which coincides with the light to dark transition when mice typically begin to forage for food. Focusing on the ZT14 time point, we observed a large number of differentially abundant metabolites in the IMC-treated group that were in common pathways of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, phase II conjugation, and other various macronutrient metabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b and c</xref>). In particular, we found that choline TMA lyase inhibition was associated with alterations in diurnal rhythms of phosphatidylcholine (PC) co-metabolites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). Gut microbial TMA lyase inhibition caused near-complete circadian phase shifts for two PC species (16:0/22:6 and 18:1/18:1), and two saturated species (16:0 and 18:0) of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), which showed robust oscillatory behavior distinct from control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). Furthermore, we found that the oscillatory behavior of genes involved in PC synthesis including choline kinase α (CKα) and phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase (PEMT) were significantly altered in TMA lyase inhibited mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b, d</xref>). It is important to note that IMC did not alter key plasma hormones (corticosterone or insulin) or lipids (non-esterified fatty acids) that are known to have strong effects on phospholipid metabolism themselves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a, b</xref>).

This paradigm shift in drug discovery is needed in light of the clear and reproducible associations between the gut microbiome and almost every human disease. Now we are faced with both the challenge and opportunity to test whether microbe-targeted therapeutic strategies can improve health in the human metaorganism without negatively impacting the symbiotic relationships that have co-evolved. Although traditional microbiome manipulating approaches such as antibiotics, prebiotics, probiotics, and fecal microbial transplantation have shown their own unique strengths and weaknesses, each of these presents unique challenges particularly for use in chronic diseases such as obesity. As we move toward selective non-lethal small molecule therapeutics, the hope is to have exquisite target selectivity and limited systemic drug exposure given the targets are microbial in nature. This natural progression parallels the paradigm shifts in oncology which have transitioned from broadly cytotoxic chemotherapies to target-selective small molecule and biologics-based therapeutics. Here, we provide the first evidence that a selective non-lethal inhibitor to the microbial choline TMA lyase CutC can have advantageous effects on host energy metabolism, adiposity, and insulin sensitivity. The current study demonstrates that gut microbe-targeted suppression of choline to TMA generation: (1) protects the host from DIO and glucose intolerance, (2) protects <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> mice from obesity, (3) increases energy expenditure and alters the expression of lipid metabolic genes in WAT, and (4) rapidly reorganizes gut microbial communities to reduce the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio and increase abundance of <italic>A. muciniphila</italic>. This study also reveals that nodes within the gut microbial TMAO pathway exhibit circadian oscillatory behavior, and that inhibition of microbial choline to TMA transformation is associated with alterations in: (1) the expression of core clock machinery in metabolic tissues; (2) the diurnal rhythmic behavior of gut microbial communities; and (3) circadian oscillation in choline-containing phospholipids; (4) and that these observations are at least in part transferred in a gnotobiotic context. Collectively, our findings reinforce the notion that the gut microbial TMAO pathway is a strong candidate for therapeutic intervention across a spectrum of obesity-related diseases and have uncovered metaorganismal crosstalk between gut microbe-derived TMA and circadian metabolic oscillations in mice. Interestingly, recent meta-analysis of clinical studies demonstrated that circulating TMAO levels are dose-dependently associated with obesity in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Moreira Júnior et al., 2019</xref>), highlighting the potential translation of this work.</p><p>As drug discovery advances the area of small molecule non-lethal bacterial enzyme inhibitors it is key to understand how these drugs impact microbial ecology in the gut and other microenvironments. As we have previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Roberts et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gupta et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Organ et al., 2020</xref>), IMC treatment does promote a significant remodeling of the cecal microbiome in mice. These IMC-induced alterations occur as early as 1 week (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b, c, e</xref>) and persist even after 20 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). It is important to note that the observed IMC-induced alterations in the gut microbiome are generally expected to be favorable for the host. For instance, IMC lowers the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5b and c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1e</xref>), which is known to be elevated in obese humans and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bäckhed et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ley et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Turnbaugh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Turnbaugh et al., 2009</xref>). Of the taxa that were significantly correlated with circulating TMA levels (<italic>Akkermansia</italic>, <italic>Bilophila</italic>, Clostridiales, and <italic>Allobaculum</italic>), only <italic>Akkermansia</italic> was likewise correlated with body weight in <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>). It is important to note that previous studies have shown favorable effects of <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> in obesity and diabetes, which has prompted its development as a probiotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Miao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Craciun and Balskus, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Everard et al., 2013</xref>). Supplementation with <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> can improve glucose tolerance in obese mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Everard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Org et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, increases in <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> are consistently seen in mice treated with TMA lyase inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Roberts et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gupta et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Organ et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that small molecule inhibition of gut microbial choline TMA lyase may be an alternative means to enrich gut microbiomes with <italic>A. muciniphila</italic>. As small molecule bacterial enzymes inhibitors are developed, it will be extremely important to understand their effects on microbial ecology, and it is expected that some of the favorable effects of these drugs will indeed originate from the restructuring of gut microbiome communities. This is not an uncommon mechanism by which host-targeted drugs impact human health. A recent study showed that nearly a quarter of commonly used host-targeted drugs have microbiome-altering properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Maier et al., 2018</xref>), and in the context of diabetes therapeutics, it is important to note that metformin’s anti-diabetic effects are partially mediated by the drug’s microbiome-altering properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dehghan et al., 2020</xref>). Given the strong association between gut microbiome and obesity and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bäckhed et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ley et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Turnbaugh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Turnbaugh et al., 2009</xref>), it will likely be advantageous to find therapeutics that beneficially remodel the gut microbiome as well as engage either their microbe or host target of interest.</p><p>One burgeoning area of microbe-host crosstalk relevant to human disease is the intersection between gut microbes and host circadian rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Org et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Seldin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Thaiss et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liang et al., 2015</xref>). It is well appreciated that a transcriptional-translational feedback loop (TTFL) exists in mammalian cells to orchestrate an approximately 24 hr oscillatory rhythm in the expression of thousands of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Org et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Seldin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Thaiss et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liang et al., 2015</xref>). The mammalian clock is coordinated by core transcription factors CLOCK and BMAL1, which peak during light phases, and crytochromes (CRYs) and period genes (PERs), which are most active during dark phases. Under normal conditions, the clock regulated TTFL maintains cell autonomous homeostatic responses to environmental ‘zeitgebers’ including light, food, xenobiotics, and exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Org et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Seldin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Thaiss et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liang et al., 2015</xref>). However, disruption of normal circadian rhythms induced by abnormal light exposure, sleep-activity, or eating patterns has been associated with the development of many human diseases including obesity, diabetes, CVD, kidney disease, cancer, and neurological disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Org et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Seldin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Thaiss et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liang et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, ‘chronotherapies’ or therapies that prevent circadian disruption hold promise across a wide spectrum of diseases. Interestingly, it has been discovered that circadian disruption is associated with a marked reorganization of gut microbial communities, and microbial abundance in the gut exhibits circadian rhythmicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Org et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Seldin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Thaiss et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liang et al., 2015</xref>). However, whether gut microbial metabolites contribute to circadian disruption is not well understood. Here, we show that multiple nodes with the metaorganismal TMAO pathway (choline, TMA, <italic>Fmo3</italic>, and <italic>Taar5</italic>) oscillate in a circadian manner, and that inhibition of the choline TMA lyase CutC rewires the host circadian clock itself, circadian rhythms in the cecal microbiome, and clock-driven reorganization of host lipid metabolic processes. The impact of gut microbial choline TMA lyase inhibition on the expression of core clock genes is modest in metabolic tissues such as the liver or WAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b, d</xref>). However, in skeletal muscle where the host TMA receptor <italic>Taar5</italic> exhibits oscillatory behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>), IMC treatment elicits profound alterations in the expression of <italic>Nr1d1</italic> (RevErbα) and cryptochrome 1 (<italic>Cry1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Furthermore, gnotobiotic mice receiving a cecal content transplant from IMC-treated mice had a marked suppression of <italic>Cry1</italic> and <italic>Per2</italic> in the skeletal muscle after 8 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5j</xref>). The oscillatory behavior of the TMA receptor <italic>Taar5</italic> is specific to both skeletal and cardiac muscle, and is not seen in the olfactory bulb where <italic>Taar5</italic> is essential to sense the fish-like odor of TMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Thaiss et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). A recent report demonstrated that TMAO, but not TMA, can bind to and activate the endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress)-related kinase PERK (<italic>Eif2ak3</italic>), and that TMAO binding to PERK regulates the expression of the forkhead transcription factor <italic>Foxo1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chen et al., 2019a</xref>). It is interesting to note that PERK was recently shown to regulate circadian rhythms that support sleep/wake patterns and cancer growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chen et al., 2019b</xref>). We also observed tissue-specific alterations in the circadian expression of <italic>Foxo1</italic> with IMC treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>,d; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5k</xref>). However, additional studies are needed to understand whether the TMAO-PERK-FOXO1 signaling axis is mechanistically linked to oscillatory behavior in metabolism or associated metabolic disease. Additionally, several independent metabolomics studies have found that circulating levels of TMAO exhibit circadian oscillatory behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ly et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beli et al., 2019</xref>). In a similar manner, the expression of flavin-containing monooxygenase enzymes which convert TMA to TMAO are also under direct circadian clock transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Giskeødegård et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bollard et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dixit and Roche, 1984</xref>). Collectively, these emerging data suggest that gut microbe-derived TMA and potentially its metabolic co-metabolite TMAO may be underappreciated microbe-derived signals that impact host circadian rhythms in metabolism. Further studies are now warranted to test whether TMA lyase inhibitors of the host liver TMAO-producing enzyme FMO3 can act as chronotherapies to improve circadian misalignment-associated diseases.</p><p>The metaorganismal TMAO pathway represents only one of many microbial metabolic circuits that have been associated with human disease. Many microbe-associated metabolites such as short chain fatty acids, secondary bile acids, phenolic acids, and polyamines have been associated with many human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brown and Hazen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brown and Hazen, 2018</xref>). In a circadian and/or meal-related manner, gut microbes produce a diverse array of metabolites that reach micromolar to millimolar concentrations in the blood, making the collective gut microbiome an active endocrine organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brown and Hazen, 2015</xref>). Small molecule metabolites are well known to be mediators of signaling interactions in the host, and this work provides evidence that diet-microbe-host metabolic interplay can shape normal diurnal rhythms in metabolism and obesity susceptibility in mice. Our work, along with that of many others, demonstrates clear evidence of bi-directional crosstalk between the gut microbial endocrine organ and host metabolism. As drug discovery advances it will be important to move beyond targets based solely in the human host. This work highlights that non-lethal gut microbe-targeted enzyme inhibitors can serve as effective anti-obesity therapeutics in preclinical animal models and provides proof of concept of a generalizable approach to target metaorganismal crosstalk in other disease contexts. Selective mechanism-based inhibition of bacterial enzymes has the advantage over host targeting given that small molecules can be designed to avoid systemic absorption and exposure, thereby minimizing potential host off-target effects. As shown here with the gut microbial TMAO pathway, it is easy to envision that other microbe-host interactions are mechanistically linked to host disease pathogenesis, serving as the basis for the rational design of microbe-targeted therapeutics that improve human health.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Roberts et al., 2018</xref>). For HFD feeding experiments, C57Bl6/J were maintained on 60% HFD alone or with the addition of 0.06% w/w IMC (D12942 and custom diet D15102401, respectively, Research Diets, Inc). For <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> and circadian studies, mice were maintained on a standardized control chow diet (Envigo diet TD:130104) with or without supplemental with IMC (0.06% w/w) (Envigo diet # 150813). Body weight was measured weekly. Food intake was assessed by weighing the food consumed weekly divided by the number of mice in each cage and normalized to the average body weight. For studies of circadian rhythms, 9-week-old C57Bl6/J male mice were adapted for 2 weeks on a standardized minimal choline chow (Envigo diet # TD.130104) with a strict 12 hr:12 hr light:dark cycle after shipment. Mice were then maintained on standardized chow (Envigo diet # TD.130104) or the same diet supplemented with 0.06% IMC (Envigo diet # 150813). After 7 days, plasma and tissue collection were performed every 4 hs over a 24 hr period. All dark cycle necropsies were performed under red light conditions. In the obesity treatment study paradigm C57Bl6/J mice fed an HFD (Research Diets # D12942) for 6 weeks to establish obesity (body weight &gt;35 g), and after 6 weeks of DIO mice were continued on HFD alone (Research Diets # D12942) or the same HFD-containing IMC (Research Diets #D15102401) for another 10 weeks to test whether IMC can improve obesity-related phenotypes. For studies of the circadian patterns of gene expression and gut microbes, 9-week-old male mice were adapted for 2 weeks on chow with a strict 12 hr:12 hr light:dark cycle after shipment. Mice were randomly housed the 4 mice per cage upon arrival. Mice were then switched to standardized chow with or without 0.06% IMC by random assignment. After 7 days, plasma and tissue collection were performed every 4 hr over a 24 hr period. Sample size estimation was calculated from previous circadian quantitative PCR (qPCR) datasets from our lab. All calculations were at 95% confidence level with a power of 80% and a level of significance set at 5% (two sided), for detecting a true difference in means as stated here. The standard deviation was 0.05 units for liver, requiring a sample size of 4 to detecting a true difference between 2 means 1 and 1.1. The standard deviation of muscle was 0.35 requiring a sample size of 8 to detecting a true difference in means 1 vs. 1.5. The standard deviation in adipose was 0.38 requiring a sample size of 8 to detecting a true difference in means 1 vs. 1.5. Therefore, sample size n = 8 was used as it would be predicted to sensitive enough to detect circadian clock changes 50% of control. All mice were purchased from Jackson Labs and housed in groups of 5 per cage on corn cob bedding on ventilated racks. Before diet and drug treatments were administered, a mix of bedding was collected from all cages and then redistributed equally across all cages to set baseline microbiota diversity in all experimental mice. A minimum of two and up to four cages per condition were used for each experiment to account for cage effects. In the short-term IMC-feeding study to examine kinetic changes in the gut microbiome, 6-week-old male C57Bl/6 mice purchased from Jackson Laboratory were individually housed in cages with pooled bedding from all 16 mice enrolled in the study to normalize their baseline microbiome. Five days later, a baseline fecal sample was collected while the mice were on chow diet. After baseline collection, the mice were placed on either HFD (D12942) or HFD + 0.06% IMC (D15102401), and fecal pellets were collected every 48 hr for 6 days. For the cecal microbial transfer studies shown in Main <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, 4-week-old germ-free B6/N mice were purchased from Charles River and placed on a sterile HFD (D12942, double-irradiated, 1.5× vitamin mix). Two weeks later, the mice were given an oral gavage of 200 mL pooled cecal contents suspended in sterile PBS + 20% glycerol from mice fed either HFD or HFD + 0.06% IMC for 6 days. A second gavage was performed 2 days later to ensure colonization. Gnotobiotic colonized mice were maintained using the Allentown Sentry SPP Cage System (Allentown, NJ) on a 14 hr:10 hr light:dark cycle. To account for potential cage effects, all data points from the kinetic and gntotobiotic 16S rRNA analysis represent mice from different cages. For all studies plasma was collected by cardiac puncture, and liver, WAT, and skeletal muscle was collected, flash-frozen, and stored at –80°C until the time of analysis. All mice harvested at the ZT14 time point underwent 24 hr cold exposure that ended 12 hr prior to necropsy. All mice were maintained in an Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, International-approved animal facility, and all experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and use Committee of the Cleveland Clinic (Approved IACUC protocol numbers 2015–1381, 2018–1941, and 00002499).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Synthesis of IMC iodide</title><p>IMC iodide was prepared using a previously reported method using 2-dimethylethanolamine and diiodomethane as reactants in acetonitrile followed by recrystallization from dry ethanol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Astafev et al., 2017</xref>). <sup>1</sup>H- and <sup>13</sup>C-NMRs of IMC were both consistent with that in the reported literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Astafev et al., 2017</xref>), as well as consistent based on proton and carbon chemical shift assignments indicated below.

Demultiplexed sequences were aligned and clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on their sequence similarity (97% identity) using the SortMeRNA/SumaClust open reference-based OTU picking protocol in QIIME. Representative sequences for each OTU were aligned using PyNAST (a python-based implementation of NAST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hamady et al., 2008</xref>] in QIIME and the Greengenes 11 database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kuczynski et al., 2011</xref>]); 38,826,537 total reads were generated after removal of singleton reads and rare (&lt;0.01% of total reads) OTUs, with an average of 776,531 reads per sample. Samples were rarefied to the depth of the sample with the lowest number of reads (86,941 sequences/sample) for beta diversity assessment only. Beta diversity was assessed using weighted UniFrac in QIIME. Adonis statistical test with 1000 permutations was used to determine the strength and statistical significance of sample groupings.

The samples were then centrifuged at 14,000 <italic>g</italic> for 20 min to precipitate out the protein pellet. The supernatant was recovered and subjected to LC-MS analysis. One-microliter aliquots taken from each sample were pooled and this QC standard was analyzed every 10th injection. The untargeted metabolomics was performed by injecting 7 µL of each sample onto a 10 cm C18 column (Thermo Fisher CA) coupled to a Vanquish UHPLC running at 0.25 mL/min using water and 0.1% formic acid as solvent A and acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid as solvent B. The 15 min gradient used is given below. The Orbitrap Q Exactive HF was operated in positive and negative electrospray ionization modes in different LC-MS runs over a mass range of 50–750 Da using full MS at 120,000 resolution. Data-dependent acquisitions were obtained on the pooled QC sample. The DDA acquisition (DDA) include MS full scans at a resolution of 120,000 and HCD MS/MS scans taken on the top 10 most abundant ions at a resolution of 30,000 with dynamic exclusion of 4.0 s and the apex trigger set at 2.0–4.0 s. The resolution of the MS2 scans were taken at a stepped NCE energy of 20.0, 30.0, and 45.0. XCMS was used to deconvolute the data using 5 ppm consecutive scan error, 5–60 s as minimum and maximum peak width, S/N threshold of 10, and span of 0.2 in positive mode and span of 0.4 in negative mode for retention time correction. The resulting peak table was further analyzed via MetaboLyzer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mak et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, the ion presence threshold was set at 0.7 in each study group. Data were then log-transformed and analyzed for statistical significance via non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-test (FDR-corrected p-value &lt; 0.05). Ions present in just a subset of samples were analyzed as categorical variables for presence status via Fisher’s exact test. All p-values were corrected via the Benjamini-Hochberg step-up procedure for FDR correction. The data was then utilized for PCA, putative identification assignment, and pathway enrichment analysis via KEGG. In this dataset 7665 spectral features were detected, from which 1151 features were putatively assigned an identification in HMDB within a pre-defined 7 ppm m/z error window. Also, the MS/MS spectra of 120 of these features matched with a score of greater than 50–120% unique compounds on the <italic>mzCloud</italic> database. Given the complicated nature of comparing the global metabolome across two treatment groups and six circadian time points, we used an algorithm called SPICA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fernandes et al., 2013</xref>), to reveal subtle differences the plasma metabolome kinetically. Pairwise analysis was conducted between all adjacent time points (ZT2, ZT6, ZT10, ZT14, ZT18, and ZT22) for each treatment group (chow control vs. chow + IMC), resulting in a total of 10 comparisons made (five for chow and five for chow + IMC). Differences in the global plasma metabolome for each pairwise comparison were quantified via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve construction and area under the curve (AUC) calculations via Monte Carlo cross validation procedures in SPICA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fernandes et al., 2013</xref>). This analysis revealed that while all adjacent time points were roughly equally differentiated in the chow control data with an AUC averaging 0.884, this was not the case in the IMC-treated group. The AUC calculated for the IMC-treated group when comparing T10 vs. T14 was much greater than that of the chow-fed control group at the same time points (0.964 vs. 0.869), meaning the differences in the plasma metabolome between these two time points were much more pronounced in the IMC-treated mice compared to chow controls. Furthermore, The AUCs calculated for the subsequent two time point comparisons (T14 vs. T18 and T18 vs. T22) were much lower in the IMC-treated group (0.624 and 0.615, respectively) when compared to the chow control group (0.842 and 0.899, respectively), implying that the T14, T18, and T22 time points were poorly differentiated by IMC treatment. As a result, subsequent data analyses focused on this T10 to T14 transition, which also coincided with when the mice began to eat. The statistically significant positively charged and negatively charged spectral features which were present in more than 70% of the samples at ZT14 are shown in red in the volcano plots of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. These features were then putatively identified in the Human Metabolome and the KEGG databases using their accurate mass-to-charge (m/z) values within a 7 ppm error window. The KEGG annotated pathways associated with these putative metabolites were then identified. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref> represents such KEGG pathways associated with the negatively charged spectral features in this study. This figure displays the KEGG metabolic pathways with the highest statistically significance to which the ions were assigned. The blue and red bars are the unadjusted and the FDR-adjusted −log of p-values, respectively, while the orange line marks the significance threshold.

The authors use a variety of tools to interrogate the mechanistic underpinnings of IMC's impact on host metabolism, and suggest this is in part mediated by IMC-induced shifts in gut microbes that impact circadian outputs. The authors have generated additional data to address the initial set of reviewers' comments. In many cases, the manuscript has been strengthened. However, several points still remain regarding the connection between circadian aspects of the studies surrounding the capacity of IMC to shift circadian rhythms and subsequent metabolic outputs. For instance, many of the studies examining IMC's ability to shift circadian rhythms were performed in chow-fed animals. The meaning of shifts in circadian rhythms in regular chow-fed animals as they pertain to metabolic outputs in lean animals remains puzzling. Identical studies performed in HF-fed mice would clarify several key conclusions the authors are attempting to draw from these data.</p><p>1) Can the authors discuss what the implications are of IMC-induced shifts in circadian gene expression in regular chow-fed mice relative to regular chow untreated counterparts? Given that chow-fed mice aren't obese, the interpretation is a bit unclear regarding the protective metabolic impacts. This is also the case regarding phospholipid profiles presented in Figure 4 – what is the meaning of a 12-hour phase-shift in choline containing phospholipids in already lean animals?</p><p>2) Related to the comment #1, Figure 1—figure supplement 4 contains data where animals were fed HF diet followed by treatment w/ or w/o IMC to test therapeutic capacity – can the authors discuss the circadian aspects of gene expression? Are the phase and amplitude shifts induced by IMC also evident in HF-fed animals?</p><p>3) Despite the response to Reviewers' comments regarding the focus on adipose tissue vs. liver, the focus and findings in muscle are intriguing. Could the authors discuss and quantify the 12-hour phase shift in muscle Taar5 expression? Again, given that chow-fed animals are not obese, it is unclear what the gene expression changes indicate in already lean animals and it would be ideal to show under HF feeding conditions that this change in rhythmicity persists.</p><p>4) Line 279 – 282: The authors make a claim about microbial oscillations, however, the resolution of sample collections every 48 hours is not refined enough to make statements regarding microbial rhythms. It is possible the authors misinterpreted my initial comment regarding the need for 48-hour fecal collections (48-hour fecal collections refer to fecal collections from the same animal every 4 to 6 hours over 2 consecutive LD cycles, rather than fecal samples collected every 48 hours). Further, simply examining ZT2 vs. ZT14 does not provide enough sampling time points to identify rhythms. To truly examine microbial oscillations, resolution needs to be refined to every 4 hours over a 24 hour period at a minimum for cecal contents and every 4 to 6 hours over a 48 hour period for stool. These more resolved data are shown in a high-resolution figure at the end of the manuscript proof on page 81 and is presumably meant to be Figure 2—figure supplement 2 (although the high-resolution images are not labeled with figure #). This high-resolution figure seems to be missing from the figures shown beginning on page 55 of the proof. Can the authors resolve this discrepancy regarding this supplemental figure?</p><p>5) Similar to comment 4, it would be ideal to show that the microbial rhythmicity changes induced by IMC treatment also persist in HF-fed animals and are not just observed under chow-fed conditions.</p><p>6) In reading through the methods, germ-free mice used for conventionalization were maintained under a different light schedule (14:10LD) relative to the conventionally-raised mice (12:12LD). Yet, all animals were harvested at similar timepoints. Can the authors at a minimum, mention this in the discussion as a potential caveat in the interpretation of the data? Further, the authors are drawing broad claims regarding circadian rhythmicity of microbiota as well as host parameters based on two timepoints in the conventionalized study, which is not acceptable. A minimum of 3 timepoints (at least to make the initial claim) are needed to draw conclusions regarding rhythms in gut microbes and host parameters. Suggest softening claims regarding these data as they relate to circadian dynamics.</p><p>7) Regarding the conventionalization study – can the authors provide statistics for the engraftment efficiency relative to the donors? The stacked bars from the donors are shown in panel f in Figure 2—figure supplement 1, but it does not seem like all animals colonized to an equal extent (i.e., conventionalized mice at ZT2 from the HFD CCTx group shown in Figure 5, panel b appear to be missing Blautia). For the mice that were collected at ZT2 vs. ZT14, were all the animals harvested from a single cage? Or were they spread out across cages? This is important for conventionalization, since colonization efficiency can be unique from cage to cage, creating artifacts within a timepoint if not accounted for.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63998.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While each of these datasets is intriguing, they haven't been integrated in such a way to explain the underlying mechanisms responsive for the initial phenotypes.

We agree. To address the concerns raised in Option 1 above, we performed microbiota transplantation studies where we transferred control or IMC-treated mouse cecal contents into naïve germ-free mice and studied the downstream consequences on high fat diet-induced obesity and circadian disruption in re-colonized mice.</p><p>The results of this new study are included in main Figure 5 in the revised manuscript. Transplantion of cecal contents from mice previously treated with the TMA lyase inhibitor IMC was able to transmit reduced adiposity in recipient mice. Furthermore, cecal transplant from IMC-treated mice was also able to reorganize core circadian gene expression in the skeletal muscle of recipient mice. Collectively, our studies demonstrate for the first time that gut microbial TMA(O) production impacts core circadian metabolic pathways and obesity susceptibility in the host. Moreover, these new studies reveal the beneficial effects observed on adiposity and circadian rhythm alterations in the host following inhibition of gut microbial TMA production (i.e. with IMC) can be attributed, in part, to the microbiome altering properties of the drug.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Option 2.

Although the majority of circadian data presented are in chow-fed mice, we include new data in this revision in the high fat-fed cohorts. These data confirm that IMC alters circadian rhythms in metabolism in both chow and high fat-fed mice, and we importantly now show that the ability of IMC to alter host circadian rhythms can be transferred to germ-free mice implicating the gut microbiome in the drug’s anti-obesity effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Can the authors discuss what the implications are of IMC-induced shifts in circadian gene expression in regular chow-fed mice relative to regular chow untreated counterparts?

We performed extensive circadian analysis in a chow-fed cohort simply due to the fact that &gt;99% of all published studies in the literature use rodent chow as a base diet. We feel it is important to include these data in this initial description of IMC circadian links, but we also include new data in this revision showing the IMC can alter circadian oscillations in metabolism in high fat-fed mice (Figure 3—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This is also the case regarding phospholipid profiles presented in Figure 4 – what is the meaning of a 12-hour phase-shift in choline containing phospholipids in already lean animals?</p></disp-quote><p>Due to the complexity of the interorgan crosstalk (gut microbiome, liver, adipose, etc.) in IMC-treated mice, we hesitate to overinterpret the metabolic impact of altered oscillation in phosphatidylcholine (PC) metabolism in this manuscript. In fact, many follow up studies will be required to understand how TMA lyase inhibitors impact PC metabolism throughout the body. Although beyond the scope of this manuscript, we are actively investigating how the gut microbial TMAO pathway can alter hepatic phosphatidylcholine (PC) homeostasis. PC plays many key roles in the liver and systemic distribution of lipids, including its key role in hepatic biliary lipid secretion, very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion, and PC is the major structural lipid in all mammalian cell membranes so can have key roles in lipid signaling and cell function. Therefore in follow up studies, we plan to examine the effect of exogenous TMA and/or TMA lyase drug treatment of biliary lipid section, VLDL production, and cell signaling. However, these are well beyond the scope of this current manuscript. The key new finding from this current work is that TMA lyase inhibition alters the normal circadian oscillations in circulating lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and PC, as well as circadian oscillation in the hepatic gene expression of key PC biosynthetic enzymes (choline kinase a, CKa and phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase, PEMT). It is important to note that we arose at this conclusion using unbiased LC-MS/MS-based metabolomic approaches (i.e. followed unbiased data to our conclusions), and we feel strongly that the PC altering aspect of TMA lyase inhibitors likely play an important role in shaping systemic lipid metabolism. Although we did not do an extensive dive in PC metabolism in high fat diet-fed mice here, we did find that the circadian expression of another PC metabolizing enzyme betaine homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT) was altered in IMC-treated mice. These new data are included in the revised manuscript in Figure 3—figure supplement 2. We have now embarked on follow up studies examining the potential for bacterially-derived TMA to alter circadian rhythms in hepatic PC metabolism via the host GPCR trace amine-associated 5 (TAAR5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Related to the comment #1, Figure 1—figure supplement 4 contains data where animals were fed HF diet followed by treatment w/ or w/o IMC to test therapeutic capacity – can the authors discuss the circadian aspects of gene expression? Are the phase and amplitude shifts induced by IMC also evident in HF-fed animals?</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree with the reviewer’s interest about results from HFD cohorts. We also understand it is relevant for the reviewer to mention HFD studies in several contexts pertaining to this manuscript. Unfortunately, the samples collected for Figure 1 —figure supplement 4 were performed at a single timepoint and therefore cannot be used to address the question above. However, we have provided new data in the revised manuscript showing that IMC can alter circadian fluctuations in circulating metabolic hormones, as well as key metabolic genes in the liver and skeletal muscle (Figure 3—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Despite the response to Reviewers' comments regarding the focus on adipose tissue vs. liver, the focus and findings in muscle are intriguing. Could the authors discuss and quantify the 12-hour phase shift in muscle Taar5 expression? Again, given that chow-fed animals are not obese, it is unclear what the gene expression changes indicate in already lean animals and it would be ideal to show under HF feeding conditions that this change in rhythmicity persists.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that circadian expression of <italic>Taar5</italic> in muscle was an interesting finding, and worth further exploration. We performed cosinor analysis for skeletal muscle <italic>Taar5</italic> gene expression (Figure 3—figure supplement 1 – Panel D). Acrophase shifted from about 20.4 hours in control mice to 0 in mice fed IMC. In the discussion we describe that it is tempting to speculate that the oscillation of muscle Taar5 may be sensitive to the oscillation of serum TMA levels, given that IMC inhibits the levels and oscillation of serum TMA. Also, as described above we have included new data in high fat fed mice, showing that IMC treatment can reorganize plasma hormone levels and circadian gene expression in skeletal muscle (Figure 3—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Line 279 – 282: The authors make a claim about microbial oscillations, however, the resolution of sample collections every 48 hours is not refined enough to make statements regarding microbial rhythms. It is possible the authors misinterpreted my initial comment regarding the need for 48-hour fecal collections (48-hour fecal collections refer to fecal collections from the same animal every 4 to 6 hours over 2 consecutive LD cycles, rather than fecal samples collected every 48 hours).</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed we did misinterpret the original reviewer concern to mean that we should collect feces every 48 hours and perform 16S microbiome analysis. The original comment was “Could the authors perform 48-hour fecal collections – (1) before, (2) early following IMC administration onset, and (3) late following IMC administration onset to show if gut microbiota oscillations observed at baseline pre-administration the same or unique post-administration and before overt metabolic and physiological changes are occurring?” We interpreted to mean “perform 48-hour fecal collections” immediately after the drug was given. Therefore, as requested we performed fecal collections after drug exposure for 4 48-hour time periods. This was not a trivial experiment and quite costly to perform longitudinal 16S sequencing. The resulting data clearly show that drug effect is seen quite rapidly and maintain throughout the time period assayed, which we feel help strengthen some of the microbiome-related conclusions of this work. On top of this experiment performed to be responsive to reviewer concerns, we performed another experiment where cecal microbiome analysis was performed every 4 hours over a 24 hour time course to examine more kinetic changes in the gut microbiome in the same mice (Figure 2—figure supplement 2). Although the mice have been exposed to drug for a week prior to cecum collection, these data clearly show oscillations in gut microbial populations that agrees with other published results, and show that IMC treatment significantly alters the normal circadian oscillations in gut microbial communities. To avoid confusion, we have removed any unintentional claims we may have made concerning microbial oscillation, unless we collected data every 4 hours over a 24-hour period, taking great care not to claim oscillation changes occurred for data measured only at one zeitgeber (ZT) time points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further, simply examining ZT2 vs. ZT14 does not provide enough sampling time points to identify rhythms. To truly examine microbial oscillations, resolution needs to be refined to every 4 hours over a 24 hour period at a minimum for cecal contents and every 4 to 6 hours over a 48 hour period for stool.

The Reviewer suggests “resolution needs to be refined to every 4 hours over a 24 hour period at a minimum for cecal contents.…” In the experiment shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 2 we did exactly this, collecting cecal contents from experimental mice every 4 hours over a 24 hour period. This allowed us to utilize JTK_cycle to analyze the rhythmic oscillation within the gut microbiome.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Similar to comment 4, it would be ideal to show that the microbial rhythmicity changes induced by IMC treatment also persist in HF-fed animals and are not just observed under chow-fed conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We unfortunately did not perform 16S analyses in the high fat diet-fed cohorts treated with IMC, and respectfully suggest that this is beyond the scope of this current manuscript. After last revision the editorial summary stated “Please note that we do not require any additional data or experiments at this time.” We feel strongly that even if these costly data were generated and included they will not dramatically alter any of the interpretations made.

At the Cleveland Clinic, our mouse gnotobiotic facility is maintained on a 14:10 light cycle to maintain a diverse array of germ-free mouse lines. Therefore, we were not afforded the ability to switch the light:dark cycle in an area that serves many different laboratories. Given previous reviewer concerns to establish a gut microbial link to the observed IMC-induced metabolic reorganization, we felt it was imperative to perform a microbiome transfer experiment in germ-free mice under the most rigorous conditions allowed at our institution. The 2-hour light cycle difference is not a particular concern in our case, as we do not compare phase shifts between the germ-free and conventional mice. For us the consistency of the cycle was the critical variable, and in fact find similar alterations in circadian oscillation in host metabolism. We continued to compare ZT2 versus ZT14 in the germ-free mice, because although there were clear IMC-induced metabolomic alterations at every time point, diurnal patterns were the most significant alterations seen, and coincided with the transitions from light to dark phases. Comparing ZT2 versus ZT14 remained relevant and provided data that was sufficient to claim altered gene expression (not oscillations) in a tissue specific manner in alignment with our other studies. Importantly, we have fully disclosed the different light dark cycles in our experiments in our methods section, and have added the following statement in the discussion to address this comment:</p><p>“It is important to note that the cecal microbial transfer experiments into germ-free mice (Figure 5) were on a slightly different light cycle (14:10) compared to all other studies (12:12), which was necessitated by our gnotobiotic facility standard operating procedures. It remains possible that this lighting change may alter some of the circadian and metabolic phenotypes under study.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further, the authors are drawing broad claims regarding circadian rhythmicity of microbiota as well as host parameters based on two timepoints in the conventionalized study, which is not acceptable. A minimum of 3 timepoints (at least to make the initial claim) are needed to draw conclusions regarding rhythms in gut microbes and host parameters. Suggest softening claims regarding these data as they relate to circadian dynamics.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer’s concern and agree the term oscillation should be used correctly. In the revised version here, we only discuss circadian rhythmicity in datasets where at least 6 time points were collected (i.e. samples collected every 4 hours over a consecutive 24-hour period). In the introduction we mention oscillation when describing previous literature. In the results, serum parameters and gene expression data were analyzed every 4-hours for 24-hours and analyzed for oscillations by the cosinor method. Therefore, oscillations in the data could be interpreted. Initial cecal bacterial communities and serum metabolite analyses were also conducted every 4-hours for 24-hours. If experiments were performed at ZT2 and ZT14 we changed any reference oscillation regarding the data. It is important to note that anywhere we make a circadian claim in the paper, at least 6 times points have been collected in the same experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Regarding the conventionalization study – can the authors provide statistics for the engraftment efficiency relative to the donors? The stacked bars from the donors are shown in panel f in Figure 2—figure supplement 1, but it does not seem like all animals colonized to an equal extent (i.e., conventionalized mice at ZT2 from the HFD CCTx group shown in Figure 5, panel b appear to be missing Blautia). For the mice that were collected at ZT2 vs. ZT14, were all the animals harvested from a single cage? Or were they spread out across cages? This is important for conventionalization, since colonization efficiency can be unique from cage to cage, creating artifacts within a timepoint if not accounted for.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concern regarding the engraftment efficiency of donor cecal microbial pools. Due to the oscillatory nature of the gut microbial community, the donor cecal pools used for engraftment only represent a snapshot in time of the microbial community. For this reason, it is not feasible to calculate an exact engraftment efficiency. However, we can determine the engraftment efficiency summed over two timepoints (ZT2 and ZT14) as % donor pool OTUs present in the recipient:</p><table-wrap id="sa2table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Donor Cecal Pool</th><th># Donor OTUs</th><th># Matching Recipient OTUs (ZT2 + ZT14)</th><th>% Engraftment Efficiency</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">HFD</td><td align="left" valign="top">30</td><td align="left" valign="top">29</td><td align="left" valign="top">96.67</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">HFD + IMC</td><td align="left" valign="top">32</td><td align="left" valign="top">26</td><td align="left" valign="top">81.25</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Additionally, the data represented in Figure 5, panel b are relative (not absolute) abundances and consequently, underrepresented OTUs may be excluded from visual representation at any one timepoint. Regarding the possibility of cage effect, all samples sequenced from ZT2 vs. ZT14 gnotobiotic mice were from animals housed in different cages, so can not be attributed to cage effects. We would like to thank the reviewer for bringing this critical point to our attention. We have updated the Methods to reflect this distinction.</p></body></sub-article></article>
