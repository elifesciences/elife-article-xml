In a parasite that must adapt to the regulatory requirements of its multi-host life style, there is a need to adopt additional means to partition the distinct transcriptional signatures of the closely and tandemly arranged stage-specific genes. In this study, we report our findings in <italic>T. gondii</italic> of an m6A-dependent 3’end polyadenylation serving as a transcriptional barrier at these <italic>loci</italic>. We identify the core polyadenylation complex within <italic>T. gondii</italic> and establish CPSF4 as a reader for m6A-modified mRNAs, via a YTH domain within its C-terminus, a feature which is shared with plants. We bring evidence of the specificity of this interaction both biochemically, and by determining the crystal structure at high resolution of the <italic>T. gondii</italic> CPSF4-YTH in complex with an m6A-modified RNA. We show that the loss of m6A, both at the level of its deposition or its recognition is associated with an increase in aberrantly elongated chimeric mRNAs emanating from impaired transcriptional termination, a phenotype previously noticed in the plant model <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. Nanopore direct RNA sequencing shows the occurrence of transcriptional read-through breaching into downstream repressed stage-specific genes, in the absence of either CPSF4 or the m6A RNA methylase components in both <italic>T. gondii</italic> and <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. Taken together, our results shed light on an essential regulatory mechanism coupling the pathways of m6A metabolism directly to the cleavage and polyadenylation processes, one that interestingly seem to serve, in both <italic>T. gondii</italic> and <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, as a guardian against aberrant transcriptional read-throughs.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A member of the phylum <italic>Apicomplexa</italic>, <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> is an obligate parasite that develops and proliferates inside a surrogate host cell and causes toxoplasmosis, a usually mild disease in immunocompetent humans that can turn into a major threat to the unborn and to immunocompromised people for example with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or under chemo- and graft rejection therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Milne et al., 2020</xref>). <italic>T. gondii</italic> has evolved dynamic and robust mechanisms for adapting and regulating its gene expression in response to the distinct external cues from the different host cell environments that the parasite faces throughout its life cycle, as well as to guide developmental transitions that are central to the parasite’s persistence and transmission.</p><p>The parasite therefore faces the challenge of limiting and coordinating its transcriptional potentials in a way to swiftly adjust gene expression to its corresponding developmental requirements. However, the paucity both in numbers and variety of specific transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bozdech et al., 2003</xref>), relatively to the high number of protein-encoding genes, leaves the possibility of alternative mechanisms open. Apicomplexans often display remarkably decondensed states of their chromatin, with limited heterochromatic regions as well as a general transcriptional permissiveness thus underlining the flexibility of the parasite in its dynamic life cycle requirements. A large part of the gene silencing machinery seems to be governed by the action of chromatin shapers, which were assigned significant roles in directing developmental trajectories and sexual commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Farhat et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Waldman et al., 2020</xref>). Along these lines, epigenetic changes are acknowledged as driving regulators of gene expression at the level of transcription. However, the post-transcriptional level of regulation in Apicomplexans seems to be held by complex mechanisms which can be attributed to the apparent episodic absence of correlation between the levels of mRNA and their corresponding proteins at a given stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Holmes et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>While post-transcriptional control of gene expression is critical for development and environmental adaptation, the mechanisms underlying these processes are yet to be uncovered in <italic>Apicomplexa</italic>. In eukaryotes, capping, splicing, and 3′-end processing occur co-transcriptionally on the nascent transcripts produced by RNA polymerase II (Pol-II). Pre-mRNAs are capped at their 5′ ends and polyadenylated at their 3′ ends, and spliced, before being exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. This 3′ end processing is a two-step reaction in which the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) multiprotein complex catalyzes the endonucleolytic cleavage and addition of a poly(A) tail at the 3′ end of the pre-mRNA, a modification necessary for the stability and nuclear export of mature mRNAs.</p><p>Covalent modifications are also commonly found in RNAs and emerge as an alternative way of controlling the processing, stability, localization, and translatability of mRNAs. <italic>N</italic>6-Methyladenosine (m6A) is established as the most abundant epitranscriptomic modification of eukaryotic RNA, occurring preferentially at the conserved RRACH motif (where R = G or A; H = A, C, or U) and accumulating preferentially in 3’ UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Linder et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Parker et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schwartz et al., 2013</xref>). Nuclear-based mRNA m6A deposition is a co-transcriptional event driven by an evolutionarily conserved writer complex grouping a catalytically active m6A methyltransferase (METTL3, methyltransferase-like 3, also known as MT-A70), a second methyltransferase-like protein (METTL14) and the regulatory subunit WTAP (Wilms-tumour-1 associated protein) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Meyer and Jaffrey, 2017</xref>). METTL14 is reported to not hold catalytic activity itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Śledź and Jinek, 2016</xref>), but to facilitate the allosteric activation of METTL3 by providing an RNA-binding scaffold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2016a</xref>). WTAP mediates the localization of the m6A writer complex into nuclear speckles that are enriched in proteins involved in RNA processing and alternative splicing. It also recruits target RNAs, thus indirectly enhancing the catalytic capacity of the writer complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ping et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The disruption of the methyl enzymatic transfer in the course of forming m6A, a process that is mostly catalyzed by the activity of METTL3, has been linked to severe defects in the levels of sporulation and seed development in yeast and plants, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clancy, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schwartz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhong et al., 2008</xref>). Reports recently emerged linking the m6A metabolism to differentiation processes in hematopoietic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2019</xref>) and embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Geula et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2014</xref>), along with attributed roles in certain types of cancer, notably acute myeloid leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barbieri et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vu et al., 2017</xref>) and glioblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cui et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The recognition of the m6A modification is mostly mediated by YT521-B homology domain proteins (YTH domains) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Meyer and Jaffrey, 2017</xref>) where an aromatic cage is thought to recognize the modified RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Luo and Tong, 2014</xref>). Two distinct phylogenetic subfamilies of YTH domain proteins can be distinguished, exemplified by the mammalian YTHDF and YTHDC classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Patil et al., 2018</xref>) which were observed to compartmentalize in the cytoplasm and nucleus, respectively, and to form dedicated sub-compartments through liquid-liquid phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fu and Zhuang, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ries et al., 2019</xref>). These YTH readers preferentially bind methylated RNA and execute regulatory actions at the level of mRNA fate and downstream pathways. In the nucleus, YTHDC1 was shown to enhance mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Xiao et al., 2016</xref>), export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Roundtree et al., 2017</xref>) and degradation. In the cytoplasm, YTHDF proteins have been shown to promote mRNA translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), or conversely, mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zaccara and Jaffrey, 2020</xref>).</p><p>A unique protein arrangement bringing together a C-terminal YTH domain with N-terminal CCCH zinc finger motifs has been detected in apicomplexans, but not exclusively, as it seems to also be conserved in higher plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stevens et al., 2018</xref>). Although this co-occurrence seems to be unique to these species, the zinc finger motifs in question represent the canonical domain found in all eukaryotic counterparts of the CPSF4 (alias CPSF30; cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor subunit 4) proteins. It is worth noting that apicomplexan and plant species have a high number of shared proteins architectures, an evolutionary consequence of an early algae-related endosymbiotic event. An archetype are the plant-like Apetala-2 (AP2) factors, which have a high regulatory potential in apicomplexans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jeninga et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Although the role of m6A in mRNA stability and translation has been well documented, less is known regarding its impact on 3’-end processing, despite its prevalence within mRNA 3’-UTR. In animals, mutants defective in components of the m6A pathway show opposing effects on the choice of alternative polyadenylation (APA) sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kasowitz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yue et al., 2018</xref>). It has been recently revealed in plants, that the adenosines of the consensus polyadenylation signals (PAS) motif consisting of AAUAAA, could themselves be methylated, as a nanopore-based analysis indicated an enrichment of PAS motifs around m6A motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Parker et al., 2020</xref>). A link between the presence of an m6A site and the overrun of the respective proximal PAS by the 3’end processing machinery was briefly implied in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Parker et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, the fact that chimeric mRNAs were generated in plants, in the context of a deficiency in the CPSF30-YTH (CPSF30L) isoform, hints at transcriptional readthrough events taking place, and at the involvement of the YTH domain of CPSF30 in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pontier et al., 2019</xref>). While a link between m6A-related proteins and 3’end processing players has been proposed, the mechanistic and functional outcomes of such a cross between these two pathways as well as their evolution across species have not yet been fully explored.</p><p>Here, we describe the <italic>T. gondii</italic> homolog of CPSF4 and we demonstrate by mass spectrometry, the involvement of the CPSF4-YTH protein in the core CPSF complex, as well as providing the overall composition of the latter through the use of endogenously tagged and purified putative CPSF subunits.

At many <italic>loci</italic>, the depletion of CPSF4 was accompanied by an apparent transcriptional readthrough that went beyond the annotated 3’end sequence of a certain gene to breach into the adjacent one, and that generated very long transcripts (top of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Could this defect in the transcription termination be caused by an overrun of the gene’s proximal polyadenylation signal (PAS)? Nanopore long-read Direct RNA Sequencing (DRS) data argue in favor of this suggestion, and point to an alternative 3’end processing that is occurring using the downstream PAS of the adjacent gene (bottom of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>These claims are based on the fact that nanopore technology allows the direct sequencing of individual native mRNAs, as only polyadenylated RNAs can pass through the pore complex due to the ligation of motor proteins to poly(T) adaptors. Furthermore, the sequencing is stranded going from 3’ to 5’, so 3’ ends are sequenced first. Therefore, the fact that following the depletion of CPSF4, the same aberrant transcription termination seen with <italic>illumina</italic> RNAseq is detected by nanopore DRS on single full length transcripts, provides evidence that the initial 3’ end polyadenylation site has been overrun, and that this process has now shifted to employ an alternative PAS within the downstream gene (bottom of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>), thus the display of these elongated transcripts with aberrant 3’UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>).

This prompted us to use nanopore direct sequencing approach to accurately define the events of transcriptional readthrough in a plant model. RNAs were extracted from wild-type plants and from plants harboring either a mutation in their FIP37 gene, which encodes for a m6A methyltransferase auxiliary factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shen et al., 2016</xref>), or the <italic>CPSF30-3</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pontier et al., 2019</xref>), which allows the assessment of the roles of the YTH domain, as it specifically abrogates the longer isoform of the CPSF30 gene which carries the additional YTH domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The nanopore DRS data generated from these samples allowed the confirmation of the existence of single full-length chimeric transcripts in the mutants, as revealed by an increase in the number of reads of a set of genes, when compared to their repressed state in the WT samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A–B</xref>).

The fact that the depletion of the m6A main writer enzyme, METTL3, generates transcripts that are polyadenylated at sites downstream of their canonical ones suggests that the initial proximal PAS are ones that are dependent on the m6A modification, and that in its absence, as in the context of the METTL3 KD, a downstream m6A-independent PAS is chosen by the polyadenylation machinery, thus generating the poly(A) transcripts that are detected by nanopore mRNA sequencing.</p><p>To support this claim, and to identify the sites of m6A across the genome, we employed DRS to indirectly detect modified nucleotides.

The recently developed <italic>Epinano</italic> pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2019</xref>) uses error variations between two sets of aligned DRS reads (WT vs KD) to map significantly modified error sites.

In fact, many loci with termination defects presented significant error peaks at the putative 3’ termination site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). This could be explained by an overlap existing initially between the overrun PAS sites and m6A sites, if not that the adenosines of the PAS themselves could be methylated, as was observed in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Parker et al., 2020</xref>).

The deep hydrophobic pocket dedicated to m6A recognition is for the most part similar to other YTH domains, with the noticeable difference attributed to a supplemental small α-helice (α3) which opens the site and makes it comparatively more accessible than the HsYTHDC1 or AtCPSF30-YTH structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2021</xref>). This feature can explain the quantitatively weaker interaction when compared to AtCPSF30-YTH or YTHDC1 affinities which are within the nanomolar range. The binding of RNA occurs in a similar fashion to other YTH/RNA structures (YTHDC1 and AtCPSF30-YTH) and no elements forcing sequence specificity are clearly visible in this structure as most of the bases are turned outwards and only the phosphate backbone interacts with the negatively charged binding groove. Intriguingly, however, the presence of a potential secondary binding groove implies possibly multiple binding modes which could depend on RNA secondary structures or on the binding context with the PAS. This feature, combined with a lower affinity, is indicative of a high plasticity in RNA binding with the only centerpiece being the presence or absence of m6A. The YTH domain is separated from the zinc fingers by an extended region which is predicted as disordered. This observation highlights the flexible nature of CPSF4 which itself integrates the quaternary CPSF complex. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Song et al., 2021</xref> also showed that this same disordered region was involved in promoting liquid-liquid phase separated organelles by the CPSF30-L of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. Further structural research may uncover the interplay between m6A recognition and PAS recognition in the context of a fully active CPSF complex.</p><p>In parallel to the orthodox 3’end processing mechanism which occurs independently of the m6A modification, we propose the existence in <italic>T. gondii</italic> of an m6A-dependent polyadenylation through which the m6A site would guide the polyadenylation machinery, via the ability of the CPSF4 YTH to bind this modification, thus allowing the recognition of the respective m6A-dependent polyadenylation site, and the proper termination at a relevant <italic>locus</italic>.</p><p>The fact that the parasite has adopted and evolved such an unconventional 3’end processing mechanism, suggests a role in the tight regulation of gene expression that is typical of this highly adaptive organism. This m6A dependent polyadenylation was detected mainly at the ends of a set of tachyzoites-specific genes that are highly expressed and are adjacent to developmental stage-specific repressed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Farhat et al., 2020</xref>), hence at sites where a highly efficient barrier is needed to partition the distinct transcriptional signatures of these tandem genes, thus preventing any aberrant readthrough of the polymerase that is actively transcribing the upstream tachyzoite gene.</p><p>When taking into consideration the pervasive nature of transcription in the highly replicative tachyzoites stage, along with the remarkably high level of gene density of this parasite’s genome, which bears very few constitutive heterochromatic regions, the relevance of the parasite adopting additional means for preventing any aberrant transcription of its repressed genes at the tachyzoite stage becomes clear. The high rate of transcription that is witnessed in this stage, dampens down in the other stages, these later stages being either slow in their proliferation or even quiescent, which might explain why the parasite has prioritized a large set of tachyzoite genes by this m6A related transcriptional barrier at their 3’ends. Additionally, the fact that most of the m6A related enzymes and most of the 3’end processing factors, were found to be less expressed in latent stages than they were in highly replicative ones, agrees with the requirement of this mark at these stages in particular (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>Although this differential concentration might hint at some level of stage-specific upstream regulation for this mark, the fact that no m6A erasers have been detected in <italic>T. gondii</italic> and that the mark seems to have a relatively long half-life hints at a low level of dynamism for this mark. It seems that the crucial requirement for this m6A-dependent barrier in tachyzoites might not be extended to other stages. When transcribed, the transcriptional termination of the transcripts of genes 2 (as referred to the text to the downstream gene in a tandem, which belongs to stages other than tachyzoites) would occur in an orthodox manner, independently of m6A.</p><p>It should be noted that the PAS sites which we referred to as being m6A-dependent were not sequenced, thus we do not claim that <italic>T. gondii</italic> harbors the canonical AAUAAA. However, in metazoans, variants of this hexamer have been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shepard et al., 2011</xref>), and at plants transcripts, this sequence does not represent more than 10% of the total PAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Loke et al., 2005</xref>), and in other species, auxiliary cis-elements were reported to be substituting for the lack of any PAS elements at some transcripts, in their transcripts 3’end processing purpose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nunes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Venkataraman et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, many sequenced PAS were classified as being m6A-dependent, with the termination of the respective transcripts being dependent on the specific binding of this modification by the YTH within CPSF30L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Parker et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pontier et al., 2019</xref>). However, the existence of more than 12 YTH-proteins in plants, hints at the involvement of the m6A mark in a multitude of mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The magnitude of transposable elements is acknowledged in plants species, as they represent driving evolutionary forces of gene expansion and duplication, thus of genome complexity in these species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rensing, 2014</xref>). Despite these elements aiding the static plants in their constant requirement for adaptation to their changing environment, their mis-regulation and aberrant transcription could generate detrimental regulatory effects, thereby requiring additional means to keep these elements in check. The m6A-assisted polyadenylation has recently been suggested to serve as one of the mechanisms for prevention of aberrant transcription at recently rearranged <italic>loci</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pontier et al., 2019</xref>). Despite the functional conservation of the architecture of CPSF4 between plants and <italic>T. gondii</italic>, the evolutionary divergence between these species and the different homeostatic requirements emanating from either a static but free life style, or a multi-host parasitic one, drove each of them to evolve this m6A-dependent barrier for their respective needs. In <italic>T. gondii</italic>, this barrier would answer to one of the most discernible challenges that the parasite faces: its need to partition the distinct stage specific transcriptional signatures of its genes which in the majority of cases have their transcriptional units bordering each other, if not even overlapping.</p><p>In fact, if it were not for such a high level of gene density occurring in the genome of <italic>T. gondii</italic>, the traversal and overrun of a gene’s PAS, without the conventional downstream RNA cleavage and polyadenylation would have led in most cases to an aberrant non-adenylated and eventually degraded transcripts. The close distance between the adjacent genes makes it so that the RNA pol II would still be able to scan the downstream poly(A) signal site and to use it to efficiently terminate the transcripts, thus allowing us to detect these latter by nanopore and to assess the phenotype of the KD of CPSF4 at these <italic>loci</italic>.</p><p>In addition, employing the nanopore DRS allowed us to observe events which we could not have captured through <italic>illumina</italic>-seq. Apart from the genome assembly artefacts emanating from the inaccuracy of conventional techniques to read the repetitive elements which exist broadly in this genome, there seem to be a fairly large amount of <italic>loci</italic> that were mis-annotated or even non-annotated in the genome of <italic>T. gondii</italic>. For instance, nanopore-based DRS allowed us to align the transcripts of some unannotated genes (e.g. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref> – panel D). The nanopore data also allowed us to distinguish the direction in which the transcription is taking place; for instance, the readthrough breaching into the <italic>TGME49_212275</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref> – panel G) occurs in a direction opposite to the strand at which it is predicted, in the context of the CPSF4-KD-dependent readthrough, while the transcription of this same gene follows its predicted direction in the context of its MORC-KD-dependent induction. A similar behavior is observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>. The ability to detect the orientation of the transcription occurring at a gene, allowed us to also predict instances of steric hindrance between molecules of actively transcribing polymerases, as the case at a gene that was initially transcribed in WT, but then had fewer reads mapping at its <italic>locus</italic> when the adjacent repressed gene was undergoing a CPSF4-KD-dependent readthrough (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2D</xref>).</p><p>Despite witnessing a clear-cut loss of a crucial post-transcriptional barrier following the disruption of either the deposition or the reading of m6A, it cannot be excluded that the genomic context could have had an impact on the degree of the transcriptional functional outcomes observed at those <italic>loci</italic>. Also, this modification has been linked to the translational potential of transcripts as well as to their stability in other apicomplexan parasites, namely in <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baumgarten et al., 2019</xref>), which brings our attention to whether this m6A/polyadenylation coupling would also serve this parasite in its transcriptional partitioning, especially in view of the conservation of the special evolutionary feature of a YTH being carried within its CPSF4 homolog.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Parasites and human cell culture</title><p>HFFs (ATCC CCL-171) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 10 mM HEPES buffer pH 7.2, 2 mM l-glutamine and 50 μg ml−1 of penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen).

Final yields were evaluated using the Qubit HS dsDNA kit (Thermofisher Q32851) with minimum RNA preps reaching at least 150 ng. For all conditions, sequencing was performed on FLO-MIN106 flow cells either using a MinION MK1C or MinION sequencer running Minknow v20.06.5 and guppy v4.09. Basecalling was performed during the run using the fast-basecalling algorithm with a Q score cutoff &gt;7. Long read alignment (to ME49-Toxodb-13 and TAIR10 reference fasta files) was performed using Minimap2 (ver 2.1) with the following parameters: ‘-ax splice -k14 -uf -G 5000 t 10 --<monospace>secondary</monospace>=no –sam-hit-only’ for <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> and ‘-ax splice -k14 -uf -G 20000 t 10 --<monospace>secondary</monospace>=no –sam-hit-only’ for <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Aligned reads were converted to bam, sorted, and indexed using Samtools. For <italic>T. gondii</italic> datasets, most sequencing runs were stopped after having generated between 400 k and 500 k of aligned reads to keep a standard of comparison (<italic>T. gondii</italic> reads varying between 30% and 70% of total mRNA depending on the preparation).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Chimeric transcript detection</title><p>Chimeric reads covering two predicted transcripts were extracted using the ChimerID scripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Parker et al., 2020</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/bartongroup/Simpson_Barton_Nanopore_1">https://github.com/bartongroup/Simpson_Barton_Nanopore_1</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farhat, 2021a</xref> copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:7ca31bd3bb216187e167a091d1c559f8726f15a1;origin=https://github.com/bartongroup/Simpson_Barton_Nanopore_1;visit=swh:1:snp:25103e8204f657ea935189da396f5028ff0b8e5c;anchor=swh:1:rev:1b509454a9e25a8c81be5092f8e525ca00e7b5a5">swh:1:rev:1b509454a9e25a8c81be5092f8e525ca00e7b5a5</ext-link>) from native RNA Nanopore aligned reads within a Anaconda environment containing the following packages (snakemake ;pysam ; samtools ; scipy ; statsmodels ; py-bgzip ; tabix ; pytables ; bedtools ; minimap2 ; panda=0.25.3). Prior to running the analysis, the ToxoDB gene file (in gff format) was processed by AGAT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/NBISweden/AGAT">https://github.com/NBISweden/AGAT</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Farhat, 2021b</xref> copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:11afd9fa91fd15affbaad51ba778957b06a2e172;origin=https://github.com/NBISweden/AGAT;visit=swh:1:snp:4f40f236dbf81051ffa5dc53d087ddc54839e5bb;anchor=swh:1:rev:692791aa30d253bd2ff83397d0dc1a74b5b52adb">swh:1:rev:692791aa30d253bd2ff83397d0dc1a74b5b52adb</ext-link>) to convert to GTF and modify the format. For practical reasons, all KEXXXX contigs were removed from the GTF and genome fasta file. Once extracted, chimeric reads were counted against transcripts in the TGME49 gtf file using Htseq-count. This count file was also supplemented with normal counts of standard transcripts. Data was then normalized using a total aligned read normalization and ratios of Chimera over Total reads were calculated for every transcript in every condition. Log2Fold change in these ratios were then calculated to compare UT against IAA conditions for every KD condition (CPSF4, METTL3, and MORC). Transcripts with readthrough counts below three were excluded from further analysis. Of note, we had no mAID UT condition for MORC so we used the METTL3 UT condition as a comparison to calculate Log2Fch.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Differential splicing analysis</title><p>Splice correction, collapse, quantification and differential isoform representation was performed using the FLAIR pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tang et al., 2020</xref>) with standard parameters however keeping non-consistent isoforms after the correction stage. The GTF generated by FLAIR collapse was used to visualize long chimeric transcript formation in Integrated Genome Browser.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Differential error detection</title><p>Differential error detection was performed using the Epinano pipeline 1.2 (available code at, described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). To limit unwanted background errors, DRS fast5 raw datafiles (of METTL3 UT and METTL3 24h-IAA or Arabidopsis WT and FIP37 ko) were re-basecalled on the MinionMK1C using the high accuracy basecalling option. Bam alignment files were generated with the following command “minimap2 -MD -ax splice -k14 -uf -t 12 ref-genome.fasta Guppy-HA-reads.fastq | samtools view -hbS -F 3844 - | samtools sort -@ 6 -o Alignement.bam’. Briefly, nucleotide variants were calculated on the aligned bam file for UT and KD/KO using the Epinano_Variants.py python script with normal parameters. A global error statistic by nucleotide position was calculated using the Epinano_sumErr.py python script with a minimum of 50 reads per position. Finally, differential error z-scores were obtained by comparing the two datasets with the Rscript Epinano_DiffErr.R, the generated csv file was trimmed of unmodified residues using the linux « grep » command to select only the « mod » containing lines which have a z-score above 3. For representation, the generated data was converted to a bedgraph format representing nucleotide positions as a function of the epinano_DiffErr z-score * 10.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Motif detection at differential error peaks</title><p>The most significant peaks were selected based on a z-score higher than 8, from the initial position, 10 nucleotides upstream and downstream were selected to generate a FASTA file using ‘bedtools getfasta’. For negative sense transcripts, the sequences were reverse complemented using seqkit. Duplicates were removed using seqkit rmdup and further curated manually to avoid duplications. This created a FASTA file containing 223 sequences which were summitted as stranded to the MEME server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://meme-suite.org/meme/">https://meme-suite.org/meme/</ext-link>) which detected only one significant motif RRACD present within 141 sequences with a E-value of 7.4e-25. The same approach was used on <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> WT / Fip37L-KD on a total of 883 unique peaks and generated a similar motif with E-value of 7.4e-186.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The HTX Lab (EMBL Grenoble) are thanked for support in screening for crystal conditions and automatic mounting of crystals.

Dayana C. Farhat et al. first identified the components of the core CPSF complex within <italic>T. gondii</italic>, an obligate parasite who can turn into major thread to the unborn and to immunocompromised people. Then they used biochemistry and structural methods to prove that CPSF4 was an m6A reader, coupling m6A modification directly to APA events. Finally, they detected transcriptional readthrough events upon CPSF4 or Mettl3 KD using Nanopore DRS. Most importantly, they detected m6A-dependent PAS was an efficient transcriptional barrier, that preventing aberrant readthrough of highly expressed genes into the downstream repressed ones in the high gene density genome. And this will make the parasites to reproduce more quickly.</p><p>The conclusions of this paper are mostly well support by the data, and this study opens up new insights about this ancient APA regulation. It helps us to understand how parasites and plants adjust themselves quickly under external stimuli.</p><p>The conclusions of this paper are mostly well support by the data, but some aspects need to be clarified.</p><p>1. What's the relationship between ZnF recognition and YTH recognition of m6A within CPSF4? Because ZnF of CPSF4 in human is found to recognize AAUAA site directly, but AAUAA site was also reported to be m6A modified, which is recognized by YTH domain of CPSF4.Do you have evidence to show PAS binding by these two domains within one protein are competing or assisting each other?</p><p>2. Knocking down of CPSF4 or Mettl3 would have some indirect side effects since these two proteins might involve in other biological processes, I'm wondering if you could test the 3'-end profiling using CPSF4-m6A-binding-defective mutants.</p><p>3. In the paper cited by the authors (doi: 10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.49658), nanopore DSR was also used to map the mRNA profiling in the m6A writer(vir-1) defective background in Arabidopsis, but opposite conclusions were reached: could the authors comment on this inconsistency?</p><p>4. As you compared the structure of TgYTH-m6A RNA with other complexes, and identified RNA bound within a clearly charged groove as seen in other structures. What's the point of a potential secondary binding groove as stated in the text? What do you mean by referring to &quot;multiple binding modes&quot; in line724?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this paper, Farhat et al. demonstrate that m6A on mRNA in <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> interacts with a cleavage and polyadenylation factor protein (CPSF4). This interaction is mediated via the YTH-domain and is characterized using high resolution crystal structures and isothermal calorimetry. The authors have identified the CPSF4 complex using reciprocal IP-MS. The also carried out an IP-MS for the m6A writer machinery – namely METTL3, METTL14, and WTAP homologs to reflect the m6A writer machinery. The main findings for this paper relate to the fact that a loss of or CPSF4 YTH reader protein results in the production of chimeric mRNAs as a result of aberrant transcriptional termination in <italic>T. gondii</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. This phenomenon is also phenocopied in the loss of METTL3 writer protein. Of interest, transcripts which are reliant upon this m6A-dependent recruitment of CPSF4 are generally upstream of otherwise repressed developmental stage-governed transcripts.</p><p>While the paper presents a large amount of data, some of excellent quality, there are critical issues that need to be addressed. Of importance, the implication that METTL3 or CPSF4 KD is involved in developmental regulation requires a clear demonstration of a phenotype where this is impaired and that m6A site is dynamically regulated at the boundary of these transcripts. This involves demonstrating stage transition is impaired in the knockdowns and also using nanopore or other technologies demonstrate that the m6A site is &quot;dynamic&quot; despite not possessing known demethylases.</p><p>The effort to combine multiple strands of work ranging from polyadenylation and transcript termination, the role of m6A in this process and alternative splicing in aberrant transcripts and finally development made the story confusing and often detracted from the important message that could be conveyed. Also, it meant that some conclusions were not well supported by the data.</p><p>Here is a list of some of the essential issues to address:</p><p>1. It is essential to show quantifiable western blot data that shows the downregulation of the different target proteins in the knock down cell lines.</p><p>2. m6A quantification cannot be carried out using IFAs. If using antibodies – show specificity as well. M6A occurs in the host cell as well – why is this not reflected in the staining Figure 3A? I would suggest to either selectively enrich for TG mRNA and then carry out dot blots or mass spectrometry or perhaps even sequencing based approaches. This is critical since none of the IFA data presented is quantifiable.</p><p>3. The link between developmental regulation and m6A is poorly supported. As a minimum it would be necessary to show that m6A levels are developmentally regulated.</p><p>4. Also, there is a significant challenge on how the knock down data can be interpreted. The m6A knockdown would have a global impact of this modification in all mRNA locations. So it is not clear on whether the impact observed is a direct or indirect result.</p><p>5. &quot;Of the CPSF complex, the <italic>T. gondii</italic> CPSF4 subunit can be distinguished as one holding a unique architecture which interestingly is shared with the plant CPSF4 family, and it constitutes of a co-occurrence of three zinc fingers and a conserved YTH domain&quot; – Which YTH domain? DC or DF?</p><p>6. In this context I could imagine that the replacement of CPSF4 with a version lacking the YTH domain may be a way to clearly demonstrate the importance of the YTH domain.</p><p>7. Binding affinities using ITC – TG CPSF4 with m6A has a Kd at 5uM for the modified oligo and Arabidopsis CPSF4 shows close to a Kd 6uM for the non-m6A modified oligo. Could the authors explain this judgement on what constitutes good/bad binding?</p><p>8. In addition, the specificity of YTH binding to m6A is based on a single oligonucleotide sequence. At least a scrambled version of this should be used.</p><p>9. Based on the crystallization results where CPSF4 does not show RNA context specificity, except for m6A residue, how do the authors predict that this recruitment IS context specific? There exist other m6A sites in regions that do not constitute the 3' UTR (Line 612).</p><p>10. Figure 7A -An IFA is not sufficient. A western blot is needed in the very least to validate the KD.</p><p>11. Figure 7B – Are these adjusted p-values. Then these would not be a relatively low number of differentially expressed genes then as per Line 457.</p><p>12. Line 480 – There must be a way to quantify these readthrough events. A statement like this requires substantiation in the form of data.</p><p>13. Please provide a quantitative methodology to depict how METTL3 KD phenocopies CPSF4 KD. How many transcripts display aberrant splicing and which of these are common to both KDs?</p><p>14. Line 209 – Could you draw a venn diagram or similar representation to see the overlapping proteins identified in the complex in each pulldown?</p><p>15. Since you identified Val522 as an additional amino acid for the binding cage of m6A when compared to its counterparts, I suggest you to test the binding affinity towards m6A-modified RNA using V522 mutation by ITC.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68312.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) Regarding the connection between m6A RNA methylation and transcriptional readthrough: please provide accurate quantifications, as listed by reviewer #1 and comment 12 from reviewer #3.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added a more descriptive quantification of readthrough events in Figure 8 — figure supplement 1 of the manuscript.

Yet, depletion of METTL3 or CPSF30 does not promote differentiation to chronic or sexual stages, unlike MORC KD we used as a control. However, CPSF30 or METTL3 KD in the tachyzoite reveals an unexpected role for m6Adependent 3’ end polyadenylation that likely serves as a transcriptional barrier in tachyzoite at closely and tandemly-arranged stage specific genes. Indeed, a significant number of readthroughs caused by depletions of CPSF30 or METTL3 originate from the expression of tachyzoite gene and invade adjacent gene whose expression is restricted to chronic or sexual stages. Therefore, we did not claim on a role for m6A in stage transitions but we did highlight a function for the modification in developmental gene partitioning at least in tachyzoite.</p><p>Whether this partition remains in the other stages is a burning question, still to be answered. According to Holmes et al. (1), no difference in m6A levels was found when comparing tachyzoite to early bradyzoite (converted in vitro). One of the challenges to overcome is to be able to modulate the writing/reading of m6A in chronic or sexual stages, which have long been inaccessible without recourse to animal models. With the discovery of BFD1 (2) and MORC (3), culture models mimicking the mouse brain or cat gut offer new opportunities to explore m6A at other stages of development than tachyzoite.</p><p>1 – Holmes et al., – doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.29.428772</p><p>2 – Wadman et al., Cell, 2020</p><p>3 – Farhat et al., Nature Microbiology, 2020</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Reviewers raised similar comments about the writing: sentences are often too lengthy, too internally convoluted and deploy sesquipedalian vocabulary, rendering their meaning unclear and the message the authors want to convey difficult to understand.

We will also include a more detailed discussion on the limitations of these quantifications.

Dayana C. Farhat et al. first identified the components of the core CPSF complex within T. gondii, an obligate parasite who can turn into major thread to the unborn and to immunocompromised people. Then they used biochemistry and structural methods to prove that CPSF4 was an m6A reader, coupling m6A modification directly to APA events. Finally, they detected transcriptional readthrough events upon CPSF4 or Mettl3 KD using Nanopore DRS. Most importantly, they detected m6A-dependent PAS was an efficient transcriptional barrier, that preventing aberrant readthrough of highly expressed genes into the downstream repressed ones in the high gene density genome. And this will make the parasites to reproduce more quickly.</p><p>The conclusions of this paper are mostly well support by the data, and this study opens up new insights about this ancient APA regulation. It helps us to understand how parasites and plants adjust themselves quickly under external stimuli.</p><p>The conclusions of this paper are mostly well support by the data, but some aspects need to be clarified.</p><p>1. What's the relationship between ZnF recognition and YTH recognition of m6A within CPSF4? Because ZnF of CPSF4 in human is found to recognize AAUAA site directly, but AAUAA site was also reported to be m6A modified, which is recognized by YTH domain of CPSF4.Do you have evidence to show PAS binding by these two domains within one protein are competing or assisting each other?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting point, for which there is probably no definitive answer. In higher eukaryotes, a canonical PAS signal is found within approximately 70% of transcripts (Neve et al., 2017). In apicomplexan parasites, no clear PAS signal has been characterized as of yet and we only could see clear m6A sites on the canonical RRAC motif recognized by METTL3/METTL14. In any case, if we reason by homology to the CPSF1/CPSF4/WDR33 structures interacting with the AUAAA motif (Sun et al., 2018; Clerici et al., 2018), all the adenosines involved in this interaction would not be available for binding to the YTH domain if they were m6A modified. As such, you would have a binding competition if the m6A was on the PAS site directly. If the m6A is in close proximity, then a cooperative binding mode can be imagined where the zinc fingers would bind the PAS and the YTH domain would bind a proximal m6A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Knocking down of CPSF4 or Mettl3 would have some indirect side effects since these two proteins might involve in other biological processes, I'm wondering if you could test the 3'-end profiling using CPSF4-m6A-binding-defective mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>This concern of pleiotropic effects which we also have is fully understandable, as stated in the response to reviewer 3 point 6 we have tried deleting the YTH module within CPSF4 unsuccessfully. Because on the very week expression of CPSF core subunits combined with their paramount essentiality, it is extremely difficult to generate any altered versions of these proteins and select them within viable parasites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In the paper cited by the authors (doi: 10.7554/eLife.49658), nanopore DSR was also used to map the mRNA profiling in the m6A writer(vir-1) defective background in Arabidopsis, but opposite conclusions were reached: could the authors comment on this inconsistency?</p></disp-quote><p>It is not clear what inconsistency the reviewer is referring to, as our data parallel those</p><p>of Parker et al., (2020; doi: 10.7554/eLife.49658) although generated in different genetic backgrounds. For instance, we were able to confirm the m6A signature (AGAUU) that was identified by Parker et al., using Nanopore DRS data.</p><p>Loss of m6A from 3’ untranslated regions was associated by Parker et al., with decreased relative transcript abundance and defective RNA 3’ end formation. They detected 523 loci with increased levels of chimeric RNAs in vir-1 resulting from unterminated transcription proceeding into downstream genes on the same strand. In the same fashion, we were able to confirm the existence of single full-length chimeric transcripts in fip37L and cpsf30-3 mutants. Both studies found that disrupting m6A was associated with altered patterns of mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation.</p><p>The predominant effect in their study was the activation of proximal poly(A) sites in the absence of m6A, indicating that m6A can suppress proximal poly(A) site selection. In our study, impairing m6A writing (fip37L) or reading (cpsf30-3) cause a readthrough of an upstream gene, the transcription of which did not terminate and read into the adjacent gene and terminated at the PAS of this latter instead. Parker have taken the analysis a step further by showing that only 33% of upstream genes forming the chimeric RNAs had detectable m6A sites in the VIRcomplemented line with restored VIR activity. They hypothesize the existence of an m6A-independent role for VIR (or the writer complex) in 3’ end formation or an indirect effect on factors required for 3’ processing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. As you compared the structure of TgYTH-m6A RNA with other complexes, and identified RNA bound within a clearly charged groove as seen in other structures. What's the point of a potential secondary binding groove as stated in the text? What do you mean by referring to &quot;multiple binding modes&quot; in line724?</p></disp-quote><p>To be clear, the second positively charged groove is clearly visible but its function is only speculated. What is certain is that crystal structures of isolated YTH domains in complex with usually short RNA chains (which is required to generate crystalizing complexes) show clearly the m6A recognition ability but fall short to truly explain interactions with extended RNA chains or in the context of larger complexes such as in our case the CPSF complex. These complexes are quite modular and can possibly adapt to different RNA motifs and secondary structures. As such, alternative binding modes are possible. To further expand on this point, we have now added an additional sentence within the discussion (Line 717).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this paper, Farhat et al. demonstrate that m6A on mRNA in Toxoplasma gondii interacts with a cleavage and polyadenylation factor protein (CPSF4). This interaction is mediated via the YTH-domain and is characterized using high resolution crystal structures and isothermal calorimetry. The authors have identified the CPSF4 complex using reciprocal IP-MS. The also carried out an IP-MS for the m6A writer machinery – namely METTL3, METTL14, and WTAP homologs to reflect the m6A writer machinery. The main findings for this paper relate to the fact that a loss of or CPSF4 YTH reader protein results in the production of chimeric mRNAs as a result of aberrant transcriptional termination in T. gondii and Arabidopsis thaliana. This phenomenon is also phenocopied in the loss of METTL3 writer protein. Of interest, transcripts which are reliant upon this m6A-dependent recruitment of CPSF4 are generally upstream of otherwise repressed developmental stage-governed transcripts.</p><p>While the paper presents a large amount of data, some of excellent quality, there are critical issues that need to be addressed. Of importance, the implication that METTL3 or CPSF4 KD is involved in developmental regulation requires a clear demonstration of a phenotype where this is impaired and that m6A site is dynamically regulated at the boundary of these transcripts. This involves demonstrating stage transition is impaired in the knockdowns and also using nanopore or other technologies demonstrate that the m6A site is &quot;dynamic&quot; despite not possessing known demethylases.</p><p>The effort to combine multiple strands of work ranging from polyadenylation and transcript termination, the role of m6A in this process and alternative splicing in aberrant transcripts and finally development made the story confusing and often detracted from the important message that could be conveyed. Also, it meant that some conclusions were not well supported by the data.</p><p>Here is a list of some of the essential issues to address:</p><p>1. It is essential to show quantifiable western blot data that shows the downregulation of the different target proteins in the knock down cell lines.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we added western blot data for both METTL3 (new Figure 3B) and CPSF30 (new Figure 7B) KD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. m6A quantification cannot be carried out using IFAs. If using antibodies – show specificity as well. M6A occurs in the host cell as well – why is this not reflected in the staining Figure 3A? I would suggest to either selectively enrich for TG mRNA and then carry out dot blots or mass spectrometry or perhaps even sequencing based approaches. This is critical since none of the IFA data presented is quantifiable.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that immunofluorescence is not quantitative. The dot blots in our hands give poor results. We then opted for the ELISA technique based on the EpiQuick kit developed by EpiGentek. The challenge for us was to properly purify the tachyzoites (by sequential filtrations) to subtract the host cell background. The data reported in the new Figure 3D show a significant decrease in m6A in total Toxoplasma RNAs exclusively after METTL3 depletion, as the decrease in CPSF4 protein (used as a control) does not alter m6A levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The link between developmental regulation and m6A is poorly supported. As a minimum it would be necessary to show that m6A levels are developmentally regulated.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this thoughtful comment. Indeed, developmental trajectories and stage transitions are accompanied by major transcriptome changes in Toxoplasma gondii. Yet, depletion of METTL3 or CPSF30 does not promote differentiation to chronic or sexual stages, unlike MORC KD we used as a control. However, CPSF30 or METTL3 KD in the tachyzoite reveals an unexpected role for m6Adependent 3’ end polyadenylation that likely serves as a transcriptional barrier in tachyzoite at closely and tandemly-arranged stage specific genes. Indeed, a significant number of readthroughs caused by depletions of CPSF30 or METTL3 originate from the expression of tachyzoite gene and invade adjacent gene whose expression is restricted to chronic or sexual stages. Therefore, we did not claim on a role for m6A in stage transitions but we did highlight a function for the modification in developmental gene partitioning at least in tachyzoite.</p><p>Whether this partition remains in the other stages is a burning question, still answered. According to Holmes et al. (1), no difference in m6A levels was found when comparing tachyzoite to early bradyzoite (converted in vitro). One of the challenges to overcome is to be able to modulate the writing/reading of m6A in chronic or sexual stages, which have long been inaccessible without recourse to animal models. With the discovery of BFD1 (2) and MORC (3), culture models mimicking the mouse brain or cat gut offer new opportunities to explore m6A at other stages of development than tachyzoite.</p><p>1- Holmes et al., – doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.29.428772</p><p>2- Wadman et al., Cell, 2020</p><p>3- Farhat et al., Nature Microbiology, 2020</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Also, there is a significant challenge on how the knock down data can be interpreted. The m6A knockdown would have a global impact of this modification in all mRNA locations. So it is not clear on whether the impact observed is a direct or indirect result.</p></disp-quote><p>The re-analysis provided as an answer to the reviewer 1 (especially the new Figure 8C with the Venn diagram) should enlighten this question and a non-negligible amount of METTL3 and CPSF4 KD read-throughs are commonly observed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. &quot;Of the CPSF complex, the T. gondii CPSF4 subunit can be distinguished as one holding a unique architecture which interestingly is shared with the plant CPSF4 family, and it constitutes of a co-occurrence of three zinc fingers and a conserved YTH domain&quot; – Which YTH domain? DC or DF?</p></disp-quote><p>DF and DC YTH are quite closely related but to be precise and as detailed in the answer to reviewer 1, the CPSF4 YTH is closer to a YTH-DC2. This is quite logic as it remains a nuclear YTH domain although associated with the CPSF complex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In this context I could imagine that the replacement of CPSF4 with a version lacking the YTH domain may be a way to clearly demonstrate the importance of the YTH domain.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a valid observation, as the YTH domain is in the C-terminus we tried on several occasions to insert a HA/FLAG/DHFR/stop prior to the YTH domain but were unable to select any positive clones.

Binding affinities using ITC – TG CPSF4 with m6A has a Kd at 5uM for the modified oligo and Arabidopsis CPSF4 shows close to a Kd 6uM for the non-m6A modified oligo. Could the authors explain this judgement on what constitutes good/bad binding?</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the ITC figures (these are the same titrations) to make the message less confusing (see new Figure 4). Indeed, Arabidopsis CPSF30-YTH titrations against non-m6A modified RNA were displayed without the same scale and we fitted a titration curve on a very weak shift in ΔH, in reality we can consider that there is no binding when we compare both.</p><p>Now for what is considered good or bad binding, what can be said is that in both cases specific binding only occurs with m6A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. In addition, the specificity of YTH binding to m6A is based on a single oligonucleotide sequence. At least a scrambled version of this should be used.</p></disp-quote><p>Aside from the technical difficulty to synthesize a scramble m6A modified oligo in quantities sufficient for ITC we don’t really see how this would benefit the central message of the ITC experiment, the main message being the centerstage importance of having m6A on a central position to measure any binding at all. This is also the same RNA which is seen within the crystal. Measuring a scrambled un-modified sequence against a scrambled modified sequence would probably not improve the affinity as the optimal sequences would not be in saturation quantities and eventually you would start titrating non optimal sequences as well, we would also lose the information related to the positioning of the m6A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Based on the crystallization results where CPSF4 does not show RNA context specificity, except for m6A residue, how do the authors predict that this recruitment IS context specific? There exist other m6A sites in regions that do not constitute the 3' UTR (Line 612).</p></disp-quote><p>Context is probably controlled by PAS binding ability of the N-terminal zinc fingers of CPSF4, RNA secondary structures which may inhibit proper m6A recognition or a number of additional regulators such as CSF factors for which we identified a number of putative subunits within our MS purification of CPSF1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10.
