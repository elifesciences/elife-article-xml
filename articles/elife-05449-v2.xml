It is mainly caused by cytotoxicity of the mutant huntingtin protein (Htt) with an expanded polyQ stretch. While Htt is ubiquitously expressed, HD is characterized by selective neurodegeneration of the striatum. Here we report a striatal-enriched orphan G protein-coupled receptor(GPCR) Gpr52 as a stabilizer of Htt in vitro and in vivo. Gpr52 modulates Htt via cAMP-dependent but PKA independent mechanisms. <italic>Gpr52</italic> is located within an intron of <italic>Rabgap1l</italic>, which exhibits epistatic effects on Gpr52-mediated modulation of Htt levels by inhibiting its substrate <italic>Rab39B</italic>, which co-localizes with Htt and translocates Htt to the endoplasmic reticulum. Finally, reducing Gpr52 suppresses HD phenotypes in both patient iPS-derived neurons and in vivo <italic>Drosophila</italic> HD models. Thus, our discovery reveals modulation of Htt levels by a striatal-enriched GPCR via its GPCR function, providing insights into the selective neurodegeneration and potential treatment strategies.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05449.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05449.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05449.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Huntington's disease is an inherited disorder of the central nervous system. Symptoms typically begin between the ages of 30 and 50, and initially include clumsiness and uncontrollable movements, as well as personality changes and mood swings. Symptoms worsen over time and life expectancy is usually around 10 to 25 years following diagnosis.</p><p>The disease is caused by a mutation in the ‘<italic>huntingtin</italic>’ gene, which leads to the production of an abnormal form of ‘huntingtin’ protein. This accumulates inside neurons in a region of the brain called the striatum, which is involved in the control of movement, and destroys them. However, it is not clear why other regions of the brain that also produce the mutant huntingtin protein are not affected.</p><p>Yao, Cui, Al-Ramahi, Sun et al. have now identified a protein that could explain this phenomenon and open up new therapeutic possibilities for Huntington's disease. The protein, which is called Gpr52, is a receptor located within the outer membrane of neurons, particularly those in the striatum. Reducing the levels of this protein reduced the amount of mutant huntingtin protein that was able to accumulate inside cells grown in culture. Moreover, mice that were genetically engineered to possess a mutant <italic>huntingtin</italic> gene, but only a single copy of the gene for Gpr52, accumulated less mutant huntingtin in the striatum than mice with two copies of the Gpr52 gene.</p><p>Further experiments revealed that Gpr52 protects mutant huntingtin from being broken down inside cells: it does this by activating a signaling pathway involving the cellular messenger cAMP. Encouragingly, when genetic techniques were used to reduce Gpr52 synthesis in a fruit fly model of Huntington's disease, the treated flies showed fewer movement impairments than flies that had not been treated. In addition, reduced levels of Gpr52 were observed to lead to dramatic protective effects in neurons derived from the stem cells of a patient with Huntington's disease.</p><p>The fact that Gpr52 is located on the surface of neurons means that it might be possible to design drugs that can block its activity and thus reduce accumulation of mutant huntingtin. Such a treatment would be the first to target the causal mechanism behind Huntington's disease, rather than simply addressing the symptoms. The strategy could also be relevant to Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders in which death of neurons is triggered by abnormal accumulation or aggregation of proteins.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05449.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05449.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurodegenerative disorders refer to a number of diseases caused by progressive loss of neurons, and they currently have no cure. Many similarities appear in these diseases, such as selective loss of neurons in certain brain regions and accumulation of aggregation-prone proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Soto, 2003</xref>). In order to study these fundamental features and find treatment strategies of these diseases, Huntington's disease (HD) is often used as an important model because of its clear genetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">The Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research Group, 1993</xref>), which facilitates establishment of genetic models as well as early diagnosis. The major cause of HD is the cytotoxicity of the mutant Htt protein (mHtt) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rubinsztein and Carmichael, 2003</xref>), which is expressed throughout the brain and peripheral tissues, but elicits selective neurodegeneration of the corpus striatum and lesser damage to the cerebral cortex in HD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cowan and Raymond, 2006</xref>). This selectivity is likely contributed, at least partially, by striatal-enriched modulators of mHtt toxicity and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Subramaniam et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tsvetkov et al., 2013</xref>). Consistent with this idea, the neuronal longevity correlates with mHtt turnover, which is slower in striatal than in cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tsvetkov et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting expression of striatal-enriched mHtt stabilizers. Discovery of such stabilizers may help understanding the selective pathology of HD.</p><p>More importantly, it provides potential therapeutic entry points for HD: while the mechanism of mHtt toxicity is unclear, lowering its level should suppress its downstream toxicity and treat the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yu et al., 2014</xref>). Meanwhile, reducing the wild-type Htt protein (wtHtt) at the same time seems to be well-tolerated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boudreau et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grondin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lu and Palacino, 2013</xref>). Thus, modulators of Htt levels are attractive targets for potential HD treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Gpr52 modulates Htt levels in the striatal cells in vitro and in vivo</title><p>To identify modulators of Htt levels in the striatal cells, we screened through a number of candidates in STHdh<sup>Q7/Q111</sup> cells, a well-established and easily-transfectable striatal-derived cellular HD model expressing endogenous full length mHtt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Trettel et al., 2000</xref>). We tested the endogenous mHtt levels following knock-down of 104 candidate modulators using pooled siRNAs. We selected these candidates based on our previous screening results in the stably-transfected <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lu et al., 2013</xref>) and tested the mHtt level changes by western-blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This effort revealed six potential modulators of mHtt levels: Gpr52 and Eaf1 siRNAs lower mHtt, whereas Gclc, Grid2, Ndrg3 and Hdhd3 siRNAs increase its level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Among them, Gpr52 (a GPCR) is of special interest. First, GPCRs locate on the plasma membrane and their functions are modulated by extracellular molecules, placing them among the most druggable targets: highly accessible to drugs and the functions are modulated by small molecules. Second, Gpr52 has been recently characterized as a Gα<sub>s</sub>-coupled receptor highly enriched in the striatum, especially D2 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sawzdargo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Komatsu et al., 2014</xref>), which are amongst the earliest affected in HD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Raymond et al., 2011</xref>). The coincidence between Gpr52 expression and selective neurodegeneration suggests that Gpr52 may contribute to the selective early loss of striatal neurons in HD.</p><p>To confirm Gpr52's effect on Htt, we tested an additional set of siRNAs (Gpr52_si1∼3) in the STHdh<sup>Q7/Q111</sup> cells, and observed robust reduction of both wild-type and mutant endogenous Htt levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Consistently, in the Hdh<sup>Q140/Q140</sup> knock-in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Menalled et al., 2003</xref>), shRNA mediated knock-down of Gpr52 lowers Htt in primary cultured striatal but not the cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). More importantly, by crossing the Gpr52 heterozygous knockout mice with the Hdh<sup>Q140/Q140</sup> knock-in mice, we have observed robust lowering of endogenous Htt levels in the striata but not in the cortices by heterozygous knockout of Gpr52 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>); confirming Gpr52 mediated modulation of Htt levels in vivo.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05449.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Gpr52 modulates Htt levels.</title><p>All data plots: average and S.E.M.; ‘*’: p &lt; 0.05, ‘**’: p &lt; 0.01, ‘***’: p &lt; 0.001 by the two-tailed Mann–Whitney U test.

Consistently, detected by both western-blots and Homogenous Time-Resolved Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (HTRF) assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Weiss et al., 2009</xref>), knocking-down Gpr52 significantly reduces Htt in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

Consistent with this, the intracellular cAMP level is reduced by knocking-down Gpr52 (by 15.6 ± 2.5 nM, 35.8 ± 2.5 nM and 21.1 ± 3.1 nM, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), suggesting some levels of constitutive activity. Uncovering the possible involvement of this cAMP reduction in lowering Htt is critical, because it determines whether we can target Gpr52's GPCR function to lower Htt. Thus, we tested the effect of the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin, which increases intracellular cAMP levels (by 54.8 ± 5.7 nM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Treatment of forskolin completely inhibits the Htt reduction caused by the Gpr52 knock-down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <italic>left</italic> panel, lane 5 and 6 compared to lane 1 and 2; <italic>Bar plot</italic>), suggesting that the reduction of cAMP is required for the Gpr52 mediated Htt modulation. The canonical cAMP sensor is protein kinase A (PKA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Meinkoth et al., 1993</xref>). To test possible PKA-dependence, we treated the cells with Rp-cAMP, a non-hydrolysable cAMP analog that does not activate PKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rothermel and Parker Botelho, 1988</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Note that Rp-cAMP was applied at 1 µM, which is much lower than the <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> value for Rp-cAMP's inhibition of PKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rothermel and Parker Botelho, 1988</xref>) and thus should not influence the PKA activity. Similarly, another cAMP analog 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP that does not activate PKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Enserink et al., 2002</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) completely abolishes the Htt reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <italic>Bar plot</italic>) as well. In contrast, the PKA inhibitor H89 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Takuma and Ichida, 1994</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) and a PKA-specific agonist 6-Bnz-cAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Christensen et al., 2003</xref>) fail to inhibit the Htt reduction by Gpr52 knock-down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), confirming the PKA-independence.

Thus, Gpr52 may function via a PKA-independent and cAMP-dependent signaling mechanism by activating GEFs. The reported small GTPases downstream of these GEFs are Rap1 and Rap2, and thus we tested their potential involvement by dominant negative and constitutively active Rap proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fu et al., 2007</xref>). None of these showed obvious effects on the Htt lowering by Gpr52 knock-down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting novel mechanisms potentially involving other GEFs and/or small GTPases, which is suggested in other models as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Emery and Eiden, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kuwayama et al., 2013</xref>). Given that the major function of small GTPases is trafficking, we tested potential Htt translocation events upon treatments of PKA-insensitive analogs Rp-cAMP or 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me cAMP, and found that they lead to Htt enrichment at the perinuclear regions and co-localization with the endoplasmic reticulumn (ER) marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

Rab39B is inactivated by its GAP Rabgap1l, which shows epistatic effects on Gpr52 mediated Htt modulation.

Further evidence needs to be obtained to reveal whether Gpr52 is one of the major causes of the regional specificity. For example, Gpr52 could be exogenously expressed in other brain regions in HD in vivo models to see if the regional specificity of neurodegeneration is shifted.</p><p>Targeting Gpr52 is effective in lowering Htt and remarkably rescues HD phenotypes in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), confirming its therapeutic potential. Further efforts need to be made to confirm its activity in mammalian and/or large animal models and to screen for its antagonists, which are currently unavailable.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Gpr52's effect is cAMP-dependent</title><p>While the possible link between cAMP and Htt has been suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Williams et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lin et al., 2013</xref>), those studies focus on exogenously expressed or transgenic Htt aggregates or fragments, and show inconsistent results. Our data confirm that the sustained lowering of cAMP is required for GPCR-mediated lowering of endogenous soluble full-length Htt through PKA-independent mechanisms. It is intriguing why other striatal GPCRs, such as dopamine receptors, were not identified as Htt modulators by our screenings. There are several major possibilities besides a random missing of these targets. First, in the knock-down screen that we performed, the GPCRs need to have a certain level of constitutive basal activity in order to be identified as hits. Second, a sustained change of cAMP is required to modulate Htt levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), and this may not be achieved by knocking-down many of the GPCRs in absence of agonists. Gpr52 may have a relatively high endogenous activity in the striatal cells, enabling it to provide a significant contribution to the endogenous cAMP levels. Alternatively, the endogenous Gpr52 ligand might be present at a certain level under endogenous conditions, and ligand is predicted to be fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kakarala and Jamil, 2014</xref>). Finally, cAMP may only be a required part of the mechanism, while other signaling pathway or the receptor itself may contribute as well.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The intronic gene and its host: <italic>Gpr52</italic> and <italic>Rabgap1l</italic></title><p><italic>Gpr52</italic> is located in the intron region of <italic>Rabgap1l</italic> gene in the mammalian genome, and the two genes are functionally linked in regulating Htt levels.

Note that anti-Gpr52 antibody only detects human Gpr52 but not the mouse Gpr52. We failed to generate anti-mouse Gpr52 antibody or mouse Gpr52 cDNA plasmids. Similar technical difficulties have been also reported by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Komatsu et al., 2014</xref>). All secondary antibodies were used at 1:5000. For all the representative western-blots shown in the figures, three or more biological repeats have been performed showing consistent results.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Homogeneous time resolved fluorescence (HTRF) assay</title><p>The HTRF assays were performed similarly to those previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liang et al., 2014</xref>). For all the samples, the protein concentration (by BCA, Life Technologies, cat. no. 23225) and/or the DNA content (by Picogreen, Life Technologies, cat. no. P7589, for lyse-in-well experiments) were measured to correct the loadings. Different protein concentrations or cell numbers per well were tested to ensure that the signals were in the linear range. Background corrections were performed by subtracting the background signals from blank samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>Coverslip cultures were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15–20 min, washed with 1× PBS 10 min three times and incubated in a blocking buffer (10% donkey serum and 0.2% triton X-100 in PBS) for 60 min and then incubated with primary antibodies: Tuj1 (Covance, Princeton, NJ, USA, cat. no. 14971502, 1:5000), GABA (Sigma, cat. no.

Fluorescence conjugated secondary antibodies were used to reveal the binding of primary antibodies (Life Technology, cat. no. A21206, A31572, A21202, A21203, 1:1000) and nuclei were stained with DAPI (Sigma, cat. no. D9542, 1:1000). Images were captured by Leica TCS SP8 confocol system. Co-localization was quantified using the Pearson's correlation coefficient and the overlap coefficient, which were calculated with Image-pro Plus software. Data represent the mean with standard deviation. One-way ANOVA experiments were performed to judge the statistical significance.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>qPCR</title><p>mRNA levels were determined by qPCR. RNA from siRNA-transfected or compound treated cells was extracted using RNAprep Pure Cell/Bacteria Kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China, cat. no. DP430). Random-primed cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription using the FastQuant RT Kit (Tiangen, cat. no. KR106). DNase I was added to break down the genomic DNA. qPCR was then performed using SYBR Green Realtime PCR Master Mix (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan, cat. no. QPK-201). qPCR Primers used were as follows: Gpr52 forward: TTGCTTTATTGTTTGTTTACTTTATGC, Gpr52 reverse: GTGAAAGTAAGTGAAGCAGACAACC; Rabgap1l forward: GGAACTGGCACAGACCAAAC, Rabgap1l reverse: GCTCCTCTCTGATGCTCAAGTT; Hprt forward: GTCAACGGGGGACATAAAAG, Hprt reverse: CAACAATCAAGACATTCTTTCCA; Htt forward: CTGCACGGCATCCTCTATGT, Htt reverse: TGTTCACGCAGTGGGCTATT.</p><p>All the primers were tested with standard curve, amplification efficiency was between 95%–105%, and the R<sup>2</sup> for linear relationship is &gt;0.999. No reverse-transcriptase controls were used to ensure the specificity of the signals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Neuronal loss assays</title><p>The patient iPS-derived neurons exhibit HD-dependent phenotypes including elevated caspase-3 signals and neuronal loss upon BDNF removal. Similarly, the STHdh cells exhibit HD-dependent caspase 3 and/or 7 activity upon stress, such as serum removal. Briefly, patient and wild type iPS-derived neurons were cultured in NIM (1% N<sub>2</sub> in DMEM:F12) for further 48 hr after transfected with siRNAs for 4 days. These phenotypes could be detected by the caspase activity assay as well as the neuronal loss assay. For the caspase activity assay, the NucView 488 caspase-3 dye (Biotium, Hayward, CA, cat. no. 30029) was used for the caspase activity detection as based on manufacturer's protocols. The images of the caspase-3 dye and DAPI treated live cells were taken by Nikon ECLIPSE TE2000-S microscope. For the neuronal loss experiments, the Tuj1 confluence and shape were analyzed by ImageJ and the sholl analysis-plug in of ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sholl, 1953</xref>). The images were analyzed blindly.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> motor performance tests</title><p>Experiments were performed using 15 age-matched virgin females. We placed the flies in an empty vial and tapped them down. The percentage of flies that climbed past a 9-cm-high line after 18 s was recorded, and two replicates were tested in parallel for each genotype. The mean and S.E.M. of 10 observations is plotted for each day and data analyzed by ANOVA followed by Dunnett's post hoc test. Blinding was used both for carrying out the experiment and for analyzing the data. The nervous system driver line <italic>elav-GAL(c155)</italic> as well as the classical loss-of-function alleles DopEcR<sup>MI02790</sup> and GapcenA<sup>f01044</sup> were obtained from the Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center at University of Indiana (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flystocks.bio.indiana.edu/">http://flystocks.bio.indiana.edu/</ext-link>).

NT-Htt128Q flies express an N-terminal human Htt fragments comprising exons 1–4 (first 336 amino acids including 128Q) and have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Ramahi et al., 2006</xref>). FL-Htt200Q flies express the full length human Htt protein with 200Q and exhibit similar motor defects (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical comparisons were conducted by the two-tailed unpaired Mann–Whitney U-test for comparing the average of each sample in the bar graphs. For comparison of sample averages with different doses of Gpr52 cDNA transfected vs the single control (mock) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), one way ANOVA tests were performed followed by Dunnett's <italic>post hoc</italic> test. For comparisons between different groups over different time points, two-way ANOVA has been utilized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref>). Significance was established at p &lt; 0.05. In all graphs, error bars, S.E.M. The biological replicate numbers are indicated on top of each bar and/or as the n numbers in the legends. The statistical powers for all analyses were calculated and confirmed to be &gt;80%. For all the cellular assays, the cells were evenly suspended and then randomly allocated in each well tested. For the animal experiments, the littermates were allocated into each group based on their genotypes and thus randomization does not apply. The key experiments including detecting Htt level changes upon Gpr52 knock-down or knockout, the co-localization analysis, and the cellular phenotypic rescue analyses were confirmed by blind testing in which different investigators prepared/labeled the samples and the analyses were carried out without information exchange before obtaining the results. The key observations including the lowering of Htt, the epistasis between Gpr52 and Rabgap1l and the phenotypic rescue have been replicated by multiple independent investigators. Data were excluded when there were clear indications of artifact or experimental failures, such as contamination, transfection/infection failure, etc.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Virus packaging</title><p>Lentiviral particles for infection were produced in HEK293T cells transfected with the pLKO-Gpr52-shRNA or scrambled constructs with the three plasmid packaging mix (pLP1, pLP2 and pLPVSV-G). After 48 hr, the medium was collected, filtered through a 0.45-µm membrane and ultracentrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 90 min. The viral pellets were resuspended in sterile PBS with 1% BSA and stored at −80°C. Viral titers were determined using Abm's qPCR Lentivirus Titration Kit (Abm, Richmond, Canada, cat. no. LV900). The Gpr52 shRNA target sequences are: Gpr52_sh1: CTCCGCTGTTACACCATTATA; Gpr52_sh2: GTGGATCGATATCTTGCAATA. The viruses were applied at M.O.I = 3 for the primary neurons, and the knock-down of Gpr52 was confirmed by qPCR.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We'd like to thank Dr Saiyin Hexige for collecting fibroblasts samples of HD, Salah Ichcho and Crystal Mazur for testing some of the reagents, and Dr Daniel Pak and Dr Kunliang Guan for providing us cDNA plasmids.
