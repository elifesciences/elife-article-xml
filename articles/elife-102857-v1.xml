to rising drug unresponsiveness, leading to increasing treatment failures. While hypolipidemia characterizes VL, LD, a cholesterol auxotroph, relies on host lipid scavenging for its intracellular survival. The aggressive pathology, in terms of increased organ parasite load, observed in hosts infected with antimony-unresponsive-LD (LD-R) as compared to their sensitive counterparts (LD-S), highlights LD-R’s heightened reliance on host lipids. Here, we report that LD-R-infection in mice promotes fluid-phase endocytosis in the host macrophages, selectively accumulating neutral lipids while excluding oxidized-low-density lipoprotein (LDL). LD-R enhances the fusion of endocytosed LDL-vesicles with its phagolysosomal membrane and inhibits cholesterol mobilization from these vesicles by suppressing NPC-1. This provides LD-R amastigotes with excess lipids, supporting their rapid proliferation and membrane synthesis. This excess LDL-influx leads to an eventual accumulation of neutral lipid droplets around LD-R amastigotes, thereby increasing their unresponsiveness toward Amphotericin-B, a second-line amphiphilic antileishmanial. Notably, VL patients showing relapse with Amphotericin-B treatment exhibited significantly lower serum LDL and cholesterol than cured cases. Treatment with Aspirin, a lipid droplet blocker, reduced lipid droplets around LD-R amastigotes, restoring Amphotericin-B responsiveness.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>clinical <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> isolates</kwd><kwd>lipid droplets</kwd><kwd>drug unresponsiveness</kwd><kwd>vesicle fusion</kwd><kwd>LDL-cholesterol</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001501</institution-id><institution>University Grants Commission India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CSIR-UGC (2020–2021) fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pradhan</surname><given-names>Supratim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Prime Minister's Research Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021–2024</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pradhan</surname><given-names>Supratim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001412</institution-id><institution>Council of Scientific and Industrial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GATE fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dhar</surname><given-names>Dhruba</given-names></name><name><surname>Chakraborty</surname><given-names>Shubhangi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001412</institution-id><institution>Council of Scientific and Industrial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CSIR fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Manna</surname><given-names>Debolina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Nutritional adaptations in <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> enable persistent antimony resistance and reduced Amphotericin-B effectiveness by selectively exploiting host lipids and limiting cholesterol mobilization.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Antimony, which was mainstay for treating fatal visceral leishmaniasis (VL), has been withdrawn from Indian Subcontinent for more than a decade now due to emergence of resistance. Despite this, recent clinical LD isolates remain unresponsive to antimony (LD-R), indicating persistent phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dumetz et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, LD-R also exhibits more aggressive pathology in clinical and experimental infection featuring increased organ parasite burden as compared to LD-S-infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mukhopadhyay et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mukherjee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Verma et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Thakur et al., 2003</xref>). Increased metacyclogenesis among LD-R was initially thought to be the primary factor contributing to higher infectivity, resulting in organ parasite overload (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ouakad et al., 2011</xref>). However, later studies revealed that LD-R promastigotes have a greater replicative potential than LD-S, possibly offering a selective intracellular survival advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vanaerschot et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mukherjee et al., 2021</xref>). This implies LD-R might be more adept at acquiring and metabolizing host-derived nutrients within their parasitophorous vacuole (PV), facilitating their heightened intracellular proliferation. Lipids are crucial carbon sources for energy in proliferating intracellular pathogens. Several intracellular bacteria, protozoans, and viruses utilizes cellular lipid droplets and plasma lipoproteins for entry, energy acquisition, and biomembrane synthesis, demonstrating intricate interactions between intracellular pathogens and host lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feingold and Grunfeld, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sonda and Hehl, 2006</xref>). <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites are cholesterol auxotrophs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goad et al., 1984</xref>), and need (1) host membrane cholesterol for successful attachment and infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pucadyil et al., 2004</xref>). (2) Intracellular leishmania amastigotes replicating within membrane-bound PVs, accumulates cholesterol and lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sood et al., 2024</xref>). (3) <italic>Leishmania</italic> amastigotes isolated from infected host have been shown to have increased cholesterol content in them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bouazizi-Ben Messaoud et al., 2017</xref>), all these clearly suggest replicating <italic>Leishmania</italic> amastigotes might co-opt host-derived lipids to facilitate their intracellular proliferation and membrane synthesis. In fact, hypocholesteremia is a hallmark of VL, with intracellular LD depleting host cholesterol and lipoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lal et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pradhan et al., 2021</xref>). However, the mechanism by which PV-bound LD amastigotes acquire this lipids, and how variations in lipid type, source, and utilization dynamics affect disease pathology and drug responsiveness, remains unclear.</p><p>So far, drug responsiveness in leishmaniasis has mostly been studied through in vitro selection of drug-resistant promastigotes, with limited focus on the drug susceptibility profiles of circulating clinical strains of <italic>Leishmania</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Douanne et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Légaré et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gourbal et al., 2004</xref>). However, growing evidences indicate that drug responsiveness and treatment failure in VL are multifactorial, influenced by the host’s immune-metabolic status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mukherjee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ghosh et al., 2012</xref>). Importantly, recent reports have also linked emergence of drug unresponsiveness among intracellular pathogens with their ability to modulate host lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Toledo and Benach, 2016</xref>). For instance, increased lipid accumulation can hinder drug penetration by trapping lipophilic drugs, fostering resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cao, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Day et al., 2024</xref>). VL treatment in recent years have seen a rise in treatment failure against Amphotericin-B (Amp-B), a second-line lipophilic drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mukhopadhyay et al., 2011</xref>), making it critical to investigate these failures in the context of lipid utilization during LD infection.</p><p>Using clinical antimony-unresponsive-LD strains isolated from patients this study elucidates how LD-R-infection leads to an increased uptake of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) leading to eventual accumulation of neutral lipids droplets within their PV. In vitro infection of liver-resident Kupffer cells (KCs), primary sites for cholesterol synthesis and LD amastigote residence, demonstrated that LD-R-infection facilitates fluid-phase endocytosis, increasing LDL-vesicle uptake in infected KCs cells. LD-R-PV exhibits a higher propensity to fuse with endocytosed LDL-vesicles, coupled with the inhibition of cholesterol recycling from the vesicles back to the plasma membrane of infected MΦs. Our observation thus explains the heightened energy source and cholesterol availability for PV and daughter membrane synthesis to accommodate higher number of LD-R amastigotes observed in clinical infection. We also observed a suppressed expression of MSR-1, a scavenger receptor of oxidized-LDL (ox-LDL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sheng et al., 2022</xref>), in LD-R infected murine liver, suggesting LD-R-infection limits the uptake of ox-LDL, reducing inflammatory responses. Furthermore, our findings indicate that lipid droplet accumulation around LD-R amastigotes contributes to Amp-B unresponsiveness, explaining recent reports of Amp-B cross-resistance in clinical LD-R-isolates from India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Purkait et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Srivastava, 2011</xref>). Significant low lipid profiles in VL patients experiencing treatment failure against liposomal Amp-B, combined with complete clearance of LD-R amastigotes using a combination treatment of Aspirin (a lipid droplet formation blocker) and Amp-B, confirmed critical role of assimilating host lipids in developing Amp-B unresponsiveness among rapidly replicating LD amastigotes exhibiting primary unresponsiveness toward antimony. This study identifies sequence of events that enables LD-R amastigotes to redirect host nutrients for their own aggravated sustenance, and how this preferential lipid utilization might equip them with unresponsiveness against Amp-B contributing to the gradual spread of cross-resistance among clinical LD-R-isolates.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>LD-R-infection caused severe dyslipidemia as compared to LD-S-infection</title><p>Intracellular amastigotes of <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites exhibit lipid auxotrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goad et al., 1984</xref>), with dyslipidemia being a hallmark for leishmaniasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lal et al., 2007</xref>), including VL patients. Previously, LD amastigote load in splenic aspirates of VL patients have been shown to exhibit an inverse correlation with serum cholesterol level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ghosh et al., 2011</xref>). Since infection with antimony-unresponsive-LD (LD-R) has been previously reported to exhibit higher amastigote load in spleen and liver of infected host, as compared to infection with their responsive counterparts (LD-S) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vanaerschot et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Haldar et al., 2010</xref>), we wanted to investigate possible extent of dyslipidaemia in response to LD-R and LD-S-infection and how it might affect disease pathology. Mice infected with equal number of sorted metacyclics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) of natural clinical LD-isolates with confirmed LD-R phenotype, MHOM/IN/09/BHU575/0 (LD-R<sup>1</sup>) and MHOM/IN/10/BHU814/1 (LD-R<sup>2</sup>), showed a significantly lower serum levels of LDL, HDL, and cholesterol as compared to MHOM/IN/83/AG83 (LD-S<sup>1</sup>) and MHOM/IN/80/DD8 (LD-S<sup>2</sup>), infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Liver serves as a primary site for lipid synthesis and liver-resident MΦs (KCs) are one of the primary sites harboring LD amastigotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beattie et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, we decided to test if KCs can be established as an in vitro model for LD-infection to investigate the possible link of host lipid utilization with respect to aggressive pathology shown by LD-R. Purified KCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) infected with equal number of sorted metacyclics for LD-S and LD-R-isolates as before displayed no significant difference in their initial attachment to host membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1A, B</xref>). However, although initial number of intracellular LD-S and LD-R amastigotes 4 hr post infection (p.i) showed no difference, a significantly higher number of LD-R amastigotes were observed in 24 hr infected KC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ci, ii</xref>). Interestingly, as compared to a significant and sharp rise in the number of intracellular amastigotes between 4 and 24 hr post infected KC in response to LD-R-infection, the number of intracellular amastigotes although increased significantly did not doubled from 24 to 48 hr p.i. suggesting exponential LD amastigote replication between 4 and 24 hr time frame and slowing down after that (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ci, ii</xref>). Moreover, it was also noticed that at 72 hr p.i. a notable number of infected KC began detaching from the wells with extracellular amastigotes probably egressing out from the infected KCs (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). Thus, 24 hr time point was selected to conduct all further infection studies involving KCs. Parallel infection performed in peritoneal exudate macrophages (PECs), which serves as a long-standing model for in vitro LD-infection, under identical experimental conditions also resulted in similar observation with LD-R strains showing significantly higher amastigote load at 24 hr p.i. than LD-S strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1Ci, ii, iii</xref>), as previously reported by multiple groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dumetz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Verma et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ouakad et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, KCs infected with LD-S or LD-R amastigotes isolated from 28 days infected mouse spleens, also resulted in significantly higher parasite load for LD-R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), clearly indicating that higher parasite load is a conserved LD-R phenotype which does not depends on initial infectivity or MΦ origin. Notably, infected KCs had a slightly higher inherent amastigote load compared to infected PECs for both LD-S and LD-R-infections, with no significant difference in parasite load within the two independent LD-S or LD-R strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). Hence, BHU575 was selected as representative LD-R and AG83 as representative LD-S to conduct all further comparisons with the inclusion of other representative strains as and when mentioned. Higher intracellular amastigote load in response to LD-R-infection was further confirmed by imaging LD-S and LD-R-PV at 4 and 24 hr infected KCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Comparative analysis revealed significantly higher number of LD-R-PVs as compared to LD-S-PVs at 24 hr p.i., although this difference was not observed at 4 hr p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Di, Dii</xref>). Interestingly, 3D image reconstruction for LD-R-PV at 24 hr p.i., presented it as a larger fused structure as compared to smaller individual segmented appearance of LD-S-PV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Diii</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Severe dyslipidemia is linked with higher intracellular proliferation of LD-R amastigotes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Serum lipid profile of 28 days LD-infected Balb/c mice (<italic>N</italic> = 5).

Apart from this biochemical characterization, we also performed biophysical analysis of lipid-related peaks using non-invasive confocal Raman spectroscopy to capture a snapshot of lipid distribution in LD-S and LD-R-infected-KCs under native conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Ei, ii</xref>).

Considering that MΦs primarily uptake LDL via the LDL receptor (LDLr) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goldstein et al., 1985</xref>), we checked its status in response to LD-S and LD-R-infection. However, immunofluorescence analysis showed a decrease in LDLr expression in infected KCs harboring LD-amastigotes as compared to adjacent uninfected KCs, regardless of infection type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), along with no significant changes in total LDLr expression between uninfected, LD-S, and LD-R-infected-KCs, as observed from western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This indicated that LDL uptake by LD-infected-KCs might be receptor independent. Our attempts to generate siRNA-mediated knock down (KD) in KCs were unsuccessful, hence to convincingly determine the role of LDLr in LD-infected-MΦs we generated LDLr-KD-PEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1Bi, ii</xref>) and performed infection with LD-S or LD-R.

Apart from LDLr, MΦs can also acquire LDL through receptor-independent fluid-phase endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lucero et al., 2020</xref>). To confirm this possibility, we checked the status of Cofilin, an actin modulating protein, which serves as a marker for fluid-phase endocytosis. Western blot analysis of infected KCs revealed an increase in Cofilin levels with a concurrent decrease in its phosphorylated form as LD-R-infection progressed, indicating active fluid-phase endocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Bi, ii</xref>). In contrast, LD-S-infection did not induce such changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Bi, ii</xref>). Interestingly, this decrease in Cofilin phosphorylation was also observed in LD-R-infected-PEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1Di, ii</xref>), signifying that enhanced fluid-phase endocytosis may be a conserved mechanism for facilitating LDL-influx in LD-R-infected-MΦs. This enhanced fluid-phase endocytosis in response to LD-R-infection was further confirmed by structural illumination microscopy (SIM) imaging, which showed increased Cofilin turnover with dispersed distribution in LD-R-infected-KCs, leading to enhanced F-Actin rearrangement and protrusion formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Popow-Woźniak et al., 2012</xref>), which was absent for uninfected or LD-S-infected-KCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Ci, ii, Di, ii</xref>). Finally, we infected the KCs with GFP expressing LD-R for 4 hr, washed and allowed the infection to proceed in presence of fluorescent red-LDL and Latrunculin-A (5 µM), a compound which specifically inhibits fluid-phase endocytosis by inducing actin depolymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lucero et al., 2020</xref>).

Interestingly, while, western blot analysis revealed minimal expression of LAMP-1 in response to LD-S-infection at 4 hr p.i., which increased considerably as the infection progressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Ci</xref>), however, a considerable amount of LAMP-1 expression was observed for LD-R-infected-KCs from 4 hr p.i., which also increased as infection progresses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Cii</xref>), indicating that a higher fusion of LDL-vesicles in LD-R-PV may be accompanied by increased lysosomal biogenesis required for degrading LDL into cholesterol. Filipin staining of EGFP-LD-S and EGFP-LD-R-infected KCs at 24 hr p.i. revealed enhanced cholesterol accumulation surrounding LD-R amastigotes, as indicated by a significantly higher co-localization coefficient compared to LD-S amastigotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Di–iii</xref>).

We suspected that LD-R must prevent or delay this process as this will limit cholesterol accessibility to replicating LD-R amastigotes. Analysis of available RNAseq (INRP000146) data for uninfected, LD-S and LD-R-infected-PEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) revealed a suppression of <italic>Npc1</italic> expression along with its transcription factor <italic>Srebp2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garver et al., 2008</xref>), in response to LD-R-infection. Western blot analysis of LD-S and LD-R-infected-KCs confirmed this low expression of SREBP2 and NPC-1 in LD-R-infected-KC 24 hr p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6Bi, ii</xref>). More interestingly, confocal imaging not only confirmed this low expression of SREBP2, but even in those cases of LD-R-infected-KCs where we did observe some residual expression of SREBP2, it was entirely restricted to cytoplasm, unlike LD-S or uninfected-KCs where SREBP2 did get translocated in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Furthermore, as SREBP2 acts as the master regulator of cholesterol biosynthesis, its downregulation and inhibition of nuclear translocation further impacted expression of the downstream cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme HMGCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) specifically in LD-R-infected-KCs. This again supports the RNAseq expression data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) and further confirms that LD-R-infected-KCs has a shutdown of de novo cholesterol synthesis. For NPC-1, immunofluorescence imaging comparing adjacent uninfected and infected KCs harboring LD-S or LD-R, clearly confirmed unlike LD-S, LD-R specifically suppresses NPC-1 to prevent release of LDL-derived cholesterol from fused vesicles making it accessible to amastigotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). We confirmed this observation by performing a total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRF) which clearly showed a low plasma membrane cholesterol for LD-R-infected-KCs as compared to LD-S-infected-KCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6Fi</xref>) and subsequently revalidated this by quantifying the cholesterol content in isolated membrane fraction for individual experimental set as mentioned above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6Fii</xref>). Finally, siRNA-mediated KD of NPC-1 in PEC (due to failure of successful KD generation in KCs), resulted in significant increase in amastigote load in response to LD-R-infection, while no such change in amastigote load was observed for LD-S-infected NPC-1-KD-PECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6Gi–iv</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>LD-R-infection suppress NPC-1 to alter cholesterol mobilization in infected MΦs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) 24 hr LD-S and LD-R-infected-PECs were subjected to RNAseq analysis keeping uninfected-PECs as control.

To check this, we measured inflammatory IFN-γ by co-culturing splenic T-cells isolated from LD-S or LD-R-infected mice, with LD-S and LD-R-infected-KCs, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Surprisingly, our ELISA results showed a low IFN-γ levels in the culture supernatant of LD-R-infected-KCs even after 24 hr of co-culture, while for LD-S-infection a significant increase was noted at this point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7Bi</xref>). Similarly, stimulation of LD-infected splenocytes obtained from LD-S and LD-R-infected <italic>Apoe<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice with specific soluble <italic>Leishmamia</italic> antigens (SLA) of LD-S or LD-R also confirmed this restricted IFN-γ response to LD-R-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7Bii</xref>), thus suggesting that although LD-R-infection results in increased accumulation of lipids in host MΦs, it elicits a suppressed inflammatory response as compared to LD-S. Notably, accumulation of ox-LDL, and not its neutral form has been reported to cause inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ho et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Govaere et al., 2022</xref>). LD-S or LD-R-infected-KCs incubated with ox-LDL showed a significant purple positive staining of ox-LDL only for LD-S-infected-KCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7Ci</xref>), with LD-R-infected-KCs seemingly inhibiting uptake of ox-LDL. Infecting KCs with higher number of LD-S or lower number of LD-R did not alter their ox-LDL uptake capabilities, clearly suggesting LD-R-infection inherently suppress ox-LDL uptake, irrespective of the number of intracellular amastigotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7Cii</xref>). Although, receptor of ox-LDL, MSR-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sheng et al., 2022</xref>), has shown a slightly lower expression in LD-R-infected-PEC in the RNAseq analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), however owing to reported dominant expression of <italic>msr-1</italic> in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Govaere et al., 2022</xref>), we checked expression of MSR-1 in the LD-S and LD-R-infected-KCs. Confocal images and western blot analysis confirmed a significant lower expression of MSR-1 in LD-R-infected-KCs as compared to LD-S-infected-KCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7Di, ii</xref>), thus explaining reduced staining for ox-LDL in response to LD-R-infection. Furthermore, increased expression of <italic>atp6vod2</italic> transcripts, implicated in LD-PV acidification and lipid utilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pessoa et al., 2019</xref>), was also noted to be slightly higher for LD-R-infected-PECs in the RNAseq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

As we have already observed significant accumulation of lipid droplets in LD-R-infected murine liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), we further investigated its role in response to LD-S and LD-R-infection. Lipid droplets staining of LD-S and LD-R-infected-KCs revealed significantly higher lipid droplets accumulation around LD-R amastigotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). For better visualization<bold>,</bold> we expanded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liffner et al., 2023</xref>) EGFP-LD-R-infected-KCs and again performed lipid droplets staining on them which confirmed assimilation of neutral lipid into LD-R amastigotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). This was further confirmed by performing transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in LD-R-infected-KC which showed lipid droplets accumulating around LD-R amastigotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Lipid accumulation has been previously reported to cause Amphotericin-B unresponsiveness among pathogens by hindering drug penetration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, we noted that two LD-R-strains (BHU575 and BHU814) which we have included in this study also shows reduced responsiveness against Amp-B, a second-line-antileishmanial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ghosh et al., 2021</xref>), and we validate this by determining their EC50 against Amp-B in LD-infected-KCs, which showed an EC50 of 0.39 and 0.31 μM for LD-R<sup>1</sup> and LD-R<sup>2</sup> amastigotes, respectively, as compared to EC50 of 0.03 μM for LD-S<sup>1</sup> and 0.032 μM LD-S<sup>2</sup>. We suspected that significant lipid droplets accumulation around LD-R amastigotes might be responsible for their reduced susceptibility toward Amp-B by limiting drug accessibility. To test this possibility, we performed independent infection with two LD-R strains in low and high lipid medium and access their EC50 against Amp-B. Low lipid medium results in significant drop in lipid droplets accumulation within LD-R-infected-KCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and also resulted in enhanced susceptibility for both the LD-R strains against Amp-B with EC50 reduced to 0.39–0.16 μM for LD-R<sup>1</sup> and 0.31–0.06 μM for LD-R<sup>2</sup> as compared to high lipid medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8Ci, ii</xref>). Interestingly, infection with lab-generated Amphotericin-B-unresponsive LD promastigotes (LD-S<sup>Amp-B-R</sup>) without primary unresponsiveness toward antimony did not result in any significant lipid droplets accumulation around LD-R amastigotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and neither showed any significant alteration in EC50 between low (0.09 μM) and high lipid medium (0.11 μM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8Ciii</xref>). This observation clearly suggests that this high LDL-influx along with higher lipid droplet accumulation responsible for increased unresponsiveness of LD-R-isolates toward Amp-B is a specific attribute of LD isolates with primary unresponsiveness against antimony and may vary significantly from lab-generated Amp-B unresponsive strains. Previously, Aspirin (Asp), a lipid droplet blocker has been reported to block lipid droplet formation in <italic>T.cruzi</italic> and LD-infected-MΦs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banerjee et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">D’Avila et al., 2011</xref>). We also observed a drastic drop in lipid droplets formation in LD-R-infected-KCs treated with Aspirin as compared untreated LD-R-infected-KCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Interestingly, while treatment with Aspirin alone did not significantly reduce the amastigote load in LD-R-infected-KCs, combining Aspirin with previously determined low dose of Amp-B (0.1 μM), completely restored Amp-B responsiveness against intracellular LD-R amastigotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E, F</xref>). This suggests that the enhanced uptake of LDL leading to lipid droplet accumulation might be a primarily responsible for increasing Amp-B unresponsiveness among clinical LD-R-isolates. Importantly, this observation is consistent with findings from human VL patients from the endemic region of Bihar, India, where those who relapsed after Amp-B treatment had significantly lower serum LDL and cholesterol levels compared to Amp-B treatment responders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref> and Table 2).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Lipid droplets accumulation around LD amastigotes is inversely related with susceptibility toward Amphotericin-B.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ex-M image showing lipid droplet assimilation in LD-R amastigotes.

Intracellular pathogens often alter the host’s immune-metabolic state for better survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Thakur et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kreimendahl and Pernas, 2024</xref>). Our observations pointed out that high organ parasite load linked with LD-R-infection does not rely only on initial infectivity as commonly believed to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vanaerschot et al., 2011</xref>), rather is indicative of a selective higher intracellular proliferation in host. We observed LD-R amastigotes scrutinize and access specific type of host lipoproteins to support their aggressive proliferation as seen in clinical infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lal et al., 2007</xref>). Previously increased amastigote load in VL patients has been inversely linked with their serum cholesterol level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ghosh et al., 2011</xref>), and we also observed that mice infected with LD-R-isolates had significantly lower HDL, LDL, and cholesterol compared to LD-S-infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>LD amastigotes are lipid auxtrophs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goad et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bouazizi-Ben Messaoud et al., 2017</xref>), and this severe dyslipidemia in response to LD-R-infection can be logically interpreted in terms of LD-R’s increase need to support their aggravated intracellular proliferation in the infected host. In liver-resident macrophages (KCs), primary sites for LD infection and host cholesterol synthesis, we observed significantly higher number of LD-R amastigotes and PVs formation, compared to LD-S-infection, indicating LD-R’s better capacity to utilize host cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Also, in hyperlipidemic <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, LD-R-infection led to organ parasite overload compared to LD-S-infection, confirming LD-R’s increased dependence on extracellular lipid sources to sustain its aggressive proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Thus, next we focused on investigating LD-R’s ability to differentially regulate host’s immune-metabolic status. Previous reports suggested that LD with altered drug responsiveness can modulate their host differentially resulting in different disease outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mukherjee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Díaz Varela et al., 2024</xref>). Our results confirmed that while both LD-R and LD-S promastigotes initially quench cholesterol from the host plasma membrane similarly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), LD-R amastigotes accumulate significantly more cholesterol and fatty acids in their PV by specifically promoting increased endocytosis of LDL as the infection progresses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). This possibly also explains the similar initial attachment and infectivity of LD-S and LD-R promastigotes with the host MΦs again indicating toward their ability to infect their host equally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, this LD-R-induced LDL-endocytosis is independent of the host’s LDL receptor and relies on fluid-phase endocytosis, involving significant actin cytoskeleton reorientation in LD-R-infected-MΦs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). It is worth mentioning that LD-R-infection has been reported to induce high levels of IL-10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mukherjee et al., 2013</xref>), which is linked with enhanced fluid-phase endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lucero et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, we also noted an increased convergence of endocytosed LDL-vesicles with lysosomal associated marker protein (LAMP-1), along with higher LAMP-1 expression around LD-R amastigotes as compared to LD-S ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Lysosomal acid hydrolases metabolize LDL into bioavailable cholesterol, and higher fusion of lysosomal vesicles with LD-R-PV explains the significant Filipin-cholesterol staining around LD-R amastigotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These findings not only confirm that endocytosed-LDL can be better utilized by LD-R amastigotes but probably also indicates toward a rapid maturation of LD-R-PV due to increased LDL-vesicle fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sood et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pessoa et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Although available RNAseq analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) did not support this increased expression of <italic>lamp-1</italic> in the transcript level, it did reflect a notable upregulation of vesicular fusion protein (VSP) <italic>vamp8</italic> and <italic>stx1a</italic> in response to LD-R-infection. How, LD infection can regulate LAMP-1 expression, and the role of VSPs in LDL-vesicle fusion with LD-R-PV is worthy of further investigation. It is possible and has been earlier reported that LD infection can regulate host proteins expression through post transcriptional and post translational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geraci et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tiwari et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Moradimotlagh et al., 2023</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that LD-R amastigote might be promoting an increased lysosomal biogenesis through any such mechanism to increase supply of bioavailable cholesterol through action of lysosomal acid hydrolases on LDL. Additionally, RNAseq analysis also showed suppressed expression of <italic>Npc1</italic> in LD-R-infected-MΦs. NPC-1 is crucial for mobilizing vesicular cholesterol to the cytoplasm and plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Urano et al., 2008</xref>), and its suppressed expression correlates with higher cholesterol availability for aggressive LD-R proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>Besides LDL endocytosis, de novo cholesterol synthesis could also serve as a lipid source for intracellular LD amastigotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boodhoo et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, LD-R-infected macrophages exhibited suppressed expression of HMGCR and SREBP2, the key regulators of de novo cholesterol biosynthesis. Additionally, SREBP2 showed minimal nuclear translocation in LD-R-infected macrophages compared to LD-S-infected cells, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), consistent with reports of a shutdown in de novo cholesterol synthesis in MΦs with high endocytosed LDL accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Prakash and Rai, 2022</xref>). Notably, SREBP2 regulates NPC-1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garver et al., 2008</xref>) and has been shown to get activated in response to LD-S-infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Prakash and Rai, 2022</xref>). Further RNA sequencing data also revealed a significant downregulation of <italic>hmgcs</italic> (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase) in LD-R-infected PECs as compared to LD-S-infection. Downregulation of HMGCS which catalyzes the condensation of acetyl-CoA with acetoacetyl-CoA to form 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA), which serves as an intermediate in both cholesterol biosynthesis and ketogenesis further supports our observation that LD-R-infected PECs preferentially rely on endocytosed-LDL-derived cholesterol rather than de novo synthesized cholesterol to support their metabolic needs.</p><p>Surprisingly, LD-R-infected-MΦs showed minimal inflammatory response despite high lipid accumulation, due to their ability to successfully exclude uptake of ox-LDL. Low expression of MSR-1, a scavenger receptor of ox-LDL, in the liver of LD-R-infected mice explained this observation, leading to the accumulation of neutral lipid droplets around LD-R amastigotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). Expansion microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liffner et al., 2023</xref>) along with TEM confirmed significant assimilation of these neutral lipids into LD-R amastigotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Several intracellular pathogens like <italic>Mycobacterium</italic>, <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, HCV have been reported to transfer stored triacylglycerols and sterol esters from lipid droplets to support their proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sonda and Hehl, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim and Shin, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Awadh, 2023</xref>). While the understanding of lipid uptake and metabolizing genes in LD is limited, a recent genome-wide CRISPR screen in <italic>L. mexicana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">LeishGEM, 2024</xref>), have identified such potential candidates ‘essential’ for parasite survival. Close proximity lipid droplets with LD-R amastigotes makes it tempting to speculate existence of lipid droplets contact sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sood et al., 2024</xref>), or possible copy number variations in these lipid metabolizing genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Downing et al., 2011</xref>), providing survival advantages to LD-R. This speculation is further supported by the fact that although clinical LD-R-isolates with neutral lipid droplet accumulation in infected MΦs displayed increased unresponsiveness to Amp-B, lab-generated Amp-B unresponsive promastigotes failed to do so in infected MΦs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Fact that LD-R amastigotes regained their responsiveness toward Amp-B in low lipid medium or in presence of Aspirin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banerjee et al., 2022</xref>), further confirms that eliminating lipid droplets around LD-R amastigotes might be a weapon of choice to combat treatment failure against Amp-B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Purkait et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Srivastava, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Patole et al., 2014</xref>). Our results thus suggest that natural clinical LD-R-isolates have developed an inherent adaptability to gradually develop cross-resistance toward Amp-B, probably as an additional consequence of their ability to accumulate increased host-derived lipids as a rapidly proliferating intracellular amastigote (represented graphically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Our work explains increasing Amp-B treatment failure among VL patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Purkait et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Srivastava, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Patole et al., 2014</xref>) and correlates with low serum LDL and cholesterol levels in patients relapsing after Amp-B treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, Table 2).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Scrutinized uptake of host lipids results in breakdown of Amphotericin-B responsiveness in clinical LD isolates with primary resistance to antimony.</title><p>LD-R reside within membrane-bound parasitophorous vacuoles (PVs) and actively modulate host actin cytoskeleton dynamics through cofilin-mediated depolymerization, inducing high fluid-phase endocytosis of low-density lipoprotein (LDL). The internalized LDL-containing vesicles subsequently fuse with LD-R-associated PVs, facilitating increased lipid acquisition essential for their aggressive intracellular proliferation. In these fused membranes, the vesicular cholesterol export protein NPC-1 is downregulated, effectively sequestering LDL-derived cholesterol within the PV and preventing its release into the host cytoplasm. Concurrently, LDL-derived cholesterol esters either directly or getting processed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) can lead to the formation of lipid droplets (as presented by ?, since it needs further investigation). Lipid droplets then accumulate in and around the LD-R-PV. This lipid droplet accumulation is a key factor in rendering LD-R-infections unresponsive to Amphotericin-B. Additionally, LD-R regulate inflammatory responses linked to oxidized lipid (ox-LDL) accumulation by downregulating macrophage scavenger receptor 1 (MSR-1). The elevated LDL-influx also leads to a shutdown of de novo cholesterol biosynthesis by restricting the nuclear translocation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-102857-fig9-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents</title><p>Laurdan (Merck), photoRED-LDL (Thermo Fisher Scientific), NBD Cholesterol (Sigma), Nile red (Sigma-Aldrich), Oil-red-O (Thermo Fisher Scientific), Filipin (Sigma-Aldrich), and Collagenase (Gibco) were purchased.

At 24 hr p.i., the KCs were washed using PBS, fixed with 2% PFA and proceeded to perform Raman spectroscopy (Witec, alpha300R). The Raman grade stainless steel plates were positioned on the microscope stage and focused with a 100× air objective and measurements were performed using a 532-nm laser source producing a laser spot of approximately 0.3 µm with 20 mW laser power. Spectral measurements were obtained through the Project FIVE interface (Witec, Germany) after setting the grating to 600 gratings/mm. The spectral resolution was set to 2.87 cm<sup>−1</sup>. The Raman spectra were taken with integration time set to 5 s, and 10 accumulations were selected after confirming its effectiveness on the KCs being studied.

Data were demonstrated as mean ± SD of all five individual experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>Lysates of LD-infected PECs and KCs were prepared, and western blotting was performed for different proteins with endogenous control β-actin (Cell Signaling Technology). Blots were probed with specific antibodies. Binding of secondary HRP-labeled goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse Abs was analyzed using SuperSignalR West Pico or West Dura Chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Confocal and structural illumination microscopy</title><p>PECs and KCs were cultured on 13 mm diameter glass coverslips at a density of 2 × 10<sup>5</sup>, and infected with LD as mentioned previously. After varying time intervals, infected PECs or KCs were rinsed with PBS, fixed with 2% PFA, and permeabilized using 0.2% Triton/PBS for 20 min on an orbital shaker. Non-specific binding was blocked with 2% BSA in 0.2% Triton/PBS for another 20 min on an orbital shaker. The PECs and KCs were then incubated with primary antibodies for 1 hr, followed by washing and staining with IgG Alexa Fluor 594 or IgG Alexa Fluor 488, as required. Mounting was performed using Fluromount-G-DAPI (Thermo Scientific). Images were captured using Olympus confocal microscopy (FV3000) and super-resolution microscopy ZEISS (SIM) with a 63× objective. 3D image visualization processed through Fiji 3D viewer and 3D project plugin. Live cell microscopy was performed using ZEISS phase contrast microscope and ZEISS Apotome. MΦs were plated on confocal dish and incubated with photoRED-LDL for live cell imaging of LDL uptake (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Image processing and analysis</title><p>Image processing and analysis were conducted using Fiji (ImageJ). For optimal visualization, Giemsa-stained macrophages (MΦs) were represented in gray scale to enhance contrast and structural clarity. To improve the distinction of different fluorescent signals, pseudo-colors were assigned to fluorescence images, ensuring better differentiation between various cellular components. For colocalization analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), we utilized the RGB profile plot plugin in ImageJ, which allows for the precise assessment of signal overlap by generating fluorescence intensity profiles across selected regions of interest. This approach provided quantitative insights into the spatial relationship between labeled molecules within infected cells. Additionally, for analysing the distribution of cofilin in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the ImageJ surface plot plugin was employed. This tool enabled three-dimensional visualization of fluorescence intensity variations, facilitating a more detailed examination of cofilin localization and its potential reorganization in response to infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Lipid droplet staining</title><p>LD-infected-KCs were first fixed using 2% PFA and subsequently permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100. Coverslips were then treated with Nile red (Sigma, diluted 1:100) in PBS for at least 1 hr to stain lipids, followed by DNA staining with DAPI. The coverslips were mounted onto glass slides using Fluoromount-G and visualized with confocal microscope (LEICA STELLARIS 5). 3D stacks were acquired to visualize distribution of lipid droplets. Images were processed and analyzed, and stacks were merged to reconstruct 3D images using Fiji.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Ultrastructure expansion microscopy</title><p>Ultrastructure expansion microscopy was conducted on LD-infected-MΦs following established experimental protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liffner et al., 2023</xref>). Protein crosslinking was initiated by immersing the coverslip in a solution containing 1.4% formaldehyde, 2% acrylamide, and PBS for 5 hr at 37°C. Monomer solution (19% sodium acrylate, 10% acrylamide, and 0.1% <italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>′-methylenbisacrylamide in PBS) was mixed with 10% TEMED and 10% APS solution on ice and added to 6-well pates. Gelation was performed on ice, with cell-plated coverslip placed face down on the gelation solution in a humid chamber for 5 min at 37°C for 1 hr. The gel and coverslip were together transferred to a 6-well plate filled with denaturation buffer (200 mM SDS, 200 mM NaCl, and 50 mM Tris pH 9.0) and incubated face up for 15 min at room temperature under agitation, followed by incubation at 95°C for 1.5 hr. The first expansion phase involved incubating the gel three times in ddH<sub>2</sub>O for 30 min each. Previously mentioned IFA steps were adopted for antibody staining. Images were captured using an Olympus confocal microscope (FV3000) equipped with a 63× 1.4 NA oil objective and Small Volume Computational Clearing mode was used to obtain deconvolved images. 3D stacks were acquired and analyzed using Fiji software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Transmission electron microscopy</title><p>For TEM, PECs infected with the LD-R strain were fixed after 24 hr of infection using 2.5% glutaraldehyde, an electron microscopy (EM) grade fixative.

Among these, nine samples were obtained from healthy individuals residing in endemic regions to serve as controls. Serum was isolated from each blood sample through centrifugation, and the lipid profile was subsequently analyzed using a specialized diagnostic kit (Coral Clinical System) following the manufacturer’s protocol.</p></sec><sec id="s4-30"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 8 on raw datasets to ensure robust and reproducible results. For datasets involving comparisons across multiple conditions, one- or two-way ANOVA was conducted, followed by Tukey’s post hoc test to assess pairwise differences while controlling for multiple comparisons. A 95% CI was applied to determine the statistical reliability of the observed differences. For non-parametric comparisons across multiple groups, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were employed, maintaining a 95% CI, which is particularly useful for analysing skewed data distributions. In cases where only two groups were compared, Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test was used to determine statistical significance, ensuring an accurate assessment of mean differences. All quantitative data are represented as mean ± SEM to illustrate variability within experimental replicates. Statistical significance was determined at p ≤ 0.05. Notation for significance levels: *p ≤ 0.05; **p ≤ 0.001; ***p ≤ 0.0001.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Supervision, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>In this study, all procedures involving human participants were conducted in accordance with the ethical standards of the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and approval of the 'Institutional Human Ethical Committee' of ICMR-Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, India (Approval No. RMRI/EC/20/2020).

It is of interest to determine the properties that favor the retention of their drug resistance phenotype even in the absence of the selective pressure that the drug would otherwise exert. The hypothesis that these authors set out to test is that these parasites have developed a new capacity to acquire and utilize lipids, especially cholesterol, which enables them to grow robustly in infected hosts. The authors present compelling evidence that supports their hypothesis. However, the genetic basis for the parasite's gluttony for lipids remains unresolved.</p><p>An issue raised in the initial review was the insufficient detail in the discussion of experiments in which parasitophorous vacuoles were isolated from infected cells and their molecular content was investigated. In this new version, the authors have provided more details of those experiments, including the relative enrichment of the preparations.</p><p>A puzzling observation for which they provide compelling evidence is the capacity of LD-R parasites to undergo logarithmic growth between 4 and 24 hours in infected cells. Interestingly, after logarithmic growth within the macrophages at those early times, parasite growth slows down inexplicably after 24 hours. One is left to imagine what the consequences of such growth within an infected host will be.</p><p>They made the novel observation that Lamp1 expression increases as early as 4 hours after infection with LD-R and by 12 hours after infection with both LD-S and LD-R. Interestingly, transcription analysis did not provide evidence for increased Lamp1 transcripts, leaving open the possibility that parasite infection may exert control over host cell biology at the translational level. How this might be achieved and what genes would be targets for such controls are open questions.</p><p>The dynamic changes in lipid biosynthesis pathways, in comparison to lipid uptake and the formation of lipid droplets in infected cells, are tracked.

It is of interest to determine what are the properties that favor the retention of their drug resistance phenotype even in the absence of the selective pressure that would otherwise be conferred by the drug. The hypothesis that these authors set out to test is that these parasites have developed a new capacity to acquire and utilize lipids, especially cholesterol which affords them the capacity to grow robustly in infected hosts.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely appreciate Reviewer 1's thoughtful and positive evaluation of our manuscript. We acknowledge that the reviewer has a few major concerns, and we would like to address them one by one in the following section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major issues:</p><p>(1) There are several experiments for which they do not provide sufficient details, but proceed to make significant conclusions.</p><p>Experiments in section 5 are poorly described. They supposedly isolated PVs from infected cells. No details of their protocol for the isolation of PVs are provided. They reference a protocol for PV isolation that focused on the isolation of PVs after L. amazonensis infection. In the images of infection that they show, by 24 hrs, infected cells harbor a considerable number of parasites. Is it at the 24 hr time point that they recover PVs? What is the purity of PVs? The authors should provide evidence of the success of this protocol in their hands. Earlier, they mentioned that using imaging techniques, the PVs seem to have fused or interconnected somehow. Does this affect the capacity to recover PVs? If more membranes are recovered in the PV fraction, it may explain the higher cholesterol content.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for correctly pointing out lack of details regarding PV isolation and its purity. There are multiple questions raised by the reviewer and we will answer them one by one in a point wise manner:</p><p>Firstly, “Is it at the 24 hr time point that they recover PVs?”</p><p>In the ‘Methods’ section of the original submission (Line number 606-611), there is a separate section on “Parasitophorous vacuole (PV) Isolation and cholesterol measurement”, where it is clearly mentioned, “24Hrs LD infected KCs were lysed by passing through a 22-gauge syringe needle to release cellular contents. Parasitophorous vacuoles (PV) were then isolated using a previously outlined protocol [Ref: 73].” However, we do acknowledge further details might be useful to enrich this section, and hence we would like to include the following details in the Methods section of the revised manuscript, Line 663-678 “Parasitophorous vacuoles (PV) were isolated using a previously outlined protocol with slight modifications [76]. 107 KCs were seeded in a 100 mm plate and allowed to adhere for 24Hrs. Following this infection was performed with <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> (LD) for 24Hrs, the infected KCs were then harvested by gentle scraping and lysed through five successive passages through an insulin needle to ensure membrane disruption while preserving organelle integrity. The lysate was centrifuged at 200 × g for 10mins at 4°C to remove intact cells and large debris. The resulting supernatant was carefully collected and subjected to a discontinuous sucrose density gradient (60%, 40%, and 20%). The gradient was centrifuged at 700 × g for 25mins at 4°C to facilitate organelle separation. The interphase between the 40% and 60% sucrose layers, enriched with PVs, was carefully collected and subjected to a final centrifugation step at 12,000 × g for 25mins at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded, and the resulting pellet was enriched for purified parasitophorous vacuoles, suitable for downstream biochemical and molecular analyses. Cholesterol and protein contents in PV were determined by an Amplex Red assay kit and Bradford assay, respectively. Resulting data were represented as micrograms of cholesterol per microgram of protein.”</p><p>Secondly, What is the purity of PVs? Earlier, they mentioned that using imaging techniques, the PVs seem to have fused or interconnected somehow. Does this affect the capacity to recover PVs? If more membranes are recovered in the PV fraction, it may explain the higher cholesterol content.</p><p>We appreciate the reviewer for pointing this critical lack of data in the submitted manuscript. In the revised manuscript, we have now provided data on the purity of isolated fraction by performing Confocal imaging and Western blot against PV and cytoplasmic fraction in the revised manuscript. We admit, as rightly pointed out by the reviewer we need to access the purity of isolated PV in our experiment. As suggested by the reviewer, we have included the results of this experiment in the Figure 3C i, C ii and C iii. Our results clearly showed an efficient PV isolation with demarcating LAMP-1 positive staining around LD amastigotes, which was further validated by Western Blot showing a significant enrichment of LAMP-1 specifically in the PV fraction. This has been included as (Line 225-234), in the revised manuscript which read as, “Parasitophorous vacuole fractions were isolated from LD-S and LD-R-infected KCs at 24Hrs p.i. using a previously established protocol [35]. Following isolation, PV purity was confirmed through LAMP-1 staining which showed a significant enrichment around isolated PV in Confocal microscopy (Figure 3C i). Purity of isolated PV fractions was further confirmed by Western blot which showed an enhanced enrichment of LAMP-1 for LD-R-PV fraction as compared to LD-S-PV fraction, while PV excluded cellular fraction showed residual LAMP-1 expression confirming the purity of the isolated PV fractions (Figure 3C ii, iii). Following isolation, protein concentration was measured for isolated PV fractions using the Bradford assay, and PV fractions from both LD-S- and LD-R-infected KCs were normalized accordingly.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In section 6 they evaluate the mechanism of LDL uptake in macrophages. Several approaches and endocytic pathway inhibitors are employed. The authors must be aware that the role of cytochalasin D in the disruption of fluid phase endocytosis is controversial. Although they reference a study that suggests that cytochalasin D has no effect on fluid-phase endocytosis, other studies have found the opposite (doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0058054). It wasn't readily evident what concentrations were used in their study. They should consider testing more than 1 concentration of the drug before they make their conclusions on their findings on fluid phase endocytosis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful comment and we apologise for missing out mentioning Cytochalasin-D concentration. To clarify, LDL uptake by LD-R infected KCs is LDL-receptor independent as clearly shown in Section 6, Figure 4A, Figure S4A, Figure S4B i and Figure S4B ii in the submitted manuscript. In (Figure 4F and Figure S4D) of the submitted manuscript, as referred by the Reviewer, Cytochalasin-D was used at a concentration of 2.5µg/ml. At this concentration, we did not observe any effect of Cytochalasin-D on LDL-receptor independent fluid phase endocytosis as intracellular LD-R amastigotes was able to uptake LDL successfully and proliferate in infected Kupffer cells, unlike Latranculin-A (5µM) treatment which completely inhibited intracellular proliferation of LD-R amastigotes by blocking only receptor independent Fluid phase endocytosis (Video 2A and 2B and Figure 4E in the submitted manuscript). In fact, the study referred by the reviewer (doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0058054), used a concentration of 4µg/ml Cytochalasin-D which did affect both LDL-receptor dependent and also receptor independent endocytosis in bone marrow derived macrophages. We would also like to clarify that in this work during our preliminary experiments we have also tested higher concentration Cytochalasin-D (5µg/ml). However, even at this higher concentration there were no significant effect of Cytochalasin-D on LD-R induced LDL-receptor independent fluid phase endocytosis as observed from intracellular LD-R amastigote count. Thus, we strongly believe that Cytochalasin-D does not have any impact on LD-R induced fluid phase endocytosis even at higher concentration. We have now included this data as Figure 4F and Figure S4E in the revised manuscript. Further, to clear out any confusion that readers might have, and also concentration of all the inhibitors used in the study will be mentioned in the Result section (Line 278 and 284), as well as in the revised Figure labels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In Figure 5 they present a blot that shows increased Lamp1 expression from as early as 4 hrs after infection with LD-R and by 12 hrs after infection of both LD-S and LD-R. Increased Lamp1 expression after Leishmania infection has not been reported by others. By what mechanism do they suggest is causing such a rapid increase (at 4hrs post-infection) in Lamp-1 protein? As they report, their RNA seq data did not show an increase in LAMP1 transcription (lines 432-434).</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to express our gratitude to the reviewer for highlighting the novelty of this observation. Indeed, to the best of our knowledge, no similar findings (we could not find reference of any quantitative Western blot for LAMP-1) have been reported previously in primary macrophages infected with <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> (LD). Firstly, we would like to point out, as stated in the Methods section (Lines 556–566) of the submitted manuscript: &quot;Flow-sorted metacyclic LD promastigotes were used at a MOI of 1:10 (with variations of 1:5 and 1:20 in some cases) for 4 hours, which was considered the 0th point of infection. Macrophages were subsequently washed to remove any extracellular loosely attached parasites and incubated further as per experimental requirements.” This indicates that our actual study points correspond to approximately the 8th and 28th hours post-infection”. We just wanted to clarify the time point just to prevent any potential confusion.</p><p>Now regarding LAMP1 expression, although we could not find any previous reports of its expression in LD infected primary macrophages, we would like to mention that there is a previous report (doi.org/10.1128/mBio.01464-20), which shows a similar punctuated LAMP-1 upregulation (as observed by us in Figure 5A i of the submitted manuscript) in response to leishmania infection in nonphagocytic fibroblast. It is tempting to speculate that increased LAMP-1 expression observed in response to LD-R infected macrophages might be due to increased lysosomal biogenesis, required for degrading increased endocytosed-LDL into bioavailable cholesterol. However, since no change in LAMP-1 expression in RNA seq data (Figure 6, of the submitted manuscript), we can only speculate that this is happening due to some post transcriptional or post translational modifications. But further work will definitely require to investigate this mechanism in details which is beyond the scope of this work. That is why, in the submitted manuscript, (Line 432-435), we have discussed this, “Although available RNAseq analysis (Figure 6) did not support this increased expression of lamp-1 in the transcript level, it did reflect a notable upregulation of vesicular fusion protein (VSP) vamp8 and stx1a in response to LD-R-infection. LD infection can regulate LAMP-1 expression, and the role of VSPs in LDLvesicle fusion with LD-R-PV is worthy of further investigation.”</p><p>However, we agree with the reviewer that this might not be enough for the clarification. Hence in the revised manuscript this has been updated in the Discussion section (Line 465-472) as follows, “Although available <italic>RNAseq</italic> analysis (Figure 6) did not support this increased expression of <italic>lamp-1</italic> in the transcript level, it did reflect a notable upregulation of vesicular fusion protein (VSP) <italic>vamp8</italic> and <italic>stx1a</italic> in response to LD-R-infection. How, LD infection can regulate LAMP-1 expression, and the role of VSPs in LDL-vesicle fusion with LD-R-PV is worthy of further investigation. It is possible and has been earlier reported that LD infection can regulate host proteins expression through post transcriptional and post translational modifications [61-63]. It is tempting to speculate that LD-R amastigote might be promoting an increased lysosomal biogenesis through any such mechanism to increase supply of bioavailable cholesterol through action of lysosomal acid hydrolases on LDL.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) In Figure 6, amongst several assays, they reported on studies where SPC-1 is knocked down in PECs. They failed to provide any evidence of the success of the knockdown, but nonetheless showed greater LD-R after NPC-1 was knocked down. They should provide more details of such experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Although we do understand the concern raised by the reviewer, this statement in question is factually incorrect. We would like to point out that in Figure 6F i, of the submitted manuscript (Figure 6G ii in the revised manuscript), we have demonstrated decreased NPC-1 staining following transfection with NPC-1-specific siRNA, whereas no such reduction was observed with scrambled RNA. Similar immunofluorescence data confirming LDL-receptor knockdown has also been provided in Figure S4B i of the submitted manuscript (Figure S4B ii in the revised manuscript). However, we acknowledge that the reviewer may be referring to the lack of quantitative validation of the knockdown via Western blot. We would like to clarify although, we already had this data, but we did not include it to avoid duplication to reduce the data density of the MS. But as suggested by the reviewer, we have included western blot for both NPC-1 and LDL-receptor knock down in the revised manuscript as Figure 6G i and Figure S4B i which again confirms an efficient Knock down of NPC-1 and LDLr as we have observed with IFA.</p><p>Additionally, as suggested by the reviewer, we also noticed lack of details in Methods section of the submitted manuscript, concerning siRNA mediated Knock down (KD). Therefore, we have included more details in the revised manuscript (Line 821-828), which read as, “For all siRNA transfections, Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Reagent (Life Technologies, 13778100) specifically designed for knockdown assays in primary cells was used according to the manufacturer's instructions with slight modifications. PECs were seeded into 24-well plates at a density of 1x10<sup>5</sup> per well, and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2. The transfection complex, comprising (1µl Lipofectamine RNAiMAX and 50µl Opti MEM) and (1 µl siRNA and 50µl Opti MEM) mixed together directly added to the incubated PECs. Gene silencing was checked by IFA and by Western blot as mentioned previously.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor issues</p><p>(1) There is an implication that parasite replication occurs well before 24hrs post-infection?</p><p>Studies on Leishmania parasite replication have reported on the commencement of replication after 24hrs post-infection of macrophages (PMCID: PMC9642900). Is this dramatic increase in parasite numbers that they observed due to early parasite replication?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful comment and appreciate the opportunity to clarify our findings. Indeed, as rightly assumed by the Reviewer, as our data suggest, and we also believe that this increase intracellular amastigotes number is a consequence of early replication of <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic>. As already mentioned in response to Point number 3 raised by Reviewer 1, we would again like to highlight that in the Methods section (Lines 562–566), it is clearly stated: &quot;Flow-sorted metacyclic LD promastigotes were used at a MOI of 1:10 (with variations of 1:5 and 1:20 in some cases) for 4 hours, which was considered the 0th point of infection. Macrophages were subsequently washed to remove any extracellular loosely attached parasites and incubated further as per experimental requirements.” This effectively means that our actual study points correspond to approximately the 8th and 28th hours post-infection and we just want to mention it to avoid any confusion regarding experimental time points.</p><p>Now, regarding specific concern related to Leishmania parasite replication, we would like to point out that the study referred by the reviewer on the commencement of replication after 24hrs, was conducted on <italic>Leishmania major</italic>, which may differ significantly from <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> owing to its species and strain-specific characteristics (PMCID: PMC9642900). In fact, doubling time of <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> (LD) has been previously reported to be approximately 11.4 hours (doi: 10.1111/j.1550-7408. 1990.tb01147.x). Moreover, multiple studies have indicated an exponential increase in intracellular LD amastigote number (more than two-fold increase) by 24Hrs post infection. (doi:10.1128/AAC.0119607, doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2011.07.013). We also have a similar observation for both infected PEC and KC as depicted in Figure 1C and Figure S1C in the submitted and revised manuscript indicating that active replication is happening in this time frame for <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic>. Hence it was an informed decision from our side to focus on 24Hrs time point to perform the analysis on intracellular LD proliferation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Several of the fluorescence images in the paper are difficult to see. It would be helpful if a blown-up (higher magnification image of images in Figure 1 (especially D) for example) is presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for the inconvenience. Although we have provided Zoomed images for several other Figures in the submitted manuscript and revised manuscript, like Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6 and Figure 8. However, this was not always doable for all the figures (like for Figure 1D), due to lack of space and Figure arrangements requirements. However, to accommodate Reviewer’s request we have provide a blown-up image for Figure 1D iii in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The times at which they choose to evaluate their infections seem arbitrary. It is not clear why they stopped analysis of their KC infections at 24 hrs. As mentioned above, several studies have shown that this is when intracellular amastigotes start replicating. They should consider extending their analyses to 48 or 72 hrs post-infection. Also, they stop in vitro infection of Apoe/- mice at 11 days. Why? No explanation is given for why only 1 point after infection.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer has raised two independent concerns and we would like to address them individually.</p><p>Firstly, “The times at which they choose to evaluate their infections seem arbitrary. It is not clear why they stopped analysis of their KC infections at 24 hrs. As mentioned above, several studies have shown that this is when intracellular amastigotes start replicating. They should consider extending their analyses to 48 or 72 hrs post-infection.”</p><p>We have already provided a detail justification for time point selection in our response to Reviewer 1, Minor Comment 1. As mentioned already we observed a significant and sharp rise in the number of intracellular amastigotes between 4Hrs and 24Hrs post-infection in KC, with replication rate appeared to be not increasing proportionally (not doubling) after that (Figure 1C in the revised manuscript). This early stage of rapid replication of LD amastigotes, therefore likely coincides with a critical period of lipid acquisition by intracellular amastigotes (Video 3A and 3B and Figure 4E in the submitted manuscript and revised manuscript) and thus 24Hrs infected KC was specifically selected. In this regard, we would further like to add that at 72Hrs post-infection, we noticed a notable number of infected Kupffer cells began detaching from the wells with extracellular amastigotes probably egressing out. This phenomenon potentially reflects the severe impact of prolonged infection on Kupffer cell viability and adhesion properties as shown in Video 2 in the revised manuscript and Author response image 1. This observation further influenced our decision to conclude all infection studies in Kupffer cells by the 48Hrs post-infection, which necessitate to complete the infection time point at 24 Hrs, for allowing treatment of Amp-B for another 24 Hrs (Figure 8, and Figure S5, in the submitted manuscript and revised manuscript). We acknowledge that we should have been possibly clearer on our selection of infection time points and as the Reviewer have suggested we have included this information in the revised manuscript (Line 134-141) for clear understanding of the reader. This read as, “Interestingly, as compared to a significant and sharp rise in the number of intracellular amastigotes between 4Hrs and 24Hrs post infected KC in response to LD-R infection, the number of intracellular amastigotes although increased significantly did not doubled from 24Hrs to 48Hrs p.i. suggesting exponential LD amastigote replication between 4Hrs and 24Hrs time frame and slowing down after that (Figure 1Ci, ii). Moreover, it was also noticed that at 72Hrs p.i. a notable number of infected-KC began detaching from the wells with extracellular amastigotes probably egressing out from the infected-KCs (Video 2). Thus, 24Hrs time point was selected to conduct all further infection studies involving KCs.”</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Representative images of Kupffer cells infected with <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> at 72Hrs post-infection showing a significant morphological change.</title><p>Infected cells exhibit a rounded morphology and progressive detachment.

Why? No explanation is given for why only 1 point after infection.”</p><p>We apologize for not providing an explanation regarding the selection of the 11-day time point for <italic>Apoe-/-</italic> experiments (Figure 2 of the submitted and revised manuscript). Our rationale for this choice is based on both previous literature and the specific objectives of our study. Previous report suggests that <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> infection in hypercholesteraemic <italic>Apoe-/-</italic> mice triggers a heightened inflammatory response at approximately six weeks’ post-infection compared to C57BL/6 mice, leading to more efficient parasite clearance. This is owing to unique membrane composition of Apoe<sup>-/-</sup> which rectifies leishmania mediated defective antigen presentation at a later stage of infection (DOI 10.1194/jlr.M026914). Additionally, previous studies have also indicated that <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> infection is well-established in vivo within 6 to 11 days post-infection in murine models (doi: 10.1128/AAC.47.5.1529-1535.2003). Given that in this experiment we particularly aimed to assess the early infection status (parasite load) in diet-induced hypercholesterolemic mice, we would like to argue that the selection of the 11-day time point was rational and well-aligned with our study objectives as this time point within this window are optimal for capturing initial parasite burden depending on initial lipid utilization, before host-driven immune clearance mechanisms could significantly alter infection dynamics. We have included this explanation in the revised manuscript (Line 170-179) as suggested by the Reviewer and this read as, “Previous report has suggested that LD infection in hypercholesteremic Apoe<sup>-/-</sup> mice triggers a heightened inflammatory response at approximately six weeks’ post-infection compared to wild type BL/6 mice, leading to more efficient parasite clearance. This is owing to unique membrane composition of Apoe-/- which rectifies leishmania mediated defective antigen presentation at a later stage of LD infection [20]. Additionally, previous studies have also indicated that LD infection is well-established in mice within 6 to 11 days post-infection in murine models [33]. Thus to evaluate impact of initial lipid utilization on LD amastigote replication in vivo, BL/6 and diet-induced hypercholesterolemic Apoe<sup>-/-</sup> mice were infected with GFP expressing LD-S or LD-R promastigotes and sacrificed 11 days p.i.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study by Pradhan et al. offers critical insights into the mechanisms by which antimonyresistant Leishmania donovani (LD-R) parasites alter host cell lipid metabolism to facilitate their own growth and, in the process, acquire resistance to amphotericin B therapy.

This is a critically missing piece in this nice study.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree with the Reviewer on this, a more detailed analysis of lipid droplets composition, dynamics of its formation and mechanism of lipid transfer to amastigotes residing within the PV would be worthy of further investigation. To answer the Reviewer, we are already conducting investigation in this direction and have very promising initial results which we are willing to share with the Reviewer as unpublished communication if requested. Since, we plan to address these questions independently, we hope Reviewer will understand our hesitation to include these data into the present work which is already data dense. We sincerely believe existence of lipid droplet contact sites with the PV along with the specific lipid type transfer to amastigotes and its mechanism requires special attention and could stand out as an independent work by itself.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The macrophages (PEC, KC) could have been treated with latex beads as a control, which would indicate that cholesterol and lipids are indeed utilized by the Leishmania parasitophorous vacuole (PV) and essential for its survival and proliferation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this nice suggestion, which we believe will further strengthen the conclusion of this work. We have now included this data as Figure 5E in the revised manuscript. Our data showed that infected KC harbouring both LD-R amastigotes and Fluorescent Latex Beads, showed a concentrated staining of Cholesterol around amastigotes, with no positive Cholesterol staining around internalized latex beads similar to LD-S amastigotes. This observation clearly confirmed specific lipid uptake in LD-R-PV, which can not be replicated by phagocytosed Latex Beads.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) HMGCoA reductase is an important enzyme for the mevalonate pathway and cholesterol synthesis. The authors have not commented on this enzyme in either host or parasite. Additionally, western blots of these enzymes along with SREBP2 could have been performed.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the concern and do see the point why reviewer is suggesting this. We would like to mention that regarding HMGCoA we already do have real time qPCR data which perfectly aligns with our RNAseq data (Figure 6 A i, in the submitted and revised manuscript), showing significant downregulation specifically in LD-R infected KC as compared to uninfected control. We are including this data as Author response image 2. However, we did not proceed with checking the level of HMGCoA at the protein level as we noticed several previous reports have suggested that HMGCoA reductase remains under transcriptional control of SERBP2 (doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2011.03.005, doi: 10.1194/jlr.C066712, doi:10.1194/jlr.RA119000201), which acts the master regulator of mevalonate pathway and cholesterol synthesis (doi.org/10.1161/ATVBAHA.122.317320) and SERBP2 remains significantly downregulated in response to LD-R infection (Figure 6B i and Figure 6C in the submitted and revised manuscript). However, as suggested by the Reviewer, we have updated this data in the revised manuscript as Figure 6D. Western blot data further confirmed a significant expected downregulation of HMGCoA in response to LD-R infection.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>qPCR Analysis of HMGCR Expression Following <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> Infection: Quantitative PCR analysis showing the relative expression of <italic>hmgcr</italic> (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase) in Kupffer cells after 24 hours of <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> (LD) infection compared to uninfected control cells.</title><p>Gene expression levels are normalized to <italic>β-actin</italic> as an internal control, and fold change is represented relative to the uninfected condition.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-102857-sa2-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) The authors should discuss the expression pattern of any enzyme of the mevalonate pathway that they have found to be dysregulated in the transcript data.</p></disp-quote><p>As per the reviewer’s suggestion, we have looked into the <italic>RNA seq</italic> data and observed that apart from <italic>hmgcr</italic>, <italic>hmgcs</italic> (3-hydroxy-3methylglutaryl-CoA synthase), another key enzyme in the mevalonate pathway, is significantly downregulated in host PECs in response to LD-R infection compared to the LD-S infection.

Downregulation of HMGCS which catalyzes the condensation of acetyl-CoA with acetoacetyl-CoA to form 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA), which serves as an intermediate in both cholesterol biosynthesis and ketogenesis further supports our observation that LD-R-infected PECs preferentially rely on endocytosed low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-derived cholesterol rather than de novo synthesized cholesterol to support their metabolic needs.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e) The authors have followed a previously published protocol by Real F (reference 73) to enrich for parasitophorous vacuole (PV). However, they do not show how they ascertain that they have a purified fraction of the PV post-density gradient centrifugation. The authors should at least show Western blot data for LAMP1 for different fractions of density gradient from which they enriched the PV.</p></disp-quote><p>As we previously stated in our response to Reviewer 1, in the revised manuscript we have included a detailed analysis of purity for different fractions during PV isolation. We sincerely appreciate the reviewer for highlighting this important concern and for suggesting an approach to conduct the experiment. We have included this data as Figure 3C i, ii, iii in the revised manuscript. Our Imaging and Western blot data showed a significant enrichment of LAMP-1 in PV fraction, and we believe this result further reinforce the conclusions of our study on increased Cholesterol.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Presentation improvements:</p><p>a) Add a clear timeline for infection experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the Reviewer, we have included a schematic of Timelines for all the animal infection experiment (Figure 2Ci and Figure 7A,Fi) in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Provide more details on patient sample collection and analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included more details on the sample collection in the Method section of the revised manuscript (Line 830-835), “Blood samples were collected from a total of 22 individuals spanning a diverse age range (8 to 70 years) by RMRI, Bihar, India. Among these, nine samples were obtained from healthy individuals residing in endemic regions to serve as controls. Serum was isolated from each blood sample through centrifugation, and the lipid profile was subsequently analysed using a specialized diagnostic kit (Coral Clinical System) following the manufacturer's protocol.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Consider reorganizing figures to better separate mechanistic and clinical findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We felt that a major arrangement altering the sequence of the Figures as presented in the Original Submission will impact smooth flow of the story and hence, we did not disturb that. However, as suggested by the Reviewer we have performed major rearrangement within Figure 2, Figure 5 and Figure 6 and Figure 9 of the revised manuscript for a better representation of the data and convenience of the reader. Also, if the reviewer has specific suggestion regarding rearrangement of any particular figure, we will be happy to consider that.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Technical clarifications needed:</p><p>a) Specify exact concentrations used for inhibitors.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for this unwanted and unnecessary mistake. Please note we have now clearly mentioned the concentration of all the inhibitors used in this study in Result section and in the Figures of the revised manuscript. For easy understanding The revised section (Line 281-287) read as, “Finally, we infected the KCs with GFP expressing LD-R for 4Hrs, washed and allowed the infection to proceed in presence of fluorescent red-LDL and Latrunculin-A (5µM), a compound which specifically inhibits fluid phase endocytosis by inducing actin depolymerization [41]. Real-time fluorescence tracking demonstrated that Latrunculin-A treatment not only prevented the uptake of fluorescent red-LDL but also severely impacted intracellular proliferation of LD-R amastigotes (Video 2A and 2B and Figure 4E). In contrast, treatment with Cytochalasin-D, which alters cellular F-actin organization but does not affect fluid phase endocytosis [41], had no effect on the intracellular proliferation of LD-R irrespective of Cytochalasin-D concentrations (2.5µg/ml and 5µg/ml respectively) (Figure 4F and Figure S4D).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Include more details on image analysis methods.</p></disp-quote><p>Please note that in specific sections like in Line numbers 574-579, 653-658, 10471049 of the submitted manuscript, we have put special attention in describing the Image analysis process. However, we agree that in some particular cases more details will be appreciated by the reader. Hence, we have included an additional section of Image Analysis in the Methods section of the revised manuscript. This section (Line 727-739) read as, “Image processing and analysis were conducted using Fiji (ImageJ). For optimal visualization, Giemsa-stained macrophages (MΦs) were represented in grayscale to enhance contrast and structural clarity. To improve the distinction of different fluorescent signals, pseudo-colors were assigned to fluorescence images, ensuring better differentiation between various cellular components. For colocalization analysis (Figures 3, Figure 5, Figure 6, and Figure S2), we utilized the RGB profile plot plugin in ImageJ, which allows for the precise assessment of signal overlap by generating fluorescence intensity profiles across selected regions of interest. This approach provided quantitative insights into the spatial relationship between labelled molecules within infected cells. Additionally, for analyzing the distribution of cofilin in Figure 4, the ImageJ surface plot plugin was employed. This tool enabled three-dimensional visualization of fluorescence intensity variations, facilitating a more detailed examination of cofilin localization and its potential reorganization in response to infection.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Clarify statistical analysis procedures.</p></disp-quote><p>We have already provided a dedicated section of Statistical Analysis in the Methods section of the Original Submission and also have also shown the groups being compared to determine the statistical analysis in the Figure and in the Figure Legends of the submitted manuscript. Furthermore, as suggested by the Reviewer we have now also add additional clarification regarding the statistical analysis performed in the revised manuscript (Line 737-749). In the revised manuscript this section read as, “All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 8 on raw datasets to ensure robust and reproducible results. For datasets involving comparisons across multiple conditions, one-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted, followed by Tukey’s post hoc test to assess pairwise differences while controlling for multiple comparisons. A 95% confidence interval (CI) was applied to determine the statistical reliability of the observed differences. For non-parametric comparisons across multiple groups, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were employed, maintaining a 95% confidence interval, which is particularly useful for analysing skewed data distributions. In cases where only two groups were compared, Student’s t-test was used to determine statistical significance, ensuring an accurate assessment of mean differences. All quantitative data are represented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) to illustrate variability within experimental replicates. Statistical significance was determined at P ≤ 0.05. Notation for significance levels: *P ≤ 0.05; **P ≤ 0.001; ***P ≤ 0.0001.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Minor corrections:</p><p>a) Methods section could benefit from more details on Raman spectroscopy analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this suggestion of the Reviewer. For providing more clarity have incorporate additional details in the Methodology for the Raman section of the revised manuscript (Line 638-649). The updated section will read as follows in the revised manuscript. “For confocal Raman spectroscopy, spectral data were acquired from individual cells at 1000× magnification using a 100 × 100 μm scanning area, following previously established specifications. After spectral acquisition, distinct Raman shifts corresponding to specific biomolecular signatures were extracted for further analysis. These included: Cholesterol (535–545 cm¹), Nuclear components (780–790 cm¹), Lipid structures (1262–1272 cm<sup>1</sup>), Fatty acids (1436–1446 cm<sup>1</sup>) Following spectral extraction, pseudo-color mapping was applied to highlight the spatial distribution of each biomolecular component within the cell. These processed spectral images are presented in Figure 3D1, where the first four panels illustrate the individual biomolecular distributions. A merged composite image was then generated to visualize the co-localization of these biomolecules within the cellular microenvironment, with the final panel specifically representing the spatial distribution of key biomolecules.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) In the methods section line 609, page 14, the authors cite Real F protocol as reference 73 for PV enrichment. However, in the very next section on GC-MS analysis (lines 615-616, page 15), they state they have used reference 74 for PV enrichment. Can they explain why a discrepancy in PV isolation references this? Reference 74 does not mention anything related to PV isolation.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We would like to sincerely apologise for this confusion which probably raised from our writing of this section. We would like to confirm that our PV isolation protocol is based on the published work of Real F protocol (reference 73). However, in the next section of the submitted manuscript, GC-MS analysis was described and that was performed based on protocol referenced in 74. In the revised manuscript, we have avoided this confusion and made correction by putting the references in the proper places. In the revised manuscript, this section (Line 663-678) read as,</p><p>“GC-MS analysis of LD-S and LD-R-PV</p><p>Following a 24Hrs infection period, KCs were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and pelleted. Subsequent to this, PV isolation was carried out using the previously described protocol [35]. After PV isolation Bradford assay was carried out for normalizing the protein concentration. The resulting equal volume of PV pellet was suspended in 20 ml of dichloromethane: methanol (2:1, vol/vol) and incubated at 4°C for 24hours. After centrifugation (11,000 g, 1 hour, 4°C), the supernatant was checked through thin layer chromatography (TLC) and subsequently evaporated under vacuum. The residue and pellet were saponified with 30% potassium hydroxide (KOH) in methanol at 80°C for 2 hours. Sterols were extracted with n-hexane, evaporated, and dissolved in dichloromethane. A portion of the clear yellow sterol solution was treated with N, O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) and heated at 80°C for 1 hour to form trimethylsilyl (TMS) ethers. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis was performed using a Varian model 3400 chromatograph equipped with DB5 columns (methyl-phenylsiloxane ratio, 95/5; dimensions, 30 m by 0.25 mm). Helium was used as the gas carrier (1 ml/min). The column temperature was maintained at 270°C, with the injector and detector set at 300°C. A linear gradient from 150 to 180°C at 10°C/min was used for methyl esters, with MS conditions set at 280°C, 70 eV, and 2.2 kV[77].</p></body></sub-article></article>
