Multiple neural circuits involved in behavioral inhibition converge upon a key basal ganglia output nucleus, the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). To examine how changes in basal ganglia output contribute to self-restraint, we recorded SNr neurons during a proactive behavioral inhibition task. Rats responded to <italic>Go!</italic> cues with rapid leftward or rightward movements, but also prepared to cancel one of these movement directions on trials when a <italic>Stop!</italic> cue might occur. This action restraint – visible as direction-selective slowing of reaction times – altered both rates and patterns of SNr spiking. Overall firing rate was elevated before the <italic>Go!</italic> cue, and this effect was driven by a subpopulation of direction-selective SNr neurons. In neural state space, this corresponded to a shift away from the restrained movement. SNr neurons also showed more variable inter-spike intervals during proactive inhibition. This corresponded to more variable state-space trajectories, which may slow reaction times via reduced preparation to move. These findings open new perspectives on how basal ganglia dynamics contribute to movement preparation and cognitive control.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>behavioral inhibition</kwd><kwd>substantia nigra pars reticulata</kwd><kwd>population dynamics</kwd><kwd>spike variability</kwd><kwd>parkinson's disease</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH101697</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berke</surname><given-names>Joshua D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS123516</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berke</surname><given-names>Joshua D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005725</institution-id><institution>CHDI Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>A-13733</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berke</surname><given-names>Joshua D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Rats are slower to initiate actions when these actions may need to be cancelled, and this slowing is associated with increased and more variable neural firing in the substantia nigra pars reticulata.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fluid, efficient behavior often involves simply triggering well-learned behaviors. However, flexibility requires that such behaviors can be suppressed, should circumstances change. This capacity for behavioral inhibition is considered central to cognitive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bari and Robbins, 2013</xref>), and is compromised in a range of neurological and psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chambers et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Behavioral inhibition can be ‘reactive’ – for example, promptly responding to an unexpected <italic>Stop!</italic> cue by cancelling upcoming actions. Reactive inhibition has been shown to involve fast cue responses in frontal cortex and basal ganglia pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jahanshahi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wager et al., 2005</xref>), including from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) to SNr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schmidt et al., 2013</xref>). This rapid response to stimuli can transiently, and broadly, retard action initiation, providing time for a second set of basal ganglia mechanisms to cancel actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mallet et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schmidt and Berke, 2017</xref>).</p><p>By contrast, ‘proactive’ inhibition refers to an altered state of preparation, in which particular actions are restrained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Claffey et al., 2010</xref>). Proactive inhibition has been argued to be especially important for human life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aron, 2011</xref>), and is behaviorally apparent as longer reaction times (RTs) selectively for the restrained action. The underlying mechanisms are not well understood, but have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aron, 2011</xref>) to involve the pathway from striatum ‘indirectly’ to SNr, via globus pallidus pars externa (GPe). In a prior study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gu et al., 2020</xref>) we therefore recorded from GPe neurons as rats engaged proactive inhibition toward a specific action. The state of being prepared to stop did not involve an overall net change in GPe firing rate, but rather a shift at the level of neural population dynamics away from action initiation, and toward the alternative action. One objective of the present work was to determine whether a corresponding preparatory change in population dynamics is visible ‘downstream’ in SNr, thereby altering basal ganglia output.</p><p>Basal ganglia output neurons are thought to affect behavior not just via their firing rates, but also via their firing patterns and synchrony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rubin et al., 2012</xref>). In particular, Parkinson’s disease (PD) is associated with an increase in firing variability and synchronous bursting, often without rate changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lobb, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Willard et al., 2019</xref>). As PD is characterized by slowed movement initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Low et al., 2002</xref>), we assessed whether related physiological changes are present when movements are slowed as the result of proactive inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RTs are selectively slowed with proactive inhibition</title><p>We used a selective proactive inhibition task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gu et al., 2020</xref>), a variant of our extensively characterized rat stop-signal task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Leventhal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schmidt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mallet et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Rats start a trial by nose-poking an illuminated start port. To proceed, they need to maintain this position for a variable delay (500–1250 ms, uniform distribution) until a <italic>Go!</italic> cue is presented (1 or 4 kHz tone, indicating a leftward or rightward movement, respectively). If the movement is initiated rapidly after the <italic>Go!</italic> cue (RT limit &lt;800 ms), and completed correctly and promptly (movement time limit, MT &lt;500 ms), rats are rewarded with a sugar pellet dispensed at a separate food hopper. On a subset of trials, the <italic>Go!</italic> cue is followed by a <italic>Stop!</italic> cue (white noise burst; delay after <italic>Go!</italic> cue onset = 100–250 ms). This indicates that the rat should not initiate a movement, and instead hold their nose in the Center port for at least 800 ms (after <italic>Go!</italic> cue onset) to trigger reward delivery.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Selective proactive inhibition.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left, operant box configuration, with dashed red lines indicating photobeams for nose detection; right, event sequence for Go and Stop trials.

These were: no possibility of <italic>Stop!</italic> cue (‘No-Stop’); 50% probability that a left <italic>Go!</italic> cue will be followed by the <italic>Stop!</italic> cue (‘Maybe-Stop-left’); and 50% probability that a right <italic>Go!</italic> cue will be followed by the <italic>Stop!</italic> cue (‘Maybe-Stop-right’). We obtained SNr microelectrode recordings from rats (n=10) that had successfully learned this proactive task, as indicated by significant and selective slowing of RTs for movements contraversive to the implant side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). For example, if electrodes were placed in the right SNr, contraversive proactive inhibition would mean longer RTs for Maybe-Stop-left trials, compared to No-Stop trials.

At the same time our operational definition of proactive inhibition does not fully constrain which internal factors are at play – and these may vary both within, and between, individual subjects. Basal ganglia activity is especially affected by changes in reward expectation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lauwereyns et al., 2002</xref>) including in SNr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sato and Hikosaka, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yasuda and Hikosaka, 2017</xref>), producing faster RTs toward more rewarding movements.

Moreover, this bias could have produced pre-selection of the Ipsi movement, a factor also known to modulate SNr activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basso and Wurtz, 2002</xref>). However, the slower Contra RTs on Maybe-Stop-Contra trials were not accompanied by faster Ipsi RTs, suggesting that slowing of Contra movements did not result simply from a greater preparation of Ipsi movements.</p><p>Another internal factor potentially at play is uncertainty: in the Maybe-Stop conditions there are more potential future action paths than under No-Stop. This could increase vacillation between different preparatory states as rats wait for the Go! cue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kaufman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rich and Wallis, 2016</xref>), with corresponding increases in neural variability.</p><p>The SNr state-space bias during proactive inhibition may arise from the ‘indirect pathway’ projection from GPe, which we found to have a similar neural bias toward Ipsi movements in a prior study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gu et al., 2020</xref>). However, proactive inhibition also caused GPe population activity to shift further away from action initiation, which we did not observe for SNr. Furthermore, proactive inhibition produced no overall change in GPe firing rates, and we were not able to identify a distinct subpopulation of modulated GPe neurons. The reasons for these GPe: SNr differences are not clear. Recent modeling has demonstrated that the influence of the GABAergic GPe inputs over SNr neurons can be far more complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Simmons et al., 2020</xref>) than shown in classic rate models of basal ganglia function, for example, switching from inhibitory to excitatory in an activity-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Phillips et al., 2020</xref>). Alternatively, the shift in SNr Ipsi&gt;Contra neuron firing with proactive inhibition may reflect other basal ganglia inputs, particularly the direct pathway input from striatum, or hyperdirect via the STN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schmidt et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Impact on downstream targets</title><p>How might the elevated activity of SNr Ipsi&gt;Contra cells help restrain actions? To some extent, this elevation is compatible with classic models in which pauses in basal ganglia outflow disinhibit downstream targets to evoke movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chevalier and Deniau, 1990</xref>). Increased SNr activity while waiting for a Go! cue would enhance inhibition of movements, and the release of this inhibition might require longer to achieve, extending RTs. However, many of the Ipsi&gt;Contra cells with elevated firing in the Maybe-Stop condition did not have movement-related pauses, but rather increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Such increasing-type SNr cells have been commonly reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bryden et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Joshua et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lintz and Felsen, 2016</xref>), but their functional roles remain unclear. They may help suppress competing, alternative actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gulley et al., 2002</xref>), by acting either on downstream targets or through collateral inhibition of other SNr cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2014</xref>). Further studies, likely incorporating additional techniques, will be needed to resolve these and other possibilities.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Behavioral control and neural variability</title><p>Our study also leaves unresolved the origins of the increased SNr spike variability we observed with proactive inhibition. Like GPe and STN neurons, SNr neurons are intrinsic pacemakers that spontaneously fire regularly even if their inputs are blocked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhou and Lee, 2011</xref>). These inputs – which include the aforementioned direct and indirect pathways, and also extensive local collaterals within SNr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mailly et al., 2003</xref>) – thus alter SNr spiking by either accelerating or delaying the occurrence of the next spike. Changes in spike time variability presumably reflect either changes in local network properties, for example, due to neuromodulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Delaville et al., 2012</xref>) or changes in the statistics of extrinsic inputs. Causal manipulation of specific incoming synapse sets within SNr (e.g. optogenetic suppression of GPe or STN inputs) might usefully reveal the origins of neural variability and establish its contribution to proactive inhibition.</p><p>More variable SNr inter-spike intervals within-trials were associated with more variable trajectories through a more variable network state at <italic>Go!</italic> cue, and longer and more variable RTs. In the cortex, decreases in spike variability have been previously linked to various processes including stimulus onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Churchland et al., 2010</xref>), attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cohen and Maunsell, 2009</xref>), and movement preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Churchland et al., 2006</xref>). There is also evidence of within-trial changes in spike variability in the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berke, 2011</xref>). To our knowledge, there are no prior observations of specific task cues evoking <italic>increases</italic> in variability between or within trials. Our finding that variability increases with proactive inhibition – in particular following Stop-fail or premature trials – suggests that variability might be actively elevated as part of a behavioral strategy. This would fit with proposals that neural variability can confer behavioral advantages, such as increased flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Waschke et al., 2021</xref>). Alternatively, increased neural variability with proactive inhibition may simply reflect the <italic>absence</italic> of a reduction in variability that accompanies movement preparation. In this way, preparation to stop would consist, at least in part, of less preparation to go. Either way, our results demonstrate that cognitive control strategies can operate through shifts in neural variability.</p><p>Connecting single-neuron measures of variability to state-space concepts of movement preparation offers an intriguing perspective on PD, which is characterized by both slowed movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Low et al., 2002</xref>) and elevated single-neuron spike variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dorval et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lobb, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Willard et al., 2019</xref>). A more variable state of preparation may help explain why <italic>average</italic> RTs and movement times are slowed in PD, yet the fastest movements are still preserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mazzoni et al., 2007</xref>). An important goal for future studies is to better understand how shifts in neural variability occur in the basal ganglia, and whether they originate from the same mechanisms during both proactive inhibition and PD.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All animal experiments were approved by the University of California, San Francisco Committee for the Use and Care of Animals (#AN181071).

Approximately every two to three sessions, screws were turned to lower tetrodes by 100–160 µm; to avoid duplicate neurons, we did not include units from the same tetrode from multiple sessions unless the tetrodes had been moved between those sessions. We further excluded a small number of neurons on the same tetrode that appeared to be potential duplicates based on waveforms and firing properties (e.g. firing rates, CV, and behavioral correlations), even though the tetrode had been moved. After recording was complete, we anesthetized rats and made small marker lesions by applying 5–10 µA current for 20 s on one or two wires of each tetrode. After perfusing the rats, tissue sections (at 40 µm) were stained with cresyl violet or with CD11b antibody and compared to the nearest atlas section (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Paxinos and Watson, 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Data analysis</title><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Firing rates and functional classification of neurons</title><p>Firing rates were smoothed using a Gaussian kernel (30 ms SD) and normalized (Z-scored) using each neuron’s session-wide mean and SD.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Joshua Gold as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Gidon Felsen (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Enthusiasm is high for this study which was viewed as important for advancing our understanding of the role of the basal ganglia in behavioral inhibition. Although no new experiments are requested, the manuscript would benefit from some revisions to increase its clarity and a clearer discussion of how these results fit into the broader field.</p><p>A list of essential revisions to improve the clarity and presentation of the work are:</p><p>1. An additional analysis where within-session performance is analyzed.</p><p>2. Figure 2C-E: Population heat maps should be separated for ipsi vs. contra movements.</p><p>3. Clarify whether data for &quot;maybe stop&quot; trials only include Go trials, or if it also includes (failed) stop trials, and consider comparing data for these two types of trials, if that was not already done.</p><p>4. The Discussion section should be expanded to include more discussion of prior literature concerning how SNr neurons respond during movement and how upstream and downstream nuclei might be affected.</p><p>5. The writing was too concise in some places, particularly for Figure 2 and 3. Expansion of the rationale and methods for the analytical approaches used in these figures will clarify the paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– In Figure 2C, E, it would be helpful to see the population heat maps separately for ipsilateral and contralateral movements (as they are shown in the summary plots). Given that so many SNr neurons are direction selective, it is difficult to interpret activity averaged over both directions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I first recommend better describing and sometimes even motivating the methodologic choices of the present work. A significant part of the methods is described in figure legends. Sometimes the authors refer to a previous publication (Gu et al., 2020) instead of providing the information. This is fine to some extent, but I think that in the present case, including more information in the Methods section will help readers to better appreciate the authors' work. For example, it is unclear how &quot;task-related&quot; neurons have been categorized as such. It is also not clear to me what is the added value of the state-space analyses compared to the single-unit approach, especially those shown in Figure 3. As I understand it, the computation through the dynamics framework does not consider the &quot;task-related&quot; activity of cells as an important criterion. Instead, all cells are included to extract latent dynamics which, as a whole, are supposed to underlie behavior. I think that the two ways of analysing neural activity should be better motivated. Also, in the analysis shown in Figure 3, I wonder why trajectories of neurons recorded during sessions in which rats successfully applied proactive inhibition are not compared against trajectories depicted by neurons monitored during sessions in which rates failed to apply inhibition.</p><p>My second recommendation is to improve the Discussion section by commenting with more details on the points mentioned above: the unexpected modulation of SNr neurons given their pre-movement pattern; the comparison between GPe and SNr; the impact of SNr activity on target areas and, more globally, the broad picture of the role of the basal ganglia during movement inhibition control (both active and reactive).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82143.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Enthusiasm is high for this study which was viewed as important for advancing our understanding of the role of the basal ganglia in behavioral inhibition.
