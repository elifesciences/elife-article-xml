Using quantitative fluorescent imaging of <italic>FLC</italic> mRNA and protein, together with mathematical modeling, we find that <italic>FLC</italic> expression before cold is regulated by both analog and digital modes. We observe a temporal separation between the two modes, with analog preceding digital. The analog mode can maintain intermediate expression levels at individual <italic>FLC</italic> gene copies, before subsequent digital silencing, consistent with the copies switching OFF stochastically and heritably without cold. This switch leads to a slow reduction in <italic>FLC</italic> expression at the cell population level. These data present a new paradigm for gradual repression, elucidating how analog transcriptional and digital epigenetic memory pathways can be integrated.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>quantitative gene expression</kwd><kwd>Single molecule RNA FISH</kwd><kwd>FLC</kwd><kwd>mathematical modeling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/P020380/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dean</surname><given-names>Caroline</given-names></name><name><surname>Dean</surname><given-names>Caroline</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018-04101</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meschichi</surname><given-names>Anis</given-names></name><name><surname>Meschichi</surname><given-names>Anis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/P013511/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dean</surname><given-names>Caroline</given-names></name><name><surname>Dean</surname><given-names>Caroline</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100018694</institution-id><institution>HORIZON EUROPE Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>813282</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reeck</surname><given-names>Svenja</given-names></name><name><surname>Reeck</surname><given-names>Svenja</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100018694</institution-id><institution>HORIZON EUROPE Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MSCA-IF 101032710</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Lihua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The regulation of gene expression can be either binary (on/off digital regulation) or graded (analog regulation) and these fundamentally different regulatory modes can be integrated to control the expression of the same gene.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>One of the most fundamental questions in molecular biology is how quantitative gene expression is achieved. Traditionally, such regulation is ascribed to sequence-specific transcription factors that bind to regulatory DNA elements. According to the concentration of the transcription factors, gene expression can then be quantitatively up- or downregulated. While such regulation undoubtedly occurs in many systems, it has become abundantly clear in recent years that this paradigm is fundamentally incomplete. This is especially so in eukaryotes where quantitative transcriptional regulation can arise from modulation of the local chromatin environment of a gene. For example, by varying the type and level of histone modifications, DNA accessibility can be radically altered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmad et al., 2022</xref>). In one scenario, nucleosome positioning affects the ability of transcription factors to bind. Another possibility is that alteration of the chromatin environment directly affects the kinetics of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coulon et al., 2014</xref>) by altering how fast the RNA polymerase elongates.</p><p>For the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> floral repressor gene <italic>FLOWERING LOCUS C</italic> (<italic>FLC</italic>), it has been shown that expression levels are quantitatively reduced by a prolonged duration of cold. This quantitative response is achieved through individual <italic>FLC</italic> gene copies making a <italic>cis</italic>-mediated, digital switch from an ‘ON’ (expressing) state to an ‘OFF’ (silenced) state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angel et al., 2011</xref>). This switch is asynchronous between gene copies, even in the same cell, with the number switched OFF increasing over time in the cold. This results in a gradual decrease in <italic>FLC</italic> expression over time at a whole plant level with silenced gene copies covered by high levels of the silencing histone mark H3K27me3 controlled by the Polycomb system through Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). This mode of regulation is called ‘digital,’ to highlight the discrete ON/OFF states for each gene copy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, Digital Regulation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Munsky and Neuert, 2015</xref>). Such digital regulation has also been observed in many other systems, both natural (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saxton and Rine, 2022</xref>) and engineered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bintu et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic of digital and analog gene regulation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Digital regulation (left) corresponds to loci being in an ‘ON’ state (purple) or ‘OFF’ state (white), where we assume for simplicity that there is only one gene copy per cell. At the tissue level, moving from low to high average expression (columns left to right) is achieved by a change in the fraction of cells in each of the two states. This mode is distinct from analog regulation (right), where each cell has a graded expression level that roughly corresponds to the overall population average. (<bold>B</bold>) <italic>FLC</italic> represses the transition to flowering and is controlled by <italic>FRIGIDA</italic>, the autonomous pathway and the vernalization pathway (inducing digital epigenetic silencing in the cold).

Quantitative regulation at the cell population level can then be achieved by tuning the expression level uniformly at all gene copies, as in inducible gene expression systems. A well-characterized example of such behavior is in the level of stress-responsive gene expression as controlled by the transcription factor Msn2 in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stewart-Ornstein et al., 2013</xref>). This graded mode of regulation is called ‘analog’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, Analog Regulation, ), in contrast to the digital alternative.</p><p>While <italic>FLC</italic> loci are known to have digital behavior during and after a cold treatment, allowing them to robustly hold epigenetic memory of cold exposure, it remains unknown how the starting expression levels (prior to cold) are regulated quantitatively in terms of analog versus digital control. After plants germinate, they grow as seedlings that have not experienced any cold exposure, or digital Polycomb switching, so quantitative variation in <italic>FLC</italic> expression seen in young seedlings could represent different cellular proportions of digitally regulated <italic>FLC</italic>, as well as graded transcriptional changes. More generally, elucidating the interplay between analog and digital control is essential for a more in-depth understanding of quantitative gene regulation. Although digital and analog modes of repression have been separately studied in the past (see, e.g., ), how these two fundamentally different modes of regulation might be combined has not been considered. <italic>FLC</italic> is an ideal system to study this question due to its digital control after cold, as well as the wealth of knowledge about its regulation at all stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berry and Dean, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p><italic>FLC</italic> levels are set during embryogenesis by competition between an <italic>FLC</italic> activator called <italic>FRIGIDA</italic> (<italic>FRI</italic>) and the so-called autonomous repressive pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schon et al., 2021</xref>). The commonly used <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions Ler and Col-0, have mutations in the <italic>FRI</italic> gene, allowing the autonomous pathway to dominate, thereby repressing <italic>FLC</italic> during vegetative development and resulting in a rapidly cycling summer annual lifestyle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johanson et al., 2000</xref>). On the other hand, genetic introduction of an active <italic>FRI</italic> allele (Col<italic>FRI,</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee and Amasino, 1995</xref>) generates an initially high <italic>FLC</italic> expression state, which then requires cold for <italic>FLC</italic> repression and subsequent flowering. However, both these cases, with high (Col<italic>FRI</italic>) or low (Ler, Col-0) <italic>FLC</italic> expression, are extreme examples, where essentially all <italic>FLC</italic> loci are either expressed to a high level or not, before cold. It is therefore difficult to use these genotypes to understand any possible interplay between digital and analog control as only the extremes are exhibited. Instead, what is required is a genotype with intermediate <italic>FLC</italic> expression at a cell population level during embryogenesis. Such a genotype at a single gene copy level might exhibit either a graded (analog) or all-or-nothing (digital) <italic>FLC</italic> expression before cold, thereby allowing dissection of whether analog or digital regulation is at work.</p><p>In this work, we exploited mutant alleles in <italic>FLOWERING CONTROL LOCUS A</italic> (<italic>FCA</italic>), which is part of the <italic>FLC-</italic>repressive autonomous pathway, thereby systematically varying overall <italic>FLC</italic> levels. One of these mutants, <italic>fca-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Koornneef et al., 1991</xref>), is a complete loss of function and therefore exhibits late flowering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and high <italic>FLC</italic> expression before cold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>), similar to Col<italic>FRI</italic>. The wildtype, Ler, has a fully functional autonomous pathway and so exhibits low <italic>FLC</italic> levels before cold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>) and early flowering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), with the <italic>FLC</italic> gene covered by the silencing histone mark H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). Crucially, however, the <italic>fca-3</italic> and <italic>fca-4</italic> mutants lead to compromised FCA function (see ‘Materials and methods’ and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Koornneef et al., 1991</xref>). In <italic>fca-3</italic>, there is a splice site mutation that leads to changed exon structure through variable use of alternative splice sites with either loss or misfolding of the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Macknight et al., 2002</xref>). The <italic>fca-4</italic> allele is the result of a large genomic inversion that disrupts the <italic>FCA</italic> gene at the 3′ end of exon 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Page et al., 1999</xref>). The expressed 3′ fragment contains the second RNA-binding domain and the C-terminal region of the protein including the WW protein interaction domain, sufficient to give an intermediate flowering time phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Page et al., 1999</xref>). Both mutants display intermediate cell population-level <italic>FLC</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>) and flowering time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), indicating partial functionality of the FCA protein in these mutants. Crucially, this intermediate property allows us to systematically dissect the interplay of analog and digital regulation at <italic>FLC</italic> before cold using a combination of single cell and whole plant assays, together with mathematical modeling, revealing a temporal separation between the two regulatory modes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Analysis of <italic>fca</italic> alleles reveals both analog and digital regulation at <italic>FLC</italic></title><p>To investigate the mode of repression arising from regulation by the autonomous pathway, we utilized the <italic>fca-1</italic> and <italic>fca-3</italic> mutants, as well as the parental Ler genotype, and assayed how individual cells varied in their <italic>FLC</italic> expression in these three genotypes at 7 d after sowing. We quantified the number of individual mRNAs per cell using single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).

Possibly because of the TE, we observed <italic>FLC</italic> mRNA accumulation in the nucleolus in this background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Furthermore, when looking only at the ON cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>; ON cells defined here as cells with more than three mRNAs counted, though the conclusion is unchanged with alternative thresholds; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), the mRNA numbers in <italic>fca-3</italic> were only around 1/5 of those in <italic>fca-1</italic>, much less than one-half, ruling out that the reduced levels in <italic>fca-3</italic> were solely due to silencing of one of the two gene copies. The mRNA distribution of <italic>fca-3</italic> cells is significantly different from Ler, confirming that <italic>fca-3</italic> is not simply all digitally OFF. However, we note that the Ler images contain noisy signals due to background (see ‘Materials and methods’), resulting in the detection of ON cells with similar mRNA counts as in <italic>fca-3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Despite this, <italic>fca-3</italic> has considerably more ON cells than in Ler (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that counts for <italic>fca-3</italic> are not simply background. Visual inspection and manual counting of images further confirmed these conclusions (‘Materials and methods’). Nevertheless, mRNA numbers in many <italic>fca-3</italic> cells were close to zero, suggesting that digital silencing may also be relevant in this case. Hence, the differences in overall expression between the mutant genotypes appeared to have two components. Firstly, there were different fractions of apparently silenced cells (digitally OFF) without any appreciable expression (three or fewer mRNAs counted): 72% in <italic>fca-3</italic> and 1.5% in <italic>fca-1</italic>. Secondly, in cells that did express <italic>FLC</italic> (digitally ON), the <italic>FCA</italic> mutations lead to an analog change in their expression levels, so that there was more <italic>FLC</italic> mRNA in <italic>fca-1</italic> ON cells than in the <italic>fca-3</italic> ON cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This behavior clearly differed from the digital regulation observed at <italic>FLC</italic> after cold treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rosa et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We additionally used confocal live imaging to investigate FLC protein levels in individual cells in the root tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>) and in young leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). We found similar protein expression patterns in roots and leaves, suggesting that each mutation was having similar effects in different tissues. Therefore, conclusions we draw from root experiments can be extended to <italic>FLC</italic> regulation in leaves. Imaging in roots has clear technical advantages, as well as the presence of clonal cell files which can inform heritability, and so further microscopy experiments are in root tissue only. After cell segmentation, we quantified the FLC-Venus intensity within the nuclei, comparing the different genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>; all differences are significant with <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mrow/><mml:mrow/></mml:msup><mml:msup><mml:mrow/><mml:mrow/></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>). This procedure allowed us to combine information of relative protein levels with the cell positions in the root. Median intensity levels of FLC -Venus per cell and the overall histogram distribution revealed again intermediate levels of FLC protein in <italic>fca-3</italic>, relative to Ler and <italic>fca-1</italic>. At the same time, there was again strong evidence in favor of a digital component for <italic>FLC</italic> regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D(v)</xref>): in cells with the lowest protein levels, these levels were similar in <italic>fca-3</italic> and in Ler, again supporting a digital OFF state. Furthermore, we could see a mix of distinct ON and OFF cells by enhancing the <italic>fca-3</italic> images to increase the Venus intensity to a similar level as in <italic>fca-1</italic>. By contrast, in <italic>fca-1</italic> all cells were ON, whereas in Ler, cells appeared OFF even with an equivalent adjustment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D(iv)</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). We could also infer a potentially heritable component in the ON/OFF states as short files of ON cells could be observed in <italic>fca-3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D(v)</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, yellow boxes). In <italic>fca-4</italic>, we observed similar short ON files (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, yellow boxes), suggesting that this is a general feature that is not specific to <italic>fca-3</italic>. Overall, our results support a combination of analog and digital regulation for <italic>FLC</italic>: in Ler most cells were digitally OFF, in <italic>fca-1</italic> all cells were digitally ON, while in <italic>fca-3</italic> a fraction of cells were OFF, but for those cells that were ON, the level of <italic>FLC</italic> expression was reduced in an analog way relative to <italic>fca-1</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>FLC</italic> RNA and protein are degraded quickly relative to the cell cycle duration</title><p>Our results strongly pointed toward a digital switching component being important for <italic>FLC</italic> regulation by the autonomous pathway, but with an analog component too for those loci that remain ON. A study in yeast previously reported on the expected RNA distributions for the two cases of analog and digital control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goodnight and Rine, 2020</xref>). An important additional consideration when interpreting the analog/digital nature of the regulation concerns the half-lives of the mRNA and protein. In a digital scenario, long half-lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rahni and Birnbaum, 2019</xref>) are expected to broaden histograms of mRNA/protein levels due to the extended times needed for mRNA/protein levels to increase/decrease after state switching. This could lead to a possible misinterpretation of analog regulation, for example, if intermediate levels of mRNA/protein remain in OFF cells that are descended from ON cells. In contrast, short half-lives will lead to clearer bimodality. Furthermore, what might look like a heritable transcription state could also appear due to slow dilution of a stable protein, as observed in other cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kueh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>). We therefore needed to measure the half-lives of the mRNA and protein to interpret our observations appropriately.</p><p><italic>FLC</italic> mRNA has previously been shown to have a half-life of approximately 6 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ietswaart et al., 2017</xref>) in a different genotype (Col<italic>FRI</italic>) to that used here. We measured the half-lives of both RNA and protein in our highly expressing <italic>FLC</italic> line, <italic>fca-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The RNA half-life measurement used actinomycin D treatment, inhibiting transcription, whereas the protein measurement used cycloheximide, arresting protein synthesis. The half-lives were then extracted from the subsequent decay in mRNA/protein levels. We found that both degradation rates were quite fast, with half-lives of ~5 and ~1.5 hr, respectively, for the mRNA and protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). These timescales are short compared to the cell cycle duration, here of ~1 d (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rahni and Birnbaum, 2019</xref>), let alone compared to the timescale of development. Therefore, slow degradation is unlikely to be the cause of the apparent analog regulation and of the observed heritability seen in our root images. Furthermore, the short protein half-life indicates that any potential effects from growth causing dilution, and thus a reduction in protein concentrations, will also be small.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Switching of <italic>FLC</italic> loci to an OFF state over time in <italic>fca-3</italic></title><p>To understand the nature of potential digital switching, it is important to determine whether switching occurs from ON to OFF, OFF to ON, or in both directions. If most loci are switching one-way only, in either direction, this would lead to a gradual change of overall <italic>FLC</italic> expression over time. Alternatively, two-way switching or non-switching in at least a few cells would be necessary to have a constant concentration of <italic>FLC</italic> mRNA/protein over time. These considerations therefore raised the related question of whether cell population-level silencing is at steady state at the time of observation or whether we are capturing a snapshot of a transient behavior, with cells continuing to switch over developmental time.</p><p>To test if <italic>FLC</italic> expression is changing over time, we sampled <italic>FLC</italic> expression in the intermediate <italic>fca-3</italic> mutant, as well as <italic>fca-1</italic> and Ler, at 7, 15, and 21 d after sowing. This experiment revealed a decreasing trend in <italic>fca-3</italic> and Ler (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), which did not seem to be due to a change in <italic>FCA</italic> expression over the same timescale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This was particularly clear when comparing <italic>FLC</italic> and <italic>FCA</italic> in <italic>fca-3</italic> between 7 and 15 d: since FCA is a repressor of <italic>FLC</italic> expression, a decrease in both suggests that FCA is not the cause of the <italic>FLC</italic> expression decrease. We therefore concluded that the most likely explanation was primarily one-way switching from an otherwise heritable <italic>FLC</italic> ON state, to the heritable silenced OFF state occurring digitally and independently at individual loci in <italic>fca-3</italic> and Ler. We note that Ler was already mostly OFF at the starting time of 7 d, and so the significant but very slow rate of decrease (slope: –0.038, p-value: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mn>4.8</mml:mn><mml:mo>∙</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>6</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> , <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; slope: –0.023, p-value: 0.0030, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>) is interpreted as a small number of remaining ON cells continuing to switch OFF. However, at the later timepoints Ler had transitioned to flowering and so no biological conclusions were drawn from the <italic>FLC</italic> dynamics at those times in this genotype.

The silenced state is Polycomb dependent, given the similarity of our data to the vernalized state and the role of the Polycomb mark H3K27me3 in silencing <italic>FLC</italic> in wildtype Ler and Col-0 in the absence of cold treatment. In Col-0, in a mutant of the PRC2 component and H3K27 methyltransferase, <italic>clf</italic>, it has also been observed that <italic>FLC</italic> is upregulated and H3K27me3 reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shu et al., 2019</xref>), though this is only a partial effect due to the presence of an active SWN, another PRC2 H3K27 methyltransferase. Based on previous studies on the interplay between transcription and PRC2 silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beltran et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berry et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Holoch et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lövkvist et al., 2021</xref>), we propose that the rate of digital Polycomb silencing is dependent on the transcription levels. These transcription levels are genetically controlled and constitute analog regulation since the pathways governing this process are capable of graded expression control. Analog regulation is set within each genotype, as illustrated by the <italic>fca</italic> mutants, before possible digital switching at each gene copy into a heritable silenced OFF state.</p><p>In the case of Ler, low analog transcription is not sufficient to significantly oppose silencing and so the switch occurs before our first experimental measurements at 7 d. In <italic>fca-1,</italic> the switch does not occur at all, prevented by high analog transcription in that genotype. However, for <italic>fca-3,</italic> with intermediate analog <italic>FLC</italic> expression, the digital switching occurs slowly and so can be observed in our timeseries experiments, underlining a clear temporal separation of analog and digital transcriptional control. In this way, both analog and digital regulation are combined at <italic>FLC</italic>, with the timescale for switching between these states controlled by the strength of initial analog transcription. In <italic>fca-3,</italic> such switching to the OFF state causes a gradual reduction in <italic>FLC</italic> expression at the whole plant level. Furthermore, we emphasize that there may be additional developmentally regulated processes occurring at <italic>FLC,</italic> in addition to the constant rate of switching. This possibility is underscored by the model not completely recapitulating the long cell files we observe experimentally at the 21-day timepoint.</p><p>A prolonged environmental cold signal can also result in a switch from cells expressing <italic>FLC</italic> to nonexpressing OFF cells, a process that occurs independently at each gene copy of <italic>FLC</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berry et al., 2015</xref>). These ON/OFF states are then maintained through cell divisions leading to epigenetic memory. This cold-dependent silencing shows only digital characteristics, with highly <italic>FLC-</italic>expressing cells present both before and after intermediate periods of cold, albeit in a lower proportion after. Here, we have addressed how <italic>FLC</italic> is regulated in the absence of cold and show that a similar mode of regulation occurs. Furthermore, at least in the case of <italic>fca-3</italic> with initially intermediate transcription levels, silencing at the cell population level also happens gradually over many cell cycles, like the behavior over prolonged periods of cold. Moreover, images of roots at 21 d after sowing without cold, with fluorescently labeled FLC, are visually strikingly like images of vernalized roots, where in both cases we find whole files of either all ON or all OFF cells. These comparisons suggest similarities in the molecular characteristics of the Polycomb silenced state at <italic>FLC</italic> generated either with or without cold treatment. We hypothesize that in the absence of active Polycomb the <italic>fca</italic> alleles would display only analog differences, without the possibility of digital silencing.</p><p>In this work, we have focused on the early regulation of <italic>FLC</italic> by analog and digital pathways, rather than the effect of these on flowering. However, natural variation at <italic>FLC</italic> largely affects expression as the plants are germinating in autumn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hepworth et al., 2020</xref>). The analog component of transcriptional regulation could therefore have widespread ecological relevance. For example, the high <italic>FLC</italic> genotype Lov-1, a natural accession from Sweden, has higher <italic>FLC</italic> expression upon germination in early autumn compared to Col<italic>FRI</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coustham et al., 2012</xref>). The analog component could be dominating in Lov-1, with all cells having a higher ON level. Consistent with this, Lov-1 also has lower levels of the Polycomb mark H3K27me3 at the <italic>FLC</italic> locus, with potentially few or no OFF cellsn the warm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Qüesta et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The main antagonist of the autonomous pathway is the <italic>FRIGIDA</italic> gene, a transcriptional activator of <italic>FLC</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), which was not present in the lines used in this study. In fact, it is the antagonism between FRI and the autonomous pathway that determines the starting <italic>FLC</italic> levels, and so we would expect that FRI controls the analog component directly and digital component indirectly. For future work, it would therefore be interesting to investigate transcriptional responses in an <italic>FRI</italic> allelic series. This could be particularly important because natural accessions show mutations in <italic>FRI</italic> rather than in autonomous pathway components, possibly because the autonomous components regulate many more target genes.</p><p>Overall, our work has revealed a combination of both analog and digital modes of regulation at <italic>Arabidopsis FLC</italic> before cold, with analog preceding digital. We further propose it is the strength of the initial analog, autonomous pathway transcriptional level that controls the timescale for the switch into the subsequent digital, Polycomb silenced state. Future work is needed to address how this integrated analog and digital regulation affects flowering time, including further exploration of this pathway in leaves and the use of cell-tracking to capture the switching process in action.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant material</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title><italic>fca</italic> alleles</title><p><italic>fca-3</italic> and <italic>fca-4</italic> are the result of X-ray mutagenesis, while <italic>fca-1</italic> was induced by EMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Koornneef et al., 1991</xref>).

A combination of the visibility markers and nuclei were used to seed a watershed segmentation of the image, thus dividing the image into regions representing individual cells. Probes within each region were counted to generate the per-cell counts. Occluded cells were excluded from the analysis (probe counts for those regions were ignored). Segmentation and probe detection parameters were optimized, with different thresholds used for different replicates and genotypes. This was necessary due to the difference in signal and background of the probes in each of these cases.</p><p>Visual inspection of smFISH images revealed high rates of false positive detection in Ler, likely due to very low levels of expression. In the absence of real signals, unspecific signals can be counted through our automated quantification pipeline as a consequence of unspecific probe binding or general background.

The similar count range observed in Ler and <italic>fca-3</italic> ‘ON’ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1C and 2</xref>) suggests that there is an overlap between the distribution of real ON cells in <italic>fca-3</italic> and background signal (in both Ler and <italic>fca-3</italic>). However, the higher frequency of such cells in <italic>fca-3</italic> compared to Ler confirms that these are not simply the result of background measurements.

Furthermore, visual inspection of the images confirmed that in <italic>fca-3</italic> we can confidently detect real signals (higher than in Ler and lower than <italic>fca-1</italic>), confirming the analog component.</p><p>Custom code is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/JIC-Image-Analysis/fishtools">https://github.com/JIC-Image-Analysis/fishtools</ext-link> (copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hartley and Antoniou-Kourounioti, 2022a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-2"><title>FLC-Venus fluorescence intensity in roots</title><p>To measure per-cell FLC-Venus intensities in roots, we developed a custom image analysis pipeline to extract cell structure information from the PI cell wall information and use this to measure per-cell nuclear fluorescence. Images were initially segmented using the SimpleITK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beare and Lehmann, 2006</xref>) implementation of the morphological watershed algorithm. Reconstructed regions touching the image boundaries and those below a certain size threshold were removed. Segmentations were then manually curated to merge over-segmented regions and assign file identities to the resulting segmented cells. This curation was performed using custom software, able to merge segmented cells, resegment cells from specified seeds, and split cells along user-defined planes. To approximate the nuclear position, we fitted a fixed size spherical volume of 15 voxels radius to the point of maximal FLC-Venus intensity in each reconstructed cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). Cells where the sphere overlap fraction (between sphere and cell) was less than 55% were excluded from the analysis. Per-voxel mean FLC-Venus intensities for each cell were then calculated by dividing the summed intensity within the intersection of the spherical region and the cell, by the fixed sphere volume. A background correction was performed by the following calculation to estimate the FLC-Venus intensity in the nucleus (‘sphere_filled,’ also see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>): sphere_filled = (mean_in_sphere / overlap_fraction) - mean_outside_sphere.</p><p>The ‘mean_in_sphere’ intensity was first divided by the ‘overlap_fraction,’ the fraction of the sphere which overlaps the cell, to correct for regions of the sphere outside the cell. The mean intensity of the region outside the sphere (‘mean_outside_sphere’), which is the background signal, was then subtracted from this overlap-corrected sphere intensity. This background subtraction is also the cause for the negative values in a fraction of OFF cells where the signal inside and outside the sphere are both background noise. Because of the sphere’s prescribed size, in some cases even the brightest sphere inside a cell will have lower intensity than the remaining cell (e.g., by necessarily including the darkest region of the cell), leading to these negative values.</p><p>Custom code for initial segmentation and Venus intensity measurement is written in the Python language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Python Software Foundation, 2023</xref>), and is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/JIC-Image-Analysis/root_measurement">https://github.com/JIC-Image-Analysis/root_measurement</ext-link> (copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hartley and Antoniou-Kourounioti, 2022b</xref>).</p><p>The code for the segmentation curation software is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/jfozard/segcorrect">https://github.com/jfozard/segcorrect</ext-link> (copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fozard, 2022</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Mathematical model</title><p>We constructed a model for <italic>FLC</italic> chromatin states and protein levels in the root (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and used it to simulate root cell files and generate simulated protein-level histograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The root was represented as a collection of cell files (such as the 12 representative cell files shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), and 1000 cell files were simulated in total.

The results of their work lead the authors to propose that analog regulation in the autonomous flowering pathway precedes digital regulation conferred by Polycomb silencing before cold exposure, and that this temporal switch correlates with the strength of transcription at the <italic>FLC</italic> locus in different genetic backgrounds.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79743.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Hao</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01tgyzw49</institution-id><institution>National University of Singapore &amp; Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory</institution></institution-wrap><country>Singapore</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Vernoux</surname><given-names>Teva</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04w61vh47</institution-id><institution>Laboratoire Reproduction et Développement des Plantes</institution></institution-wrap><country>France</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.07.04.498694">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.04.498694v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by the Reviewing Editor, Hao Yu, and Naama Barkai as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Teva Vernoux (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another. While there was a common interest about the topic and the relevant findings, some concerns on the methodologies, genetic materials, and interpretation of results as listed below in the section of &quot;Essential revisions&quot; need to be addressed before the manuscript could be further considered.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The authors should consider using live-imaging to track the cell-level correlation between ON/OFF states of FLC and FLC expression levels as well as their link with cell division. These results are required to support the corresponding correlations established by the results obtained at the cell population level.</p><p>2. The nature of the genetic materials (e.g. fca-3 and FLC-Venus) used or created in this study should be clearly characterized and described in the manuscript. Notably, the intermediate mutant fca-3 exhibits comparable FCA expression levels to the strong mutant fca-1 (Figure 3B). How the mutations in these alleles eventually cause different FLC expression levels and flowering time could be relevant to different types of FCA forms produced in these mutants. As fca-1 and fca-3 are crucial genetic material used in this study, more detailed information on these two mutants and rationales of selecting fca-3 as the intermediate mutant should be provided for interpreting the results obtained in this study.</p><p>3. The authors utilized the root system with transgenes in mutant backgrounds to observe and model the repression of FLC expression. In some experiments, the authors compared the results obtained from different tissues (e.g. qPCR measurement of FLC in whole plants in Figure 3A versus FLC signal in root cells in other panels). As FLC mainly functions in leaves and the shoot apical meristem (SAM) to regulate flowering time, how the molecular logic deduced from root cells could be applicable to FLC roles in leaves and SAM should be justified with concrete evidence.</p><p>4. For the time-course experiments (e.g. Figure 3A and 4B), examination of FLC expression or active copies beyond the floral transition stage (particularly for Ler) could be biologically irrelevant.</p><p>5. The thresholding definition of digitally ON and OFF of FLC expression seems too arbitrary. This needs to be better justified, and, if necessary, redefined.</p><p>6. The authors should consider whether it is more appropriate to use medians rather than means for the plots exhibiting skewed distributions. In addition, biological repeats and statistical analyses are required for most of the quantitative data in this manuscript.</p><p>7. Although this study proposes a new paradigm for gradual repression of FLC by the combined analog and digital modes, how this model is applicable to plants in different genetic backgrounds and integrated with other regulatory mechanisms pertaining to FLC regulation should be discussed.</p><p>Please also take into consideration the other specific comments from the reviewers below to revise the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. To go beyond cell population-level correlations, the authors should use live-imaging to track cells and show that their probability to switch FLC off is indeed correlated to the level of FLC expression. This cell-level correlation would help to build a much stronger case for the importance of analog regulation in determining the dynamics of FLC. It is also necessary to claim that analog regulation comes before digital regulation as the authors do, otherwise this claim is not really supported by the data.</p><p>2. Figure 2D (v): to claim that there is a heritable component in the ON/OFF state the authors need to show more than one image.</p><p>3. About the half-lives of FLC mRNA and FLC protein: the measurements effectively indicate relatively short half-lives but could the authors show further evidence (e.g. using a simple model) that these values are compatible with the interpretation of their results. This would be more convincing.</p><p>4. As the link between division and digital regulation is important to the model, couldn't the authors use live-imaging to show this functional link? That would be an important addition to the manuscript.</p><p>5. Concerning the model again, the authors could show that they reproduce also the wild-type and fca-1 situations. Notably for the wild-type, the mRNA and protein distribution are relatively similar despite the clear quantitative difference and this would strengthen the modeling analysis.</p><p>6. How do the authors explain that fca-1 still flowers despite the absence of switch? Does the s.itch occur later? Is this an artifact resulting from the use of roots instead of shoots?</p><p>7. The authors could show that the digital regulation of FLC is also dependent on Polycomb in absence of cold treatment (or cite existing work if this evidence already exists). This would help to better connect this work to what is known in the case of cold exposure.</p><p>8. It would be important that the authors discuss more the relevance of their findings to what occurs in wild-type background and to better highlight why their findings are important for understanding how flowering is controlled. This is missing at the moment. Is it reasonable to speculate that FRI allelic series could represent a situation somehow equivalent to what has been studied in this work? In relation to this, I am not convinced that the authors can claim that analog regulation is dependent on the autonomous pathway. As such their data could rather indicate that the autonomous pathway in Ler prevent analog regulation, allowing for an efficient digital regulation of FLC. If an analog regulation of FLC indeed exists in the wild, one could envision that it rather arises from an equilibrium between at least the FRI and autonomous pathways. The authors should revise this claim and discuss how they envision that analog regulation could occur in wild-type plants.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The nature of the fca-3 mutant should be described in detail.</p><p>What is the phenotype (flowering time) of FLC-venus in fca-1 and fca-3? In addition, how many independent lines were used? Do they behave similarly?</p><p>Whether what the authors observe is &quot;biologically&quot; relevant is a critical point the authors should carefully address.</p><p>The authors should measure the functional form of FCA transcripts in Figure 3B, and as discussed earlier, the description of fca-1 and fca-3 alleles would be helpful for readers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>When assessing the differences between the FLC transcript and protein levels in the histograms for Ler, fca-3, and fca-1, one can see a much larger gap between fca-3 and fca-1 levels than fca-3 and Ler. Could the authors better justify the use of fca-3 as an 'intermediate' state to assess the interplay between digital and analog mode? Given the outcome of the quantifications, perhaps the word 'intermediate' might need to be reconsidered. Adding more comments about these levels during the text (better describe its medians rather than means) would be also appreciated.</p><p>The model needs some further clarity to better connect it with the data, and, if possible, it would be ideal if this could be used for understanding the different regulatory modes.</p><p>I would suggest the authors use the model to provide examples such the different regulatory modes (digital, analog and combined digital-analog regulation) can be recapitulated and more easily connected to the data. Yet, perhaps this is not the purpose of that model and this connection is not that easy, given how the model itself has been formulated. If this is the case, I invite the authors to consider reformulating the model to clarify the different regulatory modes and better connect it with the data.</p><p>In line 501 it says there is a &quot;manual fitting&quot; process. Could you explain that more formally? This seems arbitrary and I am wondering why a curve or distribution fitting algorithm couldn't work better.</p><p>I find the idea of connecting the simulated cell states with the FLC-Venus experimental data quite original (as in Lines 505-508). However, I am a bit confused as to why the authors have selected the equations in 505-507. Why is this the case? And are there other distributions that may work better? (say a Poisson distribution, as that may give you a better indication of dividing since you are counting the number of cycles a cell goes through).</p><p>From the time course in Figure 3 it is concluded that there is 'one-way switching to an OFF' state in fca-3. I was wondering whether the authors could discuss further the possibility of switching from 'OFF to ON'. Presumably, by visual observation of the experimental data one could think this may happen – e.g. when looking at a given time point in cells along the same row in some cases in fca-3 and fca-1. Furthermore, could the model help in evaluating how things would change if OFF-ON transitions are included?</p><p>In Figure 3A, the authors perform qPCR in the whole plants while the rest of the figure focuses on looking at silencing at the root tips. For consistency, wouldn't it be possible to perform the qPCR in root tips? I am aware this would be a significant amount of work, but the current conclusions extracted from Figure 3A are not clear to me, nor whether this qPCR quantification in the whole plant helps to find digital silencing that is FCA independent. In terms of conclusions – please revise the used (type of) tests; it is strange to me that fca-1 does not show a significant decrease, as commented in lines 221 and 233.</p><p>Could the authors comment on the bimodal distributions potentially observed in fca-1?</p><p>Would it be possible to quantify the dilution effects from the experimental data? I was wondering whether this could be a possible explanation for the decrease in FLC-VENUS levels in the time course, especially for Ler and fca-3, as an alternative to digital silencing.</p><p>Figure 2S3A – One can see the sphere to quantify the fluorescence intensity in some cases is partly outside of the measured cell (especially when the cell is smaller in width than the diameter of the sphere), indicating this computation will dilute the signal. This can drive to potentially artifacts and negative concentrations. Could the authors correct this effect?</p><p>Histogram Figures, such as Figure 2E, have negative concentrations, so this should be revised. Perhaps it is related to a previous point on the outlined spheres to quantify the fluorescence intensity.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Integrating analog and digital modes of gene expression at Arabidopsis <italic>FLC</italic>&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1. Why different analog expression of FLC occurs in different fca alleles should be discussed.</p><p>2. It will be helpful to include an internal control in the FLC-venus experiments to compare fluorescence levels in ON cells with varying degrees of FLC-venus expression.</p><p>3. Clarifications on some major issues raised by reviewers, such as in-depth quantification in non-root tissues and actual meaning of the integration of digital and analog regulation, should be briefly incorporated into the manuscript.</p><p>Please also take into consideration the other specific comments from the reviewers below to revise the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this revised version, the authors have consolidated their data and their text, including the discussion. One can certainly agree, that given the difficulty to obtain reliable live-imaging data, their population-level analysis from imaging snapshots provides a sufficiently solid basis to the idea of a combination of an analog and digital regulation of the expression of FLC. Demonstrating expression of FLC in shoot tissues is also certainly strengthening the hypothesis that the mode of action seen in the root is relevant to shoot tissues. However, it would be nice if the authors could mention at the end of the discussion that, finding a way to address these two questions in the future will be important to explore further how the regulation they have identified acts in the regulation of flowering.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I appreciate that the authors have addressed several criticisms from reviewers in this revision.</p><p>This study reports the existence of an &quot;analog&quot; mode of regulation in addition to the previously reported &quot;ON-OFF&quot; switch for FLC regulation. By comparing the levels of FLC mRNA/protein in different genetic backgrounds, the authors provide evidence for the analog mode of FLC regulation. Although time-course experiments suggest that the &quot;ON-OFF&quot; switch occurs in ON cells regardless of FLC levels, the mechanism behind the analog difference in FLC levels in fca-1 and fca-3 mutants remains unclear.</p><p>I also understand that the authors empirically selected fca-1 and fca-3 (and fca-4 in this revision) mutants based on distinct levels of FLC (and flowering time). The main conclusion of the manuscript hinges on the different behaviors of FLC (analog) observed in these genetic backgrounds. Therefore, it is crucial to address how the various alleles of fca influence FLC regulation. However, the study did not address why different alleles of fca resulted in different analog mode of FLC expression.</p><p>As a result, the study is primarily descriptive.</p><p>1. The study would benefit from an internal control in the FLC-venus experiments to compare fluorescence levels in ON cells with varying degrees of FLC-venus expression (after all, the authors are comparing fluorescence in different cells among different transgenic lines in different genetic backgrounds).</p><p>2. I appreciate the detailed description of different alleles of fca used in this revision. However, I am still puzzled how fca-1 and fca-3, which both failed to produce &quot;functional&quot; FCA protein, resulted in different analog expressions of FLC. The authors discussed the analog regulation of FLC as an early regulation of FLC and the level of transcription affects the Polycomb switch. It would be more relevant to discuss how the different levels of FLC transcription are established in fca-1 and fca-3 mutants.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I would like to thank first the authors for all the work performed on the previous version and the addressed comments. I find the manuscript has improved, although I still have several issues I would like to comment on:</p><p>1. I appreciate the effort to study the FLC behavior in leaves. Yet, by eye it is difficult to distinguish whether Ler and fca-3 are exhibiting different behaviors, as the authors claim it is occurring in the root (Ler and fca-3 seem to express at the same levels in Figure 2S4). Hence, despite of the challenge, I believe quantification would be important to support the claims by the authors, although I am aware the authors were told by the editor this could be done 'without the need of in-depth quantification'. Otherwise, could the authors comment on that, and clarify in the manuscript?</p><p>2. In my understanding, the ON transcriptional state between Ler and fca-3 is having the same (median) levels, according to Figure 2S2, which tells us that the differences between these two lines is just in the digital mode, and not the analog mode. Hence, if I understand well, digital and analog mode is not seen (or I could not clearly see) in the same line at the same time – at least, at the transcriptional level. If this is the case, I think the claim of the integration of digital and analog might need to be revised, given the current data is not showing both regulations in the same line. If this is not the case, I believe I am misunderstanding the interpretation of your data, and further clarifications would be needed.</p><p>3. I agreed with the comment 3 by Reviewer 1, and the authors thought it is not needed to provide further evidence, given the differences between the half-lives timescales (hours) with the developmental timescales (weeks). Yet, I am wondering whether the timescale to compare to understand in part the resulting distributions should also be the division timescale (a day). Given this manuscript relies on quantitative evidences, I believe it is still unclear for the reader whether dilution effects or the protein or RNA half-lives (perhaps together with noise) might broaden the histograms, conferring the false impression of analog regulation. Could slightly different dilution (and noisy) rates between the different lines account for the different protein levels shown in Figure 2? I think given the central scope of this manuscript on distinguishing what is analog and what is digital, this point needs more justification and/or clarification (ideally, a model could help).</p><p>4. I understand that the authors might find the manual fitting good enough for them, but they derive conclusions out of it, in particular now they give numbers about the OFF-ON rates in relation to the ON-OFF rates. I think that given the quantitative scope of this work, it would be more ideal to have a more reproducible fitting to have solid conclusions.</p><p>5. Overall, although I appreciate the very good and interesting work from the authors, I still find there are aspects of clarity of the manuscript that need to be revised, that better link the data from the conclusions extracted by the authors. For instance, as I said above it is not clear to me what the authors really mean by 'the integration of the digital and analog regulation', given I do not clearly see such two modes acting in the same line, and I am still hesitant about not seeing a bimodal distribution whose expression levels could be modulated, which would be the major evidence to me. Also, lines in the abstract 39-40 are not totally clear to me; I understand there is a slow time scale for the digital silencing, but I am not totally sure about associating a timescale to the analog regulation, and therefore, to compare both timescales. (Maintenance of expression levels does not necessarily show to me that analog precedes the digital silencing). I would appreciate more clarifications in this directions.</p><p>6. I noticed that the manuscript version with tracked changes (which is the version I initially read in detail) is not the same as the non-tracked version (e.g. see lines 553 and 596, which refer to Sup File 3 and Sup. File 1, and compare it with the tracked version, in which the equivalent sentences would refer to Sup. File 1 and Supp Table 4, respectively). I hope there are not further major differences between the tracked and non-tracked manuscripts.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79743.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

We believe the similar behaviour of both intermediate <italic>fca</italic> lines adds further robustness to our study. However, despite some early success, we have not been able to reliably generate dynamical timecourses. The reason stems from the very low levels of FLC-Venus in <italic>fca3/fca-4</italic>, and corresponding high laser power required for imaging. Under such conditions, the roots are clearly unhappy, cells only elongate and stop dividing, presumably due to cell cycle arrest, and we also cannot observe any switching. We have tried multiple methodologies, including on plates, chambered coverslips (with roots growing between the coverglass and a block of agar), and an agarblock chamber containing perfluorodecalin to maintain constant levels of oxygen while imaging, but without success. Very rarely (2 roots only, 1 in <italic>fca-3</italic> and 1 in <italic>fca-4</italic>), we found roots that did still grow, with cells dividing, and in both cases we were able to identify switching from ON to OFF. However, we do not think this is sufficiently reproducible to be included in the manuscript. Instead, analysing high-precision population-level FLC data from imaging snapshots, as we have already presented in the manuscript, is the only feasible approach. We emphasise that this approach is fully sufficient to justify our conclusions: the reducing fraction of cells with visible <italic>FLC</italic> mRNA/protein can only be achieved through individual cells predominantly switching off <italic>FLC</italic> expression over time.</p><p>These new results do show, however, that an active cell cycle is required for switching, but we do not have evidence that this is specifically connected to division. We have also examined this in our computational model and found that our results are unchanged if we drop this connection. Therefore, we have simplified the model to remove the cell-division link to switching, so that a switch from ON to OFF can happen at any time, independently of the cell-cycle stage, with a constant probability per unit time, provided that the cell has an active cell cycle (which all the cells we simulate do, as they are all in the division zone of the root). A switch from OFF-to-ON with a low 7% rate relative to the ON-to-OFF transition was also added to this model (see response to Reviewer 3’s comments below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The nature of the genetic materials (e.g. fca-3 and FLC-Venus) used or created in this study should be clearly characterized and described in the manuscript. Notably, the intermediate mutant fca-3 exhibits comparable FCA expression levels to the strong mutant fca-1 (Figure 3B). How the mutations in these alleles eventually cause different FLC expression levels and flowering time could be relevant to different types of FCA forms produced in these mutants. As fca-1 and fca-3 are crucial genetic material used in this study, more detailed information on these two mutants and rationales of selecting fca-3 as the intermediate mutant should be provided for interpreting the results obtained in this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out this omission. We have added much more information on the genotypes in the methods of the manuscript. We emphasise, however, that the rationale for selecting <italic>fca-3</italic> as an intermediate mutant was empirical: namely, it generates an intermediate level of <italic>FLC</italic> expression (Figure 1C and Figure 1S1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors utilized the root system with transgenes in mutant backgrounds to observe and model the repression of FLC expression. In some experiments, the authors compared the results obtained from different tissues (e.g. qPCR measurement of FLC in whole plants in Figure 3A versus FLC signal in root cells in other panels). As FLC mainly functions in leaves and the shoot apical meristem (SAM) to regulate flowering time, how the molecular logic deduced from root cells could be applicable to FLC roles in leaves and SAM should be justified with concrete evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>The developmental structure, with clonal cell files, and transparency of the Arabidopsis root make it an ideal tissue for our imaging analysis. Imaging green tissues with very low expression, such as FLCVenus in <italic>fca-3</italic> mutant, is extremely challenging (see point 1 above). However, we have now managed to obtain images of FLC-Venus in young leaf tissues using ClearSee (a method that diminishes autofluorescence while preserving fluorescent protein signal; see Kurihara et al., ClearSee: a rapid optical clearing reagent for whole-plant fluorescence imaging, Development (2015)). Using this method, we have now imaged FLC in young leaves (Figure 2S4) in Ler, <italic>fca-3</italic> and <italic>fca1</italic>. As can be seen from this image, we observe a similar pattern as in the roots: (Ler cells OFF, <italic>fca-1</italic> cells ON, <italic>fca-3</italic> cells some OFF and some cells ON, with ON cells at an analog reduced intensity compared to <italic>fca-1</italic>). In the non-root tissue, even for imaging snapshots, full statistics would require a completely new image analysis pipeline for young leaves rather than roots. Developing such a pipeline for these tissues is, we feel, beyond the scope of this work, and would also require huge amounts of additional image acquisition to gather enough cells. Instead, we show example images in the revised manuscript to make it visually clear that <italic>FLC</italic> in young leaves does indeed behave similarly to the roots.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. For the time-course experiments (e.g. Figure 3A and 4B), examination of FLC expression or active copies beyond the floral transition stage (particularly for Ler) could be biologically irrelevant.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, Ler is the only line that has transitioned to flowering during the experiment, with both <italic>fca</italic> lines being late flowering mutants. We totally agree that for Ler, later timepoints may be biologically irrelevant. It is used in this case as a negative control for the imaging, since <italic>FLC</italic> in Ler was already mostly OFF from the first timepoint and no biological conclusions are drawn from the later times. We have added a comment to this effect in the Results section, also clarifying in the discussion that our focus is on the early regulation of <italic>FLC</italic>. Therefore, by looking at the young seedling in wildtype Ler, as we and others have previously, we are already looking too late to capture the switching of <italic>FLC</italic> to OFF. However, we expect that this combination of analog and digital regulation will be highly relevant to <italic>FLC</italic> regulation in wild-type plants in different accessions, partly leading to the differences in autumn <italic>FLC</italic> levels that were shown to be so important in the wild (Hepworth et al. 2020). We have added more discussion on this point also in relation to comment 7 below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The thresholding definition of digitally ON and OFF of FLC expression seems too arbitrary. This needs to be better justified, and, if necessary, redefined.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the choice of threshold is somewhat arbitrary, as the ON and OFF distributions are overlapping. Specifically for the Venus fluorescence intensity data, we have now removed the statements in the manuscript that were related to quantification based on these thresholds, and avoided using thresholds where possible. As we now make clearer in the manuscript, we now use a threshold to compare only the tails of the fluorescence intensity <italic>fca-3</italic> distributions at the three timepoints (Figure 3S4). We use the high threshold of 1, to look only at the tail of the ON cells.</p><p>We have retained thresholds from smFISH experiments, where measurements of mRNAs are absolute. In this case, we tested other thresholds and our conclusions are robust to the choice of threshold, as shown in new Figure 2S2. We have, however, employed a slightly higher threshold (more than 3 visible foci rather than 1 for ON cells), as we believe this accounts better for spurious noisy foci present at very low levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The authors should consider whether it is more appropriate to use medians rather than means for the plots exhibiting skewed distributions. In addition, biological repeats and statistical analyses are required for most of the quantitative data in this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that showing medians may be more appropriate and we have now added the medians as well as the means to all relevant plots where we make comparisons in the manuscript, also allowing a comparison for the reader. The statistical test used to compare distributions is the non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test, so though we were showing the means, this was not what was being compared in the statistical tests. We have now also added statistical tests for Figure 1C, 3B which were previously missing. We performed biological repeats and data shown is combined cells from two or three biological replicates. The only exception was where the tissue was labelled as cortex/epidermis, where data from only one experiment were used. Therefore, we have now removed this panel. We have also now added number of experiment repeats in the figure legends. Furthermore, the supplementary file indicates from which replicate each cell measurement originated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

Switching of cells from an analog into a digitally silenced state is, we believe, still clear from the population level data: comparing ON cells in <italic>fca-3</italic> versus <italic>fca-1</italic> at the 7-day timepoint, it is clear that the former has lower FLC levels (both protein and RNA), thus demonstrating analog regulation. Over time, at a population level in <italic>fca-3</italic>, the proportion of ON cells decreases, with the fraction of cells with no visible FLC increasing, thus supporting a predominantly one-way switch into a digitally silenced state. Our modelling also supports a predominantly one-way switch to digital OFF, although a much lower rate of switching back to analog ON is also possible, as we now show. Overall, we find that analog regulation does predominantly precede digital: if this were not so, there would be no progressive reduction in the number of ON cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

About the half-lives of FLC mRNA and FLC protein: the measurements effectively indicate relatively short half-lives but could the authors show further evidence (e.g. using a simple model) that these values are compatible with the interpretation of their results. This would be more convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>The measured half-lives are indeed short (hours) compared to the developmental timescale (weeks). For this reason, the decay of protein/RNA can't cause the analog reduction we see in <italic>fca-3</italic>. In a scenario where all the cells in <italic>fca-3</italic> switch off early on, then all the protein/RNA would be lost within a day, which is not what we observe. This rapid decay, with all protein/RNA lost within a day of switching, is also why we don't incorporate these dynamics into the model: there will be a short period of intermediate FLC levels immediately after a cell switches OFF, but this is a very minor effect given the weeks-long duration of development in our experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. As the link between division and digital regulation is important to the model, couldn't the authors use live-imaging to show this functional link? That would be an important addition to the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>See response to Essential comment 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Concerning the model again, the authors could show that they reproduce also the wild-type and fca-1 situations. Notably for the wild-type, the mRNA and protein distribution are relatively similar despite the clear quantitative difference and this would strengthen the modeling analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>For the wild-type and <italic>fca-1</italic> situations there is no switching in the model, and hence no dynamical changes in the FLC protein levels. As the FLC levels in the ON or OFF states are simply fit to the data using log-normal distributions, this would simply be a fitting exercise for <italic>fca-1</italic> and Ler, and little would be learnt. Hence, we have not pursued this line of analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. How do the authors explain that fca-1 still flowers despite the absence of switch? Does the s.itch occur later? Is this an artifact resulting from the use of roots instead of shoots?</p></disp-quote><p>Highly expressing <italic>FLC</italic> lines and mutants, such as Col<italic>FRI</italic> and <italic>fca-9</italic>, often used for vernalization studies, are late flowering, but do eventually flower even with no decrease in <italic>FLC</italic> levels (and so no switching). This is not an artifact of using roots versus shoots, and presumably arises from there being multiple inputs into the flowering decision which can allow the FLC-mediated flowering inhibition to eventually be overcome.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The authors could show that the digital regulation of FLC is also dependent on Polycomb in absence of cold treatment (or cite existing work if this evidence already exists). This would help to better connect this work to what is known in the case of cold exposure.</p></disp-quote><p>H3K27me3, the Polycomb mark, is present at <italic>FLC</italic> in wildtype Ler and Col-0, where <italic>FLC</italic> is silenced in the absence of cold treatment. In Col<italic>FRI</italic> and the natural variant Lov-1, both of which have high <italic>FLC</italic> in the absence of cold treatment, H3K27me3 levels at <italic>FLC</italic> are low. In the <italic>clf</italic> mutant in Col-0 it has been observed that <italic>FLC</italic> is upregulated and H3K27me3 is reduced (Shu et al., 2019). This evidence does not prove that the digitally-silenced state in this case is Polycomb dependent, but we propose it as a likely explanation considering the analogy with the cold-dependent digital state. We now say this explicitly in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. It would be important that the authors discuss more the relevance of their findings to what occurs in wild-type background and to better highlight why their findings are important for understanding how flowering is controlled. This is missing at the moment. Is it reasonable to speculate that FRI allelic series could represent a situation somehow equivalent to what has been studied in this work? In relation to this, I am not convinced that the authors can claim that analog regulation is dependent on the autonomous pathway. As such their data could rather indicate that the autonomous pathway in Ler prevent analog regulation, allowing for an efficient digital regulation of FLC. If an analog regulation of FLC indeed exists in the wild, one could envision that it rather arises from an equilibrium between at least the FRI and autonomous pathways. The authors should revise this claim and discuss how they envision that analog regulation could occur in wild-type plants.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s comment that analog regulation most likely arises from an equilibrium between FRI and autonomous pathways and have added to the manuscript that we would expect a FRI allelic series to be equivalent. Additional discussion on the importance of these findings for flowering regulation in natural variants has also now been added. Regarding the reviewer’s comment that the autonomous pathway prevents analog regulation in Ler, we would in principle agree, but are using a slightly different framing of what we believe is effectively the same statement, which is that the autonomous pathway in Ler prevents analog upregulation, giving low analog levels that are easily overturned by Polycomb.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The nature of the fca-3 mutant should be described in detail.</p><p>What is the phenotype (flowering time) of FLC-venus in fca-1 and fca-3?

Could the authors better justify the use of fca-3 as an 'intermediate' state to assess the interplay between digital and analog mode? Given the outcome of the quantifications, perhaps the word 'intermediate' might need to be reconsidered. Adding more comments about these levels during the text (better describe its medians rather than means) would be also appreciated.</p></disp-quote><p>As described elsewhere, we now also use the medians as well as the means to assess the FLC levels. It is true that the FLC levels in <italic>fca-3</italic> are much closer to Ler than to <italic>fca-1</italic>. Nevertheless, they are clearly distinctly higher than in Ler. For this reason, we think the description “intermediate” (whose definition means coming between two things) is appropriate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The model needs some further clarity to better connect it with the data, and, if possible, it would be ideal if this could be used for understanding the different regulatory modes.</p><p>I would suggest the authors use the model to provide examples such the different regulatory modes (digital, analog and combined digital-analog regulation) can be recapitulated and more easily connected to the data.

If this is the case, I invite the authors to consider reformulating the model to clarify the different regulatory modes and better connect it with the data.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer points out, reworking the model and presentation in the way suggested is not straightforward.

(say a Poisson distribution, as that may give you a better indication of dividing since you are counting the number of cycles a cell goes through).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added more clarification to justify the choice of the equations in 505-507, including the choice of the log-normal distribution.

Presumably, by visual observation of the experimental data one could think this may happen – e.g. when looking at a given time point in cells along the same row in some cases in fca-3 and fca-1. Furthermore, could the model help in evaluating how things would change if OFF-ON transitions are included?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included switching from OFF to ON in the model, thus weakening our assumptions.

For consistency, wouldn't it be possible to perform the qPCR in root tips?

In terms of conclusions – please revise the used (type of) tests; it is strange to me that fca-1 does not show a significant decrease, as commented in lines 221 and 233.</p></disp-quote><p>qPCR at root tips is extremely difficult as it requires a large number plants and laborious methodology. Instead, we have taken the opposite approach which is to retain whole plant qPCR, but use single cell imagery in other parts of the plant (the young leaves). This reinforces our conclusion that the reduction in expression found at the whole plant level in <italic>fca-3</italic> in Figure 3A is due to more and more cells switching to a digitally silenced state over time. Finally, we do not think it appropriate to revise the statistical tests, which are the accepted methodology. We have doublechecked the result of the statistical test for <italic>fca-1</italic> in Figure 3A and it is indeed not significant. We believe this is because of the wide error bars at the first time point. However, a separate experiment in non-transgenic plants showed similar trends but in that case the decrease was significant.

We now explain this directly where we discuss these issues in the main text. Therefore, any differences in FLC-Venus level do not reflect differences associated with the insertion site but differences in the genetic background (in this case, different <italic>fca</italic> alleles). Moreover, the different genotypes were always imaged together while using the same settings, which is a common practice when comparing fluorescent protein levels. Furthermore, the differences between Ler, <italic>fca-1</italic> and <italic>fca-3</italic> are very large and, for <italic>fca-1</italic> and <italic>fca-3</italic>, are supported by RNA FISH experiments that rely on counts of single mRNA molecules and correspond to absolute numbers, thereby eliminating any need for internal controls. For these reasons we do not think that such an internal control is necessary. Furthermore, including such a control would require crossing with a marker line and re-selection of FLC-Venus homozygous lines. This would therefore require ~12 months of work for the generation of these lines plus redoing all imaging experiments and data analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Demonstrating expression of FLC in shoot tissues is also certainly strengthening the hypothesis that the mode of action seen in the root is relevant to shoot tissues. However, it would be nice if the authors could mention at the end of the discussion that, finding a way to address these two questions in the future will be important to explore further how the regulation they have identified acts in the regulation of flowering.</p></disp-quote><p>This aspect has now been added in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I appreciate that the authors have addressed several criticisms from reviewers in this revision.</p><p>This study reports the existence of an &quot;analog&quot; mode of regulation in addition to the previously reported &quot;ON-OFF&quot; switch for FLC regulation. By comparing the levels of FLC mRNA/protein in different genetic backgrounds, the authors provide evidence for the analog mode of FLC regulation.

The main conclusion of the manuscript hinges on the different behaviors of FLC (analog) observed in these genetic backgrounds. Therefore, it is crucial to address how the various alleles of fca influence FLC regulation.

I appreciate the detailed description of different alleles of fca used in this revision. However, I am still puzzled how fca-1 and fca-3, which both failed to produce &quot;functional&quot; FCA protein, resulted in different analog expressions of FLC. The authors discussed the analog regulation of FLC as an early regulation of FLC and the level of transcription affects the Polycomb switch.

I find the manuscript has improved, although I still have several issues I would like to comment on:</p><p>1. I appreciate the effort to study the FLC behavior in leaves. Yet, by eye it is difficult to distinguish whether Ler and fca-3 are exhibiting different behaviors, as the authors claim it is occurring in the root (Ler and fca-3 seem to express at the same levels in Figure 2S4). Hence, despite of the challenge, I believe quantification would be important to support the claims by the authors, although I am aware the authors were told by the editor this could be done 'without the need of in-depth quantification'. Otherwise, could the authors comment on that, and clarify in the manuscript?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now quantified FLC-Venus levels in shoot tissues for the three genotypes. The quantification reveals the same trend as we had identified by visual inspection (Figure Supp 2S4B) and which is in agreement with the data from the root tissues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In my understanding, the ON transcriptional state between Ler and fca-3 is having the same (median) levels, according to Figure 2S2, which tells us that the differences between these two lines is just in the digital mode, and not the analog mode. Hence, if I understand well, digital and analog mode is not seen (or I could not clearly see) in the same line at the same time – at least, at the transcriptional level. If this is the case, I think the claim of the integration of digital and analog might need to be revised, given the current data is not showing both regulations in the same line. If this is not the case, I believe I am misunderstanding the interpretation of your data, and further clarifications would be needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We agree that our quantification according to Figure 2S2 does not immediately reveal the transcriptional differences between Ler and <italic>fca-3</italic>. However, we are confident that the differences do exist and are not immediately apparent in the quantification because of a technical issue. The reason for this is that unspecific signals can be counted as real signals through automated quantification. When expression levels are high, this effect is negligible, but when expression levels are very low, the effect of unspecific signals becomes significant. As a result, the differences between Ler and <italic>fca-3</italic> don't appear large through our automated counting. However, we were able to verify that a real difference was present through visual inspection of the images. We conducted a blind test, where we manually counted the number of transcripts in images in which the genotype was omitted. Our, blind manual counting has revealed that no signals were counted in Ler, whereas for <italic>fca-3</italic> we could easily detect a small number of transcripts (2-15 mRNAs/cell) in a few cells. Thus, there is a real difference between Ler and <italic>fca-3</italic>, which is also evident in the FLC-Venus protein quantification analysis. For the above technical reasons, it's not as apparent through our automated image analysis pipeline.</p><p>We have explained these issues in the manuscript (in the Results and Methods sections) and we now also state that Ler quantification in smFISH is not distinguishable from the background. However, a more subtle analysis nevertheless still reveals that Ler and <italic>fca-3</italic> are clearly different in our smFISH results, not only in the significantly different all-cell distributions of Figure 2C, but also in the ON cell analysis of Figure 2S1/2. While ON cells in <italic>fca-3</italic> have similar counts as Ler &quot;ON&quot; cells (not real ON but false positives from noisy background), a much higher percentage of ON cells is detected in <italic>fca-3</italic> (Figure 2S1/2). Therefore, these ON cells detected in <italic>fca-3</italic> cannot be a consequence of the technical issue described above. If they were, we would expect similar frequencies of high background cells between genotypes. Hence, even from the ON cell analysis we see that <italic>fca-3</italic> is expressed at a higher analog level compared to Ler, and lower compared to <italic>fca-1</italic>.</p><p>We have also added text in the Discussion to explain how the analog/digital modes are integrated, highlighting that analog expression varies across genotypes but is predominantly stably set within each genotype over time, while digital regulation does occur over time (with the probability of digital switching affected by the analog levels). We hope this clarifies any confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. I agreed with the comment 3 by Reviewer 1, and the authors thought it is not needed to provide further evidence, given the differences between the half-lives timescales (hours) with the developmental timescales (weeks). Yet, I am wondering whether the timescale to compare to understand in part the resulting distributions should also be the division timescale (a day). Given this manuscript relies on quantitative evidences, I believe it is still unclear for the reader whether dilution effects or the protein or RNA half-lives (perhaps together with noise) might broaden the histograms, conferring the false impression of analog regulation. Could slightly different dilution (and noisy) rates between the different lines account for the different protein levels shown in Figure 2? I think given the central scope of this manuscript on distinguishing what is analog and what is digital, this point needs more justification and/or clarification (ideally, a model could help).</p></disp-quote><p>The correct timescale to compare the half-lives to when interpreting the gradual drop of expression and Venus intensity in the time course experiment is definitely the developmental switching timescale of 1-2 weeks. Indeed, during the process of switching there will be a short period (hours) during which the mRNA/protein levels decay in that cell, which will broaden the histograms. But at a given moment when we are measuring the mRNA/proteins levels only a small fraction of the cells (few percent) will actually be undergoing this process (~6 hr switching time out of ~10 days of growth). Hence, it cannot significantly affect histograms. We have revised the relevant section of the manuscript “FLC RNA and protein are degraded quickly relative to the cell cycle duration” to try to make this clearer. Furthermore, this effect would give the impression of analog regulation within a single genotype (hiding the digital effect) rather than affecting the comparison between genotypes where we see the analog effect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. I understand that the authors might find the manual fitting good enough for them, but they derive conclusions out of it, in particular now they give numbers about the OFF-ON rates in relation to the ON-OFF rates. I think that given the quantitative scope of this work, it would be more ideal to have a more reproducible fitting to have solid conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not agree that introducing a more complex fitting procedure will change any of our conclusions. We do give OFF-ON versus ON-OFF rates but because of the fact that cells are clearly turning off over time at a population level, there is no escaping the conclusion that the ON to OFF rate must be much higher. A more sophisticated fitting cannot change this fundamental conclusion. Furthermore, as our current fitting method provides reasonable fits to almost all our data, we do not see how making this aspect more elaborate is going to lead to any significant changes. Accordingly, and as this point was not highlighted by the editors as being an essential revision, we have therefore opted not to make any further changes on this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Overall, although I appreciate the very good and interesting work from the authors, I still find there are aspects of clarity of the manuscript that need to be revised, that better link the data from the conclusions extracted by the authors. For instance, as I said above it is not clear to me what the authors really mean by 'the integration of the digital and analog regulation', given I do not clearly see such two modes acting in the same line, and I am still hesitant about not seeing a bimodal distribution whose expression levels could be modulated, which would be the major evidence to me. Also, lines in the abstract 39-40 are not totally clear to me; I understand there is a slow time scale for the digital silencing, but I am not totally sure about associating a timescale to the analog regulation, and therefore, to compare both timescales. (Maintenance of expression levels does not necessarily show to me that analog precedes the digital silencing). I would appreciate more clarifications in this directions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now revised the Discussion to better explain the integration of digital and analog. Regarding the abstract, we state that the analog precedes the digital. Indeed, we do not associate a timescale to the analog, which varies according to genotype, not time. The Discussion now clarifies this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. I noticed that the manuscript version with tracked changes (which is the version I initially read in detail) is not the same as the non-tracked version (e.g. see lines 553 and 596, which refer to Sup File 3 and Sup. File 1, and compare it with the tracked version, in which the equivalent sentences would refer to Sup. File 1 and Supp Table 4, respectively). I hope there are not further major differences between the tracked and non-tracked manuscripts.</p></disp-quote><p>We can confirm that no further major differences exist between these files.
