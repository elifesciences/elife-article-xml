Yet, the neural processes that occur in human primary motor and somatosensory cortex during planning, and how they relate to those during movement execution, remain poorly understood. Here, we used 7T functional magnetic resonance imaging and a delayed movement paradigm to study single finger movement planning and execution. The inclusion of no-go trials and variable delays allowed us to separate what are typically overlapping planning and execution brain responses. Although our univariate results show widespread deactivation during finger planning, multivariate pattern analysis revealed finger-specific activity patterns in contralateral primary somatosensory cortex (S1), which predicted the planned finger action. Surprisingly, these activity patterns were as informative as those found in contralateral primary motor cortex (M1). Control analyses ruled out the possibility that the detected information was an artifact of subthreshold movements during the preparatory delay. Furthermore, we observed that finger-specific activity patterns during planning were highly correlated to those during execution. These findings reveal that motor planning activates the specific S1 and M1 circuits that are engaged during the execution of a finger press, while activity in both regions is overall suppressed. We propose that preparatory states in S1 may improve movement control through changes in sensory processing or via direct influence of spinal motor neurons.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>motor planning</kwd><kwd>sensorimotor cortex</kwd><kwd>finger control</kwd><kwd>fMRI</kwd><kwd>representational geometry</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010785</institution-id><institution>Canada First Research Excellence Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BrainsCAN</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Diedrichsen</surname><given-names>Jörn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Movement planning elicits finger-specific activity in primary somatosensory cortex that is strongly correlated to the finger-specific activity elicited during movement execution.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Animals are capable of generating a wide variety of dexterous behaviors accurately and effortlessly on a daily basis. This remarkable ability relies on the motor system reaching the appropriate preparatory state before each movement is initiated.</p><p>At the level of behavior, the process of motor programming, or planning, has long been shown to be beneficial to performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Keele, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Keele et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rosenbaum, 1980</xref>), leading to faster reaction times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Klapp and Erwin, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Klapp, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Haith et al., 2016</xref>) and more accurate response selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ghez et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wong and Haith, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ariani and Diedrichsen, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hardwick et al., 2019</xref>). The behavioral study of motor planning led to neurophysiological investigations showing the presence of preparatory signals in the patterns of neuronal firing in the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cisek and Kalaska, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cisek and Kalaska, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hoshi and Tanji, 2006</xref>), the supplementary motor area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hoshi and Tanji, 2004</xref>), and the posterior parietal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cui and Andersen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cui and Andersen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen and Cui, 2009</xref>). Building on this work, human neuroimaging studies have shown that activity in parietofrontal brain regions during planning of prehension movements can be used to decode several movement properties such as grip type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gallivan et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ariani et al., 2015</xref>), action order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gallivan et al., 2016</xref>), and effector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gallivan et al., 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gallivan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Leoné et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Turella et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>At the level of neural population dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vyas et al., 2020</xref>), motor planning can be understood as bringing the neuronal state toward an ideal preparatory point. Once this state is reached and the execution is triggered, the intrinsic dynamics of the system then let the movement unfold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Churchland et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shenoy et al., 2013</xref>). Preparatory neural processes have not only been observed in premotor and parietal areas, but also in primary motor cortex (M1, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tanji and Evarts, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crammond and Kalaska, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ariani et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, the degree to which primary somatosensory cortex (S1) receives information about the planned movement before movement onset is less clear.</p><p>S1 is often considered to be mostly concerned with processing incoming sensory information from tactile and proprioceptive receptors arising after movement onset. Consistent with this notion, previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI studies have not detected the presence of planning-related information in this area <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gallivan et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gallivan et al., 2011b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gallivan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gallivan et al., 2013</xref>; although see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gale et al., 2021</xref>). However, challenging this notion, in the past years research has shown that S1 can be somatotopically activated even in the absence of tactile inputs, for instance during touch observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kuehn et al., 2014</xref>), attempted movements without afferent tactile inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kikkert et al., 2021</xref>), and through attentional shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Puckett et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, a recent human electrocorticography (ECoG) study suggested a possible role for S1 in cognitive-motor imagery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jafari et al., 2020</xref>). The authors recorded neural activity from S1 while a tetraplegic participant imagined reaching movements and found that S1 neurons encoded movement direction during motor imagery in the absence of actual sensations. Another recent ECoG study in nonhuman primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Umeda et al., 2019</xref>) showed grasp-specific information in the signals from S1 well before movement initiation, and only slightly later than in M1.</p><p>However, it remains unknown whether S1 plays a role during motor planning in human participants with an intact sensory system. Furthermore, we currently do not know how the signals during action preparation relate to those during execution, a fact that could provide important insight into the role these signals may play.</p><p>Here, we designed a high-field (7T) fMRI experiment to study what brain regions underlie the planning of individual finger presses and how these brain representations relate to those during execution. We used variable delays between an instructing cue and a go signal, as well randomly interspersed no-go trials, to temporally separate the evoked responses to movement planning and execution. Using advanced multivariate pattern analyses we were able to examine the relationship between the fMRI patterns related to planned and executed finger actions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Deactivation in sensorimotor regions during planning of finger actions</title><p>We instructed 22 participants to plan and execute repeated keypresses with individual fingers of their right hand on a keyboard device while being scanned with 7T fMRI.

After a variable delay (4–8 s), participants received a color cue indicating whether to press the planned finger (go trials), or whether to withhold the response (no-go trials).

To ensure that planning results would not be biased by the subsequent execution, we restricted all our analyses of the preparation phase to no-go trials only (see Materials and methods). First, we asked which brain regions showed an evoked response during the planning of finger presses (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>We focused our analysis on the lateral aspect of the contralateral (left) hemisphere (purple and white areas of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> inset), which included the primary motor and somatosensory cortex, as well as the premotor cortex and anterior parietal cortical regions. To examine brain activation during finger planning, we performed a univariate contrast of the preparation phase (across the three fingers) vs the resting baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Overall, the instruction stimulus evoked little to no activation in our regions of interest (ROIs, see Materials and methods). In fact, compared to resting baseline, we observed significant deactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) in the primary motor cortex (M1, <italic>t</italic><sub>21</sub> = −6.939, p = 7.446e−07) and in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1, <italic>t</italic><sub>21</sub> = −5.508, p = 1.823e−05). Significant deactivation was also observed in the PMd (<italic>t</italic><sub>21</sub> = −2.929, p = 0.008). While anterior regions in the superior parietal lobule (aSPL) showed some signs of activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>), these did not reach statistical significance when tested at the ROI level (<italic>t</italic><sub>21</sub> = 1.881, p = 0.074).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Activation and distance analyses of movement planning and execution.</title><p>The inset shows the inflated cortical surface of the contralateral (left) hemisphere, highlighting the area of interest (A-D, purple) and the strip used for the profile region of interest (ROI) analysis (E, F, white).

This lack of planning-related activation in high-order areas in planning is likely explained by the low task difficulty (i.e., little planning demands). Participants were only asked to plan repeated movements of a single finger, resulting in little amounts of overall planning activation. In contrast, execution strongly activated both primary and high-order sensorimotor regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), with activation being significant in all tested ROIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, all <italic>t</italic><sub>21</sub> &gt; 14.824, all p &lt; 1.351e−12).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Planning induces informative patterns in primary somatosensory and motor cortex</title><p>Although we found little univariate planning-related activation, preparatory processes need not increase the overall activation in a region. Rather, the region could converge to a specific preparatory neural state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Churchland et al., 2010</xref>), while activity increments and decrements within the region (i.e., at a finer spatial scale) average each other out. In this case, information about planned movements would be present in the multivoxel activity patterns in that region.</p><p>To test this idea, we calculated the cross-validated Mahalanobis dissimilarity, or crossnobis distance (see Materials and methods), between activity patterns. First, the activation patterns (beta weights) for the planning phase of no-go trials where prewhitened using the voxel-by-voxel covariance matrix. The distance was then calculated by comparing activity patterns across partitions (imaging runs), such that the value of the dissimilarity is on average zero if the two conditions only differ by measurement noise. Thus, systematically positive values of this dissimilarity measure indicate that the patterns reliably differentiate between the different planned actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Walther et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arbuckle et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, a surface-based searchlight approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Oosterhof et al., 2012</xref>) revealed reliably positive crossnobis distance between the activity patterns related to planning of individual finger presses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), which the ROI analysis confirmed to be significantly greater than zero in both M1 (<italic>t</italic><sub>21</sub> = 2.343, p = 0.029) and S1 (<italic>t</italic><sub>21</sub> = 3.137, p = 0.005, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p><p>The distribution on the flat surface map of these distance values during planning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) appeared to be highly similar to the distribution of distances during execution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). To quantify this topographic similarity, we computed the ratio between distances in different Brodmann area (BA) subdivisions of our ROIs (see Materials and methods), reasoning that a mismatch in location would result in large differences in ratio values. However, the ratio between planning and execution distances was roughly stable across the different subregions of sensorimotor cortex (BA 4a: 0.23, BA 4b: 0.16, BA 3a: 0.24, BA 3b: 0.19, BA 1: 0.22, BA 2: 0.31). In other words, the average distance between finger-specific activity patterns during planning was between 16% and 31% of the average pattern distance during execution. Thus, we not only show the existence of planning-related activity in S1, but also that S1 activity patterns are at least as informative as M1 activity patterns.</p><p>Visual inspection suggested that the informative patterns during planning may be concentrated more dorsally in M1 and S1 relative to execution. To test for the possibility that the location on the flat surface map of the peaks of the crossnobis distance for M1 and S1 was statistically different across subjects between planning and execution, we used a Hotelling <italic>T</italic><sup>2</sup> test that allowed us to compare the difference between two multivariate means of different distributions (i.e., the distributions of <italic>x</italic>–<italic>y</italic> coordinates for the peaks of planning and execution).

Neurophysiological experiments have suggested that patterns of movement preparation are orthogonal – or uncorrelated – to the patterns underlying active movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kaufman et al., 2014</xref>). This arrangement allows movement preparation to occur without causing overt movement.</p><p>When we compared the planning- and execution-related activity patterns as measured with fMRI, a technique that samples neuronal activity at a much coarser spatial resolution, we found the opposite result. Planning- and execution-related patterns for the same finger were tightly related.

Importantly, however, when ignoring the overall difference between the mean patterns for planning and execution, by looking at a rotated view of the representational geometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <italic>bottom</italic>), it became clear that the finger patterns were arranged in a congruent way, with planning- and execution-related activity patterns for the same finger being closer to one another. This representation suggested that the finger-specific patterns during planning may be a scaled-down version of the patterns during execution.</p><p>To test this idea more precisely, we quantified the correspondence (i.e., correlation) between planning and execution patterns for each finger using pattern component modeling (PCM, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Diedrichsen et al., 2018</xref>). Because of the biasing influence of measurement noise, simple correlations between measured fMRI patterns are substantially lower than their true correlation (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.diedrichsenlab.org/BrainDataScience/noisy_correlation">http://www.diedrichsenlab.org/BrainDataScience/noisy_correlation</ext-link>). PCM corrects for this bias by evaluating the likelihood of the data (taking into account the measurement noise), under a range of models with a true correlation between 0 and 1. In other words, rather than asking which correlation value is the best estimate given the data, PCM asks how likely the data is given different correlation values (see Materials and methods for details).</p><p>The log-likelihood of the data under each model (evaluated individually for each participant and then averaged) is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>. Across participants, the averaged maximum likelihood estimate of the correlation (i.e., the average best fitting correlation model) was <italic>r</italic> = 0.83 (±0.053 standard error of the mean [SEM]) for M1 and <italic>r</italic> = 0.81 (±0.061 SEM) for S1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, red dashed lines). By comparing these estimates to the zero-correlation model, we can conclude that the correlation of finger-specific patterns across planning and execution was significantly larger than zero in both M1 and S1 (both <italic>t</italic><sub>21</sub> &gt; 13.288, p &lt; 1.086e−10 in a two-tailed one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test against zero). However, the maximum likelihood estimates of the correlation cannot be used to evaluate whether the overlap of these patterns was only partial (<italic>r</italic> &lt; 1) or complete (<italic>r</italic> = 1), as the estimates are still biased due to measurement noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Walther et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Diedrichsen et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, in a cross-validated fashion, we compared for each participant the log-likelihood of the best fitting model (determined on all other participants, see Materials and methods) to the log-likelihood under the model that the patterns are perfectly correlated (<italic>r</italic> = 1). Across participants, this difference was not significant for either M1 (<italic>t</italic><sub>21</sub> = 0.953, p = 0.176) or S1 (<italic>t</italic><sub>21</sub> = 0.148, p = 0.442). Given that no correlation model had significantly higher log-likelihoods than the 1-correlation model, we cannot rule out that the underlying true correlation was indeed 1. In other words, we have as much evidence that the correspondence was only partial as we do that the correspondence was perfect. By comparing the best fitting correlation model to every other correlation model, we have evidence that the true (i.e., noiseless) correlation between planning and execution finger-specific activity pattern was between 0.41 and 1.0 in M1 and between 0.54 and 1.0 in S1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, pink-shaded areas).</p><p>Thus, our data are consistent with the idea that, at the resolution of fMRI, the activity patterns for planning and execution of finger presses in S1 and M1 are either partially overlapping or even a scaled version of each other.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, we asked participants to produce repeated single finger presses while undergoing 7T fMRI. We used variable preparatory delays and no-go trials to cleanly dissociate the brain responses to the consecutive preparation and movement phases. We found that information about planned finger actions is present in both S1 and M1 before action onset, even though the overall level of activation in these regions was below resting baseline. Moreover, while execution elicited much higher brain activation, the fine-grained, finger-specific activity patterns were highly similar across planning and execution. Control analyses confirmed that the observed results were not caused by premovement finger activity.</p><p>Our finding that motor planning activates M1 in a finger-specific fashion was not necessarily surprising given many neurophysiological studies reporting anticipatory activity of M1 neurons related to movement intentions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tanji and Evarts, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Riehle and Requin, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander and Crutcher, 1990</xref>), as well as human neuroimaging showing shared information between delayed and immediate movement plans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ariani et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, the robust activity patterns related to single finger planning in S1 were more surprising, given that this region has classically been associated with the passive processing of somatosensory information from receptors in the skin, muscles, and tendons.</p><p>So, what could then be the role of S1 during movement planning? First, it is worth noting that there are substantial projections from S1 (BA 3a) that terminate in the ventral horn of the corticospinal tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coulter and Jones, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rathelot and Strick, 2006</xref>). Although stimulation of area 3a in macaques typically fails to evoke overt movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Widener and Cheney, 1997</xref>), it has been suggested that this population of corticomotoneurons specifically projects to gamma motoneurons that control the sensitivity of muscle spindle afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rathelot and Strick, 2006</xref>). Thus, it is possible that S1 plays an active role in movement generation by preparing the spindle apparatus in advance of the movement.</p><p>Second, the finger-specific preparatory state in S1 may reflect the prediction of the upcoming sensory stimulation, allowing for a movement-specific sensory gain control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Azim and Seki, 2019</xref>). It is likely that, this process is also accompanied by an allocation of attention to the cued finger. However, as voluntary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gallivan et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gallivan et al., 2011b</xref>) planning requires attention, our current dataset cannot distinguish between the two possibilities. Sensory stimuli could become attenuated to maintain movement stability and filter out irrelevant or self-generated signals. Indeed, multiple studies have shown that both somatosensation and somatosensory-evoked potentials in S1 decrease during voluntary movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Starr and Cohen, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chapman et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jiang et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Seki and Fetz, 2012</xref>). Alternatively, sensory processing of the expected salient signals could be enhanced to improve movement execution.</p><p>While several previous fMRI studies did not find action-specific encoding in S1 during planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gallivan et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gallivan et al., 2011b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gallivan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gallivan et al., 2013</xref>), concurrently with our study a second paper found movement-specific modulation of S1 preparatory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gale et al., 2021</xref>). Together, these two papers provide convergent evidence that motor planning triggers notable changes in the neural state of the somatosensory system and that such changes can be detected with fMRI in humans.</p><p>The second important finding in our paper was the close correspondence between finger-specific activity patterns across planning and execution – which appears to be at odds with the idea that these two processes occupy orthogonal neural subspaces to avoid overt movement during planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kaufman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Elsayed et al., 2016</xref>). We think that there are at least two possible explanations for this. First, the divergence of results could be caused by the difference in behavioral paradigms. While the neuronal correlates of movement planning in nonhuman primates have largely been studied using upper limb movements, we used here individuated finger presses. If for single finger actions even single-neuron activity patterns are highly correlated between planning and execution, then overt movement during planning would need to be actively suppressed, for example through the deactivation that we observed around the central sulcus.</p><p>An alternative and perhaps more likely explanation of the discrepancy lies in the different measurement modalities. Orthogonality was observed in electrophysiological recordings of individual neurons, whereas the fMRI measurements we employed here mainly reflect excitatory postsynaptic potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Logothetis et al., 2001</xref>) and average metabolic activity across hundreds of thousands of cortical neurons. Thus, it is possible that planning preactivates the specific cortical columns in M1 and S1 that are also most active during movement of that finger. Within each of these cortical microcircuits, however, planning-related activity could still be orthogonal to the activity observed during execution at the single-neuron level (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arbuckle et al., 2020</xref>, for a similar observation for cortical representations of flexion and extension finger movements). This would suggest a new hypothesis for the architecture of the sensory–motor system where movement planning preactivates the action-specific circuits in M1 and S1. However, it does so in a fashion that the induced planning-related activity is, in terms of the firing output of neurons, orthogonal to the patterns during execution.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Twenty-three right-handed neurologically healthy participants volunteered to take part in the experiment (13 F, 10 M; age 20–31 years, mean 23.43 years, SD 4.08 years).

To limit and monitor unwanted movements during the preparation phase, we required participants to preactivate their fingers by maintaining a steady force of around 0.2–0.3 N on all of the keys during the preparation phase. As a visual aid, we displayed a red area (between 0 and 0.5 N) and asked participants to remain in the middle of that range with all the fingers (touching either boundary of the red area would count as unwanted movement, thus incurring an error). We preferred this technique over using electromyography (EMG) recordings to monitor micromovements during the preparation phase because extensive pilot experiments for our studies of ipsilateral representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Diedrichsen et al., 2013</xref>) and mirroring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ejaz et al., 2018</xref>) showed that force fluctuations from preactivated hand muscles provide a more sensitive readout of involuntary muscle activations compared to EMG signals acquired during fMRI.</p><p>At the onset of the movement phase (green background), participants received a color cue (go/no-go cue) indicating whether to perform the planned finger presses (blue outline = go, p = 0.6), or not (orange outline = no-go, p = 0.4).

Participants received online feedback on the correctness of each press with asterisks turning either green, for a correct press, or red, for incorrect presses. As long as the participants remained within task constraints (i.e., six keypresses in less than 2.5 s), an exact movement speed was not enforced.

In an event-related design, we randomly interleaved three types of repeated single finger presses involving the tip of the thumb (1), the middle (3), and the little (5) fingers (e.g., 111,111 for thumb presses, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and three types of multifinger sequences (e.g., 135,315).</p><p>The day before the fMRI scan, participants familiarized themselves with the experimental apparatus and the go/no-go paradigm in a short behavioral session of practice outside the scanner (five blocks, about 15–30 min in total). This short training made the requirement of maintaining a steady force on all keys during the preparation phase very easy. In fact, the system was calibrated so that the natural weight of the hand on the keys was enough to bring the finger forces within the correct range to be maintained. Thus, it is likely that little online control was required by the participants before pressing the keys.</p><p>For the behavioral practice, ITIs were kept to a fixed 1 s to speed up the task, and participants were presented with different sequences from what they would see while in the scanner.

Next, we inflated each surface into a sphere and aligned it using sulcal depth and curvature information to the Freesurfer average atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fischl et al., 1999</xref>). Both hemispheres in each participant were then resampled into Workbench’s 164 k vertex grid. This allowed us to compare similar areas of the cortical surface in each participant by selecting the corresponding vertices on the group atlas.</p><p>Anatomical ROIs were defined using a probabilistic cytoarchitectonic atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fischl et al., 2008</xref>) projected onto the common group surface. Our main ROIs were defined bilaterally as follows: primary motor cortex (M1) was defined by including nodes with the highest probability of belonging to BAa 4a and 4b, within 2 cm above and below the hand knob anatomical landmark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yousry et al., 1997</xref>); primary somatosensory cortex (S1) was defined by the nodes related to BA 1, 2, 3a, and 3b; PMd was defined at the junction between the superior frontal sulcus and the precentral sulcus (BA 6); finally, the anterior part of the superior parietal lobule (aSPL, BA 5) included areas anterior, superior, and ventral to the intraparietal sulcus. ROI definition was carried out separately in each subject using FSL’s subcortical segmentation. When resampling functional onto the surface, to avoid contamination between M1 and S1 activities, we excluded voxels with more than 25% of their volume in the gray matter on the opposite side of the central sulcus.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Multivariate distance analysis</title><p>To detect single finger representations across the cortical surface, we used representational similarity analysis (RSA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Diedrichsen and Kriegeskorte, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Walther et al., 2016</xref>) with a surface-based searchlight approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Oosterhof et al., 2011</xref>). For each node, we selected a region (the searchlight) corresponding to 100 voxels (12 mm disc radius) in the gray matter and computed cross-validated Mahalanobis (crossnobis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Walther et al., 2016</xref>) dissimilarities between pairs of evoked activity patterns (beta estimates from first-level GLM) of single finger sequences, during both preparation and movement phases.</p><p>Prior to calculating the dissimilarities, beta weights for each condition were spatially prewhitened that is weighted by the matrix square root of the noise covariance matrix estimated from the residuals of the GLM. The noise covariance matrix was slightly regularized toward a diagonal matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ledoit and Wolf, 2004</xref>). Multivariate prewhitening has been shown to increase the reliability of dissimilarity estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Walther et al., 2016</xref>). The dissimilarity was then computed by multiplying the difference between two conditions patterns with the pattern difference for the same conditions of any other run, and then averaging over all runs and voxels. This resulted in 15 dissimilarities between the 6 conditions (3 single fingers, separately for planning and execution), which can be visualized as a 6 × 6 RDM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). An alternative visualization can be obtained using classical MDS, which shows the six conditions as points projected into the 3D space spanned by the eigenvectors of the patterns that were associated with the three largest eigenvalues (i.e., the three principal components).</p><p>For the searchlight analysis, we assigned the average distance between any of the three planning conditions to the central node of the searchlight. The region was then moved across all nodes across the surface sheet obtaining a cortical map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). An equivalent analysis was conducted for the execution patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Cross-validation ensures the distances estimates are unbiased, such that if two patterns differ only by measurement noise, the mean of the estimated value would be zero. This also means that estimates can sometimes become negative. Therefore, dissimilarities significantly larger than zero indicate that two patterns are reliably distinct, similar to an above-chance performance in a cross-validated pattern-classification analysis.</p><p>The searchlight analysis was mainly used for visualization purposes. Additionally, we conducted the multivariate analysis separately for each anatomically defined ROI (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). For the profile ROI analysis (both univariate and multivariate, e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E, F</xref>), we defined 50 rectangular surface-based searchlights in each hemisphere that covered the virtual strip shown in the top inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and that were aligned to the boundaries between different ROI subdivisions. Based on these surface-based searchlights, we defined the voxel-based subdivisions in individual brains. For statistical comparisons, these subdivisions were successively grouped by averaging within-ROI subdivisions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E, F</xref>). This approach allowed us to compute both ROI-level statistical comparisons and the analysis of the ratio of distances in the different subdivisions of our main ROIs (e.g., M1 into BA4a and BA4b). Statistical comparisons consisted of two-sided one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test vs zero for selected ROIs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Correlation between behavioral and neural distances</title><p>To ensure that our planning results were not contaminated by unwanted micromovements during the preparation phase, we calculated the behavioral distance between the different fingers on the basis of keyboard force data and correlated behavioral and neural distances.</p><p>For behavioral distances, we first extracted force data (2-ms temporal resolution, smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 9.42 full width at half maximum, FWHM) and binned it in 10 ms steps (downsampling largely due to memory constraints) for both the preparation and movement phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Next, for each subject, we calculated the mean (5) and the standard deviation (5) of the time-averaged force of each finger for each condition (3 sequences × 2 phases = 6) and block (10). These subject-specific finger force patterns (60 × 10) were multivariately prewhitened using their covariance matrix. Finally, we calculated the cross-validated squared Euclidean distances for each condition (6 × 6 RDM) and averaged distances between the three finger presses for each phase (preparation, movement).</p><p>These mean finger force distances for each subject were correlated with the mean voxel activity distances from the two phases for two ROIs (M1 and S1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). To statistically assess that the neural distances were still significantly larger than zero even in the absence of behavioral distances, we computed the pvalue for the intercept of the linear fit.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>PCM correlation models</title><p>Visual inspection of the RDM and MDS plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>) suggested that the finger-specific activity patterns during planning and execution might be arranged in a congruent fashion. This correspondence can be assessed by determining the correlation between the planning and execution activity patterns for matching fingers (i.e., planning finger 1 with executing finger 1), after accounting for the average activity pattern for planning and execution across fingers.</p><p>The problem with simple Pearson’s correlations or cross-validated correlations is that these measures are biased by noise. Even if the patterns for planning and execution were perfectly correlated (i.e., a scaled version of each other), the empirical correlation estimates would not be one (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.diedrichsenlab.org/BrainDataScience/noisy_correlation">http://www.diedrichsenlab.org/BrainDataScience/noisy_correlation</ext-link>). Therefore, we used (PCM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Diedrichsen et al., 2018</xref>, openly available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://github.com/DiedrichsenLab/PcmPy">github.com/DiedrichsenLab/PcmPy</ext-link>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:efd5abc2fee8f926a4cf781bea11fda2eada9efa;origin=https://github.com/g14r/single-finger-planning;visit=swh:1:snp:4cd06438b2697f030ac456034ccfac31601590fc;anchor=swh:1:rev:076b9a685ed116b1f0b83a68a0955d0cc5323a42">swh:1:rev:076b9a685ed116b1f0b83a68a0955d0cc5323a42</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ariani, 2022</xref>) to generate different models, each assuming a specific correlation between planning and execution patterns on the interval between 0 and 1 in steps of 0.01. We then computed the log-likelihood of the observed data (<italic>Y</italic>, the 6 activation patterns observed in 10 runs) from each participant under each correlation model (<italic>r</italic>): <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:math></inline-formula> , which is plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>. PCM assumes that both the true activity patterns and the measurement noise are randomly distributed with a multivariate Gaussian distribution. The likelihood of the data under each model can then be analytically evaluated (for details see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Diedrichsen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Diedrichsen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Diedrichsen et al., 2021</xref>). This likelihood depends only on the covariance matrix of the measured activity patterns and the predicted covariance matrix from the model. (Note: more precisely it relies on the measured and the predicted second moment matrix, as we do not subtract out the mean of each pattern across voxels.) Like RSA, PCM therefore abstracts away from the actual activity patterns, as it only depends on the relationship between the patterns, but does not have to model the pattern themselves. In fact, there is a 1:1 relationship between the second moment matrix used in PCM and the RDM used in RSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Diedrichsen and Kriegeskorte, 2017</xref>). In both cases, the correlation between two conditions (e.g., planning and execution, for each finger) can be seen as the diagonal of the off-diagonal block of this matrix. The approach is also equivalent to an encoding model estimated with Ridge regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Diedrichsen and Kriegeskorte, 2017</xref>), with the advantage that it can be estimated in closed form without fallback on cross-validation.</p><p>Here, we used 100 PCM correlation models with correlations in the range [0–1] in equal step sizes. The number of correlation models was chosen arbitrarily—ultimately, it only determines the amount of correlation values tested (i.e., the resolution on the <italic>x</italic>-axis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). By exploring the entire log-likelihood function across different correlations models, this approach allows us to test specific hypothesis even if the signal-to-noise level is low.</p><p>Apart from a fixed correlation, each model contained five free parameters, each describing the variance of specific pattern component. The first two parameters captured the variance of the common pattern for all execution patterns and the variance of the common pattern for all planning patterns. Together, these two components captured the overall difference between planning and execution. The next two parameters captured the variance associated with the three fingers under the two conditions. Finally, the noise parameter determined the variance of the measurement noise. Because all correlation models had the same number of parameters, we simply maximized the likelihood for each correlation model in respect to these parameters.</p><p>The curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> shows the average log-likelihood for each correlation model (100 models from 0 to 1 in equal steps sizes), relative to the mean log-likelihood across models (zero on the <italic>y</italic>-axis). Differences between the log-likelihoods can be interpreted as log-Bayes factors. Group inferences were performed using a simple <italic>t</italic>-tests on the log-likelihoods.</p><p>To compare specific models to the best fitting model, we had to correct for the bias arising from picking the best model and testing it on the same data. Therefore, we used <italic>N</italic> − 1 subjects to determine the group winning model, and then chose the log-likelihood of this model for the left-out subject (for whom this model may not be the best one) as the likelihood for the ‘best’ model. This was repeated across all subjects and a one-sided paired-sample <italic>t</italic>-test was performed on the recorded log-likelihood and every other model.</p><p>This test revealed which of the correlation models were significantly worse (i.e., associated with a lower log-likelihood) than the winning model that was independently estimated via cross-validation (gray-shaded area in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p>In sum, PCM has the advantage over alternative approaches in that it provides stable inferences even for noisy data, offering an optimal evaluation (in the likelihood sense) of the real evidence present in the data about the true correlation between two activity patterns.

BOLD patterns of activation/deactivation and finger-specific pattern discriminability indicate that M1 and S1 are involved not only during execution, but also during planning of single finger presses. These important results clearly establish that the role of primary somatosensory cortex goes beyond pure processing of tactile information and will be of great interest for researchers in the field of motor control and of systems neuroscience.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69517.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Baker</surname><given-names>Chris I</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Serino</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Kikkert</surname><given-names>Sanne</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution>ETH Zürich</institution><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2020.12.17.423254">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.17.423254v3">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

These findings partially limit the novelty and the impact of the present investigation. Following the evidence emerging from this recent research, I think the authors might consider conducting additional analyses to strengthen their research and better characterise the presented results.</p><p>Given the high spatial resolution of the study, I think that it might be helpful to focus on specific sub-fields of the somatosensory cortex to dissect their specific roles. In addition, based on the recent description of the possible role of ipsilateral cortices in representing movements, it would be also interesting to investigate the role of ipsilateral S1 (and M1) and to compare the pattern of finger-specific movements within these regions with the regions of the contralateral hemisphere. Finally, it would be interesting to provide whole brain data both for the univariate and the multivariate analyses in order to provide a global overview of the involved brain regions and of the brain areas hosting finger-specific patterns.</p><p>1) Lack of activation during the planning phase</p><p>Most previous fMRI studies on motor planning using complex movements instructed participants to stay still during the planning phase. It is not surprising to see deactivation or activation at baseline during this phase.</p><p>In this study, the lack of activation in S1 and M1 during planning is surprising for me, given that the participants were engaged in a visuomotor task throughout the whole duration of the preparation/planning phase (Figure 1A, lines 303-308). Participants had to pre-activate their fingers by maintaining a steady force on all the keys during the preparation phase. Moreover, a visual feedback showing the applied force was displayed and participants had to apply a force to maintain the level of this feedback within a specific range.</p><p>This type of task is rather demanding, so I would expect to see the engagement of parieto-frontal motor networks during motor planning. Could it be possible that the lack of activation in S1 and M1 during planning is simply due to how the data were modelled in the GLM. The authors reported that they modelled only the first 2 seconds of the preparation phase (lines 394-397) as this phase has different durations (4-8 seconds). As an additional control analysis, it might be interesting to directly compare the preparation phase with the initial and final baseline by explicitly modelling the baseline in the GLM.</p><p>As a general suggestion, I would recommend the authors to provide whole brain analysis as supplementary materials (see point 4).</p><p>2) Specificity of the described effects in the somatosensory cortex</p><p>I would suggest investigating the role of the different subsections of S1. One possibility could be to adopt the parcellation of the Anatomy toolbox, as implemented in a recent investigation (Gale et al., 2021), or by analysing separately the different cytoarchitectonic maps adopted to create the S1 ROI (see lines 416-417). This study (Gale et al., 2021) suggest that S1 subsectors might represent different information during action planning. Support to the possible role of S1 in motor control comes from a recent neurophysiological study showing the possible encoding of complex arm movements, and not only of somatosensory information, within area BA 2 of macaque monkeys (Chowdhury et al., 2020). The higher spatial resolution of the present study might provide support to the data presented in the and/or new insights of the specificity of the described effect in the somatosensory cortex.</p><p>3) Role of ipsilateral hemisphere</p><p>I would also suggest conducting the same type of analyses on S1 and M1 of the ipsilateral hemisphere as a meaningful control site. Moreover, this analysis could provide novel insights on the possible role of ipsilateral S1 in representing ipsilateral movements. Indeed, there is a growing body of evidence showing the representation of ipsilateral movements in the motor cortex (Bundy and Leuthardt, 2019), but much less is known on the role of S1. If a representation of the planned movements is present in one or more subsectors of S1 (see Gale et al. 2021), the comparison between the informative patterns across the two phases of the task (and maybe even across hemispheres) might be also of interest.</p><p>4) Whole brain univariate analyses and searchlight analyses</p><p>I think it would be useful to provide whole brain data of the univariate and multivariate analyses for the two phases of the task. The authors might consider adding the results of these analyses as supplementary figures.</p><p>Whole brain univariate results could provide an overview of the network of regions engaged during the planning of finger movements. Looking at Figure 1, it seems that there is only an anterior parietal region recruited by the task (possibly at an uncorrected level). I would expect to see activation in parieto-frontal regions. This analysis might also partially answer to my first point.</p><p>I also would suggest conducting searchlight analyses for the two phases of the task. These analyses might serve different purpose. First, these results could provide insights on additional regions (e.g. parietal regions, SII) representing different planned finger movements. Second, as most (if not all) previous MVPA studies adopting paradigm with a delayed execution in the field investigated complex hand/arm actions, the present data might provide an indirect indication on which part of the parieto-frontal motor networks are engaged for simple finger movements and which are specific for more complex arm/hand actions.</p><p>Finally, the comparison/conjunction between univariate and multivariate results might provide insights on the regions within the motor networks which are both engaged by the task and host a representation of the different movements. This analysis would be particularly interesting for the planning phase of the task.</p><p>5) Comparison of the topography of informative patterns between the planning and execution phase of the task</p><p>I apologise in advance if this concern is related to my misinterpretation of this analysis, as I'm not familiar with the Hotelling T2 test (lines 130-132). My understanding of this test is that it allows to test the difference between two (multivariate) means of different distributions. I think that the authors compared the distribution of the crossnobis distance for M1 and S1 across subjects.</p><p>If my understanding of the analysis is correct, then this analysis showed that the distribution of crossnobis distances within M1 and S1 is consistent across the two phases, but this analysis doesn't directly test if the spatial organization of the informative patterns across the 2 phases is different. I would suggest to directly compare the distribution of crossnobis distance between the two phases across subjects independently in each vertex of M1 and S1. The result of this analysis would be a spatial map of the difference between the distributions of the two phases. This would allow to appreciate if there is any spatial asymmetry between the 2 phases.</p><p>As a general recommendation, I would suggest providing additional details in the description of this analysis to allow an easier understanding of its implications.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. I urge the authors to include more details regarding the analysis they conducted. This is an overall recommendation, but a few things were specifically unclear to me:</p><p>a. Since the PCM is not a commonly used analysis, the manuscript would especially benefit from more conceptual explanation regarding the rationale of conducting this analysis, further explanation on the method, and how the achieved r-values can be interpreted.</p><p>b. What does the colourbar scaling represent in Figure 1B and C – is this percent signal change?</p><p>c. Similarly – Are all coloured vertices in Figure 2A-D significantly activated/ have significant distances? Or what does a value of 0.1 and 0.001 represent? Also, are the maps in Figure 2A and C corrected for multiple comparisons? This is not reported in the Methods section or the figure legend.</p><p>d. What analysis was ran to test for informative patterns in M1 and S1 while correcting for the influence of behavioural patterns – this analysis is not reported in the methods section.</p><p>e. Did the authors correct for multiple comparisons across the ROIs tested?</p><p>f. For the analysis presented Figs 2E and F, did the authors average across the y-coordinates on the whole brain flatmap, or were this values extracted from a single straight line? i.e. do the distances on the cortical surface represent averages or rather values from single vertices? This analysis is not mentioned in the Methods section.</p><p>g. The PCM rationale is better explained in the Results section, from only reading the methods section the rationale behind this method was unclear.</p><p>h. Regarding the PCM analysis: If a model of 0.4 correlation is most predictive, can we conclude the representational patterns are significantly correlated? Or how can we interpret these correlational models?</p><p>i. Regarding the PCM analysis: How could a best fitting model perform better from the one-correlation model (i.e. does it make sense to test achieved r&gt;1)? Isn't a correlation of 1 the maximum achievable value? I think that if activity patterns during planning and execution are truly a mere scaled version of each other, the correlation between the activity patterns should be 1. So if the achieved r is sig less than 1, this would argue against the scaled version argument. This means that the authors should test if their model performs sig less than the one-correlation model.</p><p>2. What could potentially be added to the argument against micromovements explaining neural distances in S1/M1 during movement planning is that the expected correlation would be positive, while you see a non-significant negative correlation. It would also be interesting to test whether there are significant differences between the behavioural and neural distances during planning and execution for each ROI. For me that would be more convincing than showing a mere non-significant correlation (without Bayesian stats).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69517.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>• To help the reader, the description of the PCM analyses should be improved.

We agree that adding whole-brain maps (including ipsilateral M1/S1) as supplementary material would provide a more complete picture of our results. Using 3 possible actions and advanced statistical methods like PCM to test for the correspondence of movement-specific activation patterns between planning and execution, our study provides an important further insight into the planning activity in M1 and S1. Second, on a technical note, we believe that our paper provides a more thorough control for micro-movements during planning (by monitoring finger forces during the preparation phase) and a cleaner separation of planning and execution (by limiting the analysis to no-go trials). We now acknowledge the Gale et al.

One possibility could be to adopt the parcellation of the Anatomy toolbox, as implemented in a recent investigation (Gale et al., 2021), or by analysing separately the different cytoarchitectonic maps adopted to create the S1 ROI (see lines 416-417). This study (Gale et al., 2021) suggest that S1 subsectors might represent different information during action planning. Support to the possible role of S1 in motor control comes from a recent neurophysiological study showing the possible encoding of complex arm movements, and not only of somatosensory information, within area BA 2 of macaque monkeys (Chowdhury et al., 2020). The higher spatial resolution of the present study might provide support to the data presented in the and/or new insights of the specificity of the described effect in the somatosensory cortex.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this suggestion, we agree that looking into different S1 subsections could potentially enrich our paper. Therefore, we have repeated our profile ROI analysis (Figure 2E-2F) to allow for separation of the different subdivisions of M1 and S1. We used rectangular searchlights (50 per virtual strip in each hemisphere) that were defined to align with the boundaries between the different subdivision (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>, where each color corresponds to a different searchlight). Based on these surface-based ROIs, we defined the voxel-based ROIs in the individual brains. For statistical purposes, the rectangular searchlights were successively grouped by averaging within-ROI subdivisions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref>). This surface-based approach provides a more accurate separation of different subdivisions than the volume-based approach—see Fischl et al. (2008). The subdivisions are now clearly labeled in the profile plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1C</xref>) and new (Figure 2E-2F).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>A.</title><p>Example of rectangular searchlights used to examine different subsections of our ROIs, superimposed on the flat map of the left hemisphere.

Thus, this shows that the evidence for planning activity (in relationship to what is seen in execution) is roughly stable across subregions of S1 and M1.

Our current data only provide mixed evidence for this idea. When we performed the profile analysis (analogous to Figure 2E-2F) in the ipsilateral hemisphere we found slight deactivation around the central sulcus (comparable to the contralateral hemisphere) and very small (non-significantly different from zero) distances during planning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>) .

This means that the authors should test if their model performs sig less than the one-correlation model.</p></disp-quote><p>The maximum correlation achievable is indeed 1. We did not test whether the best fitting model has a correlation &gt; 1. Rather, we tested if the best fitting model (at the group level, found using a cross-validation, see Methods) had a higher log-likelihoods than the log-likelihoods for the 1-correlation model (Figure 4C). So, by “performs better”, we mean “has a higher likelihood”, not “has a higher correlation”. Our analysis shows that the best fitting model does not perform significantly better than the 1-correlation model. This is compatible with the view that planning and execution patterns are a scaled version of each other. We now clarify this in the text (page 13, line 380-384).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. What could potentially be added to the argument against micromovements explaining neural distances in S1/M1 during movement planning is that the expected correlation would be positive, while you see a non-significant negative correlation. It would also be interesting to test whether there are significant differences between the behavioural and neural distances during planning and execution for each ROI. For me that would be more convincing than showing a mere non-significant correlation (without Bayesian stats).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the idea of micro-movements would have predicted a positive correlation. The argument that the correlation was non-significant, and even slightly negative, does not provide the strongest evidence against this hypothesis. Our conclusion that micromovements cannot explain the representations found is that, even if we control for the influence of micromovements, the distances both in M1 and S1 are significant. This is now clearly outlined in the text (page 10, line 264-267) and we added the significant p-value for the intercept to Figure 3C.</p></body></sub-article></article>
