Even without such external perturbations, intrinsic sources like sensorimotor noise perturb the running motion incessantly, making each step variable. Here, using simple and generalizable models, we show that even such small step-to-step variability contains considerable information about strategies used to run stably. Deviations in the center of mass motion predict the corrective strategies during the next stance, well in advance of foot touchdown. Horizontal motion is stabilized by total leg impulse modulations, whereas the vertical motion is stabilized by differentially modulating the impulse within stance. We implement these human-derived control strategies on a simple computational biped, showing that it runs stably for hundreds of steps despite incessant noise-like perturbations or larger discrete perturbations. This running controller derived from natural variability echoes behaviors observed in previous animal and robot studies.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38371.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Running at a constant speed seems like a series of repetitive, identical strides, but it is not. There are small variations in each stride. Self-inflicted errors in the forces generated by the muscles, or misperceptions from the senses, may cause these tiny imperfections. Uneven terrain or other outside forces, like a push, can also cause changes in a running stride. People must correct for these small changes as they run to avoid falling down. The only way to correct errors in a stride is by changing the force exerted on the ground by the leg.</p><p>Now, Seethapathi and Srinivasan document step-by-step how people correct for small imperfections in their running stride to avoid falling. In the experiments, eight people ran on a treadmill at three different speeds while the motion of their torso and each foot was measured along with the forces of each foot on the treadmill. Seethapathi and Srinivasan found that these runners corrected for minor deviations by changing where each foot lands and how much force each leg applies to the treadmill. The runners placed their foot at a different position on each step and these varying foot positions could be predicted by the errors in the body movement between steps. These errors in body movement could also be used to predict how the runners would change the forces applied by their legs on each step. Imperfections in the stride were mostly corrected within the next step. Errors that would cause the runner to fall to the side were corrected more quickly than errors in forward or backward motion. Seethapathi and Srinivasan incorporated these corrective strategies into a computer simulation of a runner, resulting in a simulated runner that did not fall even when pushed.</p><p>These findings may inform the design of robots that run more like humans. They may also help create robotic exoskeletons, prosthetic legs and other assistive devices that help people with disabilities move more fluidly and avoid falling.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>human running</kwd><kwd>locomotion</kwd><kwd>motor control</kwd><kwd>stability</kwd><kwd>neuromechanics</kwd><kwd>bio-inspired control</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NSF CMMI grant 1254842</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Srinivasan</surname><given-names>Manoj</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100002322</institution-id><institution>Schlumberger Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Seethapathi</surname><given-names>Nidhi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Natural step-to-step variations show how human running is stabilized, underscoring the importance of center of mass control and showing how humans run without falling despite muscle noise and uneven terrain.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human running is often modeled as being periodic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blickhan and Full, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Seyfarth et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Srinivasan and Holmes, 2008</xref>). But running is not exactly periodic, even on a treadmill at constant speed. Body motion during running varies from step to step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cavanagh et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Belli et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jordan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jordan and Newell, 2008</xref>). This step-to-step variability could be due to internal perturbative sources like muscle force noise and sensory noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Warren et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harris and Wolpert, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Osborne et al., 2005</xref>) or small external perturbations (e.g. visual field inhomogeneity, small ground imperfections). To run without falling, the body’s ‘running controller’ must prevent the effects of these small perturbations from growing too large. Here, we provide an experimentally derived low-dimensional characterization of this control that reveals how humans run without falling down.</p><p>One classic modeling paradigm for running control assumes that the human leg behaves like a linear spring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blickhan, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McMahon and Cheng, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blickhan and Full, 1993</xref>). This paradigm has been used to argue how passive-elastic properties may reduce muscle work needed for locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander and Vernon, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander, 1990</xref>) and has been useful in examining locomotion in a simplified setting. Variants of these spring-mass running models have demonstrated stable running (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Seyfarth et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Seipel and Holmes, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ghigliazza et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Geyer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Srinivasan and Holmes, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Englsberger et al., 2016</xref>). These models have been successful in fitting the average center of mass motion during running (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blickhan and Full, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Geyer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Srinivasan and Holmes, 2008</xref>). However, understanding running stability requires understanding how deviations from the average motion are controlled. It has been previously recognized that spring-like leg mechanics cannot explain how deviations from the average motion are controlled and eventually attenuated (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ghigliazza et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Biewener and Daley, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maus et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we examine the role of active muscle control in running stability, using more general models of human locomotion rooted in Newtonian mechanics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Srinivasan, 2011</xref>).</p><p>One way of characterizing the running controller is to apply perturbations (for instance, pushes or pulls or sudden changes in terrain) and examine how the body recovers from the perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Van Woensel and Cavanagh, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Daley and Biewener, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Qiao and Jindrich, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Riddick and Kuo, 2016</xref>). Instead of such external perturbations, here, we use the naturally occurring step-to-step variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hurmuzlu and Basdogan, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maus et al., 2015</xref>) to characterize the controller. Previous attempts at examining such variability for controller information focused only on walking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hurmuzlu and Basdogan, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wang and Srinivasan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang and Srinivasan, 2014</xref>) or considered variants of the spring-mass model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maus et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we directly characterize the control in terms of how humans modulate their leg force magnitude and direction during running. The only way to control the center of mass motion is for the leg to systematically change the forces and the impulses it applies on the ground. We uncover how such center of mass control is achieved. We then implement this human-derived controller on a simple mathematical model of a biped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Srinivasan, 2011</xref>), showing that this biped model runs without falling down, despite incessant noise-like perturbations, large external perturbations, and on uneven terrain.</p><p>A human-derived controller such as the one proposed here could inform monitoring devices to quantify running stability or fall likelihood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">O'Loughlin et al., 1993</xref>), or could help understand running movement disorders. Further, implementing such controllers into robotic prostheses and exoskeletons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dollar and Herr, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shultz et al., 2015</xref>) will allow the human body to interact more ‘naturally’ with the device, rather than having to compensate for an unnatural controller. Some running robots have demonstrated stable running, using a variety of control schemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Raibert, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chevallereau et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tajima et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nelson et al., 2019</xref>). But these robots fall short of human performance and versatility. Understanding human running may lead to better running robots.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The step-to-step variability during running appears superficially random.

So, a rightward perturbation results in a more rightward step. Analogously, a forward velocity perturbation results in the foot being placed further forward relative to the body. As with the impulses, again, there is no significant coupling between sideways and fore-aft directions. Fore-aft foot placement modulation also depends on vertical position deviations, in a manner that the runner lands with a steeper leg when landing from a higher flight apex <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf100"><mml:msub><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>.

We can predict the foot placement using the center of mass state better than just the relative swing foot state until about 100 ms before foot touchdown. The explanatory power of the center of mass remains flat during flight. This flatness is likely because center of mass state follows a parabolic path during flight and thus accumulates no new variation. This lag between the explanatory power of the center of mass and the foot suggests that the error information in the center of mass state is yet to be fully incorporated into the swing foot re-positioning until the flight phase. During the brief flight phase, when the swing foot’s explanatory power increases, information from center of mass state is transferred to the foot, presumably via some mixture of feedback control and feedforward dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Continuous stance state feedback, station-keeping, and running speed do not significantly affect stance control</title><p>As an alternative to control based on discrete monitoring of deviations at the previous flight apex state, we considered a ‘continuous control’ model.

This causal account, based on simplifying modeling assumptions, ignores the effect of variables not considered here. Our goal here was to delineate the explanatory power of controller descriptions based on center of mass state. To identify the effect of perturbations of other possibly relevant state variables (such as trunk attitude and angular velocity), we may need to either independently perturb these state variables or show that the natural variability in such variables is not significantly correlated with the center of mass state. </p><p>The gain relating sideways foot placement and sideways velocity deviation was about 2.5 times greater than the gain relating fore-aft foot placement and fore-aft velocity deviation; a similar factor of 3 was found in walking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang and Srinivasan, 2014</xref>), perhaps reflecting the greater sideways instability of a biped without foot placement control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ghigliazza et al., 2005</xref>). Also consistent with lower control authority and a greater fall propensity in the sideways direction, we find that the recovery from a sideways perturbation is faster than from a fore-aft perturbation.

It is hard to rigorously separate the roles of feedforward and feedback control without recording motor neuronal outputs and how these outputs interact with the properties of muscles. Nevertheless, we can determine the feasibility of feedback control by checking whether there is enough time for feedback control, given typical neuromuscular latencies. Our typical flight phase durations are greater than or about roughly equal to the typical short- or middle- latencies in reflex or feedback loops involving vestibular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fitzpatrick et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Iles et al., 2007</xref>) or proprioceptive mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pearson and Collins, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sinkjær et al., 1999</xref>). This suggests feasibility of feedback based on flight phase or late stance phase information regarding center of mass state. While we have focused on the control of stance based on the previous flight apex, we have found that equivalent controllers based on the center of mass state at the end of previous stance have similar predictive ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), thus allowing more time for neural feedback. Specifically, the lag between the information in the center of mass state and the swing foot state regarding future foot placement is about 0.1 s for sideways placement and about twice that for fore-aft foot placement, suggesting sufficient time for neurally mediated feedback control of foot placement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>Center of mass state or other body state information needed for feedback control could be estimated by the nervous system by integrating sensory signals from vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Patla, 1997</xref>), proprioceptive sensors (especially when the foot is on the ground (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sainburg et al., 1995</xref>)), and vestibular sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angelaki and Cullen, 2008</xref>), potentially in combination with predictive internal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wolpert et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cullen, 2004</xref>). In future work, repeating the calculations herein (for instance, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) for experiments that systematically block or degrade (say, by adding sensory noise) one or more of these sensors may tell us the relative contributions of these sensors to running control. We speculate that most available relevant sensory information is used, perhaps analogous to an optimal state estimator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kuo, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Srinivasan, 2009</xref>), and degrading one sensor may result in sensory re-weighting on a slow time-scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carver et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Assländer and Peterka, 2014</xref>). Such experiments may also help explicitly distinguish the effects of sensory and motor noise, which we have implicitly combined here into a single residual term in the linear regressions. </p><p>In this work, we have obtained a running controller with simplifying assumptions. Because humans have extended feet, non-point-mass upper bodies and legs with masses, the simple point-mass model may not capture all aspects of the running data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bullimore and Burn, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Srinivasan and Holmes, 2008</xref>). Further, we have made simplifying assumptions about muscle architecture, muscle properties (linear force-velocity relations), and muscle activation, which are meant to capture the main qualitative dynamical features of muscles, rather than model them quantitatively precisely. For instance, we used a linear force-velocity relation, which may be sufficient to produce damping-like and stabilizing muscle behavior when activated, but this damping behavior may be accentuated by a more realistic nonlinear force-velocity relation.</p><p>Future work will also involve obtaining controllers for more complex biped models and muscle models with different control architectures, which, for instance, might include feedback control based on not just the center of mass state, but the states of individual body segments. We have focused on linear relations between state deviations and control, as this is naturally suited for small deviations and perturbations that our data contains. In future work, we hope to examine the range of perturbation sizes for which this linear description is accurate by comparing this linear control to responses in experiments with larger perturbations, also inferring nonlinear descriptions should they improve predictive capability. We will also examine other control architectures, for instance, more explicitly incorporating state estimation and considering continuous control of motor outputs based on an estimated state, partly correcting for neural latencies using internal models. </p><p>The methods used here are simple and non-invasive: they can be replicated to study running stability and control in other animals, or indeed, other approximately periodic tasks such as flapping flight and swimming. These methods are suitable for analyzing differences in different populations like athletes and non-athletes, the young and the elderly, and adults with and without movement disorders. Once such differences are well-characterized, this information could be used, say, in a rehabilitation setting to track progress from a controller in the presence of a movement disorder to a more healthy controller, and to design rehabilitation robots that assist in this progress.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>We collected running data by conducting human subject experiments, obtained linear models to characterize the control strategies hidden in the step-to-step variability, and performed dynamic simulations using the inferred controller on a mathematical model of the runner.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental methods</title><p>The protocols were approved by the Ohio State University Institution Review Board and subjects participated with informed consent.

To obtain the integration constants, we assume that the mean velocity and acceleration over the whole trial are zero, because the person does not translate appreciably in the lab frame over a trial. To remove the slow integration drift in the center of mass velocity, we used a high-pass filter with a frequency cut-off equal to an eighth of mean step frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Luinge and Veltink, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schepers et al., 2009</xref>). Changing this high-pass filter cut-off to a twentieth of the step frequency instead, or using a piecewise-linear de-trending over 20 steps, do not affect any of this article’s conclusions. This is because the stability-critical time-scales are much shorter. We ignored air drag here, because including it changed the velocities by less than 10<sup>-5</sup> ms<sup>-1</sup>, which is much smaller than the step-to-step variability. We use a weighted mean of four markers, roughly at the sacral level, as an approximation of the center of mass position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gard et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang and Srinivasan, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Perry and Srinivasan, 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Calculating the output control variables during stance</title><p>We assume that the following variables are used to control the runner: GRFs, foot placement, and the landing leg length.

We solve for these variables to obtain a periodic running motion that accurately match the forward speed, step period, step width, and peak leg force from experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>) by using an optimization procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Srinivasan and Holmes, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Srinivasan, 2011</xref>) that enforces a constraint satisfaction tolerance of less than <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf176"><mml:msup><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>6</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>. The runner leaves the ground when it reaches the maximum leg length, but the nominal leg length at landing is assumed to be shorter (95%) than the maximum leg length, as seen in running data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Voloshina and Ferris, 2015</xref>). We enforce that left and right stances are mirror symmetric. Unlike previous simple running models, our model’s nominal periodic motion has non-zero step width and a stance phase that is asymmetric about mid-stance. This asymmetric stance is due to unequal landing and take-off leg lengths, and the asymmetry of the leg force or muscle activation about mid-stance.</p><p>The foot placement control for the models are based on the experimentally derived control and given by the linear model in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ8 equ9">Equations 8 and 9</xref>. The leg force feedback control based on apex body state, for the direct force control model, has gains as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>. The muscle control model’s feedback control gains are also shown superimposed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>. These control gains were derived for the two models by modifying the Fourier coefficients for the force and muscle activations respectively, so that the linear map from one apex to the next is best matched to that from data (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 3</xref>). While there are infinitely many controllers, even for this simple biped model, that can approximate the apex-to-apex map, our simplifying assumptions constrains the space of controllers to produce a unique fit. The leg forces and muscle activations are rectified, so that they never become negative despite feedback control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Blum et al., 2017</xref>). The foot placement control and leg force feedback control are activated only when the apex state deviates from nominal.</p><p>To obtain a running simulation over many steps, we break up each step into three phases: flight from apex to beginning of stance, the stance phase, and flight from the end of stance to flight apex. The control actions for the next stance are chosen at flight apex. As previously defined for the experimental data, the flight apex is when <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf177"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mo>˙</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula> becomes zero. In some cases, if the vertical velocity is downward when a stance phase ends (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf178"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mo>˙</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>), there is no flight ‘apex’ and the controller uses the end of stance state instead of flight apex state as input. The end of flight and thus, the beginning of stance, are determined as the moment when the distance between the body and the target foot position is exactly equal to the landing leg length. The leg length at landing is also controlled based on flight apex state, based on the linear model in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ7">Equation 7</xref>. At flight apex, if the distance to the next foot position is less than the target landing leg length, the runner immediately goes into stance.</p><p>Such a simulation, when started from initial conditions exactly on the nominal periodic motion, results in a perfectly periodic motion when there are no further perturbations. We then re-simulated the two point-mass running models for hundreds of steps, in the presence of noisy foot placements and leg forces or muscle activations with step-to-step variability. To model the noise in foot placement, we computed the ‘desired’ foot placement based on the center of mass state at flight apex (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ8 equ9">Equations 8-9)</xref> and then added a deviation drawn from a normal distribution, whose variance equals the foot placement variance not explained by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ8">Equation 8</xref>. Similarly, we incorporated imprecise control of leg forces or muscle activation in the following manner: for each stance phase, once the leg force <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf179"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> (for model-1) or muscle activation <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf180"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> (for model-2) is determined based on the center of mass state at the previous flight apex, we ‘corrupt’ these functions by a multiplicative noise term, so that the actual leg force or muscle activation is <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf181"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>ϵ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> or <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf182"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>ϵ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> respectively, where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf183"><mml:mi>ϵ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is drawn from a normal distribution with variance equal to the unexplained step-to-step variability in leg force magnitude. Thus, we use the unexplained variance in the foot placement and leg forces from experimental regressions as a simple model of the intrinsic noise in active control.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Andy Ruina for useful comments on an early draft.

Your article has been reviewed by Andrew King as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.

This study of human running exploits the information contained in the natural step-to-step variability of the movement of the center of mass of the body as well as the ground reaction forces under the foot to 'reverse-engineer' the control algorithm. Using well-designed experiments and mathematical modelling, the authors provide key insights into how changes in foot placement and ground reaction force are modulated to deal with noise and perturbations to run stably. Interestingly, humans make these adjustments side-to-side within a stride, while fore-aft adjustments are made over several strides. Previous studies explained the role of elastic storage in the legs to run efficiently, the present findings shed new light on the central role of active muscle control to run stably. This finding is of broad interest to roboticists, engineers, and biomechanists interested in human and animal locomotion over terrain. The new information on how humans control their gait may be used to develop better controllers for powered exoskeletons and prostheses as well as humanoid robots.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1A) The authors tend to overstate the novelty of their findings in suggesting that past work based on a passive spring-mass running model cannot account for stable running. Past work based on spring-mass running mechanics was developed to argue for how passive-elastic properties may reduce the work of muscles needed to control leg and body movement. But these past studies do not claim that muscle work per se is unnecessary. As the author's own work (Srinivasan, 2011) and earlier papers (Alexander, 1997; Ruina et al., 2005) have noted (in addition to others – e.g. Biewener and Daley, 2007), spring-like leg behavior can result from an inelastic limb, in which muscle negative work is performed followed by equal positive work. The authors should revise to more accurately represent that understanding and approach of past workers on running dynamics in relation to their own work. We understand that some of these earlier studies may have overstated their implications towards dynamic stability during running. However, we encourage the authors to focus on their new data and model and let that speak towards the contribution of their study. Examples are listed below:</p><p>1B) The majority of those who have modeled steady running as a spring-mass system with spring-like leg dynamics do not suggest that this passive model is an accurate representation of how running is controlled, or that it would necessarily result in stable periodic motion following a perturbation. The authors' telescoping or single knee joint muscle-controlled leg model which shows net leg work (either negative or positive) is unsurprising in this regard and an expected result. Please better reflect that past workers who analyze running as spring-mass dynamics implicitly or explicitly recognize that some muscle work must be done to control the time-varying motions of a runner's CoM state for stable periodic motion.</p><p>1C) Introduction &quot;Here, in contrast, we eschew spring-mass-like assumptions and characterize the control in terms of how humans modulate their leg force magnitude and direction.&quot; This is somewhat misleading in that spring-mass assumptions previously made by other workers were to explore the extent to which running (trotting, hopping) can be explained by passive dynamics, while recognizing that some amount of muscle work to stabilize running (or to go uphill/downhill, change direction) is necessary. The majority of prior workers do not claim that running is purely passive and does not require muscle work for control and stability. Please reflect the understanding and work in the field more accurately here.</p><p>1D) Subsection “Human-derived controller stabilizes a minimal model of bipedal running”: &quot;Running stably cannot be purely passive and involves active leg work.&quot; Please revise so this does not overstate the significance of the authors' modeling and findings.</p><p>1E) Discussion section: The pseudo-elastic behavior of a runner's leg, which in fact could be entirely based on actuation (negative work followed by equivalent positive work) – as citations to Ruina et al., 2005 and Alexander, 1997 demonstrate, as well as the author's own past work (Srinivasan, 2011).</p><p>2) There is a large literature dedicated to understanding variability in gait (e.g., Dingwell's GEM; Chang's UCM; Hausdorff's long-term noise correlations; Laquaniti's principle components analysis etc.). These approached are predominantly based on characterizing the variability in kinematic measures as a way to assess 'stability', but they cannot say much about the underlying control and this has limited their impact on understanding control of gait mechanics more fundamentally. The approach presented here is a long-overdue, a more formal linear systems ID framework grounded in Newton-Euler mechanics. It may be worth acknowledging this and comparing/contrasting the utility of these two approaches (e.g., diagnosis vs. prediction) without overly criticizing previous approaches. E.g. by focusing one or a couple of sentences in the discussion on the key new abilities that add to previous approaches and how they could be used together in future studies.</p><p>3) The modeling approach taken here is framed in the form of a linear system ID, which is OK for small perturbations, in this case step to step variation around an average behavior. Figure 8 starts to address this in simulation, but how well does the approach hold for more explicit, larger perturbations at different phases of the gait where non-linearities might become more important? What is the plan to deal with this? Please clarify this, or the underlying limitations, in the discussion.</p><p>4) Please discuss the potential physiological mechanisms underlying the extracted controller, and suggest experiments that could be done to elucidate them if you have a new perspective on this. E.g., the authors mention a combination of feedforward and feedback processes but do not elaborate much on how vision, vestibular, proprioception, and cerebellar internal model may contribute.</p><p>5) Can this approach be applied to smaller data sets from single individuals as well? How variable is the controller across people and how much data is necessary to extract a good model?</p><p>6) Introduction &quot;Numerous running robots have demonstrated stable periodic running, using a variety of control schemes (Raibert, 1986; Chevallereau et al., 2005; Tajima et al., 2009).&quot; If robots are moving stably and periodically, as stated here, why then isn't human running and other animal running not stable and periodic as per the authors' lead statement (Introduction)? The earlier statement is made to argue the importance of muscle actuation for control to achieve truly stable periodic motion. Clearly both animals and robots need to do some muscle work to control movement. This inconsistency in phrasing needs to be addressed.</p><p>7) The regressions for equations 1and 2 should be shown (at least in supplemental materials).</p><p>8) Subsection “Impulse control is achieved by phase-dependent force modulations”: &quot;compute the phase-dependent sensitivity of the GRFs to…&quot; Exactly how are these phase-dependent sensitivities computed? (The y-axis label for these needs to be defined/explained more clearly.) This is explained in part (subsection “Linear regressions between the outputs and the inputs”) but could be made more clear and explicit when showing and referring to these patterns in Figure 4.</p><p>9) Figure 5: Swing-foot reposition and CoM state predictability of foot position – how these are determined/calculated needs to be made clear. Results are stated but their basis is not shown.</p><p>10) Figure 6: The force-velocity and force-length relations shown and implemented in the authors' model may be overly simple. F-V is an inverse hyperbolic not linear relationship and the lengthening side of F-V is much more skewed than the authors' model. (Also consider Zajac, 1989). How would a more realistic F-V relationship (inverse hyperbolic for shortening and a more steep and rapid leveling off of force in relation to lengthening) affect the authors' model?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38371.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1A) The authors tend to overstate the novelty of their findings in suggesting that past work based on a passive spring-mass running model cannot account for stable running.

We do agree with the remarks by the reviewers that many authors including those that have used and pioneered the spring-mass model paradigm recognized the limitations and simplifications of spring-mass models over the years, while perhaps some authors may have taken the metaphor far as the reviewers agree. We also agree that initially spring mass models were inspired by how passive elastic properties may help reduce the muscle work needed for running and have been valuable in thinking about these tasks. So as the reviewers suggest, we have focused more on our results rather than prior spring-mass-like models. Specifically, we have made the following edits to reduce or remove our critique of spring-mass-like models and/or more explicitly attribute its weakness to prior authors (which we had perhaps done more implicitly in the prior version via parenthetical citations). We have listed many of these edits below, which are in addition to the additional ones listed in response to comments 1B, 1C, 1D, and 1E.</p><p>Original: “The classic modeling paradigm for running control assumes that the human leg behaves like a linear spring (Blickhan, 1989; McMahon and Cheng, 1990; Blickhan and Full, 1993).”</p><p>Revised: “One classic modeling paradigm for running control assumes that the human leg behaves like a linear spring (Blickhan, 1989; McMahon and Cheng, 1990; Blickhan and Full, 1993).

In our previous writing of the paragraph, we weren’t clear enough that we were attributing some of these reasoning to prior researchers, although we had cited them parenthetically. We have re-written the relevant paragraph to hopefully reflect this prior understanding better:</p><p>“It is expected that any running controller that achieves asymptotic stability will need to perform net mechanical work in response to perturbations that decrease or increase the body’s mechanical energy (Ghigliazza et al., 2005; Srinivasan and Holmes, 2008; Maus et al., 2015). Our results are consistent with such expectation, as illustrated by the work-loops with net mechanical work in Figure 11. Energy-conservative spring-like leg behavior does not allow such net mechanical work and can achieve only partial asymptotic stability, not being able to handle energy-changing perturbations (as noted by Ghigliazza et al. (2005)).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1C) Introduction &quot;Here, in contrast, we eschew spring-mass-like assumptions and characterize the control in terms of how humans modulate their leg force magnitude and direction.&quot; This is somewhat misleading in that spring-mass assumptions previously made by other workers were to explore the extent to which running (trotting, hopping) can be explained by passive dynamics, while recognizing that some amount of muscle work to stabilize running (or to go uphill/downhill, change direction) is necessary.

All such positive perturbations result in net negative work on the first step after the perturbation, reflected in the work-loops with net negative area within them. Such net positive or negative leg work is clearly necessary to recover from perturbations that change the total mechanical energy of the runner, as was recognized in prior discussions of the energy-neutral spring-mass model of running (Ghigliazza et al., 2005; Biewener and Daley, 2007; Srinivasan and Holmes, 2008).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1E) Discussion section: The pseudo-elastic behavior of a runner's leg, which in fact could be entirely based on actuation (negative work followed by equivalent positive work) – as citations to Ruina et al., 2005 and Alexander, 1997 demonstrate, as well as the author's own past work (Srinivasan, 2011).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these remarks. We have now deleted the sentence that previously was” Our results suggest…”, as described in response to reviewer comment 1B.</p><p>Regarding the seventh paragraph of the Discussion section, we assume that the reviewers are agreeing with us and simply drawing our attention to our paragraph regarding prior discussions of pseudo-elastic leg behavior in running. We have left this paragraph mostly intact, editing it down slightly as follows:</p><p>“Indeed, it is generally thought that even the spring-mass-like steady state center of mass motion in running is due to considerable muscle action, and has been termed pseudo-elastic (Ruina et al., 2005) or pseudo-compliant (Alexander, 1997). Remarkably, energy-optimal running movements in models with no leg springs produce similar spring-mass-like center of mass trajectories (Srinivasan, 2011), with leg muscles performing equal amounts of positive and negative work.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There is a large literature dedicated to understanding variability in gait (e.g., Dingwell's GEM; Chang's UCM; Hausdorff's long-term noise correlations; Laquaniti's principle components analysis etc.).

We have now added a new paragraph that show how our methods can complement these other techniques:</p><p>“Some past work on inferring stability from variability focused on kinematic measures of variability such as Floquet multipliers, finite-time Lyapunov exponents (Dingwell et al., 2001) and long-term correlations in walking and running variability (Hausdorff et al., 1995; Jordan et al., 2006; Kaipust et al., 2012). Such measures can provide discriminative diagnostic measures (Kaipust et al., 2012), but do not attempt to provide a causal narrative about how locomotion is controlled. Our approach here, rooted in Newton-Euler mechanics, is able to discover potential causal strategies underlying locomotion stability, and by extension, could inform treatment of pathological unstable movements in addition to diagnosis. Other past studies has used variants of the principal component analysis (Cappellini et al., 2006; Maus et al., 2015) to demonstrate that the intrinsic variability in human locomotion may reside in a lower dimensional manifold (Cappellini et al., 2006; Maus et al., 2015, Dingwell et al., 2010; Chang et al., 2009; Yen et al., 2009; Maus et al., 2015). Here, we used a physics-based dimensionality reduction to examine the dominant control strategies, by focusing on how the center of mass is controlled through forces.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The modeling approach taken here is framed in the form of a linear system ID, which is OK for small perturbations, in this case step to step variation around an average behavior.

We have now added the following remarks in the Discussion section:</p><p>“We have focused on linear relations between state deviations and control as it is naturally suited for small deviations and perturbations that our data contains.

We have now added the following paragraph in the Discussion section, addressing the sensory integration that may be needed to accomplish feedback control:</p><p>“Center of mass state or other body state information needed for feedback control could be estimated by the nervous system by integrated sensory signals from vision (Patia, 1997), proprioceptive sensors (especially when the foot is on the ground (Sainburg et al., 1995)), and vestibular sensors (Angelaki and Cullen, 2008), potentially in combination with predictive internal models (Walpert et al., 1995; Cullen, 2004). In future work, repeating the calculations herein (for instance, Figure 5) for experiments that systematically block or degrade (say, by adding sensory nose) one or more of these sensors may well tell us the contributions of theses sensors to running control. We speculate that the most available relevant sensory information is used, perhaps analogous to an optimal state estimator (Kuo, 2005; Srinivasan, 2009) and degrading one sensor may result in sensory re-weighting on a slow time-scale (Carver et al., 2006; Assländer and Peterka, 2014).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Can this approach be applied to smaller data sets from single individuals as well? How variable is the controller across people and how much data is necessary to extract a good model?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this question. We have now added a completely new illustrative figure (Figure 12) that provides information on these questions. We have also added the following paragraph in the Discussion section, remarking on these issues.</p><p>“The results we have presented have been for data pooled over all subjects. Performing the regressions for data from individual subjects indicates that the dominant terms in the inferred controllers are similar for all subjects; the subject to subject variability in the estimated control gains are shown in Figure 12a. Figure 12b illustrates how the accuracy of an estimated control gain depends on the number of strides used for regression. For such linear regressions, the error estimate (standard deviation) is expected to decrease with <italic>N</italic><sub>stride</sub> like 1∕<italic>N</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>stride</sub>, so that a factor of 10 decrease in error requires a 100-fold increase in sample size (Wang and Srinivasan, 2012; Hamilton, 1994).

We refer to the coefficients in these linear models as a function of the phase <italic>Ø</italic><sub>stance</sub> as the phase-dependent sensitivities of the GRFs (Figure 5) to the corresponding predictor variable in (<italic>ẋ<sub>a</sub>, ẏ<sub>a</sub>, z<sub>a</sub></italic>).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Subsection “Impulse control is achieved by phase-dependent force modulations”: &quot;compute the phase-dependent sensitivity of the GRFs to…&quot; Exactly how are these phase-dependent sensitivities computed?

We have now added the following additional paragraph in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>“In addition to the regressions described above using the flight apex state as the predictor, we used the center of mass state (Δ<italic>ẋ<sub>a</sub>,</italic> Δ<italic>ẏ<sub>a</sub>,</italic> Δ<italic>z<sub>a</sub></italic>) at different phases over the previous step to predict each of the stance phase outputs. Specifically, for each stance phase output, we performed 20 regressions, each using the center of mass state at one of 20 equally spaced gait phases over the previous step, where one full step is defined as starting and ending at a touch-down. This analysis allows us to investigate the predictive ability of the center of mass state at different phases. For these phase-dependent regressions, in addition to using the center of mass state as the predictor, we repeated the calculations using the swing foot state (position and velocity relative to the center of mass), so as to compare the different predictive abilities as in Figure 6.”</p><p>We have also expanded the figure caption from</p><p><bold>“</bold>Figure 6. Swing foot control before foot placement.The fraction of sideways foot placement (panel a) and fore-aft foot placement (panel b) variance at beginning of stance predicted by the center of mass (CoM) state or swing foot state during the previous one step (flight and stance). To produce this figure, a sequence of linear models were built for predicting the foot placement based on the center of mass state or swing foot state during different phases through the previous step. We plot the <italic>R</italic>2 value corresponding to these linear models (that is, fraction of variance explained) as a function of the gait phase used for the prediction; the gait phase is represented as the fraction of a step starting from beginning of previous stance phase. The solid and dashed lines represent right and left foot placements respectively.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Figure 6: The force-velocity and force-length relations shown and implemented in the authors' model may be overly simple. F-V is an inverse hyperbolic not linear relationship and the lengthening side of F-V is much more skewed than the authors' model. (Also consider Zajac, 1989). How would a more realistic F-V relationship (inverse hyperbolic for shortening and a more steep and rapid leveling off of force in relation to lengthening) affect the authors' model?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these remarks. We have now added the following sentences so as to comment on this model simplification:</p><p>“Further, we've made simplifying assumptions about muscle architecture, muscle properties (linear force-velocity relations), and muscle activation, which are meant to capture the primary qualitative dynamical features of muscles, rather than model them quantitatively precisely. For instance, the linear force-velocity relation may be sufficient to produce damping-like muscle behavior when activated, but this damping behavior may be accentuated by a nonlinear forcevelocity relation. Future work will also involve obtaining controllers for more complex biped models and muscle models.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
