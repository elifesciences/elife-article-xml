In this study, we designed a side-view observation petri dish/device that reflects light, enabling in situ observation of the 3D morphology of cell spheroids using conventional inverted laboratory microscopes. We used a 3D-printed handle and frame to support a first-surface mirror, positioning the device within a cell culture petri dish to image cell spheroid samples. The imaging conditions, such as the distance between the mirror and the 3D spheroids, the light source, and the impact of the culture medium, were systematically studied to validate the in situ side-view observation. The results proved that placing the surface mirror adjacent to the spheroids enables non-destructive in situ real-time tracking of tumor spheroid formation, migration, and fusion dynamics. The correlation between spheroid thickness and dark core appearance under light microscopy and the therapeutic effects of chemotherapy doxorubicin and natural killer cells on spheroids’ 3D structure was investigated.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>3D spheroids</kwd><kwd>side-view</kwd><kwd>DU 145</kwd><kwd>NK-92</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32171401</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Ling</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005230</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing Municipality</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CSTB2022NSCQ-MSX0808</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Ling</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A piece of first-surface mirror for side-view observation enables non-destructive in situ monitoring of structural changes of 3D tumor spheroids during the formation, migration, and fusion process.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Three-dimensional (3D) tumor spheroids have emerged as a powerful tool for studying tumor biology and drug response. These multicellular aggregates better recapitulate solid tumors’ complex microenvironment and heterogeneity than traditional 2D cell culture models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Thoma et al., 2014</xref>). 3D tumor spheroids exhibit gradients in oxygen, nutrients, and metabolites that mimic the pathophysiology of native tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Derda et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huh et al., 2011</xref>), making them valuable for investigating tumor growth, invasion, and response to therapies.</p><p>Visually, spheroids appear as translucent balls with a well-defined boundary and darker core when imaged by brightfield or phase contrast microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amaral et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pan et al., 2023b</xref>). Spheroid growth is characterized by an initial exponential phase followed by a plateau once the spheroid exceeds a critical diameter (typically around 500 μm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amaral et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kim et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Klowss et al., 2022</xref>). Thickness measurements can detect this transition and provide a more sensitive readout of growth arrest than the length in the <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Browning et al., 2021</xref>). Characterizing the morphology and volume of 3D tumor spheroids is essential for understanding their growth kinetics and evaluating treatment effects. Directly measuring width/diameter and thickness enables more precise volume calculations that could compensate for spheroids’ non-uniform shape and size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Napolitano et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>However, light microscopy itself has limitations in quantifying the complex 3D structure of spheroids, especially the width and thickness of the spheroids simultaneously. The translucent nature of spheroids leads to blurred images that can cause overestimation of size and volume based on 2D measurements alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Costa et al., 2019</xref>). Confocal imaging enables optical sectioning of spheroids to generate 3D reconstructions, and fluorescent labeling of cells allows direct measurement of thickness and diameter from cross-sectional views (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Raza et al., 2020</xref>). However, light scattering and absorption limit imaging depth, making it challenging to resolve the core of larger spheroids (&gt;300 μm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pan et al., 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Steinberg et al., 2020</xref>). Optical coherence tomography is a non-invasive imaging technique that uses low-coherence light to create cross-sectional images of tissue structure, allowing measurement of thickness and diameter even in larger spheroids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">El-Sadek et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">El-Sadek et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abd El-Sadek et al., 2020</xref>). Light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) is another emerging technique that illuminates samples with a thin sheet of light, enabling rapid 3D imaging of entire spheroids and measuring thickness and diameter from 3D reconstructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eismann et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Paiè et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shi et al., 2024</xref>). However, LSFM requires specialized equipment and may be limited by light scattering in dense spheroid cores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andilla et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Costa et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Another challenge in the field is the lack of standardized protocols for measuring spheroid thickness and width across different imaging modalities and analysis software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Froehlich et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Koudan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Moraes et al., 2020</xref>). Balancing spheroid thickness analysis while further observing changes in the sample’s 3D structure is extremely challenging. Due to limited perspectives, current research tends to simplify the relatively regular morphology of spheroids into models that are centrally symmetrical or axis-symmetrical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Senavirathna et al., 2013</xref>). However, in addition to regular cell spheroid morphology, cell spheroids can undergo irregular changes. This inconsistency makes it difficult to compare results across studies and reproduce findings. Establishing guidelines for image acquisition, processing, and reporting is critical for advancing the field.</p><p>In this work, using conventional brightfield microscopy, we propose a side-view observation device to systematically study the correlation between bottom- and side-view of 3D tumor spheroids. We designate the bottom-view, visible through inverted microscope imaging, as the underside of the spheroid sample (<italic>x-y</italic> plane), where measurements such as width and diameter can be obtained. Images captured through the side-view observation device represent the side-view of the sample (<italic>x-z</italic> plane), from which measurements such as width, height/thickness, and contact angle with the <italic>x-y</italic> plane can be derived. First, the 3D spheroid side-view observation device was fabricated by assembling a cell petri dish, an agarose-micro-well array, and an optical module for observing. The device was applied to track the dynamics of 3D cell spheroid formation and cell migration from the spheroid. In addition, the two spheroids’ fusion process and corresponding morphological changes at the bottom- and side-view were characterized to investigate the fusion dynamics. With the side-view observation, the correlation between the thickness of the spheroid and the dark core appearance under the light microscope examination was studied. Last, the killing effect of chemotherapy compound doxorubicin (DOX) and immune cell natural killer (NK) cells on the 3D structure of the spheroids were studied based on the side-view observation device.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Validation of side-view observation achieved by placing a first-surface mirror adjacent to the 3D spheroids</title><p>The 3D spheroids were cultivated in agarose micro-wells within a standard petri dish.

The principle of non-destructive in situ observing the samples from both bottom- and side-view is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>. For bottom-view, the standard microscope setup sufficed. For side-view, light from the source, either reflected by the sample or transmitted through it, was redirected into the microscope’s objective by the first-surface mirror. This placement enabled capturing side profiles (supplementary information <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> shows the experiment setting of observing the bottom- and side-view of the samples.

Firstly, we tested image quality using a 0.3 mm round-type microscope calibration slide (ChenZheng Precision Tools, Suzhou, China). For bottom-view imaging, the sample was placed directly on the stage. For side-view imaging, it was cut and attached vertically to polyethylene foam double-sided tape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Images captured with 4×, 10×, and 20× objective lenses showed no significant quality difference between bottom- and side-view observation. However, it was noted that the 40× objective lens’ field has limitations in imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G, H</xref>).</p><p>To study the impact of the distance between the sample and the mirror on image acquisition, a 0.03 mm line-type microscope calibration slide was fixed vertically to a base at a 90° angle to the horizontal plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), and another microscope calibration slide to the bottom surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref> shows images captured between the mirror and the sample at 2, 3, and 4 mm distances. Side-view images remained similar across these distances. However, at 4 mm, the 40× objective could not focus due to exceeding its working distance (3.6–2.8 mm). The results demonstrated that as the sample was within the working distance of the objective lens, there was no significant change in the apparent size of the sample observing with 4×, 10×, 20×, or 40× objective lenses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>).</p><p>For capturing spheroid images, the first-surface mirror was placed in a cell culture medium to maintain growth conditions. Typically, introducing different media into the light path causes refraction and potential chromatic aberration. For instance, light passing through the DMEM medium undergoes such refraction. To evaluate the impact of chromatic aberration on imaging resolution, we analyzed the offset values of the C-line (656.3 nm) and F-line (486.1 nm) using chromatic aberration analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>).

To support cell spheroid growth, we used micro-wells formed from 2 wt% agarose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pan et al., 2023a</xref>). Absorption spectra of 1 wt% agarose, 2 wt% agarose, and DMEM culture medium (each 1 cm thick), were measured using a fiber optic spectrometer (PG2000-Pro-EX, Fuxiang Optics Co, Ltd, Shanghai, China), with ddH<sub>2</sub>O as the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). It was observed that both 1 and 2 wt% agaroses partially absorb light in the 400–600 nm range, while DMEM medium, containing phenol red as an indicator, had absorption peak at 420 and 550 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhikhoreva et al., 2018</xref>). The spectra of the aforementioned samples under the CEL-TCX250 (Xenon lamp light source) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>. The DMEM medium and agarose primarily absorbed light in the 400–600 nm range, with less absorption from 600 to 800 nm, causing the spheroids’ images to appear magenta. During imaging, we used automatic white balance correction to minimize the impact of color on the cell images. Since this study focused mainly on the morphology of the spheroids rather than their color information, the introduction of the culture medium and agarose did not have a significant negative impact on the experimental results.</p><p>To optimize conditions for side-view imaging, we chose a xenon lamp for its broad wavelength coverage and adjustable angle. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> shows that a 90° angle between the lamp and first-surface mirror produced the best details of the side-view images, while angles of 45° and 0° resulted in uneven and poorly lit images. Maintaining the 90° angle, we examined the effect of varying distances between the light source and sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). At 5 cm, internal structures (dark core) were clear, but uneven background illumination complicated edge distinction. At 10 cm, background uniformity improved, though overall illumination remained irregular, and the dark core was not resolved. At 15 cm, the sample background contrast was optimal, with clearly defined edges and discernible internal details, including the dark core. By adjusting the position of the sample stage, it became straightforward to locate and observe the side-view of spheroids within agarose micro-wells (supplementary information <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Videos 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">3</xref>).

This light source should be positioned approximately 15 cm directly behind the sample, forming a 90° angle with the mirror. Samples should be kept as close to the mirror as possible, with the distance between the sample and the mirror kept within the working distance of the objective lens. Considering the diameter of 3D spheroids ranges from 200 to 500 μm, side-view images were captured using 4× or 10× objective lenses in subsequent studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Tracking the growth dynamics of spheroids from side-view observation</title><p>Tracking the growth images of cell spheroids enables further determination of their volume or size, which is significant for sample screening.

This study tracked the spheroid formation process in the agarose micro-well from a seeding density of 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells per well using the inverted microscope. Time-lapse images of the bottom- and side-view of the cells within the agarose micro-well, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, record the morphological changes of the cells during spheroid formation. Initially, the newly added human prostate cancer cells DU 145 scattered in the micro-well. After 3 hr of incubation, the cells clustered to form a ring structure. From the side-view, the thickness changes of the cell cluster were negligible, suggesting that the cells tend to aggregate at a similar planar. As the cells continued to aggregate, the cluster gradually became more compact and formed a round shape after 60 hr of incubation. However, the side profile of the same spheroid shows that the thin layer of the cell disk gradually packed, and as the <italic>x</italic>–<italic>y</italic> dimension decreased, the height/thickness of the cell aggregate increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

Through those time-lapse images/video, the width and height/thickness of the spheroid can be measured. As suggested in previous studies, when the height/thickness and width ratio of the cell aggregate approaches 1, it indicates that the spheroid structures have formed. In previous studies, spheroids had to be sealed or fixed in an agar block before the side-view morphology could be observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pan et al., 2023a</xref>).

Biologically, the dark core is believed to represent necrotic or quiescent zones arising from limited diffusion of oxygen and nutrients within the spheroid. In addition, it is important to notice that, optically, the depth of light penetration in microscopy can be hindered by the spheroid’s thickness, leading to decreased signal intensity and diminished image quality from deeper regions. This effect is further amplified in larger spheroids by the increased number of cellular layers and a dense extracellular matrix, which scatter light and obscure core details. The side-view function of the proposed device allows tracing the formation of the visually distinguishable dark core to investigate the relationship between the dark core, spheroid size, and the optical limitations of light microscopy using DU 145 cell spheroids with different initial seeding densities (2.5 × 10<sup>3</sup>, 5 × 10<sup>3</sup>, 1 × 10<sup>4</sup>, and 2 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well). The appearance of the dark core and its correlation with spheroid thickness were analyzed using the bottom- and side-view of the spheroids.</p><p>As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> shows, it was found that the time to dark core formation was inversely related to the initial seeding density. For example, spheroids initiated with 2.5 × 10<sup>3</sup> cells exhibited a dark core between 48 and 60 hr, achieving an average <italic>z</italic>-direction growth rate of 4.18 μm/hr. These spheroids reached a nearly spherical shape with an average height of 250.67 μm and a maximal height-to-width ratio of 0.99 by 60 hr. With an increase in seeding density to 5.0 × 10<sup>3</sup> cells, the dark core appeared earlier (38–43 hr), and the spheroids achieved a height-to-width ratio of 0.82 by 43 hr and approached a spherical shape by 60 hr, with a width between 270 and 290 μm. At a seeding density of 1.0 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells, the dark core developed between 28 and 33 hr, with a <italic>z</italic>-direction growth rate of 7.35 μm/hr. The spheroids presented a height-to-width ratio of 0.54 at 33 hr, evolving into a flattened spherical shape by 60 hr because the side-view images indicate an elongated, bean-shaped profile. The highest seeding density of 2.0 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells resulted in the earliest dark core formation (20–28 hr), with a <italic>z</italic>-direction growth rate of 9.43 μm/hr. These spheroids displayed the most pronounced elongation, with a height-to-width ratio of 0.49 at 28 hr, further flattening by 60 hr. We analyzed the relationship between dark cores’ appearance and width using conventional bottom-view images of spheroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). It is evident that with fewer seeding densities, the width of the spheroids gradually decreases over time, while the appearance of the dark core occurs later. The purple square highlight indicates the time points when the dark core appeared. Based on the trend observed in the images, we can predict that at lower seeding densities, the time for the appearance of dark cores in the spheroids will be longer, and vice versa. However, irrespective of the seeding densities, the <italic>z</italic>-direction height of the spheroids at the onset of dark core formation remained relatively consistent, approximately 250 ± 15 μm (the yellow-colored zone in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), suggesting that there is a correlation between the formation of dark cores in spheroids and the <italic>z</italic>-direction height of the spheroids.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The dynamics of dark zone formation within the three-dimensional (3D) spheroid.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Time-lapse bottom- and side-view images of DU 145 spheroids formed from different initial cell concentrations (2.5 × 10<sup>3</sup>, 5 × 10<sup>3</sup>, 1 × 10<sup>4</sup>, and 2 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well).

Fusion is a crucial step for tissue development. In tissue engineering, 3D spheroids fusion is vital in fabricating micro-tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lindberg et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Laschke and Menger, 2017</xref>). However, the fusion process of spheroids exhibits a highly random situation, making it challenging to maintain the fusion state while observing it in situ to reconstruct the structural changes during spheroid fusion. Herein, the side-view device was applied to conduct in situ observations of the fusion process of cell spheroids. Spheroids of 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> DU 145 cells per well were cultured for 7 days in agarose micro-wells for fusion assay. As the bottom-view images shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–i</xref>, the two spheroids contact each other and gradually merge at the contact region. The contact angle, contact length, and doublet length value can all be retrieved from time-lapse images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). First, the contact angle between spheroids increased from 30° to 45°. Next, the two spheroids’ contact length (neck) increased with co-culture time, with the most significant change occurring within the first 3 hr. The doublet length of the fusion formed by two spheroids decreased by 22.5% from 453.87 to 367.19 μm after 48 hr of fusion. Though the bottom-view depicts the <italic>x</italic>–<italic>y</italic> dimension changes of the spheroids during the fusion process, predicting the phenome occurring on the side profile of the spheroid is challenging, especially for those cell aggregates without ideal spherical structures (the red arrow denoted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–ii</xref>). With the assistance of the side-view device, it was found that the two spheroids contacted and formed symmetric necks that gradually fused (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–i</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, the contact length between two spheroids progressively approaches the <italic>z</italic>-direction thickness, and the contact angle between the two spheroids reached 171.10 ± 13.94° after 100 hr of fusion.

The vertical lines in the figure indicate the position where the arc representing the contact angle at the fusion site of the cell spheroids tangentially intersects both spheroids. A wider width between the two vertical lines indicates a higher fusion process between the two spheroids. Additionally, we observed an intriguing phenomenon: if the initial cell spheroid morphology is not entirely regular or spherical (the red arrow denoted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–ii</xref>), the side-view profiles enable to track the changes in the particular region except the fusion region.

After 16 hr of co-culture, unlike the distinct boundary between dark core and translucent zone, referring to necrotic and proliferating regions of the spheroid, observed before co-culture, four optically different regions could be distinguished from both bottom- and side-view, suggesting that NK-92 cells infiltrated the DU 145 spheroids from all directions. At this time point, the overall height and width of the spheroid were 314.47 ± 13.85 and 341.20 ± 5.81 μm, respectively. Thus, the height-to-width ratio was close to 1, suggesting a spherical structure. After 28 hr of co-culture, only three optically different regions could be distinguished, and the distinction between the inner two regions became less obvious than at 16 hr.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, side-view observation provides detailed insights into the spheroid formation, including the 3D structure of the spheroid and its height at a given time point.

In situ tracking and imaging from a side-view perspective can facilitate modeling to reconstruct the real shape of the spheroid accurately and enable researchers to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the 3D structure and growth kinetics of spheroids without disrupting their natural development.</p><p>This device offers a unique opportunity to study the 3D aspects of cell migration from tumor spheroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The side-view images allow us to analyze the interaction between the spheroids and substrate by measuring the contact angle. Moreover, the changes in the dimensions and area of the dark core were less intense than the overall changes of the spheroid, suggesting that the proliferating cells at the outer region of the spheroid were the main participants in the migration process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the side-profile changes of the spheroid during a migration assay have been depicted. By monitoring both bottom and side changes, researchers can gain valuable insights into the spatial distribution of migrating cells and the dynamics of the migration process to elucidate the mechanisms underlying tumor cell invasion and metastasis, potentially leading to the development of new therapeutic strategies targeting these processes.</p><p>The observation of the dark core in the spheroid highlights the presence of a necrotic or quiescent region, which is a common feature of larger tumor spheroids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Browning et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lindberg et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Laschke and Menger, 2017</xref>). As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, we observed that spheroids formed at different cell seeding densities, regardless of whether they approached a height-to-width ratio close to 1, began to develop a dark core at an overall height of approximately 250 ± 15 μm. This consistency suggests that the timeframe for dark core formation is primarily determined by the increasing <italic>z</italic>-direction height, with a critical threshold of approximately 250 μm may indicate the limit of effective oxygen diffusion, beyond which cellular functionality becomes compromised. The observation aligns with previous findings that suggest a maximum viable spheroid diameter of 500 μm, beyond which central necrosis becomes inevitable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pan et al., 2023a</xref>). This clear observation was not achievable using only bottom-view images, emphasizing the importance of real-time monitoring and 3D structural analysis of spheroids through side-view observation. For the spheroids’ fusion process, conventional observation using only bottom-view imaging might miss the critical structural changes on the other side of the fusion process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). However, with the side-view observation device, we could assist in the observation of 3D structural changes from the side, thus in situ monitoring of irregularly shaped spheroids, tissues, and organoids from multiple angles become possible.</p><p>Finally, we compared the cytotoxic effects of two different approaches, DOX and NK-92 cells, on spheroids using the side-view observation device. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> shows the distinct outcomes of DOX treatment versus NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity: DOX treatment does not significantly alter the 3D morphology of the spheroids, whereas NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity notably affects the overall height-to-width ratio of the spheroids. DOX exerts its effects by disrupting DNA and RNA synthesis, inducing ROS-related apoptosis, and triggering cellular senescence, among other mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agudelo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kong et al., 2022</xref>). These actions lead to morphological changes such as nuclear condensation, fragmentation, and cell shrinkage. The observed morphological features from both the bottom- and side-view suggest that DOX may induce a form of cell death in tumor spheroids without disrupting their overall 3D structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). On the other hand, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C, D</xref>, NK-92 cells gathered around the tumor spheroids and gradually infiltrated into the spheroids, leading to the expansion of the overall size of spheroids. Moreover, the co-culture of NK cells and tumor spheroids resulted in significant structural changes, as the height-to-width ratio decreased from 0.98 to 0.61 after 100 hr of co-culture. Considering that NK-92 cells exert cytotoxicity by forming pores in the target cell membrane, leading to membrane disruption and cell lysis, the side-view profile indeed captured the gradually demolished spheroid’s 3D structure. Relying solely on bottom-view observations of co-cultured spheroids may not adequately predict side-profile changes or the overall 3D structure, potentially resulting in volume prediction inaccuracies. Therefore, by accurately observing the responses of spheroids to different cytotoxic agents, researchers can design more precise drug induction protocols and develop more effective strategies for tumor eradication.</p><p>The proposed device is compatible with inverted microscopes, allowing for in situ bottom- and side-view observation of 3D cell spheroids, a capability not previously reported. Compared to existing side-view microfluidic devices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2020</xref>), our device offers lower production costs and is easier to manufacture. Additionally, the device features magnetic connections for easy positioning adjustment to observe multiple samples (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>) and convenient disassembly for reuse and sterilization purposes. To further improve the capability of the side-view device to analyze the sophisticated detail of 3D spheroids, such as the visually optical distinct layers in NK-tumor spheroids co-culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), we are considering two avenues for optimization: improving the image capture process and enhancing image quality. One approach involves adding lenses in front of the first-surface mirror. At the same time, the other entails designing complementary light sources to reduce light scattering within the spheroids during imaging. Once the image capture process is further enhanced, we can leverage machine learning to analyze the side-view morphology of the spheroids and organoids to predict their future growth patterns, potentially saving considerable screening time in preclinical drug testing.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec

Whether this size is the limitation by the device? And which is the best size by the device? The size of spheroids suitable for this device should be characterized.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your question. As shown in Fig. 1D, the imaging principle indicates that the sample size is theoretically not affected by the device. For larger biological samples or samples exceeding the size of a 35 mm petri dish, a larger container and first surface mirror can be used. However, in practice, it is not recommended to use this device with laboratory microscopes for samples exceeding 4 mm in size.</p><p>Firstly, the working distance of the microscope objective lens is limited by its factory specifications. Secondly, this device is designed to fit a 35 mm petri dish, and the first surface mirror can capture a maximum sample size of 4.5 mm. Fortunately, this size is more than sufficient for cell spheroids.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure 2F. The scale bar covered the imaging and made it unclear. It was difficult to read and evaluate the quality of the images. And it seemed no obvious difference between 5 cm and 15 cm. Please carefully check this data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your question. First, we checked the image scale and coverage issues and made adjustments in the revised version. Secondly, when the light source was placed 5 cm from the sample, the sample itself appeared relatively clear, but the boundary with the background was less distinct. At a distance of 15 cm, the light source not only illuminated the sample effectively but also made the distinction between the spheroid and the background more apparent. To ensure consistency and stability in image capture, we ultimately selected a 15 cm distance between the sample and the light source for imaging.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Figure 3A. It seemed that the seeding cells were initially located as a ring with a hole in the center. Why do not seed the cells evenly in the well?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your question. First, the cells were added as a suspension, naturally settling at the bottom of the well during imaging. When seeded in agarose wells, the cells spontaneously aggregated over time, as shown in sVideo4. Our previous study showed that the use of agarose wells offers high fault tolerance and efficiency in cell spheroid culture (Pan, R. et al. Biofabrication, 2024, 16, 035016).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) I just wonder whether this design could be extended to the fluorescent imaging and how do it.

As shown in Author response image 1A, due to the specific nature of fluorescence imaging light sources, it is feasible to perform fluorescence imaging of cell spheroids using a microscope, including the built-in light source. Using 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining, we captured fluorescence images of cell spheroids in both bottom-view and side-view modes (Author response image 1B), demonstrating that side-view observation of cell spheroids with this device is indeed feasible.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>The device was used on an inverted microscope to capture fluorescence images.</title><p>(A) Schematic of the imaging setup.
