The cytosolic C-terminal domain of the AMPAR GluA1 subunit is specifically associated with 4.1 N and SAP97. We analyze how interactions between GluA1 and 4.1N or SAP97 regulate IT and exocytosis in basal conditions and after cLTP induction. The down-regulation of 4.1N or SAP97 decreases GluA1 IT properties and export to the PM. The total deletion of its C-terminal fully suppresses its IT. Our results demonstrate that during basal transmission, the binding of 4.1N to GluA1 allows their exocytosis whereas the interaction with SAP97 is essential for GluA1 IT. During cLTP, the interaction of 4.1N with GluA1 allows its IT and exocytosis. Our results identify the differential roles of 4.1N and SAP97 in the control of various phases of GluA1 IT.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>AMPAR</kwd><kwd>Intracellular transport</kwd><kwd>LTP</kwd><kwd>SAP97</kwd><kwd>4.1N</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>787340</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Choquet</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004562</institution-id><institution>Ministère de l'Education Nationale, de l'Enseignement Superieur et de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Coussen</surname><given-names>Françoise</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Biochemistry, videomicroscopy, and immunocytochemistry reveal differential roles of GluA1/4.1N and GluA1/SAP97 interactions on GluA1 intracellular transport and exocytosis in basal transmission and during cLTP in cultured hippocampal neurons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPAR) are ionotropic tetrameric receptors activated by glutamate, the main excitatory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system. Their synaptic targeting, clustering, and immobilization in the post-synaptic density in front of glutamate release sites are crucial for efficient excitatory synaptic transmission. The number of neurotransmitter receptors, and particularly AMPAR, present at the synapse is regulated by a complex set of interdependent mechanisms going from biogenesis, IT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Díaz-Alonso and Nicoll, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hiester et al., 2018</xref>), externalization at the PM, lateral diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Choquet and Triller, 2013</xref>), stabilization at synapses and trafficking in and out synaptic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Groc and Choquet, 2020</xref>). In highly polarized and spatially extended neurons, IT is of fundamental importance to distribute cargo over hundreds of micrometers and is likely finely tuned and balanced to control receptor distribution. Accordingly, the IT of neosynthesized AMPAR plays a crucial role to transport them down the dendrites from the Golgi apparatus or Golgi outposts where they are matured after synthesis in the ER. After being released from the Golgi, the secretory vesicles containing the newly-synthesized AMPAR are trafficked to the PM through interaction with adaptor proteins and molecular motors to be finally exocytosed at the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schwenk et al., 2019</xref>). We and others provided evidence that AMPAR IT is highly modulated by neuronal activity and this suggests that regulation of IT might be a core constituent of the control of synaptic strength during various forms of synaptic plasticity in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hangen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hoerndli et al., 2015</xref>). However, despite its potential key role in synaptic regulation, and probable involvement in synaptopathies such as Huntington or Alzheimer diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mandal et al., 2011</xref>), the molecular mechanisms that are involved in the regulation of AMPAR IT nevertheless remain largely unknown.</p><p>AMPAR IT is difficult to study in vertebrates due to the lack of reliable labeling methods and current limitations of imaging systems for detecting fast-moving, low-contrast small vesicles. In cultured rat hippocampal neurons, we have overcome these two hurdles using (1) a molecular tool allowing the retention and on-demand release of the newly synthesized AMPAR from the ER/Golgi and (2) the photobleaching of a portion of a dendrite followed by fast video acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hangen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rivera et al., 2000</xref>). This allowed the characterization of IT of GluA1 AMPAR subunit, which forms homomeric calcium-permeable receptors, and can be inserted at synapses during synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Plant et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sanderson et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>We found that during chemically induced Long Term Potentiation of synaptic transmission (cLTP), the number and velocities of GluA1-containing vesicles are increased compared to the basal state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hangen et al., 2018</xref>). These changes in vesicle velocities may be due to the diversity of molecular motors associated with AMPAR, although the exact motors involved are unknown. Molecular motors associate with their cargo through intermediate components, such as adaptors, scaffolds, and transmembrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Klopfenstein et al., 2000</xref>). AMPAR is part of a macromolecular complex composed of the receptor per se surrounded by a set of associated auxiliary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bissen et al., 2019</xref>) and cytosolic proteins. Some of these intracellular partners have been shown to be associated with motor proteins and can modulate AMPAR surface expression.</p><p>Of particular interest in this regard, 4.1 N and SAP97 intracellular proteins are directly and specifically associated with GluA1 C-terminal (C-ter.) domain, the most variable domain between the different AMPAR subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Diering and Huganir, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sans et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shen et al., 2000</xref>). The C-ter. domain of GluA1 is particularly interesting for the regulation of IT as mutations on this domain modulate its transport and could be responsible for its upregulation during cLTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hangen et al., 2018</xref>). However, in the recent years, the C-ter. domain has been under intense scrutiny and its role in mediating synaptic plasticity has been debated. On the one hand, the C-ter. domain of native GluA1 and GluA2 has been suggested to be necessary and sufficient to drive NMDA receptor-dependent LTP and LTD, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>). On the other hand, the expression of heteromeric receptors containing the GluA1 subunit lacks the C-ter. domain maintains a normal basal trafficking and LTP at CA1 synapses in acute hippocampal slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Díaz-Alonso et al., 2020</xref>). The method we developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hangen et al., 2018</xref>) and the results reported here will fuel this debate and allow to determine the exact contribution of GluA1 C-ter. domain for the regulation of IT properties of newly synthesized GluA1 subunit.</p><p>In red blood cells, the protein 4.1 (4.1R) is critical for the organization and maintenance of the spectrin–actin cytoskeleton and for the attachment of the cytoskeleton to the cell membrane. 4.1 N, the neuronal form of 4.1, may function to confer stability and plasticity to the neuronal membrane via interactions with multiple binding partners such as spectrin-actin–based cytoskeleton, integral membrane channels, and receptors. In neurons, 4.1 N associates specifically with GluA1 and colocalizes with AMPAR at excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Walensky et al., 1999</xref>). The C-ter. domain of 4.1 N mediates the interaction with the membrane-proximal region of GluA1. It has been suggested that 4.1 N regulates AMPAR trafficking by providing a critical link between the actin cytoskeleton and AMPAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shen et al., 2000</xref>). Phosphorylation of S<sub>816</sub> and S<sub>818</sub> residues in GluA1 regulates activity-dependent GluA1 insertion at the PM by enhancing the interaction between 4.1 N and GluA1. This suggests that 4.1 N is important for the expression of LTP, but doesn’t affect basal synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lin et al., 2009</xref>). However, while the regulation of GluA1 exocytosis by binding to 4.1 N has been established, its potential involvement in AMPAR IT still remains unknown.</p><p>SAP97, another important GluA1 C-ter. domain interactor is a member of the MAGUK family of proteins that play a major role in the trafficking and targeting of membrane ion channels and cytosolic structural proteins in multiple cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fourie et al., 2014</xref>). Within neurons, SAP97 is localized throughout the secretory trafficking pathway and at the postsynaptic density (PSD). The role of SAP97 in the control of synaptic function is still unclear despite the fact that the PDZ2 domain of SAP97 interacts directly with the last four amino acids of GluA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cai et al., 2002</xref>). The interaction between SAP97 and GluA1 occurs early in the secretory pathway, while the receptors are in the ER or cis-Golgi, and participates in its forward trafficking from the Golgi to the PM, suggesting that SAP97 acts on GluA1 solely before its synaptic insertion and that it does not play a major role in anchoring AMPAR at synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sans et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fourie et al., 2014</xref>). SAP97 is a protein known for its involvement in NMDAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jeyifous et al., 2009</xref>) and AMPAR IT, thanks to its role as an adaptor protein between GluA1 and the actin-based motor MyoVI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wu et al., 2002</xref>). However, the role of SAP97 in the trafficking and synaptic localization of AMPAR is still debated with conflicting results have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fourie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kay et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, its role in the induction and maintenance of LTP is yet not well characterized.</p><p>Here, we have a unique experimental pipeline that allows us to differentiate IT from exocytosis of a given protein by measuring them independently. We report the role of the interactions between 4.1 N and SAP97 with the C-ter. domain of GluA1 by analyzing IT and exocytosis of newly synthesized GluA1 deleted for this domain under basal conditions and during synaptic activity. We identify different roles of the interactions between 4.1N-GluA1 and SAP97-GluA1 during basal transmission and after induction of cLTP in hippocampal cultured neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To study the properties of AMPAR IT, we used cDNA constructs to express GluA1 and its different mutants subcloned in the ARIAD system and tagged at its N-terminus (ARIAD-Tag-GluA1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hangen et al., 2018</xref>). With this technology, receptors are retained in the ER in the basal state thanks to a conditional aggregation domain. Receptor release from the ER and follow-up secretion is tightly controlled with a cell-permeant drug (D/D solubilizer or ARIAD ligand: AL) that disrupts aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rivera et al., 2000</xref>). The synchronized release of receptors triggered by the addition of AL allows expressed proteins to progress through the secretory pathway in a synchronous manner, particularly adapted to monitor IT. Important features of this system include (1) no or low basal secretion and (2) a rapid and high level of secretion in response to the addition of AL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hangen et al., 2018</xref>). This allowed us to measure three main parameters of AMPAR intracellular trafficking. First, the total number of GluA1-containing vesicles after the synchronized release of receptors was used as a measure of ER/Golgi export efficiency. Second, GluA1 vesicle transport properties (speed, fraction of time spent moving or pausing) were measured. Third, we determined the kinetic and extent of GluA1 appearance on the cell surface by live immunolabeling at various times after release. The comparative measurement of these different parameters allowed us to decipher finely the regulatory steps of GluA1 intracellular transport.</p><p>4.1 N and SAP97 are important proteins implicated in the regulation of AMPAR PM localization. Among all AMPAR subunits, these two proteins are specifically associated with the GluA1 C-ter. domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rouach et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schwenk et al., 2014</xref>), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We analyzed how interactions between these associated proteins and GluA1 regulate AMPAR IT in basal conditions and after induction of cLTP in cultured rat hippocampal neurons.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>GluA1 intracellular transport and exocytosis are dependent on the expression of 4.1N or SAP97</title><p>4.1 N and SAP97 participate in the biosynthesis and processing of AMPAR in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sans et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shen et al., 2000</xref>). Previous studies established that knocking down 4.1 N by expression of a specific sh-RNA substantially reduced the frequency of GluA1 exocytosis, indicating that 4.1 N is critical for GluA1 insertion at the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lin et al., 2009</xref>). On the other hand, SAP97 has been shown to associate with GluA1 containing AMPAR while they are in the ER, with SAP97 dissociating from the receptor at the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sans et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>We decided to knock down each of these two proteins independently and analyze IT and externalization of newly synthesized GluA1 in basal condition. We expressed sh-RNAs against 4.1 N or SAP97 or their corresponding control (scramble) and analyzed the trafficking of ARIAD-Tag-GluA1 after the addition of the ligand to release the protein from the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Intracellular transport and exocytosis of GluA1 are dependent on the expression of 4.1N and SAP97.</title><p>(<bold> A</bold>) Top: Western blots of 4.1N and SAP97 expression in cultured rat hippocampal neurons after virus infection with scramble-RNA (scr.) or sh-RNA against 4.1N and SAP97; bottom: quantification of proteins normalized with actin on the scr. condition (sh-4.1N: 44.4 +/−11.2%,n=5, sh-SAP97: 58.3 +/−7.3%, n=4).

To test the specificity of the sh-RNA, we expressed 4.1 N or SAP97 or the corresponding rescue proteins in COS-7 cells together with the scr.-RNA or the sh-RNA and quantified expression of 4.1 N and SAP97 by western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

We expressed GluA1 subcloned in the ARIAD vector, induced the transport of the protein by the addition of the AL, and analyzed the transport 30–60 min after the addition of the AL. During this time window, the vesicles are traveling in dendrites with almost no background signal coming from the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hangen et al., 2018</xref>).

We found similar values for speed for the OUT (from the cell body to the dendrite) and for the IN (from the dendrite to the cell body) directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We thus decided to pool the speeds of transport of the OUT and the IN directions. The mean speed of the vesicles was only decreased by 13% by expression of the sh-4.1N compared to its scr.-RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). When sh-SAP97 was expressed, the mean speed was decreased by 25% compared to the corresponding scr.-RNA. Thanks to the kymographs, we calculated the percentage of time spent in the moving and in the pausing states for each vesicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>). The time spent moving was decreased by 8% when the sh-4.1N was expressed to the benefit of the pausing time. Indeed, when the expression of SAP97 was decreased, the time spent moving by a vesicle was decreased by 20% to the benefit of the time spent in pause.</p><p>We then analyzed the kinetics of externalization of GluA1 in the same conditions as for the IT experiments. We performed live extracellular labeling of GluA1 at 45 and 60 min after the addition of the AL on hippocampal rat cultured neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–I</xref>). Expression of sh-4.1N decreased massively the externalization of GluA1 compared to its externalization with the expression of the corresponding scr.

Expression of sh-SAP97 also decreased the rate of externalization of GluA1 to the same extent as sh-4.1N did (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Expression of SAP97 rescue protein partially restored the externalization of GluA1.</p><p>In conclusion, reducing the expression of 4.1 N and SAP97 both diminished GluA1 IT in rat-cultured hippocampal neurons. However, the effects were all less drastic when 4.1 N expression was decreased than when SAP97 was. This was the case for the decrease in the number of vesicles released upon the addition of AL, for the decrease in the vesicle speed, and for the increase in pausing time. However, we found that the externalization of GluA1 at the PM was equally inhibited by the absence of 4.1 N or SAP97. Because the down-regulation of 4.1 N or SAP97 could have indirect effects on GluA1 transport properties, we then studied the impact of GluA1 mutations that inhibit its interaction with these proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>AMPAR traffic is regulated by the interaction between GluA1 C-ter. domain and 4.1N or SAP97</title><p>GluA1 IT and PM localization is dependent on the expression of 4.1 N and SAP97.

However, the overall impact of SAP97 is more drastic on IT whereas we found the same effect for both conditions on the PM localization of GluA1.

Indeed, we found that immunoprecipitation of 4.1 N or SAP97 co-immunoprecipitated GluA1 and immunoprecipitation of GluA1 co-immunoprecipitated 4.1 N and SAP97. It has been shown that GluA1 binds SAP97 by its last four amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Leonard et al., 1998</xref>) whereas it binds 4.1 N on a peptide domain localized just after its fourth transmembrane domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shen et al., 2000</xref>). We designed different GluA1 mutants in order to study the impact of these interactions on GluA1 IT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We deleted the entire C-ter. domain of GluA1 (deletion of the last 78 amino acids of GluA1 leaving only four amino acids after the last transmembrane domain, Δ78) or each of the interaction sites for 4.1 N (Δ4.1N: deletion of 14 amino acids and five amino acids after the last transmembrane domain) and for SAP97 (Δ7: deletion of the last seven amino acids of GluA1). For each mutant, we studied their PM localization as a function of the time of incubation with the AL and the characteristic of their IT.</p><p>The externalization of newly synthesized GFP-GluA1-Δ78 or GFP-GluA1-WT was monitored by live immunolabeling with an antibody directed against GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). Quantification of the GFP staining revealed an almost complete disappearance of GluA1-Δ78 externalizations. This experiment demonstrates that the C-ter. domain is necessary for newly synthesized GluA1 to be externalized at the PM, even 2 hr after triggering GluA1 ER exit.</p><p>We then studied if the interaction between GluA1 and 4.1 N or SAP97 is necessary for the localization of GluA1 at the PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We performed extracellular labeling of GFP-GluA1-WT and the mutants, GFP-GluA1-Δ4.1N, and GFP-GluA1-Δ7 respectively deleted for their binding site for 4.1 N or SAP97, after induction of IT by addition of the AL during different times. For analysis of these experiments, we normalized the externalization values of the mutants to that of GFP-GluA1-WT at the corresponding times of incubation with AL in paired experiments. Both mutants were less exocytosed than GluA1-WT from 30 min to 2 hr after the addition of the AL. At each time point, the extracellular labeling of GluA1 lacking the 4.1 N binding site (Δ4.1N) was inferior to the one lacking the SAP97 binding site (Δ7). Indeed, when we quantified at 90 and 120 min. the difference in exocytosis between the two mutants, we found that this difference between Δ4.1N and Δ7 proteins was highly significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Exocytosis of the Δ4.1N mutant is less important than for the Δ7 mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This result shows that the interaction of GluA1 with 4.1 N or SAP97 plays a role in the surface expression of newly synthesized GluA1.</p><p>This lack of normal exocytosis of the mutants can be due either to an inhibition of externalization or to a decrease in their IT. We thus analyzed the IT parameters of the different mutants taking GluA1-WT as a control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–I</xref>, Sup. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). For these experiments, we expressed ARIAD-TdTom-GluA1, WT, or mutants, in order to be in the best conditions to detect the transport vesicles. We first analyzed the IT of the Δ78 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–G</xref>). The number of vesicles transporting this mutant was very low compared to GluA1-WT and this prevented the analysis of their IT parameters. The C-ter. domain of GluA1 is thus mandatory for the exit of newly synthesized GluA1 from the ER and the Golgi, likely explaining its requirement for GluA1 surface expression.</p><p>We then characterized the IT of the mutant deleted for the 4.1 N binding site (Δ4.1N) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). The number of vesicles transporting the protein was decreased compared to GluA1-WT. This is in accordance with a decrease in the number of vesicles that we found when 4.1 N was knocked down by the expression of the sh-4.1N. In contrast, the mean speeds of the vesicles were the same for GluA1-WT and GluA1-Δ4.1N. The time spent in each state was similar for the two proteins. These results indicate that binding of GluA1 to 4.1 N is important for its ER or Golgi export and exocytosis at the PM but does not affect its IT once the vesicles are released from the Golgi apparatus.</p><p>We then analyzed the IT of the mutant deleted for the last seven amino acids corresponding to the binding site of SAP97 (Δ7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). For this mutant, the number of vesicles released was decreased compared to GluA1-WT, as for GluA1-Δ4.1N. We also found a highly significant effect of the Δ7 mutant deletions of the PDZ binding domain on all the GluA1 IT parameters. First, the mean speed was decreased by 12% for the Δ7 mutants. Moreover, the time spent in a moving state was decreased by 7% and, conversely, the percentage of time in pause was increased by 22% compared to the WT. All these changes, although relatively modest, are significant and can have important functional impacts when cumulated over time. This corresponds to what we found for IT properties when the expression of SAP97 was decreased: modified ER/Golgi export and PM exocytosis, reduced speed, and increased time in pause.</p><p>For these two mutants, the vesicle number is similarly decreased but if the mean speed is also decreased for the Δ7 this is not the case for the Δ4.1N which has a completely normal IT speed. On the contrary, the exocytosis is largely decreased for the Δ4.1N protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>AMPAR traffic is regulated by the specific interaction between GluA1 C-ter. domain with 4.1N</title><p>Since we observed an impact on GluA1 IT when 4.1 N was knocked down, we were surprised by the absence of impact on IT of the Δ4.1N deletion on GluA1 IT.

These experiments were performed by directly visualizing individual insertion events of the AMPAR subunit GluA1 at the PM.

We next studied the contribution of 4.1 N to the cLTP-induced regulation of GluA1 IT. In basal conditions, when GluA1 is not associated with 4.1 N (GluA1-AA), IT is normally compared to that of GluA1-WT. However, the interaction between GluA1 and 4.1 N is important for the exit of GluA1 from the ER/Golgi and the insertion at the PM.

For IT regulation, the impact of the reduction of 4.1 N was all less drastic than for SAP97. This was the case for the decrease in the number of vesicles released upon the addition of AL as well as for the vesicle speed and for the increase in pausing time. On the contrary, we found that the externalization of GluA1 at the PM was equally inhibited by the absence of 4.1 N or SAP97.</p><p>The approach we are using allows to study the intracellular transport of neosynthesized GluA1. It however bears some shortcomings. For example, the fact that is an over-expression system and that vesicles are released from the ER synchronously is quite different from in vivo conditions and might affect trafficking. Our cDNAs are cloned in a Tet-ON system allowing us to express our proteins for a short time in order to avoid strong over-expression. In addition, we have previously shown that transport properties measured with the ARIAD release system release are indistinguishable from that of constitutively expressed receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hangen et al., 2018</xref>). Another limitation of our current study is that we are studying the transport properties of expressed GluA1 that could form either homomers or associate with endogenous subunits, and most probably GluA2. Importantly, GluA1 homomers are involved in various forms of LTP. Moreover, GluA1 C-ter. domain is specifically associated with proteins implicated in AMPAR transport such as 4.1 N and SAP97.</p><p>AMPAR is part of a macromolecular complex composed of a broad range of AMPAR interacting proteins including transmembrane auxiliary proteins and cytosolic partners associated with the C-terminal domain of AMPAR subunits. Several interactors were shown to affect biogenesis, AMPAR trafficking, and channel properties. Most of these proteins revealed preferred binding to specific AMPAR subunits, like SAP97 on GluA1 and GRIP1/PICK1 on GluA2 and GluA3. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, motor-mediated transport is the major mechanism for the delivery, removal, and redistribution of GLR-1 glutamate receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hoerndli et al., 2015</xref>). The microtubule-dependent motor UNC-116 (homolog of mammalian KIF5) drives the delivery and the removal of AMPAR, while UNC-43 (homolog of mammalian CaMKII) plays an essential role in modulating the transport of AMPAR between the cell body and the insertion or removal of synaptic AMPAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hoerndli et al., 2015</xref>). In vertebrates, AMPAR interacts with KIF5 through GRIP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Setou et al., 2002</xref>). AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission depends on both dynein and kinesin superfamily proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kim and Lisman, 2001</xref>) and an increase in AMPAR number at the PM during LTP depends also on their secretory transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Esteves da Silva et al., 2015</xref>). Other motors have also been implicated in AMPAR transport, such as Myosin-VI, an actin-dependent motor protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wu et al., 2002</xref>). SAP97 may serve as a molecular link between GluA1 and myosin-VI during the dynamic translocation of AMPAR to and from the post-synapse in an activity-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nash et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Whether the C-ter. domain of GluA1 plays any role in synaptic regulation is still uncertain. C-ter. domains of GluA1 and GluA2 are necessary and sufficient to drive NMDA receptor-dependent LTP and LTD, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>). Using a single-cell molecular replacement approach and long-expression time, the authors found no requirement for the GluA1 C-ter. domain of GluA1 for basal synaptic transmission nor for LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Granger et al., 2013</xref>). Other work observed a substantially reduced insertion frequency after expression of SEP-GluA1 and TIRF microscopy when the C-ter. domain was deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lin et al., 2009</xref>). In our model, we found that deleting the C-ter. domain of GluA1 inhibits almost completely IT and PM localization of newly synthesized GluA1. However, we could still detect rare vesicles transporting the subunit. Our experiments were performed until 120 min after the addition of the ligand. We cannot rule out that after 24–48 hr some AMPAR could reach the synapse. For the measurement of surface expression of the Δ7 and Δ4.1N mutants, all the values are expressed as a percentage of the WT expression level analyzed in the same experiments. We cannot, however, completely rule out that an increased endocytosis of each mutant is responsible for the reduced surface expression instead of a direct impact on exocytosis.</p><p>To analyze the impact of the interaction between GluA1 and 4.1 N, we used two mutants of GluA1. The first one is a complete deletion of the 4.1 N binding site, corresponding to a deletion of 14 amino acids close to the last transmembrane domain of GluA1. With this mutant, during basal transmission, we found a decrease in the number of vesicles transporting GluA1, a normal IT, and a decrease in exocytosis of GluA1. These effects could be due to the different lengths of the C-ter. domain of GluA1 or to the unbinding of 4.1 N with GluA1. In order to keep the same size as the C-ter. domain, we performed IT and exocytosis experiments with the GluA1-S<sub>816</sub>A-S<sub>818</sub>A (AA) mutant that does not bind 4.1 N. With this mutant, during basal transmission, only the exocytosis of the protein is impacted. This shows that the interaction between GluA1 and 4.1 N is only necessary for receptor exocytosis, without affecting its IT during basal transmission. The interaction with SAP97 has already a role during the transport of GluA1. In this case, externalization of GluA1 is impacted either because of the reduced vesicle number or because of a direct effect on exocytosis. After cLTP, we observed a decrease in IT properties when the interaction of 4.1 N/GluA1 was abolished. The effect of the SAP97/GluA1 interaction during cLTP stays the same as in basal conditions.</p><p>Previous studies have provided conflicting data regarding SAP97’s influence on synaptic function. Mutant mice expressing GluA1-Δ7 were found to have normal glutamatergic neurotransmission in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>). In another study, SAP97 isoforms appeared to regulate the ability of synapses to undergo plasticity by controlling the surface distribution of AMPA and NMDA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2011</xref>). SAP97 directs GluA1 forward trafficking from the Golgi network to the PM. Myosin VI and SAP97 are thought to form a trimeric complex with GluA1, with SAP97 acting as an adaptor between GluA1 and myosin VI to transport AMPA receptors to the postsynaptic plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wu et al., 2002</xref>). SAP97 only interacts with GluA1 early in the secretory pathway during its forward trafficking to the PM, suggesting that SAP97 acts on GluA1 solely before its synaptic insertion and that it does not play a major role in anchoring AMPAR at synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sans et al., 2001</xref>). SAP97 has also been shown to be associated with motor proteins such as KIF1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mok et al., 2002</xref>). Here, we found that SAP97 has a major role in the IT of AMPAR. Inhibiting the expression of SAP97 decreases IT and externalization of neosynthesized GluA1. This effect remains after the induction of cLTP. This result is in accordance with the fact that SAP97 has been already shown to be associated with AMPAR during its biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sans et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>4.1 N may function to confer stability and plasticity to the neuronal membrane via interactions with multiple binding partners, including the spectrin-actin-based cytoskeleton, integral membrane channels, and receptors. Phosphorylations at both S<sub>816</sub> and S<sub>818</sub> residues regulate activity-dependent GluA1 insertion, by affecting the interaction between 4.1 N and GluA1. In hippocampal neurons, when 4.1 N does not bind GluA1 (expression of GluA1-S<sub>816</sub>A-S<sub>818</sub>A), a substantially lower insertion frequency is detected by TIRF microscopy. During LTP these serines are phosphorylated, thus increasing the binding of 4.1 N to GluA1 and exocytosis of GluA1. 4.1 N is an important player in the expression of LTP, but doesn’t affect basal synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lin et al., 2009</xref>). With our experiments, we show that in basal conditions only the exocytosis of neosynthesized GluA1 is inhibited when it does not bind to 4.1 N without affecting its IT. However, during cLTP exocytosis and IT properties of GluA1 are dependent of the binding of 4.1 N on GluA1.</p><p>We show differential roles of 4.1 N/GluA1 and SAP97/GluA1 in basal transmission and during cLTP. In basal condition (upper panel <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) binding of SAP97 to GluA1 participates in the exit from the ER/Golgi and to intracellular transport of GluA1. By a consequence, the number of GluA1 at the PM is decreased (only by 30% compared to the control condition). The interaction between 4.1 N and GluA1 is necessary only for the exocytosis of the receptor at the plasma membrane (60% decrease compared to the control) having no effect on IT. After induction of cLTP (bottom panel <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) SAP97 has the same effect as in the basal state. However, after cLTP the role of the interaction between 4.1 N and GluA1 becomes crucial for all phases from the ER to the externalization of AMPAR. By analyzing the GluA1-S<sub>816</sub>A-S<sub>818</sub>A mutant we showed that 4.1 N/GluA1 interaction regulates the exit of the receptor from the ER/Golgi, the intracellular transport, and the exocytosis.</p><p>In this study, we uncover a new mechanism of regulation of AMPAR trafficking during basal synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity. It will be important to decipher if this mechanism still all thru in vivo and whether its abnormal regulation is involved in some synaptic disruption.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Molecular biology</title><p>cDNAs of interest are cloned in the ARIAD system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hangen et al., 2018</xref>) and then in the Tet-on vector for cLTP experiments.

Specifically, the study aims to determine the molecular mechanisms that contribute to the intracellular trafficking of AMPA receptors and determine their insertion into the synaptic plasma membrane. Using compelling methodology, the authors dissect the distinct roles of two proteins that bind to the C-terminal domain of the AMPA receptor subunit GluA1: 4.1N and SAP97. The findings will be of interest to anyone trying to understand molecular events contributing to synaptic plasticity in health and disease, and more broadly, the method could be adapted for tracking intracellular movements of a wide range of proteins.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85609.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Zubcevic</surname><given-names>Lejla</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/036c9yv20</institution-id><institution>University of Kansas Medical Center</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Zubcevic</surname><given-names>Lejla</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/036c9yv20</institution-id><institution>University of Kansas Medical Center</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.09.05.506328">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.05.506328v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Lejla Zubcevic as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Since the approach used here could be used for a variety of proteins and is hence of interest to the wider scientific community, I think it would be very important to clearly discuss the shortcomings of the approach. For example, the fact this is an over-expression system and that vesicles are released from the ER synchronously is quite different from in vivo conditions and might affect trafficking.</p><p>2) In terms of AMPARs, it should be clearly noted that the subunit composition used here is not very represented in vivo. In fact, hippocampal AMPARs are mainly heteromers composed of A1/A2, A3/A2, or even A1/A2/A3 subunits (Yu, Nature, 202, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03540-0), which is very likely to affect their trafficking properties.</p><p>3) The number of released vesicles from the ER and externalisation of AMPARs are considered separately throughout the manuscript and conclusions are made about whether an interaction affects externalisation or intracellular trafficking based on this. This works really well in the case of double Ala mutant (S816A S818A) of AMPARs, where the number of released vesicles is unchanged compared to the non-mutated AMPARs, but there is less externalisation in basal conditions. However, I was wondering whether a reduced number of released vesicles could lead to less externalisation simply because there are fewer vesicles to deliver to the plasma membrane and not because something is wrong with the externalisation process per se.</p><p>4) In experiments where surface localisation is measured over extended periods of time (e.g. over 2 hours in Figure 2D), how sure can one be there is no endocytosis happening during this time and that this not contributing to the decrease in surface intensity observed in some AMPAR mutants compared to the non-mutated AMPARs?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have the following suggestions for the authors.</p><p>1. Data presentation:</p><p>1.1. A table (or similar) to summarize and directly compare the results of the various conditions, and types of measurements might be helpful.</p><p>1.2. Axis labels in &quot;% prot/scr&quot; and &quot;%EC/scr&quot; graphs – perhaps rename to something that is easier to understand without having to refer to the figure legends? It'd make the figures easier to read if the graphs contained all the information required to interpret the data.</p><p>1.3. Many sentences are punctuated with long parentheticals, for example, &quot;(% decrease of vesicles: control/Sh-SAP97 in basal: 78.4 %, after cLTP: 67.1%; control/∆7 in basal: 27.2%, after cLTP: 33.8 %).&quot; This interrupts the thought while reading.
