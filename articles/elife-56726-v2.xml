nutritional and non-nutritional foods is a fundamental question. Flies choose the sweeter non-nutritive sugar, L-glucose, over the nutritive D-glucose if they are not starved. However, under starvation conditions, they switch their preference to D-glucose, and this occurs independent of peripheral taste neurons. Here, we found that eliminating the TRPγ channel impairs the ability of starved flies to choose D-glucose. This food selection depends on <italic>trpγ</italic> expression in neurosecretory cells in the brain that express diuretic hormone 44 (DH44). Loss of <italic>trpγ</italic> increases feeding, alters the physiology of the crop, which is the fly stomach equivalent, and decreases intracellular sugars and glycogen levels. Moreover, survival of starved <italic>trpγ</italic> flies is reduced. Expression of <italic>trpγ</italic> in DH44 neurons reverses these deficits. These results highlight roles for TRPγ in coordinating feeding with the metabolic state through expression in DH44 neuroendocrine cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>feeding</kwd><kwd>internal state</kwd><kwd>metabolic sensor</kwd><kwd>neuroendocrine cells</kwd><kwd>TRP channel</kwd><kwd>brain</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC007864</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Montell</surname><given-names>Craig</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI165575</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Montell</surname><given-names>Craig</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI169386</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Montell</surname><given-names>Craig</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2018R1A2B6004202</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Youngseok</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2016R1D1A1B03931273</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Youngseok</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2021R1A2C1007628</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Youngseok</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003654</institution-id><institution>Korea Environmental Industry and Technology Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Youngseok</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic, behavioral, and biochemical evidence reveals that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> TRPγ channel is required in neuroendocrine cells for the starvation-induced switch in preference to less palatable but more nutritive food.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In many animals, the decision about whether to feed on the most delectable food options versus the most nutritious options is influenced by the internal state. If they are sated, many animals ranging from flies to mammals select the most delicious foods, such as highly sweet forms of sugars, such as L-glucose, over the less sweet but nutritive D-glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Burke and Waddell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Araujo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dus et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dus et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miyamoto et al., 2012</xref>). This ability to detect the hedonistic quality of foods, including the sweetness of sugars, occurs through taste receptors in their peripheral taste organs. However, if an animal is starved, they alter their preference, and choose foods based on their caloric content.</p><p>The capacity to evaluate the nutrient quality of sugars can occur independent of any input from peripheral taste receptor cells. Mice missing the TRPM5 channel, which is critical for sensing sugars, retain the ability to sense caloric-rich sugars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Araujo et al., 2008</xref>). Rather, these taste-blind animals detect nutritive sugar through neurons in the brain—the nucleus accumbens of the ventral striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Araujo et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The fruit fly, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, is also endowed with neurons in the brain that enable starved animals to use a post-ingestive mechanism to choose nutrient-rich sugars over their non-metabolizable, but sweeter enantiomers. In support of this finding, starved flies undergo a change in preference for D-glucose over L-glucose, and will do so in the absence of sugar receptors expressed in peripheral gustatory receptor neurons. Their ability to switch their preference to nutritive food depends on a small cluster of six neurons in the brain that express diuretic hormone 44 (DH44)—a neuropeptide related to the mammalian corticotropin-releasing hormone. These neuroendocrine cells located in a region of the brain called the pars intercerebralis (PI) are activated by nutritive sugars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dus et al., 2015</xref>). DH44 neurons extend axons from the PI to the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dus et al., 2015</xref>). The fly gut includes the crop, which is the equivalent of the mammalian stomach, and the intestines, which control feeding intake, food absorption, and defecation.</p><p>To characterize the molecular mechanism underlying taste-independent sensation of the caloric content of sugar, we tested potential contributions of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. These channels are expressed in many peripheral sensory neurons, and function in phototransduction, chemosensation, mechanosensation, and temperature sensation. In addition, many TRP channels are expressed in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cornillot et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Venkatachalam and Montell, 2007</xref>). Here, we report that <italic>trpγ</italic> is expressed in DH44 neuroendocrine cells in the PI. Mutations that eliminate the TRPγ cation channel disrupt the ability of food-deprived flies from shifting their preference from the highly palatable L-glucose to the nutritive D-glucose. In the absence of TRPγ, we observed a host of related metabolic defects, including a reduction in intracellular sugar levels, and diminished glycogen stores under starvation conditions. These deficits were due to loss of <italic>trpγ</italic> expression in DH44 neuroendocrine cells. Our findings highlight a key role for TRPγ in taste-independent food selection, and the metabolic response to nutritive sugars under starvation conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TRPγ is required for choosing nutrient-rich glucose in starved flies</title><p>Sated flies prefer the sweeter but non-nutritive L-glucose over the nutritive sugar D-glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dus et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miyamoto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stafford et al., 2012</xref>).

The preference in sated flies depends on the taste sensors in the fly tongue, the labellum, while a taste-independent system in the brain functions in the selection of D-glucose in starved flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dus et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dus et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miyamoto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stafford et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In addition to expression in peripheral sensory neurons, many TRP channels in mammals are expressed in internal tissues that function in sensing the internal metabolic state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dhakal and Lee, 2019</xref>). Therefore, to address whether a <italic>Drosophila</italic> TRP channel contributes to the post-ingestive pathway used by starved flies to choose D-glucose, over L-glucose, we conducted two-way choice assays. We selected 200 mM L-glucose and 50 mM D-glucose for these assays since control flies (<italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>) that were restricted from eating for a relatively brief period (5 hr) selected L-glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These flies are referred to as ‘sated’, but were prevented from feeding for several hours to motivate feeding. However, if the flies were starved for a prolonged period (18 hr), they selected the metabolizable 50 mM D-glucose over non-metabolizable 200 mM L-glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dus et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dus et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miyamoto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stafford et al., 2012</xref>). The change in food preference between 5 and 18 hr has been documented previously and is consistent with the observation that sugar levels in the hemolymph remain high after 5 hr of starvation, but drop significantly after 15 hr or more of starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dus et al., 2013</xref>).

Flies with mutations in any of 11 genes encoding TRP channels are homozygous viable and healthy, while mutations in <italic>trpM</italic> or <italic>nompC</italic> either cause pupal lethality or minimal survival as adults. We tested all 11 of the homozygous viable mutations to determine if any disrupted the switch in preference to D-glucose after prolonged starvation. As previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dus et al., 2015</xref>), this taste-independent pathway depends on DH44 neurons in the brain that express the neuropeptide DH44, but not on peripheral sugar receptors such as GR64a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Ten of the 11 mutants tested displayed similar preferences for D-glucose as control flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, mutation of <italic>trpγ</italic> (<italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic>) virtually eliminated the bias for D-glucose in starved flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). However, the <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic> flies preferred L-glucose if they were sated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Consistent with previous reports, the preference for L-glucose in sated flies is not dependent on DH44, but is reduced upon mutation of sugar receptors, which are expressed in gustatory receptor neurons in the periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>The impairment in selecting D-glucose by the starved <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic> flies was due to mutation of <italic>trpγ</italic> rather than a background mutation since a second <italic>trpγ</italic> allele (<italic>trpγ<sup>G4</sup></italic>) exhibited the same phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Moreover, we rescued the deficit in choosing D-glucose with a genomic <italic>trpγ<sup>+</sup></italic> transgene, <italic>g</italic>(<italic>trpγ</italic>), and with a <italic>UAS-trpγ</italic> cDNA expressed under control of the <italic>GAL4</italic> knocked into the <italic>trpγ</italic> locus (<italic>trpγ<sup>G4</sup></italic> flies; + ). The <italic>trpγ</italic> mutant phenotype did not appear to be due to a deficit in the peripheral gustatory receptor neurons that are associated with sensilla decorating the fly tongue—the labellum. Using tip recordings on sugar-activated L6 sensilla, we found that the <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic> mutants exhibited similar frequencies of D-glucose- and L-glucose-induced action potentials as control flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>).

Surprisingly, mutation of <italic>trpγ</italic> caused the opposite effect, as we found significantly higher peak signals using the genetically encoded voltage indicator, ASAP2s. This greater response is indicative of more rapid firing of action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chamberland et al., 2017</xref>). We suggest that the underlying basis for this effect may be due to a role for TRPγ that is similar to a function of TRPC4, which is a mammalian TRPC homolog in lateral septal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tian et al., 2014</xref>). Activation of TRPC4 has been shown to cause two types of responses, one of which is ‘plateau depolarization’—a period characterized by few if any action potentials due to strong depolarization, thereby inactivating voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tian et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, the plateau depolarization caused by TRPC4 is dependent on activation of the channel by Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tian et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We propose that similar to TRPC4 in lateral septal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tian et al., 2014</xref>), TRPγ functions in DH44 neurons to hold these neurons in an afterdepolarization state, reducing the rate of firing. We suggest that in <italic>trpγ</italic> mutant DH44 neurons, the loss of the afterdepolarization block underlies the higher peak ASAP2s signal (increased firing rate) and higher baseline activity. We also propose that the TRPγ-dependent afterdepolarization requires extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, as is the case for TRPC4. Consistent with this idea, when we measured the ASAP2s signals in control DH44 neurons bathed in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free buffer, the cells displayed increased ASAP2s fluorescence, similar to the <italic>trpγ</italic> mutants. At the physiological level, this would result in the release of excessive DH44, and deplete the neuropeptide stores, thereby rendering them unable to respond to a continuous elevation of nutrients in the hemolymph.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Metabolic defect due to loss of TRPγ decreases survival during starvation</title><p>To reveal whether the impairment in starvation-induced D-glucose selection is associated with a metabolic defect, we examined circulating sugar levels. While there were small reductions in the starved mutants, the differences with the control animals were not significant. In contrast, there were large and highly significant decreases in intracellular sugar concentrations in both sated and starved flies. We suggest that a key deficit in <italic>trpγ</italic> mutants is glucose uptake. However, glucose uptake has not been assayed in flies, and we were also unable to develop such measurements. Nevertheless, in support of the concept that there is a defect in glucose uptake, we found that the glycogen stores were also diminished in <italic>trpγ</italic> mutants. In mammals, there is evidence that taste-independent sugar preference is influenced by glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ren et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, it is intriguing to speculate that the deficit in D-glucose selection in <italic>trpγ</italic> mutants is due in part to impairment in metabolism of D-glucose.</p><p>Our findings that <italic>trpγ</italic> function is rescued by expressing the wild-type transgene in DH44 neurons, and <italic>Dh44</italic> mutant flies exhibited the same deficits in tissue sugar and glycogen levels raise the possibility that TRPγ promotes the release of DH44, which in turn increases glucose uptake. Consistent with this proposal, corticotropin-releasing hormone, which is the mammalian homolog of DH44, increases glucose uptake in a variety of cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hogg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lu et al., 2018</xref>).

Prior to starvation, the flies were maintained on standard cornmeal/molasses fly food. To conduct the assays, 40–50 flies (3–6 days of age; mixed sexes, unless indicated otherwise) were starved for 5 hr (sated) or 18 hr (starved) in a humidified chamber. Two different food sources were prepared containing 1% agarose: one containing 50 mM D-glucose, and the other containing 200 mM L-glucose. These food sources were mixed with either blue food coloring (brilliant blue FCF, 0.125 mg/mL) or red food coloring (sulforhodamine B, 0.1 mg/mL). The two mixtures were distributed in a 72-well microtiter dish in alternating wells (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. # 438733). We introduced the starved flies into the dish, kept them in a dark, humidified chamber, and allowed the flies to feed for 90 min at 25°C. Then, we sacrificed the flies by putting them in a freezer and analyzed the color of their abdomens under a stereomicroscope. Blue (N<sub>B</sub>), red (N<sub>R</sub>), or purple (N<sub>P</sub>) flies were tabulated. Each preference index (PI) was calculated according to the following equation: (N<sub>B</sub>-N<sub>R</sub>)/(N<sub>R</sub> +N<sub>B</sub> + N<sub>P</sub>) or (N<sub>R</sub>-N<sub>B</sub>)/(N<sub>R</sub> +N<sub>B</sub> + N<sub>P</sub>), depending on the dye/tastant combinations. PIs = 1.0 and -1.0 indicate complete preference for one over the other food. A PI = 0 indicates no bias between the two food choices.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>We performed immunohistochemistry as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee and Montell, 2013</xref>). Briefly, to fix and block the specimens, we placed freshly dissected tissues into a well of a 24-well Tissue Culture plate (Costar Corp.) placed on ice, which contained 940 μL of Fix Buffer (0.1 M Pipes pH 6.9, 1 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 150 mM NaCl) and 60 μL of 37% formaldehyde. Formaldehyde was added to the wells containing the Fix buffer and mixed immediately before adding the tissue. We transferred as many dissected tissues into the Fix buffer as we could dissect in 15 min. The tissues were incubated for another 30 min, washed with Wash buffer (1× PBS, 0.2% saponin), and blocked for 4–8 hr at 4°C with 1 mL of Blocking buffer (1× PBS, 0.1% saponin, and 5 mg/mL BSA).</p><p>To perform immunostaining, the tissues were transferred and incubated overnight at 4°C with the primary antibodies in the Blocking buffer, washed three times with Wash buffer for 15 min each on ice, incubated with the secondary antibodies (1:200) for 4 hr at 4°C, and washed three times with Wash buffer for 15 min each on ice. The antibodies were used at the following dilutions: mouse anti-GFP (1:1000, Molecular Probes, cat. # A11120), rabbit anti-DsRed (Clontech, cat. # 632496), rabbit anti-DH44 (1:500) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cabrero et al., 2002</xref>), goat anti-mouse (Alexa488 cat. # A11029), and goat anti-rabbit Alexa568 (cat. # A11036). The tissues were transferred into 1.25× PDA Dilution buffer (37.5% glycerol, 187.5 mM NaCl, 62.5 mM Tris pH 8.8), and incubated &gt;1 hr at 4°C. Samples were mounted and viewed using a Carl Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope.</p><p>We performed staining to quantify cellular DH44 neuropeptide secretion as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dus et al., 2015</xref>).

Staining with anti-DH44 was conducted as described above. Image acquisition was performed with a Leica Stellaris 5 Confocal Microscope. The ImageJ (Fiji) application was used to quantify the fluorescence intensity of the intracellular DH44 neuropeptide stained with anti-DH44 antibody in the brain.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Ex vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging</title><p>Ex vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Inagaki et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly we dissected adult brains from 7- to 10-day-old males in cold sugar-free <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaging saline (108 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 8.2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 5 mM HEPES pH 7.5) and immobilized the brains with a slice harp (SHD-26GH/10, Warner Instruments) on a 35 mm plastic Petri dish (35 3001 Falcon), containing 4 mL sugar-free <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaging saline. We imaged the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics using a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope with a Zeiss 20× water objective (20×/1.0 DIC (uv) VIS-IR, Zeiss) and a 488 nm laser. We recorded each brain for 20 min in total (512 × 512 pixels) at a rate of 400 ms/frame. Approximately 15 Z axial sections were imaged in one time-series cycle. The section interval was ~6 μm. The time intervals between each cycle were ~8 s. Before stimulating a brain, we imaged the basal GCaMP6s signals for 5 min. Pseudo-color images and image analyses were performed using ImageJ. ΔF/F (%) was calculated as (F<sub>max</sub>-F<sub>0</sub>)/F<sub>0</sub> × 100%. F<sub>0</sub> is the GCaMP6s baseline value averaged for 10 frames immediately before glucose application. F<sub>max</sub> is the maximum fluorescence value following glucose delivery.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Ex vivo voltage imaging</title><p>To perform the ex vivo voltage imaging, we generated flies that express the voltage sensor, ASAP2s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chamberland et al., 2017</xref>), in DH44 neurons. Briefly, we dissected brains from 7- to 10-day-old males in cold sugar-free <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaging saline (108 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 8.2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 5 mM HEPES pH 7.5). For the no-Ca<sup>2+</sup> experiments, we prepared Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free imaging saline (108 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 8.2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 5 mM HEPES, 0.5 mM EGTA pH 7.5). We transferred the brains to glass coverslips coated with poly-D-lysine (VWR BD354086) surrounded by silicone to keep the <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaging saline on the microscope slides. After placing the slides on the microscope stage, we perfused the <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaging saline from one side (delivered via gravity) and adjusted the vacuum on the opposite side to match the flow rate of the perfusion. The buffer delivery system was prepared by connecting standard 1 mm diameter tubing to 50 mL syringes placed higher than the imaging area. We connected the tubing to the syringes using luer valves, and controlled the buffer delivery with roller clamps (World Precision Instruments, 14011). We connected the other end of the tubing to a stainless steel needle (45° angle, 0.010’’ inner diameter, McMaster-Carr, 75165 A62) to deliver solutions to the brain samples. The perfusion system allowed for switching among three different solutions in one experiment.</p><p>We imaged the ASAP2s signals using a Bruker two-photon microscope with a Mai Tai DeepSee laser set at 920 nm (Mai Tai EHP 1040 DS) and an Olympus 40× water objective (LUMPlanFL N 40×/0.80W) in the Galvo scanning mode. We selected a single neuron as the region of interest, and adjusted the laser strength and PMT gain. We recorded each brain for 6 min in total (512 × 512 pixels) at a rate of ~35 ms/frame. We imaged a single axial section using a one time-series cycle. We stimulated the brains by switching to the various buffers using roller clamps to turn the buffer flow on and off. Before stimulating a brain, we imaged the basal ASAP2s signals for 60 s. We then started perfusing the brain with 20 mM D-glucose, L-glucose, or buffer as a control for 120 s. We then switched back to the imaging saline. Brightness over time data were collected in real time using Prairie View software (Bruker Prairie View 5.5). We performed data analysis using a custom Python script. Briefly, we first corrected for photobleaching by fitting the brightness data points with the sum of two exponentials. The fractional fluorescence change (-ΔF/F) corresponds to -(F(t) - F<sub>0</sub>)/F<sub>0</sub>, where F(t) corresponds to the fluorescence at time t. F<sub>0</sub> corresponds to the baseline (resting) fluorescence. All data are corrected for photobleaching. To obtain F<sub>0</sub>, we averaged 100 data points before application of the stimuli. We filtered out noise by eliminating spikes that were &lt;5% of the signal. Activation latency is the time before the first activation occurred following application of the stimulus.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Glucose measurements in adult hemolymph</title><p>Hemolymph glucose level was measured as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dus et al., 2011</xref>). Briefly, to measure circulating glucose, hemolymph samples were collected from ten 3- to 5-day-old males. The animals were punctured in the thorax using a fine injection needle and placed shoulder down to prevent leakage from the genital tract into 0.5 mL tubes whose bases had been punctured with a 21-gauge needle. The tubes were set into 1.5 mL microfuge tubes and centrifuged at 4°C for 5 min at ~2800 <italic>g</italic> force; 0.5 µL of hemolymph was added to 14.5 μL PBS and placed at 70°C for 5 min. Then, we added 100 µL of glucose reagent (Sigma: G3293 VER) and incubated at 37°C for 12 hr. We used a commercial glucose (HK) assay kit (Sigma: GAHK-20-1KT) to perform the assays and measured the total glucose at 340 nm.

Briefly, 10 males were weighed and homogenized in 250 µL of 0.25 M Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> buffer and incubated in a water bath at 95°C for 5 min to inactivate all enzymes. Then 150 µL 1 M acetic acid and 600 µL 0.25 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) were added, and the solution was centrifuged (10 min,12,500 <italic>g</italic> force, 24°C); 200 µL of each supernatant was incubated overnight at 37°C with 2 µL porcine kidney trehalose (Sigma: T8778 UN) to convert trehalose into glucose, and 100 µL of this solution was added to 1 mL glucose hexokinase solution (Sigma: GAHK-20) and incubated for 20 min at 37°C. Glucose levels were quantified at 340 nm. We determined glucose concentrations using a glucose standard curve.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Glycogen measurements</title><p>We quantified glycogen levels in whole fly extracts as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dus et al., 2011</xref>). Briefly, five males (3–5 days of age) were weighed and homogenized in 100 µL of ice cold phosphate buffered saline (1× PBS). We inactivated the enzymes by incubating the homogenates at 70 °C for 5 min, centrifuged the samples at 12,500 <italic>g</italic> force for 3 min at 4 °C, and transferred 20 μL supernatants to 1.5 mL tubes, and added 20 μL diluted to 1:3 in 1× PBS; 1.5 µL amyloglucosidase (Sigma A1602) suspension was inserted in 998.5 µL 1× PBS. We added 20 µL of the diluted amyloglucosidase solution to 20 µL aliquots of each test sample (and to glycogen standards) to convert the glycogen into glucose. The samples and glycogen standards were incubated at 37°C for 60 min. A commercial glucose (HK) assay reagent (Sigma: G3293 VER) was used to measure total glucose at 340 nm. To determine the glycogen concentrations, we compared the glucose levels in the test samples with a standard curve derived from converting glycogen standards to glucose.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Tip recordings</title><p>We performed tip recordings essentially as previously described with minor modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hodgson et al., 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moon et al., 2006</xref>). Three- to 5-day-old male or female flies were anesthetized on ice, and a reference electrode containing Ringer’s solution was inserted from the thorax up to the tip of labellum. We stimulated L6 sensilla with 50 mM D-glucose or 200 mM L-glucose introduced in a glass recording electrode (tip size 10–20 μm) with 30 mM tricholine citrate as the electrolyte. The recording electrode was connected to a preamplifier (TastePROBE, Syntech, Hilversum, The Netherlands; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ockenfels-syntech.com/">http://www.ockenfels-syntech.com/</ext-link>), and the signals were collected and amplified 10× using a signal connection interface box (Syntech) in conjunction with a 100–3000 Hz band-pass filter.

Briefly, we cut off the ends of P200 pipette tips to slightly increase the openings. We inserted a fly that was starved for 5 or 18 hr so that only the head was exposed to the outside. Each fly was then kept in a humidified chamber for 30 min. We offered water to the flies so that they become water saturated. To confirm that they were not responding to water, we re-applied water stimuli (three times in a 2 s interval) to the labellum, and only used animals that were unresponsive to water alone. We then touched the labellum with a Kimwipe soaked in either 50 mM D-glucose or 200 mM L-glucose. The stimuli were applied to the flies a maximum of three times to decide whether they were responsive or non-responsive. If there was a single full extension of the proboscis to the stimuli, this was recorded as a positive PER. The responses were recorded using a Nikon SMZ745 stereomicroscope, and <italic>i</italic>solution IMTcam3 camera and Bandicam software. To quantify the times to full extension of the proboscis, we recorded videos at 8 frames/s (125 ms resolution), and measured the times to fully extend the proboscis after the stimulus was applied to the labellum. We cropped the recorded videos using a daum pot encoder (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.daum.net/">https://www.daum.net/</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Ingestion assays</title><p>Ingestion assays were performed as previously described with slight modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sang et al., 2019</xref>).

We allowed the flies to feed on the food for the indicated durations starting at 9 AM (ZT0: lights on). The flies were homogenized in 1.5 mL microfuge tubes in 1 mL distilled water.

The flies were transferred to an empty clean vial for 1 hr. The vials were cleared, and then we determined the number and size of excreta by photographing the bottoms of the vials with an <italic>i</italic>solution IMTcam3 camera connected to a Nikon SMZ745 stereomicroscope. The defecation rate was the number of spots per fly per hour. To measure the diameters of the fecal spots, we magnified the images 400-fold and determined the average area/spot using the area formula for circles. To quantify the total excreta, we washed the inside of each vial with 1 mL 1× PBS and measured the OD of the solution at 629 nm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Scoring crop sizes</title><p>To score crop sizes, we performed experiments as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Edgecomb et al., 1994</xref>).

The weight of groups of 10 flies were measured under sated conditions, and then again after 24 hr of starvation. To determine the weights, we anesthetized sated flies, transferred them to a 1.5 mL tube, and quickly measured their weights using a digital balance (OHAUS Corporation; AVG264), which provides 10<sup>–4</sup> g sensitivity. We subtracted the weights of the tubes only from the total weight. The same groups of 10 flies were starved in vials containing damp Kimwipe paper.

Your article has been reviewed by 4 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Ivan De Araujo (Reviewer #4).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after very extensive consultation between the reviewers, which is one of the strong points of <italic>eLife</italic> when the four reviewers can balance their views and discuss the points made by the other reviewers, points they might have missed or might disagree with. The discussion among reviewers is not anonymous and therefore, it is very personalized. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we believe that you will need to address several important points before your manuscript can be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>It is clear that the discovery of a role of TRPγ in the Glucose sensing pathway is likely of significance importance, and in this regard, the reviewers agreed that the work could lead to important conclusions eventually applicable to mammals.</p><p>However, there were a number of difficulties with the manuscript that dampened the enthusiasm of the reviewers.</p><p>I will try to present briefly the result of the discussion, but of course these points are presented in detail in the individual reviews.</p><p>I would still like to emphasize that the editors and reviewers consider that this work could be of high significance if the points below could be addressed, but certainly this would require additional work that would do well beyond the two months allocated for a revised version for <italic>eLife</italic>, of course accounting for the fact that we are all banned from the lab and this will likely last for another few weeks/months.</p><p>– The major issue with the paper is the fact that the reviewers do not understand the role played by a Trp channel in sensing Glucose. You were careful to say that TRPγ was 'involved' in the circuit but most readers will assume that this involvement is in Glucose sensing. However, the reviewers pointed to the fact that Calcium imaging in mutant DH44 cells indicates that they retain their ability to respond to this sugar. If a Trp channel is not a sensor, what does it do in DH44 cells? is it regulated or is it simply a leak channel with no regulatory function, which would be of lesser interest</p><p>– You describe multiple roles of the channel and the reviewers could not figure out your model as to how 'Trpγ coordinates feeding with the metabolic state'. These roles need to be better integrated to obtain a coherent model. Furthermore, the role the receptor in the mouthparts or sensory organs needs to be addressed to make sure that the phenotype is that of DH44 cells (even though you can rescue with DH44 driver, the phenotype can be confounded by these other functions).</p><p>– Reviewer #1 also points to inconsistencies in the arguments presented that are an issue.</p><p>For instance, but not exclusively, they do not understand how the loss of Trpγ, which causes hyper-polarization, results in an increase in intracellular calcium levels in response to glucose. The logic of the following argument is certainly not clear: &quot;We suggest that …..loss of TRPg causes hyperpolarization of Dh44 neurons, which increases the driving force for calcium.&quot;</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Dhakal et al., screened viable mutations for members of the TRP superfamily in the two- choice assay (nutritious vs. non-nutritious sugar) and identified a mutation in Trpγ gene that was impaired in the assay. The authors went on to show that Trpγ is required in DH44 neurons for the post-ingestive food selection and the maintenance of bodily sugar levels.</p><p>Interestingly, calcium imaging indicated that sugar-induced neuronal activity is potentiated by the Trpγ mutation. The authors further claimed that in Trpγ mutants, greater amounts of food were consumed, the size of crop and the rate of crop contraction were increased, and the rate of defecation was enhanced. The authors proposed without experimental evidence that Trpγ is a calcium-permeable leak channel and its mutation caused hyperpolarization of DH44 neuronal activity. However, it is not clear to me how a mutation in a calcium- permeable leak channel causing hyperpolarization could result in an increase in calcium influx in response to glucose application. Furthermore, if the observed phenotypes are indeed attributed to the increased intracellular calcium levels, it is not clear how Trpγ mutant flies could have such a defect in the two-choice assay. The authors claimed that silencing of DH44 neurons increased food intake, but Trpγ mutant flies, in which the intracellular calcium levels had been increased, consumed more food (which was rescued by DH44-Gal4; UAS-Trpγ ). This is inconsistent and there are many inconsistencies through the manuscript. The authors did a good job in testing a hypothesis that a TRP channel is involved in post-ingestive food selection, but need to come up with a more unifying proposal of how Trpγ functions in regulating food intake.</p><p>Other issues are indicated below.</p><p>1. Line 127, &quot;rather than a background mutation since a second Trpγ allele (trpγG4)</p><p>exhibited the same phenotype (Figure 1B).&quot; I do not see the same phenotype in</p><p>Figure 1B. In fact, Trpγ G4 allele looks completely normal.</p><p>2. Figure 3C: it is not clear whether the glycogen levels are significantly different in</p><p>DH44 rescued vs. dilp2 rescued flies.</p><p>3. Also, in Figure 5B and 5C (and other figures), I am not sure whether there is a</p><p>statistical significance.</p><p>4. Single factor ANOVA with Scheffe's analysis as a post hoc test was deployed, but I</p><p>am not sure whether the authors can use this method.</p><p>5. Further, &quot;the black and red asterisks indicate …. from the sated controls and</p><p>mutants, respectively.&quot; The descriptions of the statistical analyses were not clear.</p><p>6. The authors compared TRPγ to TRPC5 and claimed that TRPC5 in POMC neurons</p><p>causes hyperpolarization in these neurons. TRPC5 is required for activation of POMC</p><p>neurons by leptin and other stimuli, but I am not sure whether it leads to hyperpolarization in a ligand-independent manner as a leak channel. The authors need to check this.</p><p>7. The abstract does not seem to reflect the actual content of the manuscript…</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript Dhakal et al., discover a role for the Trpγ channel in nutrient sensing behavior. They show that this gene functions in the Dh44+ cells to direct the animal to feed on nutritious sugar after fasting. Since the molecular mechanisms of nutrient sensing are still poorly defined, this manuscript presents a conceptual advance on this topic and also more broadly, on the role of TRP channels in organismal physiology. The genetic data are very strong, but the functional imaging experiments do not support the conclusions of the authors. A few additional experiments are required to better characterize the function of this channel in the nutrient sensing phenotype.</p><p>Essential</p><p>The authors show that the phenotype of Trpγ mutants can be rescued by expression of the UAS-Trpγ in the DH44+ neurons. However, given that this channel has different functions in diverse neuronal populations, it would be ideal if the authors also showed that it is necessary in the Dh44+ cells by using an RNAi construct. While not all the experiments need to be repeated with the RNAi allele, it would be good to show that this phenocopies the mutant for at least the feeding behavior and glucose phenotypes.</p><p>The authors argue that Trpγ mutants do not sense the caloric value of D-glucose, but from the ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments, the Dh44+ cells retain their ability to respond to this sugar. In fact, the authors argue that the df/f is higher in the Trpγ mutants, and the hypothesis is that this channel may function as a leak channel and hyperpolarize the cells. While future experiments will address the exact mechanisms through which Trpγ works, this manuscript should provide a better characterization of the cellular phenotype.</p><p>In particular, the authors should use a higher concentration of glucose to see if the phenotype remains the same. Why was 2.5mM used? In the study cited by Dhakal et al., (Dus et al., 2015), a range of glucose concentrations we used, from 5mM to 80mM. While it is likely that the physiological levels of sugar in the fly brain are within the lower range of that spectrum, the authors should test at least another concentration above 2.5mM.</p><p>The authors argue that Trpγ decreases the resting membrane potential of the Dh44 cells. This could be tested using genetically encoded voltage indicators, depending on the indicator used, the fluorescence at rest (i.e., fasted brains with no sugar in the hemolymph like saline) should be different in Trpγ mutants.</p><p>The authors discuss that Trpγ could affect nutrient sensing behavior by preventing the proper release of the Dh44 neuropeptide. Since the authors have Dh44 antibodies (Figure 1), they should have tested this hypothesis, since hyperpolarization prevents the release of the neuropeptide (Dus et al., 2015).</p><p>Non-essential experiments and additional suggestions</p><p>In Figure1B, TrpγG4 flies have normal responses to glucose, but line 126-128 says the opposite. How do the authors explain this?</p><p>In Trpγ mutants, how is crop #5 increased even if the contraction rate is increased? (Figure 5).</p><p>Dh44 neurons have also been shown to be required for increased dietary amino acid intake in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (Yang et al., 2018), have the authors tested this phenotype?</p><p>Line 70: TRP is mentioned for the first time here in the article, so it would be a good idea to write it as Transient Receptor Potential channels at this point and then use the abbreviated version henceforth.</p><p>Figure 1:</p><p>Figure 1A n should be = 6 – 13 instead of n = 6 – 14 as mentioned in the figure legend. There are a total of 13 data points each for control and trpγ1 genotypes, unless some are overlapping.</p><p>Figure 1H Regarding the depiction of the combination of type of lines to make a particular genotype represented by &quot;-&quot; or &quot;+&quot;: The first two columns showing &quot;-&quot; for all 3 genotypes, do they represent the response of wild type controls <italic>w1118</italic> at 17°C to 17°C and 17°C to 31°C respectively?

There are a total of 12 data points for the 2nd column all &quot;-&quot; i.e. for the trpγ1 genotypes, unless some are overlapping.</p><p>Figure 1 B, C, H and I legends say both males and females were used, but the figures do not show separate data. Does that mean there was no sex-specific bias in choice assays? Or some of the data points are males and some females? Or these data are an average of male and female responses?</p><p>Line 162-167:</p><p>&quot;trpγG4/UAS-Kir2.1,tub-GAL80ts flies at 17° C, which prevented Kir2.1 expression, the starved animals showed a normal preference for the nutritious D-glucose&quot; These adults were maintained at 17°C during their adult stage, what was their rearing temperature? It would be helpful to have that information in the context of Figure 1H.</p><p>Figure 1H shows when flies were reared at 17°C and then switched to 31°C at adult stage, the starved animals were unable to make a choice between D- and L- glucose.

In general the paper is well put together and the experiments seem solid. I have a few suggestions for the authors.</p><p>My main comment relates to the general message in relation to the experiments. The title implies that TRPy might actually be part of the mechanism of food selection but if I follow the work clearly, it seems that actually in most cases the authors conclude that TRPy is required for the proper function of DH44 neurons. It therefore seems that the title needs to be more specific so that it does not mislead readers. The authors explicitly state on line 375 that 'TRPy is not involved in sensing D-glucose'. The last sentence of the manuscript should also perhaps state that TRPy is functioning in the neurons that are required for taste-independent food-selection, that it functions in the regulation of.</p><p>I also thought the authors could make a better job of fully explaining where things make sense with respect to a role in DH44 neurons and when not. For example, the authors show that the TRPy-GAL4 labels neurons in the crop and they then go on to show phenotypes in the crop. However, they state/find that these phenotypes can be rescued with DH44 neuron expression. This confused me and I am left wondering what the innervation of the GAL4 in the crop means? Is this DH44 neurons? Or are they as the title implies, only in the brain? How specific is the DH44-GAL4 expression to the brain?</p><p>The authors show that the TRPy-GAL4 expresses in many places in the brain but their study mostly focuses on the DH44 neuron expression. How sure are they that the GAl4 expression fully recapitulates the native expression? I think it would be helpful to mention this and also to comment in more detail on where else the GAL4 expresses. It is notable that defecation is TRPy dependent but not rescued with DH44 or dilp2-GAL4 expression. Is that a brain phenomenon too?</p><p>The physiological effects described in Figure 2 are very interesting and show a clear increased activity in the mutant. The authors provide a plausible explanation for this but they don't show if it has any consequence on release from the DH44 neurons. Would this be possible? Maybe they should at least mention if so?</p><p>Also, the authors show the peak amplitude is increased in TRPy mutants. Is it correct that the oscillations that follow the initial rise are actually dampened? Is that meaningful, or merely a property of the reporter?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic></p><p>In this study, Dhakal and colleagues studied the role of Transient receptor potential (TRP) genes in taste-independent nutritional choices in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The authors report that TRPgamma expression is required for the ability of (starved) flies to select metabolizable D-Glucose over non-metabolizable yet sweet L-Glucose. Importantly, the authors determined that TRPgamma is expressed in Dh44 neurons, which are known to control taste-independent choices in flies; in fact rescuing TRPgamma expression in Dh44+ neurons was sufficient to induce D-Glucose preferences. The authors do also show that TRPgamma is in addition involved in a number of metabolic and digestive processes.</p><p>This is an excellent study that greatly advances our understanding of taste-independent preferences. Crucially, the study points to TRP channels as potential regulators of nutrient preferences in mammals, as TRP channels are highly conserved across species. The experiments were all well designed and executed, as well as clearly described.</p><p>I do have however the following observations. First, it was not mentioned whether the motor control of mouth parts is preserved in TRPgamma mutants. Given that TRPgamma was previosuly shown to be involved in motor control, and in the present study is shown to affect movement of digestive parts, comments from authors are needed to clarify this issue.</p><p>One other interesting aspect of the study is that TRPgamma appears to be essential for regulating tissue sugar levels (l. 192). This may imply that the reinforcement from that is taste-independent may depend on the organism's ability to metabolize D-Glucose. This idea seems to have some support from mammalian studies (e.g. J Neurosci. 2010 Jun 9;30(23):8012-23) and would therefore be interesting to know whether the authors believe similar processes occur in flies.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your revised article <italic>Drosophila</italic> TRPgamma is required in neuroendocrine cells for post-ingestive food selection&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 of the initial peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers have been quite disappointed by your response to their comments and they are insisting that two critical experiments are required to make the paper strong enough to be published in <italic>eLife</italic>. I must add that it is quite unusual to send back revised papers to reviewers and even more unusual to request more experiments after the second round of reviews. However, although the reviewers found the paper to be potentially of significant interest, their main concern was that the manuscript does not have functional experiments supporting your hypothesis. They also thought that critical experiments were missing and needed to be done, as was spelled out in the initial evaluation. Although you did perform the RNAi experiment, the DH44 secretion experiment and the calcium imaging at a higher concentration remain to be done. These experiments do not require additional tools or materials, you have done the calcium imaging already and you have the antibodies. In particular, there is no basis of evidence that 2.5mM is the optimum concentration to use or that it is even physiological: Therefore the phenotype may not be present or be different at other concentrations.</p><p>Of course, COVID made these experiments more difficult to perform but hopefully, things are partially reopening and the two critical experiments requested do not require new setup. I am therefore ready to grant you enough time to do these experiments and allow you to be in the best position to get this paper published.</p><p>As explained by Reviewer #1, It will also be important to clarify your interpretation of your calcium imaging results. It is likely that when a high conductance Trp cation channel is removed, the membrane potential will go down by maybe -20mV, which might slightly affect the electrical driving force for Ca++, but this is going to be a small effect on Ca++ since the overall drive for Ca++ is the concentration gradient.</p><p>I hope that you will be able to do these two fairly simple experiments in order to satisfy the reviewers.<italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors addressed most of the concerns and issues raised by me and other reviewers, but it is still unclear to me how a mutation in TRPgamma (a proposed leak channel), which results in hyperpolarization, would &quot;increase the driving force for Ca++ entry following glucose-dependent activation of another Ca++ permeable channel that remains to be identified.&quot; As the authors indicated, a knockout of TRPC5 in POMC neurons indeed eliminated leptin-induced depolarization when Gao et al., conducted whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. Contrary to the authors' inference, however, these POMC neurons without TRPC5 do not have increased levels of intracellular Ca++ following leptin treatment.</p><p>The authors did not perform whole-cell recordings on DH44 neurons in which TRPgamma is knocked out, but I would be very surprised if DH44 neurons without TRPgamma are not depolarized at all in response to glucose treatment. How would glucose-dependent activation of a Ca++ permeable channel be able to endow the driving force for Ca++ entry? Inhibition of the key glucose metabolic pathway in DH44 neurons through pharmacological or mutational manipulations resulted in elimination of glucose-evoked activation of DH44 neuron. Do the authors postulate that such a Ca++ channel in DH44 neurons becomes active when TRPgamma is knocked down? I am confused….</p><p>There is a precedent where hyperpolarization in pancreatic α cells results in an increase in calcium levels, which leads to glucagon secretion. This hypothesis, however, is without controversy. This manuscript will be benefited enormously if the authors could carry out a physiology experiment to demonstrate the requirement of TRPgamma for the glucose-evoked stimulation of DH44 cells, or at least provide detailed explanations of how hyperpolarization increases intracellular calcium levels in DH44 cells before I become comfortable in recommending <italic>eLife</italic> to publish this work.<italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>I appreciate the authors' edits and inclusions. However, they did not address the essential experiments with the exception of the RNAi one. The DH44 secretion experiment and the calcium imaging at a higher concentration need to be done. These experiments do not require additional tools or materials, the authors have done the calcium imaging already and they have the antibodies. In particular, there is not basis of evidence that 2.5mM is the optimum concentration to use or that it is even physiological; thus the phenotype may not be present or be different at higher concentrations.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56726.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is clear that the discovery of a role of TRPγ in the Glucose sensing pathway is likely of significance importance, and in this regard, the reviewers agreed that the work could lead to important conclusions eventually applicable to mammals.</p><p>However, there were a number of difficulties with the manuscript that dampened the enthusiasm of the reviewers.</p><p>I will try to present briefly the result of the discussion, but of course these points are presented in detail in the individual reviews.</p><p>I would still like to emphasize that the editors and reviewers consider that this work could be of high significance if the points below could be addressed, but certainly this would require additional work that would do well beyond the two months allocated for a revised version for eLife, of course accounting for the fact that we are all banned from the lab and this will likely last for another few weeks/months.</p><p>– The major issue with the paper is the fact that the reviewers do not understand the role played by a Trp channel in sensing Glucose. You were careful to say that TRPγ was 'involved' in the circuit but most readers will assume that this involvement is in Glucose sensing. However, the reviewers pointed to the fact that Calcium imaging in mutant DH44 cells indicates that they retain their ability to respond to this sugar. If a Trp channel is not a sensor, what does it do in DH44 cells? is it regulated or is it simply a leak channel with no regulatory function, which would be of lesser interest</p></disp-quote><p>We modified the Discussion (pages 17-18), and</p><p>“propose that TRPγ, has two functions reminiscent of the dual roles of a related mammalian TRPC channel (TRPC5), which is important for the regulation of feeding and glucose homeostasis (Gao et al., 2017; Qiu et al., 2010; Qiu et al., 2018). TRPC5 is activated in POMC neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus following stimulation of the leptin receptor, and loss of mouse TRPC5 reduces leptin-induced depolarization (Gao et al., 2017; Qiu et al., 2010; Qiu et al., 2018). Mutation of TRPC5 also causes hyperpolarization of POMC neurons (Gao et al., 2017), suggesting that at least a subset of the TRPC5 pool of channels is transiently open in the absence of leptin stimulation, thereby contributing to a small leak conductance. Similar to TRPC5, we propose that TRPγ is activated in Dh44 neurons downstream of a pathway that is initiated by a glucose receptor. In addition, we suggest that a proportion of the TRPγ pool contributes to a leak conductance. Consistent with latter possibility, our laboratory as well as an independent group have shown that expression of TRPγ in vitro leads to a low level of constitutive activity (Akitake et al., 2015; Jörs et al., 2006; Xu et al., 2000), which could in principle contribute to a leak conductance. Moreover, the increased glucose-induced GCaMP6s fluorescence in Dh44 neurons in the <italic>trpγ</italic> mutant could result from hyperpolarization, which based on the Nernst equation, would increase the driving force for ca<sup>2+</sup> entry following glucose-dependent activation of another ca<sup>2+</sup> permeable channel that remains to be identified.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– You describe multiple roles of the channel and the reviewers could not figure out your model as to how 'Trpγ coordinates feeding with the metabolic state'. These roles need to be better integrated to obtain a coherent model.</p></disp-quote><p>We hope the new model that we articulate above adds clarity to the point that the requirement for TRPγ in DH44 neurons provides a potential link between the coordination of feeding and the metabolic state. As described on pages 19 to 20, we found that “there were large and highly significant decreases in intracellular sugar concentrations in both sated and starved flies. We suggest that a key deficit in <italic>trpγ</italic> mutants is glucose uptake. However, glucose uptake has not been assayed in flies, and we were also unable to develop such measurements. Nevertheless, in support of the concept that there is a defect in glucose uptake, we found that the glycogen stores were also diminished in <italic>trpγ</italic> mutants. In mammals, there is evidence that taste-independent sugar preference is influenced by glucose metabolism (Ren et al., 2010). Thus, it is intriguing to speculate that the deficit in D-glucose selection in <italic>trpγ</italic> mutants is due in part to impairment in metabolism of D-glucose.</p><p>Our findings that <italic>trpγ</italic> function is rescued by expressing the wild-type transgene in <italic>Dh44</italic> neurons, and <italic>Dh44</italic> mutant flies exhibited the same deficits in tissue sugar and glycogen levels raise the possibility that TRPγ promotes the release of DH44, which in turn increases glucose uptake. Consistent with this proposal, corticotropin-releasing hormone, which is the mammalian homolog of DH44, increases glucose uptake in a variety of cell types (Hogg et al., 2018; Lu et al., 2018). We suggest that TRPγ is critical for establishing the glycogen stores that enable the animals to survive under starvation conditions. In support of this latter idea, survival of the <italic>trpγ</italic>mutant flies under starvation conditions is significantly shorter than in control animals.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, the role the receptor in the mouthparts or sensory organs needs to be addressed to make sure that the phenotype is that of DH44 cells (even though you can rescue with DH44 driver, the phenotype can be confounded by these other functions).</p></disp-quote><p>We added electrophysiological and behavioral data (pages 6-7) indicating that mutation of <italic>trpγ</italic> does not impact on peripheral sensation of glucose.</p><p>“Using tip recordings on sugar-activated L6 sensilla, we found that the <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic> mutants exhibited similar frequencies of D-glucose- and L-glucose-induced action potentials as control flies (<italic>Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>).

The authors further claimed that in Trpγ mutants, greater amounts of food were consumed, the size of crop and the rate of crop contraction were increased, and the rate of defecation was enhanced. The authors proposed without experimental evidence that Trpγ is a calcium-permeable leak channel and its mutation caused hyperpolarization of DH44 neuronal activity. However, it is not clear to me how a mutation in a calcium- permeable leak channel causing hyperpolarization could result in an increase in calcium influx in response to glucose application. Furthermore, if the observed phenotypes are indeed attributed to the increased intracellular calcium levels, it is not clear how Trpγ mutant flies could have such a defect in the two-choice assay. The authors claimed that silencing of DH44 neurons increased food intake, but Trpγ mutant flies, in which the intracellular calcium levels had been increased, consumed more food (which was rescued by DH44-Gal4; UAS-Trpγ ). This is inconsistent and there are many inconsistencies through the manuscript. The authors did a good job in testing a hypothesis that a TRP channel is involved in post-ingestive food selection, but need to come up with a more unifying proposal of how Trpγ functions in regulating food intake.</p></disp-quote><p>These main issues raised by reviewer #1 are addressed in my preceding responses to the “Consensus reviewer comments.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other issues are indicated below.</p><p>1.

In general the paper is well put together and the experiments seem solid. I have a few suggestions for the authors.</p><p>My main comment relates to the general message in relation to the experiments. The title implies that TRPy might actually be part of the mechanism of food selection but if I follow the work clearly, it seems that actually in most cases the authors conclude that TRPy is required for the proper function of DH44 neurons. It therefore seems that the title needs to be more specific so that it does not mislead readers.</p></disp-quote><p>We changed the title to, “<italic>Drosophila</italic> TRPγ is required in neuroendocrine cells for post-ingestive food selection.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors explicitly state on line 375 that 'TRPy is not involved in sensing D-glucose'.

For example, the authors show that the TRPy-GAL4 labels neurons in the crop and they then go on to show phenotypes in the crop. However, they state/find that these phenotypes can be rescued with DH44 neuron expression. This confused me and I am left wondering what the innervation of the GAL4 in the crop means? Is this DH44 neurons? Or are they as the title implies, only in the brain? How specific is the DH44-GAL4 expression to the brain?</p></disp-quote><p>Dh44 neurons extend processes from the π that label the gut and crop (Dus et al., 2015). Similarly, we found that the <italic>trpγ</italic> reporter stained neuronal varicosities in the epithelium of the crop and intestine (<italic>Figure 4A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>). Due to co-expression of <italic>trpγ</italic> with Dh44 in the PI, these processes are likely to also extend from the PI. We added this point to page 11.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors show that the TRPy-GAL4 expresses in many places in the brain but their study mostly focuses on the DH44 neuron expression. How sure are they that the GAl4 expression fully recapitulates the native expression? I think it would be helpful to mention this and also to comment in more detail on where else the GAL4 expresses. It is notable that defecation is TRPy dependent but not rescued with DH44 or dilp2-GAL4 expression. Is that a brain phenomenon too?</p></disp-quote><p>To address our level of confidence in the <italic>trpγ</italic> reporter expression pattern, we added the following (page 9),</p><p>“The rescue results, and the ability to phenocopy the <italic>trpγ</italic> deficit by RNAi using the <italic>Dh44-GAL4</italic> support our conclusion that <italic>trpγ</italic> is required and sufficient in Dh44 neurons for proper selection of nutritive D-glucose in hungry flies. Additional support for this conclusion is our finding that the <italic>trpγ</italic> reporter is expressed in Dh44 neurons. The validity of <italic>trpγ</italic> expression in Dh44 neurons is also supported by the design of the <italic>GAL4</italic> driver, which is inserted precisely at the site of the initiation codon (Akitake et al., 2015).

Furthermore, describing the expression pattern outside of the Dh44 neurons is not essential for our conclusion that TRPγ functions in these neuroendocrine cells. Lastly, the CNS can impact on defecation, and we now mention this point (page 16):</p><p>“While the relevant neurons remain to be identified, neurons have been described that impact on defecation, some of which are in the central nervous system (Cognigni et al., 2011).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The physiological effects described in Figure 2 are very interesting and show a clear increased activity in the mutant. The authors provide a plausible explanation for this but they don't show if it has any consequence on release from the DH44 neurons. Would this be possible? Maybe they should at least mention if so?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to the second consensus comment from the reviewers. The relevant section is repeated here and appears in the main text (page 20).</p><p>“….<italic>trpγ</italic> function is rescued by expressing the wild-type transgene in <italic>Dh44</italic> neurons, and <italic>Dh44</italic> mutant flies exhibited the same deficits in tissue sugar and glycogen levels.

The authors report that TRPgamma expression is required for the ability of (starved) flies to select metabolizable D-Glucose over non-metabolizable yet sweet L-Glucose. Importantly, the authors determined that TRPgamma is expressed in Dh44 neurons, which are known to control taste-independent choices in flies; in fact rescuing TRPgamma expression in Dh44+ neurons was sufficient to induce D-Glucose preferences. The authors do also show that TRPgamma is in addition involved in a number of metabolic and digestive processes.</p><p>This is an excellent study that greatly advances our understanding of taste-independent preferences. Crucially, the study points to TRP channels as potential regulators of nutrient preferences in mammals, as TRP channels are highly conserved across species. The experiments were all well designed and executed, as well as clearly described.</p><p>I do have however the following observations. First, it was not mentioned whether the motor control of mouth parts is preserved in TRPgamma mutants. Given that TRPgamma was previosuly shown to be involved in motor control, and in the present study is shown to affect movement of digestive parts, comments from authors are needed to clarify this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the following data regarding proboscis extension, which we describe on page 7,</p><p>“the time to full extension of the proboscis was similar between the <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant and the control, and we did not detect any obvious motor deficit in proboscis extension by the <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic> mutants (<italic>Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</italic>; <italic>video 1</italic> and <italic>2</italic>).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One other interesting aspect of the study is that TRPgamma appears to be essential for regulating tissue sugar levels (l. 192). This may imply that the reinforcement from that is taste-independent may depend on the organism's ability to metabolize D-Glucose. This idea seems to have some support from mammalian studies (e.g. J Neurosci. 2010 Jun 9;30(23):8012-23) and would therefore be interesting to know whether the authors believe similar processes occur in flies.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting possibility. We added the following suggestion to the Discussion (page 19): “In mammals, there is evidence that taste-independent sugar preference is influenced by glucose metabolism (Ren et al., 2010). Thus, it is intriguing to speculate that the deficit in D-glucose selection in <italic>trpγ</italic> mutants is due in part to impairment in metabolism of D-glucose.”</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The authors addressed most of the concerns and issues raised by me and other reviewers, but it is still unclear to me how a mutation in TRPgamma (a proposed leak channel), which results in hyperpolarization, would &quot;increase the driving force for Ca++ entry following glucose-dependent activation of another Ca++ permeable channel that remains to be identified.&quot; As the authors indicated, a knockout of TRPC5 in POMC neurons indeed eliminated leptin-induced depolarization when Gao et al., conducted whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. Contrary to the authors' inference, however, these POMC neurons without TRPC5 do not have increased levels of intracellular Ca++ following leptin treatment.</p><p>The authors did not perform whole-cell recordings on DH44 neurons in which TRPgamma is knocked out, but I would be very surprised if DH44 neurons without TRPgamma are not depolarized at all in response to glucose treatment. How would glucose-dependent activation of a Ca++ permeable channel be able to endow the driving force for Ca++ entry? Inhibition of the key glucose metabolic pathway in DH44 neurons through pharmacological or mutational manipulations resulted in elimination of glucose-evoked activation of DH44 neuron. Do the authors postulate that such a Ca++ channel in DH44 neurons becomes active when TRPgamma is knocked down? I am confused….</p><p>There is a precedent where hyperpolarization in pancreatic α cells results in an increase in calcium levels, which leads to glucagon secretion. This hypothesis, however, is without controversy. This manuscript will be benefited enormously if the authors could carry out a physiology experiment to demonstrate the requirement of TRPgamma for the glucose-evoked stimulation of DH44 cells, or at least provide detailed explanations of how hyperpolarization increases intracellular calcium levels in DH44 cells before I become comfortable in recommending eLife to publish this work.</p></disp-quote><p>Monitoring changes in ca<sup>2+</sup> signals is a useful but imperfect proxy for neuronal activation since it is possible to observe a rise in ca<sup>2+</sup> that is not associated with an increase in neuronal activity. Therefore, we have now added experiments using a genetically-encoded voltage indicator (GEVI), ASAP2s, in conjunction with fast twophoton imaging to record dynamic, rapid changes in voltages. To conduct these experiments, we expressed <italic>UAS-ASAP2s</italic> under the control of the <italic>Dh44-GAL4</italic> in both control and <italic>trp</italic>g<italic><sup>1</sup></italic>. The results of these experiments resulted in revision of our previous model. We found that when we bathed the brains in a glucose-free bath, the basal voltage signals were significantly higher in <italic>Dh44</italic> neuroendocrine cells from the <italic>trp</italic>g<italic><sup>1</sup></italic> mutant than from control DH44 neurons (<italic>Figure 3A)</italic>. Furthermore, when we switched to a ca<sup>2+</sup>-free buffer, the control <italic>Dh44</italic> cells displayed elevated ASAP2s signals similar to the levels produced in <italic>trp</italic>g<italic><sup>1</sup></italic> in a ca<sup>2+</sup>-containing buffer (<italic>Figure 3A)</italic>. These data indicate that ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is essential to maintain a low, basal level of neuronal activity.</p><p>Next, we measured the voltage responses by DH44 neurons in response to glucose. Stimulation of control cells with 20 mM D-glucose increased the peak amplitude 2.3fold relative to the buffer only (<italic>Figure 3B and D</italic>). However, <italic>trp</italic>g<italic><sup>1</sup></italic> DH44 neurons exposed to D-glucose, displayed a peak ASAP2s amplitude significantly larger than the control (<italic>Figure 3B, D</italic> and, <italic>F</italic>). In contrast, the non-nutritive L-glucose had no effect on the ASAP2s signal in DH44 neurons from either the control or <italic>trp</italic>g<italic><sup>1</sup></italic> (<italic>Figure 3B</italic>). Furthermore, the peak amplitude in <italic>trp</italic>g<italic><sup>1</sup></italic> was similar to the responses of the control and <italic>trp</italic>g<italic><sup>1</sup></italic> under ca<sup>2+</sup> free conditions (<italic>Figure 3B</italic>, <italic>3G</italic>). However, the response latencies exhibited by control and <italic>trp</italic>g<italic><sup>1</sup></italic> cells exposed to a ca<sup>2+</sup>-containing buffer or ca<sup>2+</sup>-free buffer were not significantly different (<italic>Figure 3C</italic>).</p><p>Altogether, these data indicate that ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through the TRPg channel serves to attenuate rather than increase basal and glucose-stimulated activity of DH44 neurons. Our findings with the GEVI, do not support the previous model suggesting that DH44 neurons in the <italic>trp</italic>g mutant are hyperpolarized. Rather, we propose that similar to TRPC4 in lateral septal neurons (Tian et al., 2014), TRPg functions in DH44 neurons to hold these neurons in an afterdepolarization state, reducing the rate of firing. We suggest that this state underlies the higher peak ASAP2s signal (increased firing rate) and higher baseline activity in <italic>trp</italic>g mutant <italic>Dh44</italic> neurons. We also propose that the TRPg-dependent after depolarization requires extracellular ca<sup>2+</sup>, as is the case for TRPC4. Consistent with this idea, when we measured the ASAP2 signal in control DH44 neurons bathed in a ca<sup>2+</sup>-free buffer, the ASAP2 signals increased, similar to what we observed in the <italic>trp</italic>g mutants bathed in a ca<sup>2+</sup>containing bath. At the physiological level, this would result in the release of excessive DH44, and deplete the neuropeptide stores in these neurons, thereby rendering them unable to respond to a continuous high level of nutrients in the hemolymph. The new data with ASAP2 and the interpretation of the finding are presented in the Results (<italic>Figure 3</italic>) and the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>I appreciate the authors' edits and inclusions.
