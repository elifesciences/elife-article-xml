Aerobic exercise benefits brain function and may promote cognitive health in older adults. However, underlying biological mechanisms across cerebral gray and white matter are poorly understood. Selective vulnerability of the white matter to small vessel disease and a link between white matter health and cognitive function suggests a potential role for responses in deep cerebral microcirculation. Here, we tested whether aerobic exercise modulates cerebral microcirculatory changes induced by aging. To this end, we carried out a comprehensive quantitative examination of changes in cerebral microvascular physiology in cortical gray and subcortical white matter in mice (3–6 vs. 19–21 months old), and asked whether and how exercise may rescue age-induced deficits. In the sedentary group, aging caused a more severe decline in cerebral microvascular perfusion and oxygenation in deep (infragranular) cortical layers and subcortical white matter compared with superficial (supragranular) cortical layers. Five months of voluntary aerobic exercise partly renormalized microvascular perfusion and oxygenation in aged mice in a depth-dependent manner, and brought these spatial distributions closer to those of young adult sedentary mice. These microcirculatory effects were accompanied by an improvement in cognitive function. Our work demonstrates the selective vulnerability of the deep cortex and subcortical white matter to aging-induced decline in microcirculation, as well as the responsiveness of these regions to aerobic exercise.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>exercise</kwd><kwd>cerebral microcirculation</kwd><kwd>cerebral oxygenation</kwd><kwd>white matter</kwd><kwd>two-photon microscopy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RF1NS121095</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sakadžić</surname><given-names>Sava</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS115401</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sakadžić</surname><given-names>Sava</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U24EB028941</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sakadžić</surname><given-names>Sava</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U19NS123717</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Devor</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01HL133362</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sakadžić</surname><given-names>Sava</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00MH120053</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Şencan-Eğilmez</surname><given-names>Ikbal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG055413</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ran</surname><given-names>Chongzhao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Rappaport Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lo</surname><given-names>Eng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cerebral subcortical microcirculation is more vulnerable to aging-induced changes and more responsive to exercise than cortical microcirculation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The cerebral white matter is significantly affected by aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cees De Groot et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Leeuw et al., 2001</xref>). Previous work suggests that, in comparison with superficial gray matter, subcortical white matter has greater tissue loss due to aging and is more susceptible to hypoperfusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gunning-Dixon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hase et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, white matter lesions might impair cognitive function more than gray matter lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reber et al., 2021</xref>), underscoring the importance of understanding the biological mechanisms of aging-related white matter degeneration for targeted interventions.</p><p>Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) refers to a range of pathological processes affecting small arterioles, capillaries, and venules supplying the white matter and deep structures of the brain. CSVD is a common cause of stroke and an important contributor to age-related cognitive decline and dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pantoni, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith and Markus, 2020</xref>). Most CSVD-related strokes affect subcortical white and deep gray matter. In addition, there is increased awareness of the role of CSVD in accelerating the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), with some studies suggesting the possibility that white matter changes are the starting point of AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Defrancesco et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Esiri et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Radanovic et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Snowdon et al., 1997</xref>). Despite this growing awareness, our mechanistic understanding of aging-related changes in microcirculation as a function of depth in cortex and underlying white matter is incomplete.</p><p>Aerobic exercise is a promising strategy to improve neurocognitive function in aging and reduce the risk of age-related neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barnes et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yaffe et al., 2001</xref>). Most studies have thus far focused on exercise-responsive molecules that could lead to improvement of neural physiology and, thereby, cognitive performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Miguel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Islam et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Valenzuela et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang and Holsinger, 2018</xref>). Yet, how exercise may exert beneficial effects on vascular contributions to brain aging remain to be fully understood. In particular, it is unclear how exercise normalizes cerebral microcirculation, and whether there are differential effect across brain regions, including the gray and white matter.</p><p>In this study, we compared young (3–6 months old) versus old (19–21 months old) mice to assess the effects of normal aging, and then asked whether 5 months of voluntary aerobic exercise can alter or rescue brain microcirculation in old 20-month-old mice. Cerebral microvascular perfusion and oxygenation in the cortex and subcortical white matter were quantified with two-photon microscopy (2PM) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) in awake mice.</p><p>Our results showed age-related declines in capillary red-blood-cell (RBC) flux and capillary oxygen partial pressure (pO<sub>2</sub>) in the deep cortical layers and subcortical white matter, while voluntary exercise improved these measures, including the cerebral blood flow (CBF) in cortical ascending venules. Interestingly, the regions that experienced the highest decline were also the ones that benefited the most from the exercise. These microcirculatory effects were accompanied by an improvement in cognitive function. Our results may provide insights into how sedentary aging and aerobic exercise affect cerebral microvascular physiology and particularly emphasize the physiologic importance of effects in the deep cortex and subcortical white matter.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Exercise mitigates age-related decline of capillary RBC flux and induces capillary flow homogenization in the subcortical white matter</title><p>To examine the impact of aging on cortical and subcortical microcirculation, we examined the spatial distribution of capillary RBC flux across cortical and subcortical regions in aged mice and compared the result with measurements from awake C57BL/6N female mice of younger age (4 months old).</p><p>Capillary RBC flux measurements were conducted using 2PM imaging of RBC-induced shadows within blood plasma labeled by the Alexa-680, allowing the deep imaging into the subcortical white matter down to a depth of ~1.1 mm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2019</xref>). The mean capillary RBC flux in aged sedentary mice was significantly lower than that in young sedentary mice in the white matter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). No change was observed in cortical layers II/III and IV. Importantly, while in young sedentary mice, the mean white matter RBC flux tended to be slightly higher than the gray matter RBC flux, the relationship appeared reversed in aged sedentary mice, where mean RBC flux in the white matter strongly tended to be lower than RBC flux in the gray matter. This suggests that the microcirculation in the white matter is affected more than microcirculation in the gray matter by age-related changes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Aging- and exercise-induced alterations in cerebral microcirculation.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Capillary red-blood-cell (RBC) flux across cortical layers II/III and IV, and subcortical white matter in young sedentary, aged sedentary, and aged exercise groups.

No significant difference in the RBC line-density between aged sedentary and aged exercise groups was found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).

In aged sedentary mice, the capillary RBC flux in the subcortical white matter tended to be lower than that in the gray matter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Young sedentary mice showed the opposite trend, consistent with our previous finding in anesthetized young adult mice (3–5 months old) showing a higher capillary RBC flux in the subcortical white matter compared to the gray matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Importantly, we observed a large discrepancy in the capillary RBC flux between young and aged sedentary mice in the white matter with preserved capillary RBC flux in the superficial gray matter. Cerebral white matter is known to be more susceptible to hypoperfusion compared to the gray matter, potentially because it is located further downstream with respect to the arterial blood supply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gunning-Dixon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Markus et al., 2000</xref>). White matter vulnerability to ischemic injury increases with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baltan et al., 2008</xref>), and white matter lesions and lacunar infarcts are common in elderly people with CSVD and hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Breteler et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">van Swieten et al., 1991</xref>). The vulnerability of white matter to such pathological conditions could be related to our observation of a severe decrease in blood flow in the white matter during normal aging.</p><p>Five months of exercise restored the spatial distribution trend of capillary RBC flux close to its distribution in the young sedentary mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Exercise was associated with a decreased CV of the capillary RBC flux in subcortical white matter, suggesting more homogeneous microvascular blood flow in that region that could potentially facilitate improved oxygen delivery to tissue. Increased capillary perfusion in the white matter was accompanied by increased blood flow in ascending venules, as measured by Doppler OCT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d, e</xref>). In contrast to smaller ascending venules having their branches being distributed mostly over the upper cortical layers, large venules likely extend further to subcortical white matter where the increased capillary perfusion was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Duvernoy et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kirst et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Xiong et al., 2017</xref>). Venules smaller than 20 μm in diameter were excluded from analysis as the small venules tend to have slower flow and may have smaller absolute changes in the blood flow compared to larger venules with higher flow and thus the flow change may not be easily distinguishable due to the relatively low precision of the speed measurement based on Doppler OCT (±0.7 mm/s, see Spectral-domain OCT for more details) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Santisakultarm et al., 2012</xref>). The increased venous flow in the aged exercise group could be associated with an increased arterial flow, possibly affected by exercise-induced changes in heart strength, brain blood flow regulation, and vascular anatomy. However, flow measurement in arterioles could not be performed with our OCT setup because the flow in many diving arterioles exceeded the maximum measurable limit of the flow measurement by Doppler OCT.</p><p>Previous studies in mice reported conflicting results regarding the effects of exercise on cortical microcirculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dorr et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Falkenhain et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lu et al., 2020</xref>). However, these observations have been limited to the blood flow in gray matter, which was shown in this study to be less responsive to exercise than that in deeper brain regions. Human MRI data acquired after short-term (1 week) exercise showed that exercise induced a selective increase in hippocampal CBF with no or negligible changes in the gray matter CBF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Steventon et al., 2021</xref>). Our findings suggest that cerebral subcortical microcirculation is more responsive to both age-related and exercise-induced changes than cortical microcirculation.</p><p>The change in cortical microvascular oxygenation was also depth dependent. In aged sedentary mice, the mean capillary pO<sub>2</sub> increased from layer I to II/III and reached a plateau in layer II/III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a, b</xref>). A different trend was observed in young sedentary mice, which showed a gradual increase in the mean capillary pO<sub>2</sub> from layer I to IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast to aged sedentary controls, mice from the aged exercise group showed a similar trend to young sedentary mice, with a pronounced increase in the mean capillary pO<sub>2</sub> in layer IV among all assessed cortical layers. In the mouse somatosensory cortex, layer IV exhibits the highest neuronal and capillary densities and the strongest staining for the cytochrome c oxidase, potentially implying the highest oxidative demand during activation and/or at rest throughout all cortical layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blinder et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lefort et al., 2009</xref>). In an immunohistochemical study performed using an anti-Glut-1 antibody, high plaque load and decreased blood vessel density were observed, particularly in layer IV of the somatosensory cortex in aged, 18-month-old transgenic AD mice, while younger AD mice did not demonstrate any difference compared to the wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kuznetsova and Schliebs, 2013</xref>). The decrease in capillary mean pO<sub>2</sub> in layer IV in aged sedentary mice could be associated with the larger mismatch in the oxygen delivery and consumption compared with the more superficial cortical layers. However, due to technical limitations, we did not assess the microvascular oxygenation in the deeper cortical layers and subcortical white matter. Because RBC flux exhibits the largest discrepancy between sedentary aged and young mice in the subcortical white matter, it is possible that intravascular pO<sub>2</sub> also exhibits the largest discrepancy in this brain region.</p><p>Voluntary exercise significantly improved microvascular oxygenation compared to sedentary controls, particularly in layer IV. Similar to our finding of capillary RBC flux improvement due to exercise mostly in the white matter, exercise differentially affected cortical intravascular oxygenation, with the largest increase in the deeper layers and restored the spatial distribution trend of capillary pO<sub>2</sub> across cortical layers close to its distribution in the young sedentary mice. However, since the difference in both the Hct level and RBC line-density between the two groups was not significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), factors other than increased Hct may be involved in the observed depth-dependent pO<sub>2</sub> increase in the gray matter. Interestingly, we found that the RBC line-density in both groups of aged mice was significantly higher in the subcortical white matter than in the gray matter. This was not observed in young adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2020</xref>). However, this finding is consistent with previous simulation results that showed higher Hct levels in deep-reaching penetrating arterioles compared to arterioles whose branches connect to the capillary bed closer to the surface due to the plasma skimming effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gould et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with the small effect of exercise on cerebral microcirculation and oxygenation in superficial cortical areas, we observed no change in the relative peak amplitude or the latency of stimulus-induced hemodynamic response with exercise, assessed with OISI at 570 nm, which emphasizes the intrinsic signal originating from cerebral blood volume changes in the superficial cortical layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Malonek et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tian et al., 2011</xref>). Young sedentary mice (7 months old) showed a significantly larger relative response amplitude than aged mice, consistent with the reduced cerebrovascular reactivity with age in healthy adults and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bálint et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barnes, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cai et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jessen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Seker et al., 2021</xref>). The baseline CBF can have a strong effect on the magnitude of the hemodynamic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buxton et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corfield et al., 2001</xref>). While no statistically significant difference in the mean capillary RBC flux in the gray matter was found between the aged sedentary and aged exercise groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), the aged exercise group had larger capillary density in the gray matter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>), suggesting that cortical blood perfusion was possibly also higher in the aged exercise group. This was further supported by significantly higher blood flow in ascending venules in the same group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d and e</xref>). Therefore, our data imply that with a similar level of the relative response amplitude between two groups, the aged exercise group potentially had a larger transient blood supply to the tissue during functional hyperemia.</p><p>Consistent with our findings, aging-associated decrease and exercise-induced increase in cerebral microvascular density have been observed across brain regions in both humans and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ding et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Morland et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Riddle et al., 2003</xref>). However, other studies showed no improvements in cerebral microvascular structure with regular exercise in the mouse sensorimotor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cudmore et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dorr et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Falkenhain et al., 2020</xref>). Exercise can affect the brain through different mechanisms across different brain regions at various points in the lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stillman et al., 2020</xref>). Although it is unclear whether the difference in age or brain region (or both) contributed to the inconsistent results with some of the previous observations, we found significant morphological changes in the microvascular morphometric parameters due to chronic exercise in the somatosensory cortex of 20-month-old mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Based on the observed changes in the microvascular RBC flux and pO<sub>2</sub>, we anticipate that an even greater discrepancy in the capillary density between the two groups of mice may be observed in deeper cortical layers and subcortical white matter. It is compelling to hypothesize that higher microvascular density is one of the major contributors to the larger microvascular perfusion and oxygenation observed in mice from the aged exercise group. However, it is not clear whether the larger capillary density in the aged exercise group is mostly due to increased angiogenesis or decreased pruning of the capillaries in comparison with the aged sedentary group. In addition, if increased angiogenesis is present in the aged exercise group, it will be important to better understand the contribution of the new capillaries to oxygen delivery to tissue.</p><p>Increased cerebral perfusion and oxygenation with exercise were accompanied by improved spatial short-term memory function, as evaluated by NORT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). The perirhinal cortex plays an important role in object recognition memory. It receives sensory inputs from its neighboring sensory cortices, such as the somatosensory cortex, where we found significant improvements in vascular function and structure due to exercise in aged mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antunes and Biala, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cohen and Stackman Jr., 2015</xref>). The NORT results depend on the exploration time in the test phase, which is related to the age-dependent decay of the novel object preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Traschütz et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, choosing an adequate time interval to calculate the DI is important to reliably detect novel object recognition, especially in aged mice. In our analysis, the DI score was calculated at four different time intervals: 1, 2, 3, and 5 min. The results showed an increased DI score in running mice compared to aged sedentary mice across all time intervals, which was also positively correlated with both the average and total running distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). In contrast, we did not observe an increase in spontaneous alterations between the arms of the Y-maze (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). Consistent with our findings, microcirculatory changes in the white matter have been associated with recognition memory function evaluated by NORT in rodents, while no associations were found with spatial memory function assessed with Y-maze test in the same studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blasi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choi et al., 2015</xref>). However, we do not rule out the possibility that exercise may improve spatial memory function and suggest further investigation to evaluate different aspects of spatial memory function by applying other behavioral tests (e.g., Morris water maze test). As previously shown in several studies in mouse models of AD, each memory task depends on a variety of brain regions that can be differentially affected by exercise, which could also produce inconsistent results between different memory tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kraeuter et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Winters et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>A recent study reported a positive correlation between the average daily running distance and cerebral tissue oxygenation in 6-month-old mice after three months of exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lu et al., 2020</xref>). While mice in our aged exercise group had significantly higher white matter capillary RBC flux than aged sedentary mice, the mean capillary RBC flux in the white matter was negatively correlated with the average daily running distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Although white matter capillary density was not assessed in this study, lower capillary RBC flux in the white matter could potentially be accompanied with higher capillary density. In this case, capillary RBC flux in the white matter can decrease but cerebral tissue oxygenation in this region can still increase in response to chronic exercise. This result also may be due to a non-proportional relationship between exercise and brain function, which could decrease after reaching the optimal intensity of exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Khakroo Abkenar et al., 2019</xref>). It is possible that 5 months of unrestricted exercise led some (or all) animals to over-exercise, which may adversely affect subcortical capillary blood flow and prevent achieving the maximum benefits of exercise on the microcirculation. Among different optical measurements performed in this study, only the capillary RBC flux in subcortical white matter tended to correlate with the running activity while no correlations were found between the parameters measured in cortical gray matter (e.g., venous flow, capillary pO<sub>2</sub>, cortical hemodynamic response, and capillary density) and the average running distance. This could also be attributed to a higher responsiveness of subcortical white matter to exercise compared with the cortical gray matter. Correlations between the measured parameters and the total running distance were analyzed. Because of approximately the same number of days that all mice were running, total and average running distances share a common scaling factor (e.g., number of days) and show nearly identical correlations with all of the parameters measured (data not shown). The present study used female mice because the comparison with our previous studies in young adult female mice and prior data have shown that in comparison to male mice, female mice exhibit higher voluntary running activity that could potentially produce a greater effect on the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jones et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Konhilas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rosenfeld, 2017</xref>). However, the effect may vary in male mice as the animal sex could differentially affect the age-related and exercise-induced changes in cerebral microcirculation due to sex-related hormonal differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bisset et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McMullan et al., 2016</xref>). Although all the groups were subjected to the same housing conditions, isolated housing could be considered as a stressor that can influence the observed changes in the cerebral microcirculation and behavioral function. Aerobic exercise has been shown to enhance cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus regardless of housing condition in young and aged mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kannangara et al., 2011</xref>). Further investigation into the influence of environmental enrichment factors on the age-related and exercise-induced changes will help to identify the mechanisms that underlie these processes.</p><p>In the analysis of the capillary RBC flux and capillary pO<sub>2</sub>, all capillaries identified within the field of view (FOV) were selected and used for analysis without considering their branching orders. In future studies, analysis based on different types of vessels classified by branching order could potentially provide additional insight into capillary blood flow and oxygenation, as we previously showed different characteristics of capillaries with low branching orders located close to precapillary arterioles compared with higher-order capillaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, leveraging our multimodal optical imaging tools, we quantified the changes in microvascular function, structure, and sensory-evoked functional hyperemia in response to aging and voluntary exercise in 20-month-old mice. Our results indicate that cerebral microcirculation and oxygenation in deeper cortical layers and subcortical white matter are more susceptible to age-related degeneration, but they are surprisingly more responsive to voluntary aerobic exercise, which induces significant improvements in capillary density, RBC flux, and intracapillary pO<sub>2</sub> . Improvements in cerebrovascular function and structure are accompanied by rescue of cognitive function. These findings may help us to better understand the patterns and consequences of age-related decline of microcirculation at different cortical depths and subcortical white matter, and how the neurologic effects of aging may be ameliorated by aerobic exercise.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal preparation and experimental protocol</title><p>All animal surgical and experimental procedures were conducted following the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Massachusetts General Hospital Subcommittee on Research Animal Care (Protocol No. 2007N000050).

Following the procedures described in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2020</xref>), the fluorescence signal time course was segmented with a binary thresholding approach (red curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>) and RBC flux was calculated by counting the number of valleys in the segmented curve normalized by the acquisition time. The capillary RBC speed was defined as the average speed of the RBCs in the vessel (mm/s). Following our previously described procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2019</xref>), RBC speed for each RBC-passage event (valley) in the segmented curve was estimated as <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>v</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> is RBC diameter, assumed to be 6 μm, and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> is the width of the valley. For each capillary, the speed values estimated from each of the valleys in the segmented curve were averaged to obtain the mean RBC speed. The capillary RBC line-density measures the fraction of the capillary length occupied by RBCs, which is closely related to the capillary hematocrit. The capillary RBC line-density was calculated as the ratio between the combined time duration of all signal valleys to the total duration of the entire time course.</p><p>The variability in the RBC flux among capillaries, which is termed capillary flow heterogeneity, was quantified by calculating the CV of capillary RBC flux in cortical layers II/III–IV and subcortical white matter.

At each depth, two-dimensional raster scan of phosphorescence intensity was performed to acquire a survey image. Then, we manually selected the measurement locations inside all diving arterioles, surfacing venules, and capillary segments visually identified within the survey image. Next, the focus of excitation laser beam was parked at each selected segment to excite the Oxyphor 2P with a 10-μs-long excitation gate.

The microvascular stack was generated by repeatedly acquiring images with the axial steps of 1 μm up to a depth of 400 μm. In each animal, a smaller ROI (200 × 200µm<sup>2</sup>) was manually selected to cover the region containing mostly capillaries (e.g., capillary bed area). A 3D microvasculature corresponding to the selected ROI was segmented using a vessel segmentation algorithm, VIDA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tsai et al., 2009</xref>), and the number of capillary segments per volume (e.g., vessel segment density) and the average capillary segment length per volume (e.g., vessel segment length density) were calculated.

Ten volumes exhibiting minimal motion artifacts were selected and averaged to generate a single Doppler OCT volume.

The Doppler volume yields a three-dimensional map of the <italic>z</italic>-projection of RBC velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7f</xref>).

We used 3D angiograms acquired by 2PM (see Intravascular pO<sub>2</sub> imaging and calculation of SO<sub>2</sub> and depth-dependent OEF for more details) to estimate the diameter of the vessels, used for cross-correlation analysis between the flow and vessel diameter. The measured flow values in each vascular segment were averaged within the depth range of 50–100 μm. Flow data measured in diving arterioles were excluded from analysis due to their much higher flow compared to venular flow that often causes excessive phase wrapping and signal fading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koch et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>OISI imaging of hemodynamic response to functional activation</title><p>Two-dimensional CCD images were continuously acquired with a CCD camera for 18 s. Five seconds after the onset of image acquisition, a whisker stimulus was applied at 3 Hz for 2 s. A Picospritzer microinjection device (051-0500-900, Parker Hannifin Inc) was used to deliver air puffs (20 psi) for the stimulation of a whisker pad. A plastic air tube was aimed at the E1 whisker to deliver the air. A total of 20 stimulation trials were repeated with an inter-stimulus interval of 25 s. Among 20 trials, the data acquired during excessive animal motion (~10% of the measurements) were excluded from analysis based on a threshold criterion applied to the accelerometer recordings.

Briefly, mice were allowed to explore two identical objects in a testing arena for 5 min and returned to their home cage for 30 min. Mice were then moved back to the arena with one of the objects replaced with a novel object and allowed to explore the objects for 5 min. Behavioral performance was evaluated by estimating the DI. The DI was defined as exploration time of the novel object normalized by combined exploration time of both objects and was calculated during four different time intervals in each animal: during first 1, 2, 3, and 5 min of the object exploration.</p><p>Y-maze test was used to measure the willingness of animals to explore new environments and spatial working memory.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Daniel Henrion as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Christian Büchel as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Osama F Harraz (Reviewer #2); Robert H. Cudmore (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The use of female mice only should be justified in the manuscript. The authors should discuss the hormonal effect on blood flow.</p><p>2) Figure 3: see comments 3 to 5 by reviewer 2 and comments 1 to 10 by reviewer 3. All the points need to be clearly addressed and the manuscript modified accordingly.</p><p>3) Figure 5: the authors explain how whisker stimulation led to a decrease in the baseline of the signal (rev.2, comment 6).</p><p>4) Figure 6: The authors should show the same vascular density analysis in the young cohort. See detailed comment # 11 by reviewer 3.</p><p>5) The authors need to address the fact that these density measurements are done in superficial cortical areas where they do not see pronounced age-related changes in RBC flux. What might the density of deeper regions be changing with aging and what effect would exercise have (comment 12 / rev. 3)?</p><p>6) The authors should include a reference to Cudmore et al. (2017) where they perform awake longitudinal in vivo 2P imaging to determine if aerobic exercise can induce changes in capillary structure (length, tortuosity, diameter), angiogenesis, or rarefication. See details in comment 13 by reviewer 3.</p><p>7) The authors need to comment on the fact that they often did not see correlations between daily average running and blood flow changes, IOSI (Figure 5), and density (Figure 6) but do see differences in the novel object but not the Y-maze behaviors.</p><p>8) Scatter plots showing individual data points are encouraged</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The authors used female mice only without explaining why. Indeed, using female mice is very important as too many studies use only male mice and thus neglect to study females. Nevertheless, ideally, using both male and female mice would be better. As female mice do not have menopause but have a progressive decline in circulating estrogens the authors could discuss the possible link between estrogen and cerebral blood flow in their study. Another way to investigate the role of estrogens would be to use intact and ovariectomized female mice.</p><p>2. As mice were housed individually one may suspect a change in cerebral and cognitive function due to the stress of isolation as mice are very social animals. Although all the groups were submitted to the same experimental conditions, the authors could add a statement about this possible limitation in the discussion.</p><p>3. Whereas the effect of aerobic exercise is clear in old mice it would be interesting to know if the effect of exercise is equivalent in young mice. In other words, is the flow and pO2 gain equivalent in young and old mice with exercise? Same question with the other parameters.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This manuscript is well written and the evidence presented is convincing that aerobic exercise helps normalize cerebrovascular function. The effects were more evident in deeper cortical tissues and in the white matter. I have a number of comments/questions for the authors to consider:</p><p>1. Why only female mice? age-dependent changes in female mice could be crucial for the observed effects which might vary in male mice. It would be useful to know whether male mice display a similar pattern.</p><p>2. In the exercise group, mice had 5 months of access to exercise wheels. Were the running wheels removed from the cages between months 19-21?</p><p>3. The data presentation in Figure 3a and 3b doesn't clearly compare RBC flux in young versus aged mice. This is a key observation in the study and should be highlighted.</p><p>4. Figure 3e: It is not clear how the authors obtained the best-fit result for the exercise group (dotted line), since scattered points seem to follow.</p><p>5. Figure 3f: The legend mentions that the data are from 14 and 7 venules from 9 and 6 mice, respectively. What is exactly shown in Figure 3f? Was the standard deviation calculation based on the number of vessels or animals? There are twice the number of recordings from the sedentary group compared to the exercise, which possibly explains in part the very large standard deviation in 3f.</p><p>6. I suggest that the authors explain how whisker stimulation led to a decrease in the baseline of the signal. It might not be clear and I cannot find a clear explanation of the calculation of light intensity (Figure 5).</p><p>7. Since only NORT behavioral test showed significant differences between exercise and sedentary groups, I believe that the evidence is too preliminary at this stage and would need more corroborations.</p><p>8. Scatter plots showing individual data points are encouraged.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Their conclusions are in line with the experimental data provided. I am asking for the following revision below.</p><p>Figure 3 a/b. Could panels a and b be combined? The way it is requires comparing the same y-axis across two plots. Shouldn't they be one plot?

The revision has been made as follows:</p><p>(Lines 305-309, Discussion)</p><p>“Consistent with the small effect of exercise on cerebral microcirculation and oxygenation in superficial cortical areas, we observed no change in the relative peak amplitude or the latency of stimulus-induced hemodynamic response with exercise, assessed with OISI at 570 nm, which emphasizes the intrinsic signal originating from cerebral blood volume changes in the superficial cortical layers (Figure 3 and Figure 3 —figure supplement 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. Figure 6. Can the authors show the same vascular density analysis in the young cohort? The hypothesis is that aging reduces vessel density. This would be verification in that it would replicate what has previously been reported and could act as a baseline to compare and discuss the changes in density seen in aged sedentary versus exercising groups. How far does the increase in density in aged exercising mice bring the capillary density toward the young sedentary condition?</p></disp-quote><p>The LED used for OISI had a center wavelength of 570 nm, which is close to the hemoglobin isosbestic point. Therefore, the optical intrinsic signal at this wavelength is primarily sensitive to the total hemoglobin concentration, and thus blood volume changes under the assumption that hematocrit is not changing. Increases in local cerebral blood volume during functional hyperemia in response to whisker stimulation correlate with decreased diffused reflectance i.e., decreased optical intrinsic signal. To avoid confusion, a traditional way of presenting this data is to use the absolute value of relative signal change with respect to the baseline (e.g., to invert the signal) so that the increase in the blood volume is presented as an increase in the signal. Figures 3a and 3b have been revised accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. The authors need to address the fact that these density measurements are done in superficial cortical areas where they do not see pronounced age-related changes in RBC flux. What might the density of deeper regions be changing with aging and what effect would exercise have?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to the Essential revision 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. I want the authors to consider including a reference to Cudmore et al. (2017) where they perform awake longitudinal in vivo 2P imaging to determine if aerobic exercise can induce changes in capillary structure (length, tortuosity, diameter), angiogenesis, or rarefication. This study by Cudmore et al. was performed in young adult mice and they conclude aerobic exercise (voluntary wheel running) does not alter capillary density. It would be interesting to comment on their results (no effect) and your results in aged and exercising mice (big effect).</p><p>Cudmore RH, et al.

Figure 7. In the behavioral experiments it was found that exercise changed novel exploration but not the Y-maze test. The authors need to comment on why they think this is the case. I guess exercise changes short-term memory (novel object) versus Y-maze (what does the Y-maze measure?). Can we get an intuition for no change in Y-maze tests and what that means biologically?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. We have revised the manuscript as follows.</p><p>(Lines 347-354, Discussion)</p><p>“Consistent with our findings, microcirculatory changes in the white matter have been associated with recognition memory function evaluated by NORT in rodents, while no associations were found with spatial memory function assessed with Y-maze test in the same studies. (Blasi et al., 2014; Choi et al., 2015) However, we do not rule out the possibility that exercise may improve spatial memory function and suggest further investigation to evaluate different aspects of spatial memory function by applying other behavioral tests (e.g., Morris water maze test). As previously shown in several studies in mouse models of AD, each memory task depends on a variety of brain regions that can be differentially affected by exercise, which could also produce inconsistent results between different memory tasks. (Kraeuter et al., 2019; Winters, 2004).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors need to comment on the fact that they often did not see correlations between daily average running and blood flow changes, IOSI (Figure 5), and density (Figure 6) but do see differences in the novel object but not the Y-maze behaviors.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to the Essential revision 7.</p></body></sub-article></article>
