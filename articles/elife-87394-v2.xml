Axons larger than 1 Î¼m diameter are enveloped by myelinating SCs that form multilamellar myelin sheaths with a thickness proportional to axon caliber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jessen and Mirsky, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Salzer, 2015</xref>). Axons smaller than 1 Î¼m diameter, the unmyelinated nociceptors (i.e., C-fibers), are organized in clusters called Remak bundles, in which each C-fiber is ensheathed by a cytoplasmic pocket formed by non-myelinating SCs, also known as Remak SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Beirowski et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harty and Monk, 2017</xref>). Both myelinating and non-myelinating SCs provide metabolic and functional support essential for structural and functional integrity of peripheral nerves. Failure to initiate or maintain proper axon-SC association may lead to life-threatening paralysis and peripheral neuropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Scherer and Wrabetz, 2008</xref>). Myelinating SCs form and maintain myelin via a set of key transcription factors (TFs) and regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bremer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Decker et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Finzsch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">He et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jaegle et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Le et al., 2005a</xref>). However, the transcriptional regulation of myelinating SCs remains incompletely understood, and that of non-myelinating SCs is largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harty and Monk, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Recent mouse genetic studies surprisingly revealed that YAP (Yes-associated protein, also known as YAP1) and its paralogue, TAZ (Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif, also known as WWTR1), which are potent oncoproteins and transcriptional regulators in the Hippo signaling pathway, play crucial roles in developing, maintaining, and regenerating myelination of peripheral nerves. Both YAP and TAZ (YAP/TAZ) are expressed initially in all immature SCs and then selectively in myelinating SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grove et al., 2017</xref>). The processes for which they are required include: timely sorting of large axons and associated SC proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grove et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Poitelon et al., 2016</xref>); initiation of SC differentiation or myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grove et al., 2017</xref>); myelin maintenance in adults <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grove et al., 2017</xref>; and remyelination following nerve injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grove et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jeanette et al., 2021</xref>). YAP/TAZ initiate and maintain myelination in part by upregulating Krox20 (Egr2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grove et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lopez-Anido et al., 2016</xref>), which is widely recognized as the master TF promoting peripheral myelination by SCs. Krox20 is required to develop and maintain myelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Decker et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Topilko et al., 1994</xref>), and likely to promote myelin sheath growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Le et al., 2005a</xref>). It acts through direct transcriptional upregulation of myelin proteins and membrane lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jang and Svaren, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">LeBlanc et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>YAP/TAZ are transcriptional co-activators that contain a transcriptional activation domain, but no DNA binding domain. They regulate gene expression by binding to partner TFs, typically members of the TEA domain family (TEAD1-4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>). Conversely, TEADs on their own are unable to activate or repress transcription and require the help of co-factors such as YAP/TAZ to act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tian et al., 2010</xref>). Partner TFs such as TEADs are required to maintain YAP/TAZ in the nucleus, which keeps them transcriptionally active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Diepenbruck et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kofler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yao et al., 2018</xref>). Recent single-cell transcriptional analysis indicates that SCs express all four TEADs (TEAD1/2/3/4) and that their expression peaks at different times during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gerber et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, TEAD1-4 show unique, redundant, and/or opposing roles in regulating proliferation and differentiation of various cell types; these roles can also change as a function of developmental stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">He et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mukhtar et al., 2020</xref>). It remains to be elucidated how and which TEAD(s) in SCs mediate transcriptional regulation of YAP/TAZ for the development, maintenance, and/or regeneration of myelination after nerve injury.</p><p>In some cell types, TEAD1 serves as the main partner TEAD and plays non-redundant roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wen et al., 2019</xref>). In accordance, in SCs, TEAD1 associates with YAP/TAZ for upregulating myelin proteins as indicated by ChiP, co-IP, and transcription assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fernando et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grove et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lopez-Anido et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lopez-Anido et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, however, unlike YAP/TAZ, which are barely detectable in non-myelinating SCs, TEAD1 is clearly expressed in all SC nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grove et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that, independently of YAP/TAZ, TEAD1 plays an unknown role in non-myelinating SCs. In this study, we generated conditional and inducible knockout mice lacking TEAD1 in SCs to investigate the roles of TEAD1 in myelinating and non-myelinating SCs. We found that TEAD1 is required for myelinating SCs to form, grow, and regenerate myelin, and for non-myelinating SCs to enwrap C-fibers in Remak bundles during development and homeostasis. We also found that YAP/TAZ-TEAD1 promotes myelination by dually regulating SC proliferation, by enabling induced Krox20 to upregulate myelin proteins, and by upregulating cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Multiple TEADs are expressed in <italic>Schwann cells</italic> of WT and <italic>Tead1</italic> cKO mice</title><p>To investigate the roles of SC TEAD1 in developing nerves, we conditionally ablated <italic>Tead1</italic> by crossing <italic>Tead1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wen et al., 2017</xref>) with mice carrying <italic>Mpz</italic>-Cre, which is active from E13.5 in SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Feltri et al., 1999</xref>).

Western blot analysis of SN lysates showed that anti-TEAD3 and anti-pan TEAD both contained a main ~50 kD band that was decreased in <italic>Tead1</italic> cKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The pan-TEAD antibody may therefore bind preferentially to TEAD3. Anti-TEAD4 recognized three bands in WT and showed that the two faster-migrating bands were decreased in <italic>Tead1</italic> cKO. Anti-TEAD2 recognized a band of ~65 kD in <italic>Tead1</italic> cKO that was barely detectable in WT lysates. This band corresponded to the size of TEAD2 reported in other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beverdam et al., 2013</xref>). We also found that the ~65 kD band was present early postnatally, but rapidly diminished with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>), in accordance with the transcript data from mouse SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gerber et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, the expression of TEADs 2â4 was altered in <italic>Tead1</italic> cKO, likely reflecting their expression in SCs, consistent with the single cell transcriptomic analysis of SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gerber et al., 2021</xref>). Of these anti-TEAD antibodies, only anti-pan TEAD functioned for immunofluorescence staining, verifying the presence of other TEADs in SC nuclei lacking TEAD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1C and E</xref>).</p><p>In the absence of a partner TF, nuclear YAP/TAZ are decreased and phosphorylation of YAP/TAZ increased, due to targeting by Large tumor suppressor kinase 1/2 (LATS1/2), negative regulators of YAP/TAZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>). To investigate if YAP/TAZ are in the nuclei of SCs and therefore remain transcriptionally functional in the absence of TEAD1, we compared Western blotting of P50 WT vs <italic>Tead1</italic> cKO SN lysates and observed an overall decrease in YAP levels in <italic>Tead1</italic> cKO but a &gt;twofold increase in TAZ levels compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This ratio of TAZ to YAP in <italic>Tead1</italic> cKO resembled that observed during developmental myelination in WT SNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grove et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, phosphorylation of YAP decreased in <italic>Tead1</italic> cKO, which would typically indicate increased YAP activity. Thus, YAP/TAZ are not targeted for destruction in the absence of TEAD1 in SCs. Indeed, YAP/TAZ were retained in the SC nucleus of <italic>Tead1</italic> cKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), presumably due to other TEADs in the absence of TEAD1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>TEAD1 is required for myelin formation and growth</title><p><italic>Tead1</italic> cKO mice were smaller than WT mice at all ages, with labored breathing and widely splayed fore- and hindlimbs, indicative of severe peripheral neuropathy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).

We first examined SNs at P3, when, in WT, many large axons had already been radially sorted, establishing 1:1 relationship with promyelinating SCs, and myelination had begun. Compared to WT, <italic>Tead1</italic> cKO SNs were thinner, unsorted bundles of axons were larger and more numerous, and myelination was minimal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Nevertheless, we frequently observed large axons that had been sorted and established a 1:1 relationship with promyelinating SCs, as in WT. Therefore, radial sorting was delayed, but not blocked, in <italic>Tead1</italic> cKO.</p><p>At P22, when WT SNs were fully myelinated, <italic>Tead1</italic> cKO SNs were largely unmyelinated and exhibited areas of unsorted axon bundles, of sorted but unmyelinated axons, and of thinly myelinated axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Notably, at P50, this phenotype was unchanged from that at P22: areas of unsorted bundles, promyelination, and thin myelination persisted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>).

The myelin thickness measured as g-ratio, that is, the ratio between the axon diameter and the fiber diameter (axon plus myelin sheath), did not significantly change in cKO between P22 and P50 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), suggesting that growth of the myelin sheath relative to axon diameter did not increase over this period. These data suggest that myelination in <italic>Tead1</italic> cKO was arrested rather than delayed. Plots of g-ratio versus axon diameter showed that the mutant defect was present in axons of all diameters but was particularly notable in those of larger diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3J</xref>). The mean axon diameter was also reduced in cKO at P22, although it increased with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). Collectively, these data show that TEAD1 is required for timely radial sorting, myelin formation and growth during development.

TEAD1 promotes myelination by dually regulating SC proliferation, by enabling induced Krox20 to upregulate myelin proteins, and by upregulating cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes. Our findings also suggest that TEAD1 is critical in the proper formation and maintenance of Remak bundles.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Unique, redundant, and opposing roles of TEAD1</title><p>Although SCs express other TEADs, <italic>Tead1</italic> cKO mice grossly phenocopy <italic>Yap1/Wwtr1</italic> cDKO mice. They exhibit abnormal SC proliferation, delayed radial sorting, blocked myelin formation and remyelination, and normal axon regeneration. Furthermore, <italic>Tead1</italic> cKO mice, like <italic>Yap1/Wwtr1</italic> cDKO, are defective in regulating Oct6, Krox20, myelin proteins, and enzymes that synthesize cholesterol. These similarities show that YAP/TAZ regulate both SC proliferation and differentiation, the two opposing processes crucial for myelination, by partnering mainly with TEAD1 for developmental myelination and remyelination after injury. We also observed multiple differences between <italic>Tead1</italic> cKO and <italic>Yap1/Wwtr1</italic> cDKO mice. Unlike <italic>Yap1/Wwtr1</italic> cDKO, <italic>Tead1</italic> cKO initiates myelin formation in some developing axons and maintains myelination in almost all adult axons. Additionally, in <italic>Tead1</italic> cKO, Krox20 is upregulated and a large excess of SCs is generated. It is also notable that, whereas some developing axons are myelinated in <italic>Tead1</italic> cKO, almost all axons regenerating after injury are unmyelinated. These differences are likely due to stage-dependent redundancy and opposing roles of TEADs. Consistent with this notion, loss of TEAD1 does not affect nuclear localization of YAP/TAZ, which depends on interactions with TEADs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Diepenbruck et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kofler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yao et al., 2018</xref>). TEAD1-4 are all co-expressed in SCs through multiple stages of nerve development, maintenance, and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fernando et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grove et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">He et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, nuclear retention of YAP/TAZ occurs in <italic>Tead1</italic> cKO and iKO SCs when TEAD1 has a unique role in SCs for developmental myelination and remyelination. Thus, other TEADs can retain nuclear YAP/TAZ, thereby supporting transcriptional activity of YAP/TAZ, but cannot substitute for some or most of the functions of TEAD1 in a stage-dependent manner.</p><p>It is also notable that, like YAP/TAZ, the unique roles of TEAD1 change dynamically in successive steps of myelination, even though other TEADs are present. Thus, TEAD1 is uniquely required for timely proliferation of SCs; uniquely opposes SC proliferation to promote cell-cycle exit after radial sorting; redundantly promotes upregulation of Krox20; and then uniquely promotes upregulation of myelin proteins and cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes. Such unique and redundant roles for TEAD1 in the presence of other TEADs are supported by cell-based transcription assays, in which YAP-TEAD4 can substitute for YAP-TEAD1 in upregulating transcription from the Krox20 promoter, but not from the MPZ intronic enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fernando et al., 2016</xref>). Stage-dependent function of TEADs was also reported in cortical development, another multi-step differentiation program. As in nerve development, multiple TEADs (TEAD1-3) are co-expressed throughout cortical development. Depending on the differentiation stage, TEAD1 uniquely promotes proliferation, redundantly promotes proliferation with TEAD2 and 3, or redundantly promotes differentiation with TEAD3, when it is opposed by TEAD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mukhtar et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>As <italic>Yap1/Wwtr1</italic> cDKO SCs arrest at the promyelination stage, we were unable to investigate the role of YAP/TAZ in myelin growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grove et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, some <italic>Tead1</italic> cKO SCs can myelinate but fail to grow myelin sheaths proportional in size to axon diameter. Importantly, such myelinating SCs apparently lack TEAD1 because TEAD1 deletion is highly efficient in <italic>Tead1</italic> cKO mice. Support for a role of TEADs in the regulation of myelin sheath thickness comes from a study of TEAD4 cKO mice, in which SCs lacking TEAD4 gradually upregulate myelin protein expression, resulting in adult mice with abnormally thick myelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">He et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, it is possible that TEADs 1 and 4 oppose each other in the regulation of myelin sheath growth. Likewise, they may oppose each other in the regulation of SC proliferation during development, resulting in a large excess of SCs at P22 and P50 in <italic>Tead1</italic> cKO.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>TEAD1 regulation of Krox20 and myelin gene expression</title><p>Previous work suggests that YAP/TAZ-TEAD1 promote myelination in part through direct upregulation of Krox20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grove et al., 2017</xref>). Unlike <italic>Yap1/Wwtr1</italic> cKO mice, <italic>Tead1</italic> cKO mice upregulate Egr2/Krox20, but they fail to upregulate myelin proteins and cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes. Our findings extend previous work to suggest that TEAD1 functions redundantly in direct upregulation of Krox20, but that its function is required for upregulated Krox20 to promote myelination. Krox20 activity may be repressed in <italic>Tead1</italic> cKO by Oct6, which remains abnormally elevated. In support of this possibility, persistently elevated Oct6 overrides Krox20 to inhibit myelin gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Monuki et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ryu et al., 2007</xref>).

An alternative possibility is that a transcriptional co-activator that synergizes with Krox20 is absent in <italic>Tead1</italic> cKO SCs. We speculate that TEAD1 itself may function as such a factor. Supporting this idea are reports that gene regulatory elements function by co-binding several TFs, which synergistically activate transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heinz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ren and Yue, 2015</xref>), as at the Krox20 MSE (Myelinating Schwann cell element) which is the enhancer responsible for Krox20 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ghislain and Charnay, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grove et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">He et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kao et al., 2009</xref>). Krox20 synergizes with Sox10 to activate myelin genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jones et al., 2007</xref>) and with SREBP to activate lipid biosynthesis genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leblanc et al., 2005</xref>). Like Krox20, TEAD1 can directly promote transcription from PMP22 and MPZ myelin gene enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fernando et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lopez-Anido et al., 2016</xref>). Alternatively, or additionally, TEAD1 may function indirectly by upregulating co-factors, such as SREBP2, which is reduced in <italic>Tead1</italic> cKO. Notably, lipid biosynthesis is necessary to downregulate Oct6 and upregulate myelin gene transcription during developmental myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Saher et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Verheijen et al., 2009</xref>). An interesting possibility, therefore, is that YAP/TAZ-TEAD1 and Krox20 may cooperatively downregulate Oct6 and upregulate myelin gene expression in part by promoting lipid biosynthesis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>YAP/TAZ-TEAD1 regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis</title><p>SREBP1 levels are not altered in <italic>Tead1</italic> cKO or <italic>Yap1/Wwtr1</italic> cDKO, suggesting that fatty acid synthesis is not directly regulated by TEAD1 or YAP/TAZ. It is likely that the reduced levels of SCD1 at P8 and slight increase at P40 in <italic>Tead1</italic> cKO, and the large increase in SCD1 in <italic>Yap1/Wwtr1</italic> cDKO at P60 are due to developmental delay in these mutants. We did not observe downregulation of HMGCR in <italic>Tead1</italic> cKO or <italic>Yap1/Wwtr1</italic> cDKO mice at P8 or P40, which contradicts the report of reduced mRNA expression of HMGCR in <italic>Yap1/Wwtr1</italic> mutants at P3 and P5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Poitelon et al., 2016</xref>); we suggest this difference is due to developmental delay in <italic>Tead1</italic> cKO and <italic>Yap1/Wwtr1</italic> cDKO. However, marked downregulation of IDI1 and FDPS in <italic>Tead1</italic> cKO, <italic>Yap1/Wwtr1</italic> cDKO, and <italic>Yap1/Wwtr1</italic> iDKO suggests that cholesterol biosynthesis is defective in these mutants. In support of this notion, SC-selective deletion of SCAP (SREBP cleavage activation protein), which is required to produce active SREBP1 and SREBP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Verheijen et al., 2009</xref>), or of Squalene synthase, an essential enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Saher et al., 2009</xref>), evokes phenotypes which are remarkably similar to those of <italic>Tead1</italic> cKO mice: both mutants have an increased number of SCs, a severe delay at the promyelination stage, and persistently thin myelin. In addition, in SCAP cKO, Oct6 is upregulated continuously and Squalene synthase cKO fails to upregulate myelin gene transcription, resulting in severely reduced MBP, MPZ, and PMP22 protein levels.</p><p>How might YAP/TAZ-TEAD1 regulate IDI1 and FDPS? Multiple studies show that YAP/TAZ can activate the mTORC1 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2015</xref>), and that IDI1 and FDPS levels are reduced in SNs of Raptor cKO, a core component of mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">NorrmÃ©n et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, the Raptor cKO phenotype is like that of <italic>Tead1</italic> cKO, exhibiting an increased number of SCs, normal upregulation of Krox20, persistent upregulation of Oct6, delay at the promyelination stage, and thin myelin. However, HMGCR protein levels are reduced, and aberrant upregulation of Oct6 is transient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">NorrmÃ©n et al., 2014</xref>). After nerve injury, formation of repair SCs is delayed in Raptor mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">NorrmÃ©n et al., 2018</xref>), unlike TEAD1 and YAP/TAZ mutants. These differences suggest that YAP/TAZ-TEAD1 are not directly upstream of mTORC1. Another possibility is that YAP/TAZ-TEAD1 may directly regulate transcription of IDI1 and FDPS genes. Such direct regulation of cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes has been observed for other TFs in SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leblanc et al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>TEAD1 regulation of remak bundles</title><p>In both <italic>Tead1</italic> cKO and iKO mice, there is defective ensheathment of C-fibers by non-myelinating SCs in Remak bundles. This phenotype is distinct from those mutants in which SCs surround and occasionally myelinate bundles filled with large and small caliber axons, which are considered radial sorting defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Feltri et al., 2016</xref>). Remak bundles are occasionally myelinated in WT SNs during early postnatal development, but this defect is corrected and does not persist in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rasi et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, the defective Remak bundles that we observed in <italic>Tead1</italic> cKO are not due to developmental delay.</p><p>Remak bundles form normally at P60 in <italic>Yap1/Wwtr1</italic> cDKO, although many large bundles containing mixed caliber axons are present during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grove et al., 2017</xref>). The difference between <italic>Tead1</italic> and <italic>Yap1/Wwtr1</italic> mutants is supported by the presence of TEAD1 and absence of YAP/TAZ in non-myelinating SC nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grove et al., 2017</xref>). Notably, defective SC ensheathment of C-fibers is observed in various SC developmental mutants, including those with defective SC basal lamina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rasi et al., 2010</xref>) and overexpression of NRG1-IIIb (Neuregulin 1 type-IIIb) in axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gomez-Sanchez et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that TEAD1 mediates extracellular signaling from the SC basal lamina and/or axons that is responsible for forming and maintaining proper association of SCs with C-fibers. Notably, SC ensheathment of C-fibers is required for normal NCV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Taveggia et al., 2005</xref>), and NCV in the mutants overexpressing NRG1-IIIb is significantly reduced compared to WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gomez-Sanchez et al., 2009</xref>). Future studies will address NRG1 signaling and NCV in cKO and iKO mice lacking TEAD1 and/or other TEADs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Nerves were washed 3 times in PBS, then stored in 15% sucrose in PBS overnight at 4 Â°C for cryoprotection. Nerves were frozen-embedded in cryoprotectant medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) in isomethylbutane at â80 Â°C. Seven to 10 Î¼m sections from the nerves were cut using a cryostat (Leica Microsystems, Germany) and collected directly onto glass slides. For immunolabeling, nerve sections were rehydrated in PBS, permeabilized in 0.5% Triton/PBS for 20 min, washed with PBS, then blocked in 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 1 hr. Sections were incubated with primary antibodies in blocking buffer overnight at 4 Â°C in a hydrated chamber, washed with PBS, and incubated with secondary antibodies in blocking buffer for 2 hr at room temperature. Sections were washed with PBS, stained with DAPI for 10 min, and mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA).</p><p>Primary antibodies were used at the following concentrations for immunostaining of cryosections: guinea pig anti-Sox10 (kind gift from Michael Wegner, University of Erlangen, Bavaria, Germany; 1:1000), rabbit anti-Krox20 (Covance; 1:400), rabbit anti-Oct6 (Abcam ab31766; 1:800), rabbit anti-Ki67 (Novocastra NCL-Ki67p; 1:200), rabbit anti-Neurofilament 200 (SIGMA-Aldrich N4142; 1:500), mouse anti-Neurofilament (Covance SMI 312; 1:1000), mouse anti-Tubulin Î²3 (clone Tuj1, Covance #MMS-435P; 1:1000), mouse anti-SV2 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa; 1:10), rabbit anti-S100 (DAKO; 1:600), mouse anti-Myelin Basic Protein (Covance SMI 94; 1:2000), rabbit anti-TEAD1 (Cell Signaling D9X2 L, #12292; 1:200), rabbit anti-pan-TEAD (Cell Signaling D3F7L, #13295; 1:200), rabbit anti-YAP/TAZ (Cell Signaling D24E4, #8418; 1:200).</p><p>For immunostaining of extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and soleus muscles, mice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde, and the muscles removed and post-fixed for 20 min at room temperature. Muscles were then incubated for 15 min with rhodamine-conjugated Î±-bungarotoxin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), permeabilized in â20 Â°C methanol for 5 min, and blocked for 1 hr. in PBS containing 0.2% Triton and 2% BSA. The muscles were subsequently incubated overnight at 4 Â°C in a cocktail of primary antibodies diluted in the blocking solution. Axons and nerve terminals were labeled with mouse monoclonal antibodies to neurofilaments (SMI 312; Sternberger Monoclonals, Baltimore, MD) and to a synaptic vesicle protein, SV2 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA). <italic>Schwann cells</italic> were labeled with rabbit anti-cow S-100 polyclonal antibody (Dako, Carpentaria, CA). After incubation with the primary antibodies, muscles were rinsed in PBS and incubated with secondary antibodies in the blocking solution, for 1 hr at room temperature. The muscles were then rinsed in PBS and prepped for whole-mount by peeling the top layer of muscle fibers using microscissors and forceps, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Son and Thompson, 1995</xref>). The resulting âmuscle filletsâ were mounted on a slide and coverslipped.</p><p>Conventional fluorescence microscopy was performed using Olympus BX53 and Zeiss Axio Imager 2 microscopes. Images were captured using Hamamatsu ORCA R2 C10600 or Zeiss Axiocam HRm Rev 3 digital cameras, respectively, and Metamorph software. For confocal microscopy, we used a Leica SP8 confocal microscope, with either a 40x1.3 NA or 63x1.4 NA objective and Leica proprietary software. Acquired stacks were assembled using the maximum projection tool, and figures were prepared using Adobe Photoshop.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Electron microscopy, histology, and morphometry</title><p>Mice were perfused intravascularly with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer pH 7.4. Sciatic nerves were removed and incubated in the same buffer for 90 min at room temperature, then overnight at 4 Â°C. Specimens were post-fixed for 1 hr with OsO<sub>4</sub>, dehydrated, then embedded in araldite. Semi-thin (0.5 Î¼m) and ultrathin (70 nm) sections were cut using an ultramicrotome and stained with toluidine blue or uranyl acetate and lead citrate, respectively. Semi-thin sections were examined using bright field on an Olympus BX53 microscope, and images were captured using Hamamatsu ORCA R2 C10600 digital camera and Metamorph software. For analysis of the number of myelin profiles in control vs mutant sciatic nerves, semi-thin sections from proximal-, mid- and distal regions of the sciatic nerve were taken, and 2 non- overlapping images of each section were obtained using the 60 x objective. For electron microscopy, stained ultrathin sections were examined using a JEOL 1010 electron microscope fitted with a Hamamatsu digital camera and AMT Advantage image capture software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Proliferation assays</title><p>The percentage of <italic>Schwann cells</italic> in S-phase was measured by EdU incorporation.

Eighty min. later, mice were sacrificed, and sciatic nerves removed and fixed for 1 hr in 4% paraformaldehyde; longitudinal 7 Î¼m cryosections were used for analysis. EdU incorporation was identified using the Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor 555 labeling kit (Molecular Probes); the recommended protocol was followed, and labeling was for 1 hr.

Mice were deeply anesthetized, and hair was completely removed from the hindquarters. A 27 g percutaneous needle electrode was inserted subcutaneously over the femur to stimulate the sciatic nerve at two locations: at the hip joint and 1 cm distal to this site. The stimulation reference electrode (26 G percutaneous needle) was inserted over the back. Bipolar EMG electrodes were inserted subcutaneously in the digital interosseous muscles to record compound action potentials in response to activation of the sciatic nerve. Stimulation and recording were conducted on both hindlimbs. The muscle response was first tested with single pulses (100 Î¼s duration) to determine the threshold and level of activation producing a stable compound action potential in the muscle. The level of stimulation which produced stable responses was then used for two series of stimulations with 2â20 s long trains of biphasic square wave pulses (100 Î¼s duration) delivered at 1â5 Hz. The nerve was rested for 2 min between runs. Stimulation was delivered via an isolated pulse stimulator (A-M Systems Model 2100, A-M Systems Inc, Carlsborg, WA). EMG compound muscle action potential (CMAP) responses were recorded with a differential AC amplifier (A-M Systems Model 1700; gain 1 k-10k; pass band 10â50 KHz). Data was sampled at 50 KHz using LabVIEW (National Instruments Corporation, Austin, TX) running on a personal computer. Multiple recordings were taken at each location to ensure a minimum of 10 representative responses for each location and animal. Electrophysiological data were analyzed using Igor Pro (Wavemetrics Inc, Lake Oswego, OR).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Data analysis</title><p>In each experiment, data collection and analysis were performed identically, regardless of mouse genotype. We used the sample (replicate) size (number) typically used in earlier studies of peripheral myelination. Data are presented as mean +/-SD. Statistical analysis was done using Studentâs unpaired t-test for two-group comparisons and analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukeyâs test for multiple comparisons, according to the number of samples and the analysis of mice at multiple ages. Normal distribution of all data was tested using Shapiro-Wilk normality test. Sample sizes were similar to those conventional in the field and are indicated in the main text, methods, or figure legends. A p-value of 0.05 or less was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing â original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Resources, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All surgical procedures and animal maintenance complied with the National Institute of Health guidelines regarding the care and use of experimental animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol# 4920) of Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-87394-mdarchecklist1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files; Source Data files have been provided for all the figures.</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Alan Tessler and members of the Son laboratory for critical reading of the manuscript.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor.</p><p>As you will also see below the reviewers found your study interesting and suitable as a research advance over your previous work on YAP/TAZ in the peripheral nervous system. However, it was felt strongly that more information is needed about the role of other TEAD family members in Schwann cell development and myelination, which we hope is possible in a revised version. The referees also suggest that some restructuring of the manuscript would improve its readability. Please provide a point-to-point response to explain your revised manuscript.</p><p>With the results of this revision work at hand, the editor will also draft a summarizing assessment to be posted alongside the preprint.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Despite the extensive analyses I have found it quite difficult to follow the outflow of the manuscript with the continuous parallelism with their previous studies and the comparison with the results on YAP/TAZ dKO mice. If the readers are not familiar with the specific topic they will not be able to follow the argument.</p><p>2. The conclusions reached in the IP experiment shown in Figure 2 are too speculative. The quality of the western blot is poor and it is not possible to infer that &quot;TEAD1 is greatly favored as the binding partner for YAP/TAZ&quot; by simply looking at how the bands obtained in this analysis run on the gel.</p><p>3. The proposed correlation between OCT6 and Krox 20 in this model is intriguing but not supported by the experimental data, which simply rely on the expression levels of these proteins.</p><p>4. Since TEAD1 has basically no role in myelin maintenance the conclusions of this part should be softened, unless corroborated by a more precise analysis on the number of a-myelinated axons and the extent of the mild demyelination. Is the latter accompanied by axonal degeneration?</p><p>5. Sometimes the writing is not clear and it is difficult to follow, as in the case of the conclusions relative to Figure 4.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors need to address the following major and minor points before publication can be granted:</p><p>1. Antibodies against murine Tead1-4 are used to discriminate against Tead1-4 proteins isolated from sciatic nerve cell lysates (Figure 1). While the specificity of the Tead1 antibody is convincing, this has not been shown for the other antibodies, including the pan-Tead antibody. To confirm the other antibodies' specificity, the authors need to e.g., use shRNA-treated (or CRISPRi or knockout) murine cells/tissue for Tead2, 3, and 4. For the pan-Tead antibody, this needs to be conducted in a combinatorial manner. The functionality of the antibodies is central to this manuscript, as the authors claim that Tead1 is the key player to interact with YAP1/TAZ in co-IPs. In the text, the authors state that &quot;other TEADs can complex with YAP/TAZ&quot; (line 242/243), but this has not been directly shown for TEAD2, 3, and 4. Therefore, the authors need to individually address these interactions as well and need to quantitatively show (e.g., in co-IPs) how Tead1, 2, 3, and 4 bind to YAP1/TAZ.</p><p>2. In Tead1 cKO, SCs increased twice as compared to SCs of WT, measured at P22 and P50. How can this be mechanistically explained? The authors describe that Tead1 is the main TF of the TEAD family to interact with Yap1/Taz in SCs. However, could it be that Tead2-4 have a compensatory role here? And what is the contribution of such a potentially compensated Tead in WT SCs? Therefore, further experiments (e.g., qPCR on Tead2-4) are needed to validate and clarify this.</p><p>3. Oct6 protein level is upregulated in Tead1 cKO SCs. As with Tead family proteins, Oct6 belongs to a protein family, coving multiple genes, like Oct-1, Oct-2, Oct-3/4. Are those regulated in SCs? If so, how? This is particularly important for Oct-4 as YAP1 can regulate Oct-4 transcription. Further, why do the authors see a clear upregulation of Krox20 in the Western blot analysis, but not in the ICC staining? For Oct6, however, the results nicely correlated in WB and ICC.</p><p>4. In general, the selected targets the authors analysed are reasonable. However, the study will benefit from a more comprehensive and unbiased approach by conducting a transcriptomic analysis in Tead1 cKO SC to identify the entire deregulated network. This can be done using RNA-seq on isolated SNs (or even single-cell RNA-seq, if required to differentiate among cell types). The authors may want to also include SNs from Yap/Taz dKO SNs to better understand the differences between Tead1 ko and the Yap/Taz dKO SNs. The ambiguity and the rather high degree of uncertainty for some mechanistic aspects are also reflected in the discussion where many options were considered but a clearly preferred mechanism is not provided.</p><p>5. The effect of an induced Tead1 inactivation in SC is tested using a tamoxifen-inducible PLP specific Cre recombinase (Figure 7). However, data on the induced inactivation of Tead1 is missing. To validate this Tead1 iKO model, the authors must provide data (e.g., WB). Also, what is the percentage of tamoxifen-induced Tead1 iKO SC? The authors provide clear evidence for an effect on Krox20 in Yap1/Taz iDKO SC after 2 weeks of tamoxifen treatment. In Tead1 iKO SC, however, there is no effect after 6 weeks of tamoxifen treatment. How is this after 2 weeks? Could this be seen in Western blot analyses (c.f. to Tead1 cKO)? Also, how is the response to Oct6+ SC after 2 weeks? How is the response in Western blot analyses on targets of the cholesterol pathway (-&gt; 2 weeks vs. 6 weeks)?</p><p>6. Statistics section: Were all data tested for normal distribution (-&gt; Shapiro Wilk test) before applying the indicated tests?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The data are well-presented and solid. However, I have three suggestions that the authors might wish to address.</p><p>1) I found the presentation of the inducible TeaD1 KO in Figure 1 very confusing. These mutants are analysed and presented in Figures 7 and 8. Why not introduce them there? The point of Figure 1 is mainly to demonstrate the effective deletion of TeaD1 from the Schwann cell lineage and its effect on the other TEAD proteins expressed in wild type and in the absence of TEAD1 (Figure1A and 1D).</p><p>2) The timelines in Figure 7 and 8 should include the age at which TAM injection is started to avoid confusion on the age of the mice.</p><p>3) The authors should provide a much more detailed description of their YAP/TAZ IP experiments. In Figure 2F they present Western blots of IP of YAP/TAZ that appear close to 100% efficient, which is kind of incredible but possible of course. But what is really puzzling is the complete absence of a rabbit IgG heavy chain signal on their blots. They should explain the absence of this signal.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87394.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. Despite the extensive analyses I have found it quite difficult to follow the outflow of the manuscript with the continuous parallelism with their previous studies and the comparison with the results on YAP/TAZ dKO mice. If the readers are not familiar with the specific topic they will not be able to follow the argument.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we now minimize the parallelism by removing our references to earlier studies on Yap/Taz cDKO. We keep them only when readers, including those not familiar with YAP/TAZ-TEAD(s) signaling, need the information to evaluate our claims regarding TEAD1 in YAP/TAZ regulation of myelin development, maintenance, and remyelination.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The conclusions reached in the IP experiment shown in Figure 2 are too speculative. The quality of the western blot is poor and it is not possible to infer that &quot;TEAD1 is greatly favored as the binding partner for YAP/TAZ&quot; by simply looking at how the bands obtained in this analysis run on the gel.</p></disp-quote><p>In accordance with this assessment and <italic>eLife</italic>âs revision policy, we have removed the IP/Western blot data (Figure 2F) that we used to claim that YAP/TAZ favor TEAD1 but are complexed with other TEADs in the absence of TEAD1. We will obtain additional biochemical and genetic data when the necessary resources for studying TEAD2-4 are available.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The proposed correlation between OCT6 and Krox 20 in this model is intriguing but not supported by the experimental data, which simply rely on the expression levels of these proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>Persistent upregulation of Oct6 has been observed in various mutant mice defective in Schwann cell myelination and aberrant overexpression of Oct6 overrides Krox20 to inhibit upregulation of myelin proteins (Monuki, Kuhn, &amp; Lemke, 1993; Ryu et al., 2007). It remains enigmatic, however, how high levels of Oct6 inhibit Krox20 or myelin gene expression.</p><p>It is indeed intriguing to find that Oct6 is upregulated in Tead1 cKO because it suggests the possibility that Oct6 may repress Krox20 to prevent myelination in Tead1 cKO. Alternatively, Oct 6 upregulation may be a consequence of defective YAP/TAZ-TEAD1 signaling and Tead1 cKO may fail to myelinate normally due to the lack of transcriptional co-activator that synergizes with Krox20. We indeed favor this latter possibility and speculate that TEAD1 itself may function as such a cofactor. We have clarified and elaborated our comments regarding Oct6 in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Since TEAD1 has basically no role in myelin maintenance the conclusions of this part should be softened, unless corroborated by a more precise analysis on the number of a-myelinated axons and the extent of the mild demyelination. Is the latter accompanied by axonal degeneration?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now modified the title by inserting âdevelopmentalâ to indicate that TEAD1 is indispensable explicitly for developmental myelination. The new tile is that âTEAD1 is crucial for developmental myelination, Remak bundlesâ¦â. We have also softened our statements about the role of TEAD1 in myelin maintenance. We also mention the low incidence of demyelinated axons which were observed on discrete regions of SNs, indicating local, segmental demyelination. We observed no degenerating axons on TEM analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Sometimes the writing is not clear and it is difficult to follow, as in the case of the conclusions relative to Figure 4.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the suggestion and have amended our writing throughout the manuscript, including the conclusions relative to Figure 4 (now Figure 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors need to address the following major and minor points before publication can be granted:</p><p>1. Antibodies against murine Tead1-4 are used to discriminate against Tead1-4 proteins isolated from sciatic nerve cell lysates (Figure 1). While the specificity of the Tead1 antibody is convincing, this has not been shown for the other antibodies, including the pan-Tead antibody. To confirm the other antibodies' specificity, the authors need to e.g., use shRNA-treated (or CRISPRi or knockout) murine cells/tissue for Tead2, 3, and 4. For the pan-Tead antibody, this needs to be conducted in a combinatorial manner. The functionality of the antibodies is central to this manuscript, as the authors claim that Tead1 is the key player to interact with YAP1/TAZ in co-IPs. In the text, the authors state that &quot;other TEADs can complex with YAP/TAZ&quot; (line 242/243), but this has not been directly shown for TEAD2, 3, and 4. Therefore, the authors need to individually address these interactions as well and need to quantitatively show (e.g., in co-IPs) how Tead1, 2, 3, and 4 bind to YAP1/TAZ.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewerâs suggestion. We were able to demonstrate the specificity of Tead1 antibody and its expression in Schwann cell nuclei primarily because floxed Tead1 allele and IHC-compatible antibodies are available for TEAD1. As mentioned earlier, unlike TEAD1, the key resources for studying TEAD2-4 are lacking and our in vivo approach using AAV-shRNAs was not successful. We have, therefore, removed the co-IP data (Figure 2F) and the associated claim that âYAP/TAZ favors TEAD1 but can complex with other TEADs in the absence of TEAD1â. We consider this claim to be a minor portion of the manuscript and hope that the reviewers will adhere to <italic>eLife</italic>âs revision policy, which advises âeither limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting dataâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In Tead1 cKO, SCs increased twice as compared to SCs of WT, measured at P22 and P50. How can this be mechanistically explained? The authors describe that Tead1 is the main TF of the TEAD family to interact with Yap1/Taz in SCs. However, could it be that Tead2-4 have a compensatory role here? And what is the contribution of such a potentially compensated Tead in WT SCs? Therefore, further experiments (e.g., qPCR on Tead2-4) are needed to validate and clarify this.</p></disp-quote><p>TEADs in Schwann cells can be contradictory/opposing as well as compensatory to each other, as we discussed. For example, as we stated in the Discussion, Schwann cells âlackingâ TEAD4 developed thicker myelin (He et al., 2018), whereas those lacking TEAD1 failed to do so, as we found in the present study. It is possible, therefore, that TEAD4 may oppose TEAD1 in the regulation of Schwann cell proliferation, resulting in gradual increase of Schwann cells measured at P22 and P50 in Tead1 cKO.</p><p>It is also noteworthy that single cell RNAseq data show that Schwann cells express all 4 Teads throughout development and homeostasis (Gerber et al., 2021). Therefore, studying compensatory and/or opposing roles of TEAD2-4 requires a large amount of functional analysis with aforementioned key resources that are currently lacking. Simple quantitative analysis will not be able to determine their compensatory and/or opposing roles. For example, qPCR cannot demonstrate Schwann cell-specific expression of Tead2-4 because non-Schwann cells are likely to express them, as they do TEAD1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Oct6 protein level is upregulated in Tead1 cKO SCs. As with Tead family proteins, Oct6 belongs to a protein family, coving multiple genes, like Oct-1, Oct-2, Oct-3/4. Are those regulated in SCs? If so, how? This is particularly important for Oct-4 as YAP1 can regulate Oct-4 transcription. Further, why do the authors see a clear upregulation of Krox20 in the Western blot analysis, but not in the ICC staining? For Oct6, however, the results nicely correlated in WB and ICC.</p></disp-quote><p>Of 11 known Oct proteins, Oct1 and Oct6 have been reported in developing Schwann cells, and, Schwann cell mRNA transcripts data consistently suggest little or no expression of other Oct mRNAs including Oct4 (Pou5f1) (Gerber et al., 2021) (https://snat.ethz.ch/index.html). Furthermore, Oct1 and Oct6 show distinct expression patterns, presumably reflecting their unique function in Schwann cells (Blanchard et al., 1996; the Schwann cell transcripts data). It is also noteworthy that upregulated Oct6 may not be the cause for the failure of Krox20 to upregulate myelin proteins in Tead1 cKO, as we now elaborate in our discussion. Based on these data, we respectfully disagree with the reviewer that studying expression of other Oct proteins and their regulation by TEAD1 is necessary for the present work.</p><p>Based on WB analysis, Oct6 is increased ~20 times, whereas Krox20 is increased ~4 times higher in Tead1 cKO than WT (Figure 4A). As Tead1 cKO contains twice as many Schwann cells as WT, WB data therefore indicate that Tead1 cKO Schwann cells contain only two-fold more Krox20 than WT Schwann cells (but 10 fold more Oct6). We have tested several Krox20 antibodies in ICC, but none appear to have sufficient sensitivity to reveal the two-fold increase of Krox20. On the other hand, Oct6 is not present in WT Schwann cells, unlike Krox20. Therefore, demonstrating 10-fold more Oct6 in Tead1 cKO did not require a highly sensitive antibody.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In general, the selected targets the authors analysed are reasonable. However, the study will benefit from a more comprehensive and unbiased approach by conducting a transcriptomic analysis in Tead1 cKO SC to identify the entire deregulated network. This can be done using RNA-seq on isolated SNs (or even single-cell RNA-seq, if required to differentiate among cell types). The authors may want to also include SNs from Yap/Taz dKO SNs to better understand the differences between Tead1 ko and the Yap/Taz dKO SNs. The ambiguity and the rather high degree of uncertainty for some mechanistic aspects are also reflected in the discussion where many options were considered but a clearly preferred mechanism is not provided.</p></disp-quote><p>Two earlier studies performed RNAseq analysis of Yap/Taz dKO SNs and provided information on transcripts regulated by YAP/TAZ (Deng et al., 2017; Poitelon et al., 2016). Given that Tead1 cKO basically phenocopies Yap/Taz dKO, showing less severe defects in developmental myelination, RNAseq analysis of Tead1 cKO will likely show overlapping patterns of dysregulated genes but unlikely to provide new mechanistic insights into how Yap/Taz-Tead1 regulate developmental myelination and remyelination. We will be more interested in using single cell RNAseq to elucidate how TEAD1 and other TEADs regulate non-myelinating Schwann cells or Remak bundles independently of YAP/TAZ. We will pursue it in our future studies of TEAD1-4 signaling in Remak bundle formation and homeostasis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The effect of an induced Tead1 inactivation in SC is tested using a tamoxifen-inducible PLP specific Cre recombinase (Figure 7). However, data on the induced inactivation of Tead1 is missing. To validate this Tead1 iKO model, the authors must provide data (e.g., WB). Also, what is the percentage of tamoxifen-induced Tead1 iKO SC? The authors provide clear evidence for an effect on Krox20 in Yap1/Taz iDKO SC after 2 weeks of tamoxifen treatment. In Tead1 iKO SC, however, there is no effect after 6 weeks of tamoxifen treatment. How is this after 2 weeks? Could this be seen in Western blot analyses (c.f. to Tead1 cKO)? Also, how is the response to Oct6+ SC after 2 weeks? How is the response in Western blot analyses on targets of the cholesterol pathway (-&gt; 2 weeks vs. 6 weeks)?</p></disp-quote><p>We previously provided the requested data on induced inactivation of Tead1 in Figure 1, because Tead1 iKO was used at first for Figure 2F (now removed). We now present the data as Figure 6-S1, which is placed next to Figure 7, so that readers will not miss the information. As the data indicate, our 2 weeks of tamoxifen administration protocol was highly efficient and removed TEAD1 from &gt;95% Schwann cells in Tead1 iKO as shown by IHC. We also provide new WB data (Figure 6-S1A). Importantly, the residual TEAD1 that WB shows in Tead1 iKO is likely associated with non-Schwann cells, as indicated by IHC analysis.</p><p>We do not understand the rationale for examining the expression of Krox20 and Oct6 at 2 weeks in Tead1 iKO. Perhaps the reviewer considers it possible that Krox20 is rapidly lost in Tead1 iKO at 2 weeks causing demyelination, as in Yap/Taz iDKO (Grove et al., 2017), and then becomes restored at 6 weeks. As we stated, Tead1 iKO mice appeared normal 2 weeks after tamoxifen administration, unlike Yap/Taz iDKO, which displayed persistent shivering, ataxia, hunched posture, weight loss and rapid shallow breathing (Grove et al., 2017). Nonetheless, we examined Krox20, Oct6 and demyelination in Tead1 iKO at 2 weeks and found no differences from the results at 6 weeks, as expected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Statistics section: Were all data tested for normal distribution (-&gt; Shapiro Wilk test) before applying the indicated tests?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, normal distribution of all the data was tested with Shapiro-Wilk normality test.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The data are well-presented and solid. However, I have three suggestions that the authors might wish to address.</p><p>1) I found the presentation of the inducible TeaD1 KO in Figure 1 very confusing. These mutants are analysed and presented in Figures 7 and 8. Why not introduce them there? The point of Figure 1 is mainly to demonstrate the effective deletion of TeaD1 from the Schwann cell lineage and its effect on the other TEAD proteins expressed in wild type and in the absence of TEAD1 (Figure1A and 1D).</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we now introduce Tead1 iKO as a Supplemental Figure (new Figure 6âfigure supplement 1). We previously introduced both Tead1 iKO and Tead1 cKO in Figure 1, because Tead1 iKO was used at first for the IP experiment in Figure 2F, which we have now removed from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The timelines in Figure 7 and 8 should include the age at which TAM injection is started to avoid confusion on the age of the mice.</p></disp-quote><p>TAM injection was started when TEAD1 iKO mice were 8 weeks old. As suggested, we now include this information in the timelines of Figure 7 (now Figure 6) and Figure 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors should provide a much more detailed description of their YAP/TAZ IP experiments. In Figure 2F they present Western blots of IP of YAP/TAZ that appear close to 100% efficient, which is kind of incredible but possible of course. But what is really puzzling is the complete absence of a rabbit IgG heavy chain signal on their blots. They should explain the absence of this signal.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed earlier, we have now removed Figure 2F and the IP experiment from the revised manuscript.
