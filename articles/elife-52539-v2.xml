Ig-superfamily whose exact role in immune modulation has remained elusive. Its constitutive expression on resting and activated T cells precludes it from being a <italic>bona fide</italic> exhaustion marker. By breeding Pmel-1 mice with SLAMF6 -/- mice, we generated donors for T cells lacking SLAMF6 and expressing a transgenic TCR for gp100-melanoma antigen. Activated Pmel-1xSLAMF6 -/- CD8+ T cells displayed improved polyfunctionality and strong tumor cytolysis. T-bet was the dominant transcription factor in Pmel-1 x SLAMF6 -/- cells, and upon activation, they acquired an effector-memory phenotype. Adoptive transfer of Pmel-1 x SLAMF6 -/- T cells to melanoma-bearing mice resulted in lasting tumor regression in contrast to temporary responses achieved with Pmel-1 T cells. LAG-3 expression was elevated in the SLAMF6 -/- cells, and the addition of the LAG-3-blocking antibody to the adoptive transfer protocol improved the SLAMF6 -/- T cells and expedited the antitumor response even further. The results from this study support the notion that SLAMF6 is an inhibitory immune receptor whose absence enables powerful CD8+ T cells to eradicate tumors.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The immune system helps to protect our bodies from illnesses and infections. Immunotherapies are medicines designed to treat diseases, such as cancer, by boosting the immune system against the condition. This is a powerful approach but so far immunotherapies have only had partial success and there is a need for further improvements.</p><p>One protein called SLAMF6 is found on cells from the immune system that attack and kill cancer cells. Immunotherapies that suppress SLAMF6 on immune cells called killer T cells could increase immune system activity helping to treat cancers, particularly melanoma skin cancers. So far the potential for SLAMF6 as a target for immunotherapy has not been fully explored.</p><p>Hajaj et al. created mice with killer T cells that recognized skin cancer cells and lacked SLAMF6. These modified cells were better at fighting cancer, producing more anti-cancer chemicals called cytokines and killing more cancer cells. The modified cells had a lasting effect on tumors and helped the mice to live longer. The effects could be further boosted by treating the mice in combination with other immunotherapies.</p><p>SLAMF6 is a possible new target for skin cancer immunotherapy that could help more people to live longer following cancer diagnosis. The next step is to create a drug to target SLAMF6 in humans and to test it in clinical trials.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>checkpoint</kwd><kwd>immunotherapy</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>T cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005984</institution-id><institution>Dr. Miriam and Sheldon G.

set of six receptors expressed on hematopoietic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Wu and Veillette, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cannons et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Veillette, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Calpe et al., 2008</xref>). All SFRs, except 2B4, are homotypic binders, that is they engage the same ectodomain sequence, either in cis (same cell) or in trans (adjacent cell) configuration. Most hematopoietic cell types express 3–5 members of the SLAM family.</p><p>SFRs generate signals via a bi-phasic mechanism of recruitment to tyrosines in the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motifs (ITSMs) in their cytoplasmic domain. SLAM associated protein (SAP), a small protein containing the Src homology 2 (SH2)-domain, was shown to be the default adaptor of the SFRs, interchanging with protein tyrosine phosphatases, mainly SHP-1, but also SHP-2, inositol phosphatase SHIP-1 and protein tyrosine kinase Csk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Wu and Veillette, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cannons et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Veillette, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Calpe et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>SLAMF6, also known as CD352, LY108, or NTB-A, is a homotypic SFR expressed on T cells, NK cells, B cells, and dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bottino et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Zhong and Veillette, 2008</xref>). Kageyama et al. linked SLAMF6 to the anchoring of T cells to their target cells, and subsequent cytolysis of the target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kageyama et al., 2012</xref>). According to these authors, functional SAP is critical for SLAMF6 activity. In mice lacking SAP, SLAMF6 was shown to inhibit T cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kageyama et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Zhao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bottino et al., 2001</xref>). The role of SLAMF6 in healthy T cells expressing normal SAP levels was generally inferred from contextual data and is not yet clear. There are indications that SLAMF6 plays an activating role in double-positive thymocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dutta et al., 2013</xref>) along with evidence that it plays an inhibitory role in iNKT cells and CD8+ T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Eisenberg et al., 2018</xref>). Gene expression profiles of T cell subsets link SLAMF6 to the progenitor-exhausted state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Miller et al., 2019</xref>) and to the tuning of the critical number of T cells required for proper differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Polonsky et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>To elucidate the net function of SLAMF6, we generated a transgenic mouse with the Pmel-1 melanoma-specific T-cell receptor (TCR) expressed in CD8+ T cells, in which the <italic>SLAMF6</italic> gene was knocked out. In this report, we show for the first time that SLAMF6 -/- CD8+ T cells display improved anti-melanoma activity and prevent melanoma growth more effectively than CD8+ T cells with intact and functional SLAMF6. Since SLAMF6 is constitutively expressed on T cells, it acts as an inhibitory checkpoint receptor whose absence allows the eradication of established tumors by CD8+ T cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SLAMF6 is constitutively expressed on T cells and increases upon activation</title><p>SLAMF6 is an immune receptor constitutively expressed on non-activated and activated T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Eisenberg et al., 2018</xref>). The level of SLAMF6 transcription and receptor expression, however, is dynamic, changing with time and activation states. To record SLAMF6 expression in a longitudinal manner, human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were activated for 5 days, and SLAMF6 transcript and protein expression were measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). After 1 day of activation, there was an initial decrease in the SLAMF6 transcript that switched to over-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). From 3 days after activation onward, SLAMF6 receptor expression consistently increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Interestingly, the increased expression was most pronounced in T cells activated in the absence of IL-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

Cluster A represents genes highly expressed in non-activated cells, and downregulated upon activation, such as <italic>BCL2</italic> and <italic>JAK1</italic>. Cluster B represents fast-rising genes undergoing transcription as early as 3–6 hr following activation, but down-regulated after that; genes in this cluster include the activation marker <italic>CD69</italic>.

Since GM-CSF is a strong recruiter of innate immune cells, while IL-10 and IL-13 drive suppressor traits, this secretion profile supports autocrine and paracrine immune activation. mRNA data validated the secretion assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Vitiligo was noted in all mice attaining complete response, showing up earlier in the -/- group, at the 6th week, indicating the strength of the response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>In a similar experiment, peptide-activated Pmel-1 CD8+ T cells or Pmel-1 x SLAMF6 -/- CD8+ T cells were transferred into mice bearing 7-day-old tumors. A week later, mice were sacrificed, and spleens, tumors, and tumor-draining lymph nodes were extracted and evaluated for the presence of transferred T cells, using flow cytometry to detect the gp100<sub>25-33</sub> tetramer.

Using the Pmel-1 x SLAMF6-/- CD8+ T cells, we then established matrices to determine the regulatory effect of SLAMF6 on the effector T cells and their antigen-presenting targets. SLAMF6-/- mice served as a source of APC devoid of SLAMF6, and peptide-loaded EL4 cells transduced to express SLAMF6 served as another SLAMF6-expressing APC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> shows that knocking-out SLAMF6 in peptide-pulsed APCs enhances the response of Pmel-1 T cells, attesting to the inhibitory effect of the <italic>trans</italic> positioning of SLAMF6.

We initially evaluated the level of SAP, the primary adaptor required for SLAMF6 signaling, encoded by the <italic>Sh2d1a</italic> gene, which was intact in the SLAMF6 -/- mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). SAP is a critical adaptor that recruits Fyn kinase to SLAMF6. However, while SAP transcript was found at similar levels in WT and SLAMF6 -/- lymphocytes, SAP protein was not detectable in SLAMF6 -/- cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The discrepancy between the transcript and the protein could be due to the rapid degradation of cytoplasmic SAP in its unbound form. SAP protein deficiency also implies that SLAMF6 is its major anchor in non-activated CD8+ T cells, even though SAP also mediates the inhibitory activity of PD-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Peled et al., 2018</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, PD-1 expression is more than two-fold increased in 7 day activated Pmel-1 x SLAMF6 -/- lymphocytes compared to Pmel-1, but, as we have shown, this gap did not affect functionality.

No difference in phosphorylated rpS6 was found in the Pmel-1 x SLAMF6 -/- T cells.</p><p>Therefore, we proceeded to identify transcription regulators whose activity differed between the Pmel-1 cells and the Pmel-1 x SLAMF6 -/- cells. The most prominent regulator found was T-bet, which increased more than twofold in activated Pmel-1 x SLAMF6 -/- splenocytes, followed by Eomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). T-bet was originally described as the key transcription factor defining type 1 T helper (Th) cells; it has since been found to play a major role in the acquisition of effector functions by CD8+ T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Szabo et al., 2000</xref>). Type one inflammatory signals induce T-bet expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Joshi et al., 2007</xref>), which is in line with the intensive IFN-γ secretion we observed by the Pmel-1 x SLAMF6 -/- lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><p>Lastly, the level of immune receptors that mediate exhaustion was recorded during prolonged activation. Five days after the end of a 7-day activation course, Pmel-1 x SLAMF6 -/- T cells displayed similar levels of PD-1, CD244 (SLAMF4), and TIM-3 to those in the Pmel-1 T cells, but higher expression of LAG-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Hypothesizing that LAG-3 represents a compensatory mechanism for the enhanced activation of Pmel-1 x SLAMF6 -/- T cells, we used a blocking antibody against LAG-3 in the gp100 activation assay. We then measured IFN-γ secretion by activated T cells in response to B16-F10/mhgp100 melanoma cells. As expected, blocking LAG-3 on Pmel-1 x SLAMF6 -/- lymphocytes increased their cytokine secretion significantly, whereas it did not affect Pmel-1 cells. Overall, knocking out SLAMF6 together with LAG-3 blockade resulted in a three-fold increase in IFN-γ production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). To evaluate the combination of SLAMF6 -/- cells and LAG-3 blocking antibody, we conducted an ACT experiment in melanoma-bearing mice, using Pmel-1 x SLAMF6 -/- CD8+ T cells activated in vitro in the presence of anti-LAG-3 and sustained by intraperitoneal IL-2 (days 8 and 9) and anti-LAG-3 (days 8, 10, 15, 18, 21). The control arm consisted of Pmel-1 x SLAMF6 -/- CD8+ T cells stimulated and sustained with an isotype antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G–I</xref>). Mice treated by the combination of SLAMF6-deficient T cells and anti-LAG-3 antibody showed faster reduction and disappearance of their tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>), apparent already on day 16 (p=0.04) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>).</p><p>These results demonstrate that blocking the compensatory rise of LAG-3 on SLAMF6-/- T cells improved their anti-tumor effect even further.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The aim of this study was to characterize the role of SLAMF6 in CD8+ T cells, in the context of an antitumor response. The data obtained identify SLAMF6 as a receptor whose absence significantly improves CD8+-mediated tumor regression, suggesting that it is an inhibitory checkpoint.</p><p>Historically, SFRs were studied for their part in X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP), a complex genetic immune dysfunction caused by a SAP mutation. XLP is characterized by a compromised immune response to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) but also by unrestrained T lymphoblast proliferation, which is not necessarily EBV-induced. Thus, it is unclear whether loss of SAP converts all SFRs into ‘super-inhibitory’ receptors or whether, on the contrary, loss of SAP unleashes lymphocytes to proliferate, free from re-stimulation-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Katz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kageyama et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Zhao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bottino et al., 2001</xref>). Since SAP is an adaptor common to all SLAM family receptors, the role of each individual receptor was obscured by the shared defect. In this situation, SLAMF6 was considered a receptor with a dual function, depending on the interplay between SAP and SHP-1 and SHP-2, protein phosphatases that bind to tyrosines on the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Veillette, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cannons et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Detre et al., 2010</xref>). SLAMF6 duality was echoed in data from Veillette that showed differing effects of SLAMF6 on NK cells, enhancing function in the priming phase while suppressing cells in the effector-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). Also, mice lacking individual SFRs exhibit minor immune deviations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Wu and Veillette, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cannons et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Veillette, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Calpe et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>In the past, we described that targeting SLAMF6 with its soluble ectodomain yielded CD8+ T cells that do not need IL-2 supplementation, either in vitro or in vivo, to eradicate established melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Eisenberg et al., 2018</xref>). The beneficial effect of the soluble ectodomain of SLAMF6 prompted us to generate melanoma-specific SLAMF6 -/- T cells, to characterize the role of the receptor in a solid tumor model.</p><p>A key finding using the new Pmel-1 x SLAMF6 -/- mice described in this manuscript is the absence, in fact, of a dichotomy in SLAMF6 action in effector T cells. On the contrary, knocking-out SLAMF6 in murine antigen-specific CD8+ T cells disclosed an unequivocal inhibitory role for the receptor. In its absence, TCR triggering of anti-melanoma CD8+ T cells yielded a strong effector phenotype, higher IFN-γ secretion, improved cytolysis, and better outcomes in the adoptive transfer of SLAMF6 -/- anti melanoma CD8+ T cells to treat established melanoma. This study identifies SLAMF6 as a powerful inhibitor of antitumor immune response. The absence of viable SAP in SLAMF6 -/- lymphocytes hints that this adaptor takes a major part in the inhibitory effect of SLAMF6.</p><p>To explore the role of SLAMF6 in T cells without the confounding effects of its function in other cell types, we generated a system in which effector T cells interact with their tumor target based on specific epitope recognition and subsequently generate an immunological synapse. The synapse is a subcellular structure involved in the effect of SLAMF6 and is crucial for its study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Zhao et al., 2012</xref>). However, although we revealed the inhibitory effect of SLAMF6 in the Pmel-1 x SLAMF6 -/- mice, the source and configuration of SLAMF6/SLAMF6 homotypic binding in the wild-type situation were still difficult to characterize. We had to generate a SLAMF6-positive B16-F10/mhgp100 melanoma line to measure the effect, or more exactly, the degree of suppression, that SLAMF6 trans-activation has on the capacity of melanoma-cognate CD8+ T cells to eradicate tumors. As shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), the SLAMF6-expressing melanoma suppressed T cell efficacy and consequently grew faster. This observation received further support from similar data generated with peptide-pulsed thymoma cells transduced to express SLAMF6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). However, the improved IFNγ secretion of SLAMF6-/- T cells, when co-cultured with SLAMF6-lacking APCs compared to WT APCs, implies that an inherent mechanism, most likely lack of <italic>cis</italic>-inhibition in the antigen presenting cells, is also responsible for the effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).</p><p>The molecular mechanisms underlying the increased functional capacity of Pmel-1 T cells lacking SLAMF6 have common features with XLP, as the absence of SAP implies. But while XLP is a global defect of all cell types of the immune system, and therefore yields mixed derangements, the absence of SLAMF6 is remarkable for the enhanced functionality of CD8+ T cells, in which it is the dominating SFR.</p><p>The transcriptional landscape of SLAMF6 -/- T cells was governed by the higher expression of <italic>T-bet</italic>. T-bet is a transcription factor that contributes to Th1 and Th17 phenotypes in CD4 T cells. T-bet is prevalent in cytolytic innate lymphocytes residing in tissues and B cells of mouse strains prone to autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Plank et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Nixon and Li, 2018</xref>). The increased activity of T-bet in SLAMF6 -/- CD8+ T cells implies that T-bet-regulated pathways may operate in CD8+ T cells in the absence of functioning SLAMF6, generating ‘type 1’ inflammatory traits and high cytotoxicity. The improved production of IFN-γ and GM-CSF, in parallel with reduced IL-10 and IL-13, is also typical for type one phenotypes.</p><p>SLAMF6 should be distinguished from typical exhaustion markers because it is expressed on CD8+ T cells, regardless of their state of activation. Yigit et al. suggested that blocking SLAMF6 using an antibody can correct the exhaustion phase of T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Yigit et al., 2019</xref>), but we favor the notion that SLAMF6 hampers T cells at any stage, as reflected from the functional superiority of short-term activated Pmel-1 T cells. Depleting SLAMF6 improved CD8+ T cells in the short and long-term, as was most evident when the WT Pmel-1 cells induced the regression of melanoma only for a limited period while the Pmel-1 x SLAMF6 -/- cells led to lasting responses in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>).</p><p>While searching for new immunotherapeutic targets, the field of immunotherapy is moving to combination therapies, and to biomarker-based treatment choices, to target the escape mechanisms used by tumors. From the results presented here, we conclude that SLAMF6 is an important checkpoint receptor with a significant inhibitory effect on T cells. The balance between SLAMF6 and LAG-3, and the enhancing effect of LAG3 blocking suggests that targeting both may have a valuable combinatorial, and perhaps even a synergistic, effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G–I</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we have shown that SLAMF6 is a constitutive inhibitory immune receptor; in its absence, CD8+ T cells acquire stronger reactivity against tumor cells. The strong effector trait is attributed to a series of T-bet-mediated transcriptional events that drive CD8+ T cells to exert strong cytotoxicity and achieve long-lasting tumor control. SLAMF6 is an attractive target for the development of checkpoint inhibitors for systemic treatment of cancer and for the improvement of antitumor cellular therapies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background <italic>Mus musculus</italic> Female)</td><td>C57BL/6</td><td>Harlan laboratories</td><td>C57BL/6</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background <italic>Mus musculus</italic> Female)</td><td>Pmel-1</td><td>This paper</td><td>Pmel-1</td><td>Kind gift from M.

Follow up was conducted until day 30.</p></list-item></list><p>Animal studies were approved by the Institutional Review Board - Authority for biological and biomedical models, Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel (MD-14602–5 and MD-15421–5).</p><p><italic>Statistics</italic>. Statistical significance was determined by unpaired t-test (two-tailed with equal SD) using Prism software (GraphPad). A p-value&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Analysis of more than two groups was performed using the one-way ANOVA test. *, p≤0.05; **, p≤0.01; ***, p≤0.001. For each experiment, the number of replicates performed and the statistical test used are stated in the corresponding figure legend.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors wish to acknowledge the devoted technical work of Anna Kuznetz and Yael Gelfand.

The authors showed that SLAMF6 expression on human T cells was increased following T cell activation, although it is constitutively expressed on T cells. The SLAMF6 positive murine B16 melanoma specific T cells (Pmel-1) were significantly inhibited by SLAMF6 overly expressed melanoma cells than the mock melanoma cells, suggesting trans-acting effects. Pmel-1xSLAMF6 KO T cells that the authors newly generated had stronger functionality with more IFN-g and granzyme producing ability in vitro, and adoptive transfer of SLAMF6 KO T cells had stronger anti-tumor effects against the parental B16 melanoma. In terms of molecular mechanisms of action, decreased SAP adaptor protein in activated T cells with t-bet expression were found to be related to the increased T cell activity. In addition, persistent expression of LAG3 on the activated Pmel-1xSLAMF6 KO T cells was found, and addition of anti-LAG3 in vitro further increased IFN-g production of these T cells, suggesting of possible combination therapy with anti-LAG3 Ab and SLAMF6 KO T cells for cancer immunotherapy. The authors concluded that SLAMF6 is an inhibitory receptor and a possible target for cancer immunotherapy.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>It was reported that SLAM6 reduces TCR signal strength in iNKT cells (Lu et al., 2019) and soluble SLAMF6 induces strong CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell effector function and improves anti-melanoma activity in vivo (Eisenberg et al., 2018). These previous studies demonstrated that SLAMF6 is a negative regulator of TCR signaling, and blockage of SLAMF6 signaling improves anti-tumor immunity. Therefore, basic negative roles on T cells of SLAMF6 and its potential interventions for cancer immunotherapy has previously been reported. However, detailed analyses of SLAMF6-deficient T cells specific for tumor antigen in this study, including trans-acting effect, involvement of SAP and T-bet, and specific relation to LAG3 expression, is interesting. Clarification of the current results and additional experiments for further mechanisms and possible clinical application may strengthen the impact of this study for possible publication.</p><p>1) It is still unclear whether inhibitory homotypic interaction of SLAMF6 for tumor-specific CTL is dependent on either cis or trans interaction, or both. In vitro and in vivo experiments to evaluate SLAMF6-WT or KO melanoma specific T cells against SLAMF6 overexpressed and mock B16-F10 melanoma should be performed. Experiments using SLAMF6-WT or KO APC incubated with SLAMF6-WT or KO gp100-specific TCR transgenic T cells should be performed.</p><p>2) Authors should examine T cell exhaustion status in the SLAMF6 knockout mice by using RNA-seq analysis. Since some studies suggested that SLAMF-family are expressed in pre-exhausted TIL cells which are considered as one of the targets for PD-1 Ab therapy (e.g., Nat Immunol. 201910:1335; Cancer Immunol Res 9:1485, 2019; Immunity 50:181, 2019).</p><p>3) For therapeutic point of view, authors should show anti-tumor effects of SLAMF6 knockout human T cells +/- anti-LAG3 Ab in vitro and in vivo xenogenic mouse study, and also evaluate anti-SLAM6 Ab +/- anti-LAG3 Ab in syngeneic mouse models.

Our paper (Eisenberg et al., 2018) relates to T cell activation by ligand mimicry that can be interpreted as an independent agonist mechanism rather than a disclosure of the real nature of the SLAMF6 receptor. Lu et al. (2019) relates to iNKT development in primal stages. It was never shown that SLAMF6 is as strictly inhibitory in T cells as reflected in the SLAMF6<sup>-/-</sup> mice experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) It is still unclear whether inhibitory homotypic interaction of SLAMF6 for tumor-specific CTL is dependent on either cis or trans interaction, or both. In vitro and in vivo experiments to evaluate SLAMF6-WT or KO melanoma specific T cells against SLAMF6 overexpressed and mock B16-F10 melanoma should be performed. Experiments using SLAMF6-WT or KO APC incubated with SLAMF6-WT or KO gp100-specific TCR transgenic T cells should be performed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for suggesting completing this aspect of the research. Indeed, the data emerging from the added experiments now strengthen the inhibitory effect of SLAMF6 in a bilateral set of interactions.</p><p>Figures 5A-C were added to the revised manuscript and are described in subsection “The contribution of <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> SLAMF6 interactions to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell function”, and in the legend of Figure 5. The results show that the lack of SLAMF6 on the T cells or the target cells leads to a better response, suggesting that SLAMF6 plays a regulatory role both when expressed on the effectors (cis) and the targets (trans). This aspect is also dealt with in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Authors should examine T cell exhaustion status in the SLAMF6 knockout mice by using RNA-seq analysis. Since some studies suggested that SLAMF-family are expressed in pre-exhausted TIL cells which are considered as one of the targets for PD-1 Ab therapy (e.g., Nat Immunol. 201910:1335; Cancer Immunol Res 9:1485, 2019; Immunity 50:181, 2019).</p></disp-quote><p>The murine model we used does not induce T cell exhaustion because it is an adoptive T cell transfer system, meant to evaluate the tumor destruction capacity of lymphocytes. Exhaustion is better evaluated in the context of chronic infection or chronic response to ongoing cancer, which is not the case here. However, checkpoint molecules that are linked to the exhaustion state were examined (Figure 6E), and among them, the most striking one was LAG-3. In the references mentioned by reviewers, SLAMF6 is considered an important player in pre-exhaustion, but this, per se, does not imply that SLAMF6 plays a negative or an agonist role.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) For therapeutic point of view, authors should show anti-tumor effects of SLAMF6 knockout human T cells +/- anti-LAG3 Ab in vitro and in vivo xenogenic mouse study, and also evaluate anti-SLAM6 Ab +/- anti-LAG3 Ab in syngeneic mouse models. Confirmation of in vivo combination effects of SLAMF6 blockade and anti-LAG3 Ab is particularly important for this study.</p></disp-quote><p>Here, again, the reviewers’ comment contributed to the strength of the data. We performed an adoptive transfer experiment comparing SLAMF6 knockout T cells with or without the addition of an anti-murine LAG-3 Ab. Figure 6G-I show that the addition of LAG-3 blockade to ACT expedites tumor shrinkage compared to SLAMF KO T cells alone. Note that ACT with SLAMF6 KO T cells only is already very effective, but even so – it could be improved.</p><p>The revised data is in subsection “Mechanism associated with the inhibitory function of SLAMF6” and in the legend of Figure 6, and is dealt with in the Discussion section. Regarding the effect of anti-SLAM6 Abs with or without the addition of anti-LAG-3 Abs, Yigit et al. (2018) have demonstrated an agonistic effect of anti-SLAMF6 (NT7, Biolegend). However, in our experimental systems, this antibody did not improve the T cell response, and therefore we did not use it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In Figure 2E showing tumor growth data, and Figure 4H-J showing tumor growth and mouse survival data, it is not clear that the differences are significant or not. Appropriate statistical analyses should be performed.</p></disp-quote><p>We added this information to the figures and the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Figure 2, to make sure that SLAMF6 is responsible for the different anti-tumor effects, evaluation of additional SLAMF6 overexpressed tumor models, SLAM6 knock down, or neutralization of this effects by anti-SLAMF6 Ab, may be performed.</p></disp-quote><p>The Pmel-1 adoptive transfer model is considered the best experimental model to capture the natural situation of the CD8 T cell response against a native tumor-derived antigen. For this reason, we adhered to this model. However, in addition, we evaluated the effect of SLAMF6 in EL4 cells, a thymoma cell line derived from a C57BL/6 (H-2b) mouse, ectopically expressing SLAMF6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In Figure 3B, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell percentage in spleen of SLAMF6-KO x Pmel-1 mouse is lower than that of SLAMF6-WT x Pmel-1 mouse, suggesting that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell development may be impaired in SLAMF6-KO x Pmel-1 mouse thymus.

Flow cytometric analysis of SLAMF6-KO x Pmel-1 mouse thymus may find new function of SLAMF6.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that T cell development in the absence of SLAMF6 is interesting; however, it was beyond the scope of this work.</p></body></sub-article></article>
