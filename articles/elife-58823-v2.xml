antiporter that belongs to SLC30 family and plays an essential role in regulating Zn<sup>2+</sup> accumulation in the insulin secretory granules of pancreatic β cells. However, the Zn<sup>2+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange mechanism of ZnT8 remains unclear due to the lack of high-resolution structures. Here, we report the cryo-EM structures of human ZnT8 (HsZnT8) in both outward- and inward-facing conformations. HsZnT8 forms a dimeric structure with four Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding sites within each subunit: a highly conserved primary site in transmembrane domain (TMD) housing the Zn<sup>2+</sup> substrate; an interfacial site between TMD and C-terminal domain (CTD) that modulates the Zn<sup>2+</sup> transport activity of HsZnT8; and two adjacent sites buried in the cytosolic domain and chelated by conserved residues from CTD and the His-Cys-His (HCH) motif from the N-terminal segment of the neighboring subunit. A comparison of the outward- and inward-facing structures reveals that the TMD of each HsZnT8 subunit undergoes a large structural rearrangement, allowing for alternating access to the primary Zn<sup>2+</sup> site during the transport cycle. Collectively, our studies provide the structural insights into the Zn<sup>2+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange mechanism of HsZnT8.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>zinc transporter</kwd><kwd>ZnT8</kwd><kwd>insulin secretory granules</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM136976</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bai</surname><given-names>Xiao-chen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-1944</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bai</surname><given-names>Xiao-chen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004917</institution-id><institution>Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RP160082</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bai</surname><given-names>Xiao-chen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Youxing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM079179</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Youxing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-1578</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Youxing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Virginia Murchison Linthicum Scholar in Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bai</surname><given-names>Xiao-chen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cryo-EM analysis of human ZnT8 reveals a large conformational change of TMD during the transport cycle.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Zn<sup>2+</sup>, as a structural and catalytic cofactor, plays crucial roles in regulating protein functions, and thereby is essential for many cellular processes, including cell development and immunological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Maret, 2013</xref>). Not surprisingly, Zn<sup>2+</sup> deficiency can lead to a variety of disabling human diseases, such as diabetes, cancer and Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Prasad, 2013</xref>). In humans, the intracellular level of zinc is tightly regulated by two major Zn<sup>2+</sup> transporter families, the SLC39 (ZIPs) family and the SLC30 (ZnTs) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eide, 2006</xref>). ZIPs mediate the Zn<sup>2+</sup> uptake either from the extracellular space or organelle into cytosolic space, whereas ZnTs transport Zn<sup>2+</sup> in the opposite direction. ZnT8, one of the 10 ZnTs that have been identified so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chimienti et al., 2004</xref>), is localized in the insulin secretory granules of pancreatic β cells and responsible for the accumulation of high level of zinc inside granules, which is required for the packing of insulin in the hexameric form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davidson et al., 2014</xref>). ZnT8 knock-out in mice leads to severe defects in insulin processing, storage and secretion as well as glucose tolerance, indicating its critical role in β-cell function and glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pound et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wijesekara et al., 2010</xref>). Indeed, the aberrant function of ZnT8 is linked to both type 1 and 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chabosseau and Rutter, 2016</xref>). ZnT8 has been shown to be one of the major autoantigens in type 1 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wenzlau et al., 2007</xref>), and autoantibodies against ZnT8 (ZnT8A) can be detected in ~70% of young patients with type 1 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kawasaki, 2012</xref>). In addition, an R325W mutation of ZnT8 has been shown to increase the risk of type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Scott et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sladek et al., 2007</xref>). On the other hand, in a 2014 study, researchers also identified 12 rare loss-of-function mutations caused by truncation in ZnT8 that can lead to a 65% reduction in the risk of type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Flannick et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, ZnT8 has become an important target for diagnosis, prevention or intervention of both of type 1 and 2 diabetes.</p><p>ZnT8 functions as a Zn<sup>2+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ohana et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shusterman et al., 2014</xref>). Despite of extensive biochemical and physiological studies of ZnT8, our understanding of its Zn<sup>2+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange mechanism is hindered by the lack of high-resolution structures of ZnT8 in different transporting states. To date, the structures of YiiP, a bacterial member of SLC30 family that is distantly related to human ZnT8 with 14% sequence identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), have been determined by X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coudray et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lopez-Redondo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lu and Fu, 2007</xref>), and these structures have been used as the model for ZnT8. The crystal structure of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> YiiP (EcYiiP) was determined in an outward-facing conformation at 2.9 Å resolution and the transporter forms a ‘V’-shaped homodimer, with each subunit consisting of a transmembrane domain (TMD) with six membrane-spanning helices and a cytosolic C-terminal domain (CTD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lu and Fu, 2007</xref>). Distinct from the crystal structure of EcYiiP, the cryo-EM structure of <italic>Shewanella oneidensis</italic> YiiP (SoYiiP) was determined in an inward-facing conformation at 4.1 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coudray et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lopez-Redondo et al., 2018</xref>). Comparison of the two structures reveals major conformational changes in the TMD. Since the two structures of YiiP were determined by different methods with the proteins stabilized in different chemical environments (lipid vs detergent), it is unclear whether the observed structural differences truly reflect the conformational changes upon Zn<sup>2+</sup> transport. In light of their low-sequence similarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), it is also unclear whether human ZnT8 (HsZnT8) shares the same Zn<sup>2+</sup> transport mechanism as bacterial YiiP. Here, we determine the cryo-EM structures of HsZnT8 in both outward (luminal)- and inward (cytosolic)-facing states. These structures reveal a large number of novel features in HsZnT8 that are distinct from bacterial YiiP. Structural comparison between the two states elucidates the conformational rearrangements at the TMD of each ZnT8 subunit during Zn<sup>2+</sup> transport cycle. Our structural results, together with mutagenesis and cell based functional assays, illustrate a plausible Zn<sup>2+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange mechanism in ZnT8 and also provide a structure platform for diabetes drug development targeting HsZnT8.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structure determination of HsZnT8</title><p>HsZnT8 isoform B lacking the N-terminal 49 residues gave higher protein expression than the full-length isoform A and was used for structure determination in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref>). To be consistent with the amino acid numbering used for isoform A in other studies, the starting residue of isoform B is numbered as 50 in the subsequent description of our structural and functional analyses. The purified HsZnT8 in digitonin detergent formed a dimer in solution and eluted as a monodisperse peak on size exclusion chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b</xref>). The small size of HsZnT8 (about 70 kDa as a dimer) imposed a high technical challenge for its structure determination using cryo-EM. Volta phase plate was employed in data collection to enhance the contrast for better image alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Danev and Baumeister, 2016</xref>), and the initial data was collected using the wild-type HsZnT8 (HsZnT8-WT) sample prepared in the presence of Zn<sup>2+</sup> (1 mM). The single particle reconstruction yielded a map of the transporter in an outward-facing conformation, but the overall resolution of 4.1 Å is insufficient for accurate model building (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Subsequently, we introduced two mutations, D110N and D224N, at the predicted primary Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding site within the TMD of HsZnT8 (HsZnT8-DM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoch et al., 2012</xref>). As the primary site functions as the transfer center for Zn<sup>2+</sup> transport, we reasoned that by abolishing its Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding capability, the HsZnT8-DM mutant could potentially stabilize the transporter in a specific state. Indeed, the double mutations appeared to further stabilize the transporter in outward-facing conformation and data collected using HsZnT8-DM sample prepared in the absence of Zn<sup>2+</sup> yielded a map of the outward-facing transporter with an improved resolution (~3.8 Å) as compared to HsZnT8-WT, allowing us to build a near complete model containing 302 out of 320 residues for each subunit, with the help of the crystal structure of EcYiiP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4a</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the EM data collected with HsZnT8-WT in the absence of Zn<sup>2+</sup> yielded a structure of the dimeric transporter with heterogeneous conformations- one subunit in an inward-facing and the other in an outward-facing conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similar heterogeneous conformations have been observed in other multimeric transporters, such as nucleoside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hirschi et al., 2017</xref>) and glutamate transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arkhipova et al., 2020</xref>). Albeit the cryo-EM structure of HsZnT8-WT in the absence of Zn<sup>2+</sup> was determined at a low overall resolution (5.9 Å), the secondary structure features were well resolved for both TMD and CTD, enabling us to build a relatively accurate model for the inward-facing subunit by rigid-body fitting of the individual transmembrane helix and CTD from the outward-facing structure into the map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1g</xref>). Furthermore, the density for most of the linkers between adjacent transmembrane helices were well defined in the cryo-EM map, further facilitating the model building of the inward-facing structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1g</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Overall structure of HsZnT8 in the outward-facing conformation</title><p>The structure of HsZnT8 in the outward-facing state shows a ‘V’-shaped dimeric architecture similar to the crystal structure of EcYiiP, with the two TMDs forming the branches, whereas the two tightly packed CTDs located at the base of the ‘V’ and mediating the majority of the dimerization interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5a</xref>).

Notably, Phe134 comes from the extended loop between TM2 and TM3 of TMD, which protrudes into the CTD of the neighboring subunit and tucks into the pocket between β1 and the C-terminal tail. The CTD dimerization also involves multiple hydrogen bonding interactions, for example the H-bonds between Arg331s and Gln350s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>).</p><p>Arg325, whose mutation (R325W) is associated with higher risk of type 2 diabetes, is located in a short loop (residues 321–327) between β2 and α2 of CTD. This loop has also been proposed to be the antigen epitope for autoantibodies from type 1 diabetes patients. Structurally, the two epitope loops in HsZnT8 dimer are physically separated from each other and completely exposed to the cytosolic solution at the distal tip of CTD, providing ample space for antibody access (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). On the contrary, the two equivalent loops in EcYiiP dimer are tightly packed with each other and contribute to part of the dimerization contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5d</xref>). As the epitope loop is remote from the Zn<sup>2+</sup> transport pathway, it is unclear how R325W mutation and the binding of autoantibodies to this loop affect the transporter function.</p><p>Among the six transmembrane helices (TM1-TM6) in the TMD of each HsZnT8 subunit, TMs 3 and 6 also participate in the dimerization through hydrophobic interactions with their counter parts from the neighboring subunit at the cytosolic leaflet of the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). In addition, Arg138s at the N-terminal ends of TM3s and Glu276s at the C-terminal ends of TM6s from both subunits converge at the cytosolic surface of the membrane and form a cluster of salt bridges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). The extensive dimerization interactions at CTDs as well as TMs 3 and 6 imply that these parts of the protein likely remain static during Zn<sup>2+</sup> transport cycle, leaving other part of the TMD (TMs 1, 2, 4 and 5) undergo conformational changes as will be further discussed later.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding sites in CTD</title><p>The structure of HsZnT8-DM reveals two adjacent Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding sites (designated as S<sub>CD1</sub> and S<sub>CD2</sub>) within each CTD, in a pocket encircled by the U-shaped loop near the C-terminus of the protein right after β3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–c</xref>).

Notably, His52, Cys53 and His54 come from the HCH (His52-Cys53-His54) motif at the N-terminus of the neighboring HsZnT8 subunit. The HCH motif seals off S<sub>CD1</sub> and S<sub>CD2</sub>, making the two bound Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions buried in the protein. As the HsZnT8-DM sample was prepared in the absence of Zn<sup>2+</sup>, the bound Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions likely come from the host cells for protein expression and appear to be integral part of the protein with high-affinity binding. The HCH motif is highly conserved in ZnT8s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>) as well as some subfamilies of ZnT, but is not present in YiiP transporter whose N-terminus does not participate in Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In sharp contrast, the regions that participate in dimerization of HsZnT8, including CTD, TM3 and TM6, can all be well superimposed between the structures of inward and outward-facing conformations, indicating that these regions remain static during Zn<sup>2+</sup> transport cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d,e</xref>).

In the inward-facing conformation of HsZnT8, TM1 packs tightly against TM2 in a manner similar to that in the outward-facing conformation. TM1 of SoYiiP, however, rotates away from TM2 during the transition from outward- to inward-facing states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3d</xref>). As mentioned above, the tethering of the N-terminal segment of HsZnT8 to CTD may restrain the flexibility of TM1 and limit its rocking rotation upon conformational change. This explains why the TM1s of HsZnT8 and SoYiiP undergo different types of structural changes during the transport cycle. We also noticed that, HsZnT8 adopts a more open inward-facing conformation as compared to SoYiiP, due to the altered position of TM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">3d</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that, the wide open cytosolic cavity in the inward-facing conformation of HsZnT8 could facilitate the fast diffusion of Zn<sup>2+</sup> from the cytosol to the primary Zn<sup>2+</sup> site in TMD and thereby may increase the efficiency of Zn<sup>2+</sup> uptake into insulin granule.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>The mechanism for Zn<sup>2+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiport in HsZnT8</title><p>The conformational heterogeneity of HsZnT8-WT in the absence of Zn<sup>2+</sup> along with small size of the protein likely causes difficulty in obtaining a high-resolution cryo-EM structure. However, the observation of different conformations between the two subunits within each HsZnT8-WT dimer implies that the Zn<sup>2+</sup> transport activity of HsZnT8 is unlikely to be coupled between the two subunits within a dimer, allowing each subunit to carry out Zn<sup>2+</sup> transport activity independently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). No occluded state has been observed in all of our structural analysis, leading us to suggest a simple two-state model for Zn<sup>2+</sup> transport function of HsZnT8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Each transporter subunit may simply shuttle between inward- and outward-facing states with S<sub>TM</sub> housing the Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion in a pH-dependent manner. At inward-facing state, higher cytosolic pH environment allows for high-affinity Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding at S<sub>TM</sub>. The presence of a secondary Zn<sup>2+</sup> site at the cytosolic entrance of the ion pathway may help increase the local Zn<sup>2+</sup> concentration and facilitate the Zn<sup>2+</sup> occupancy at S<sub>TM</sub> even at low concentration. Upon moving to the outward-facing state, S<sub>TM</sub> becomes exposed to the low pH environment of the insulin secretory granule and the subsequent protonation of S<sub>TM</sub>, likely through the two histidines, effectively reduce the Zn<sup>2+</sup> affinity and promote its release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). The transporter would then move back to inward-facing states where the apo S<sub>TM</sub> gets deprotonated at higher pH and ready for the next transport cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>).

Our structural and functional analyses reveal a total of 4 Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding sites in each subunit, including one primary site in the TMD (S<sub>TM</sub>), one site at the interface between TMD and CTD (S<sub>IF</sub>), and two adjacent sites located in an open pocket of CTD covered by a HCH motif from the N-terminal segment of neighboring subunit (S<sub>CD1</sub> and S<sub>CD2</sub>). The primary Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding site in the TMD of ZnT8 consists of His-Asp-His-Asp residues, with one residue difference as compared to Asp-Asp-His-Asp of YiiP. It has been shown that the replacement of Asp to His in the primary site of ZnTs significantly increases the specificity of Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoch et al., 2012</xref>). We proposed that the weak binding of Zn<sup>2+</sup> to the interfacial site S<sub>IF</sub> in HsZnT8 may help to increase local Zn<sup>2+</sup> concentration at the entrance of cytosolic ion pathway, which could facilitate the recruitment of cytosolic Zn<sup>2+</sup> to the primary site in TMD. Indeed, our cell based uptake assay showed that disruption of S<sub>IF</sub> markedly reduced the transport activity of HsZnT8. This interfacial Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding site is not present in YiiP.</p><p>The two adjacent Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding sites in CTD, S<sub>CD1</sub> and S<sub>CD2</sub>, are localized in a similar position between ZnT8 and YiiP, but are formed by very different structural elements. In HsZnT8, S<sub>CD1</sub> and S<sub>CD2</sub> is surrounded by the β-sheet and C-terminal tail of CTD from one subunit and the N-terminal segment from the other. Therefore, the binding of Zn<sup>2+</sup> to S<sub>CD1</sub> and S<sub>CD2</sub> in HsZnT8 will anchor each CTD to the TMD of the neighboring subunit. In contrast, both of C-terminal tail of CTD and N-terminal segment are not involved in the formation of S<sub>CD1</sub> and S<sub>CD2</sub> in YiiP. Instead, S<sub>CD1</sub> and S<sub>CD2</sub> of YiiP is sandwiched between two neighboring CTDs, such that the binding of Zn<sup>2+</sup> to S<sub>CD1</sub> and S<sub>CD2</sub> plays an important role in the dimerization of CTD in YiiP.</p><p>A comparison of our outward- and inward-facing structures of HsZnT8 reveals detailed structural rearrangements within each TMD during the transport cycle. Importantly, the motions observed during the transition from outward- to inward-facing states are significantly different between ZnT8 and YiiP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Firstly, different from YiiP, no inter-TMDs rotation occurs during the transport cycle of ZnT8. The positions of TM3 and 6 of HsZnT8 remain unchanged between outward- and inward-facing states. Secondly, due to the tethering of HCH motif in the N-terminal segment to CTD, the movement of TM1 of HsZnT8 is largely restricted. As a result, TM1 of HsZnT8 undergoes distinct structural rearrangement between outward- and inward-facing states, as compared to that of YiiP, leading to a wider opening of cytosolic cavity in the inward conformation, which might be important for the efficient diffusion of Zn<sup>2+</sup> from the cytosol to the primary Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding site in TMD. This observation partially explains why the HCH motif is critical for the transport activity of HsZnT8. Notably, mutation of a single residue in the HCH motif of ZnT2 (H54R) was directly linked with transient neonatal zinc deficiency (TNZD), further indicating the significance of this motif in the function of SLC30 family of zinc transporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chowanadisai et al., 2006</xref>). It also worth noting that similar HCH motif has been found in the C-terminus of copper importer Ctr1 that can bind Cu<sup>2+</sup> and is important for the regulation of Ctr1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Maryon et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our structural and functional analyses provide a wealth of information for defining the Zn<sup>2+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter mechanism of HsZnT8. Additionally, our detailed structural model of HsZnT8 presented here provide a basis for understanding a number of mutations in ZnT8 that are associated with diabetes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), and may serve as the template for homologous modeling of other members in SLC30 family.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="bottom">Designation</th><th valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">TOP10</td><td valign="bottom">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td valign="bottom">Cat# 18258012</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">DH10bac</td><td valign="bottom">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td valign="bottom">Cat# 10361012</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">Sf9 cells</td><td valign="bottom">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td valign="bottom">Cat# 11496015;

several cryo-EM structures of human zinc transporter ZnT8, which uses the transmembrane proton gradient to pump zinc into insulin secretory granules. There, zinc is necessary to pack insulin into secretion-ready hexameric form. The structures push the technical capabilities of cryo-EM because of the comparatively small size of the transporter. They reveal the transport mechanism, the location of mutations associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes, and the location of the loop that has been proposed to be the target of autoantibodies in type 1 diabetes patients.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Cryo-EM structures of human ZnT8 in both outward- and inward-facing conformations&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Olga Boudker as the Senior and Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Aravind Penmatsa (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript reports cryo-EM structures of the dimeric human ZnT8 from the ZIP protein family in the outward-facing conformation at 3.8 Å and inward-facing conformation at a moderate resolution of 5.9 Å. The authors manage to reconstruct the structure of this sub-100kDa (~70kDa) Zn transporter using the phase plate and the study joins a small but increasing list of integral membrane transporter structures recently elucidated through cryo-EM. The biomedical importance of ZnT8 in insulin secretion, Zn enrichment in secretory granules, and elucidation of different conformations along the transport cycle make this study highly relevant. However, more rigorous data analysis and presentation are required to warrant publication. Below are the points raised by the reviewers that would need to be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The major concern is with the certainty that the authors claim the presence/absence of Zn<sup>2+</sup>, especially since the wild-type structures solved with and without Zn<sup>2+</sup> are at only ~4 Å and ~6 Å resolutions.</p><p>Throughout the entire manuscript and figures, there are no indications of statistical significance for interpreting cryo-EM densities. It is important that the displayed/compared volumes show parts of the map that have a corresponding level of significance. This is especially concerning the presence and absence of the Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion density (Figure 2). In making direct comparisons between density maps that contain different statistical compositions and distributions it is essential to scale and normalize the maps with respect to the lowest quality map. Then displaying the normalized data and stating a number of sigmas above the mean threshold to which the density is present, would allow for evaluation of the density maps on an equal footing. This should be explicitly stated in Materials and methods section and figure legends should this measure have been carried out. Moreover, a density difference map should be calculated to adequately satisfy the author's statements of 'unequivocal' and 'clear' presence of Zn<sup>2+</sup> (subsections “Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding sites in CTD” and “Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding sites in TMD”). However, even at ~4 Å and ~6 Å resolutions, there is still a potential for the presence of noise to be misinterpreted as Zn<sup>2+</sup> density, and I suggest the authors rephrase their strong assertions of modeling ions at this resolution.</p><p>2) Subsection “Structural determination of HsZnT8”: building a relatively accurate model at 5.9 Å for the HsZnT8-WT in the absence of Zn<sup>2+</sup> is quite a bit of a stretch, and side chains cannot accurately be modeled at this resolution. Interpretations should be limited to what one can observe in the density map and leave speculation for the discussion. Moreover, the model for this structure should be deposited as C-α representations, since minimal side-chain densities are observed.</p><p>3) HsZnT8-DM in the absence of Zn<sup>2+</sup> (Figure 1—figure supplement 2), there appears to be quite a bit of variation in the central TMs (TM6 and TM3) after initial 3D refinement. Some explanation should be provided for this, given that this domain is proposed to be static (subsection “Structural changes from outward- to inward-facing states”). Additionally, were the other classes refined? If so, to what resolutions? Even at 6 Å, as in HsZnT8-WT, some interpretations could expand the understanding of the protein dynamics.</p><p>4) The data is presented in a way that it is very difficult to assess the statement &quot;the two conformations appear to be energetically equivalent, allowing the transporter to be evenly distributed between the two conformations.&quot; (See subsection “The mechanism for Zn<sup>2+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporting in HsZnT8”). Consider revising or provide more substantial evidence for the energetics and &quot;even distribution&quot;.</p><p>5) The authors should include additional discussion of what is known about the Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding affinity for each of the sites and physiologically relevant available Zn<sup>2+</sup> concentrations? Would the transporters ever see an environment in which there is no Zn<sup>2+</sup> present?</p><p>6) The authors have proposed that the structures will provide insights into human disease, but fail to follow through on this. Can disease-causing mutations be mapped to the structures generated in this study or homology models created for this purpose? This would elevate your claim and provide substantial advancement in understanding diabetes.</p><p>7) Figure 2 legend should be re-written for clarity as it does not specifically indicate which structure/condition is presented. The threshold for evidence of density should be presented and translated into a number of sigmas above the mean.</p><p>8) Subsection “Overall structure of HsZnT8 in the outward-facing conformation”: The statement, &quot;Notably, clear lipid density is visible in the space between the two TMDs&quot; should be supported with a figure displaying the densities as well as further discussion on its identity.</p><p>9) In the Zn<sup>2+</sup> uptake experiments (subsection “Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding sites in CTD”), it is unclear how the data was normalized. The particulars of the data processing were omitted in the Materials and methods section, directing the reader to the figure legend (subsection “Vesicular zinc uptake assay”), where there is no indication of how data was normalized to protein expression.</p><p>10) Subsection “Structural determination of HsZnT8”: The authors state HsZnT8-WT in the absence of Zn<sup>2+</sup> yielded heterogeneous conformations however, Figure 3—figure supplement 1 does not depict this.</p><p>11) How do the solvent-accessible transport pathways appear as a 3D volume in the inward- and outward-facing structures?</p><p>12) Subsection “Model building, refinement and validation”: Is the modeling really de novo if a template from the crystal structure was used? This should be rephrased to better represent the contribution of previous structural information.</p><p>13) Upon examining the coordinates of the three deposited structures it is evident that in the WT HsZnT8 reported without Zinc, the authors model D110 and D224 as asparagines in chain B at site STM. This is a likely modeling error of the authors as it is fairly clear that the authors are reporting HsZnT8 structure without Zinc in the WT state and not as a heterodimer of HsZnT8DM (CH B) and WT HsZnT8 (CH A).</p><p>14) Among the residues involved in the charge interlock (R138; E276) between TMs 3 and 6 there is a break in the symmetry between the residues in the WT ZnT8 structure lacking Zinc. The E276 of chain A is positioned away from forming a salt bridge interaction in the structure. Given the poor resolution of this structure, the side chain density is likely not visible in this case. However, given the lack of any structural changes in the cytosolic domains the authors may correct the orientation of this side chain.</p><p>15) The H106 which should be coordinating with Zn in the WT structure is modeled away from the Zinc. The imidazole ring should be brought closer within the coordinating radius of the STM Zn ion in the WT-Zn bound structure.</p><p>16) The structural comparisons between outward and inward-facing conformations in Figure 3 would be best be represented with the addition of interhelical angles to represent structural transitions particularly between TMs 1, 2, 4 and 5 which undergo substantial changes.</p><p>17) None of the figures showing structural overlaps report C-α RMSD values, be it within ZnT8 structure or the comparison between nZnT8 and EcYiiP/SoYiiP structures. The authors could even consider including a table with domain wise RMSD comparisons between different structures.</p><p>18) Despite drawing an extensive comparison between the EcYiiP and SoYiip with HsZnT8, the MSA in Figure 1—figure supplement 5 does not report structure-based sequence comparison between HsZnT8 vs. the prokaryotic Zn transporters. Having this multiple sequence alignment would help the readers significantly.</p><p>19) The authors do not particularly indicate the concentrations of Zn used in their work. It is not clear from the methods or the text as to what is the concentration of zinc when they say 'presence of Zn'.</p><p>20) The Zn uptake assay displaying activity is a fairly qualitative one and does not report any kinetic parameters. Would the authors be able to provide KM and Vmax values for the transport and their mutants as part of the revision?</p><p>21) The discussion of the putative Zn-binding site at the luminal face of the transporter as potential 'luminal Zn sensor' is speculative at best since the earlier citation by Gola et al., 2019, suggests that there is a loss of transport activity upon mutations of E88 and D103. While this suggests that the residues are important for Zn permeation, it does not indicate as to why the site could sense Zn. Also, if the site senses Zn at high concentrations the transport activity is likely to be retained except at high luminal Zn levels. The authors may consider altering this part of the Discussion section.</p><p>22) The dual conformation found in the WT ZnT8 structure in the absence of Zinc is a rather interesting observation. While it is plausible that the transporter has a two-state model without a likely occluded state it would be interesting for the authors to discuss the possibility of the two protomers, transporting Zn, to be decoupled from the dimerization helices and the CTD and transport Zn independent of each other.</p><p>23) The summary figure (Figure 4) can be improved by adding the pH gradients and Zn concentration gradients across the bilayer. The release of Zn inside the secretory granule can be directly depicted as being released from the molecule upon protonation rather than as arrows between two states.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Cryo-EM structures of human ZnT8 in both outward- and inward-facing conformations&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Olga Boudker as Senior and Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>As you will see from the comments below, the reviewers are questioning the assignment of the excess density as a lipid. You should substantiate the assignment and edit the text to reflect uncertainty.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors have carefully addressed the concerns that I had raised in the earlier version and have made changes both to the text and the figures as recommended. The manuscript figures display marked improvement and provide greater clarity to the reader in this version. I do not have any major concerns and the manuscript can be accepted after a couple of minor concerns are addressed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors have addressed most of the points that were raised in the initial review. I do appreciate the authors' responses, and new analyses and discussions added to the revised manuscript. However, the manuscript still lacks a satisfactory discussion related to the lipids identified in the in HsZnT8 structure. Specific points are given below and need to be addressed.</p><p>- Subsection “Overall structure of HsZnT8 in the outward-facing conformation”: &quot;Notably, clear lipid density is visible in the space between the two TMDs&quot;. While the authors have provided a new figure displaying anticipated lipid density (Figure 1—figure supplement 3C), it remains unclear why these densities were ascribed to lipid molecules. The data presented does not support the identification of a lipid. There is only a small density, no bulky head group and no continuous density to lipid bilayer boundaries. What evidence do you have to support ascribing density as lipid? This density could be due to image processing artifacts, noise, bound detergent, etc. It would be impactful to provide clarification/discussion on identity of lipid-like densities or remove this supposition from the manuscript.</p><p>- Figure 1A legend – the authors should indicate a threshold level used to display the EM density map; if the map was filtered for this display, it should be also indicated in the figure legend.</p><p>- Figure 1—figure supplement 3 – &quot;Lipid densities….&quot; – please provide statistical definition of visualized lipid-like densities. Why these densities were escribed to lipid molecules? It would be impactful to provide some clarification.</p><p>- Figure 1—figure supplement 5 and Figure 1—figure supplement 6. Indicate GI/protein accession numbers for the sequence alignments. Indicate how the multiple alignments were accomplished.</p><p>- Figure 2B,C,D: &quot;The densities for the Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion are displayed as blue mesh (6 σ)…&quot; – Cryo-EM densities shown as a blue mesh at 6σ include protein as well. Consider revising.</p><p>- Figure 2G and Figure 3C – The surface-rendered model of the outward-facing (Figure 2) and inward-facing (Figure 3) subunit from the HsZnT8-WT structure obtained in the absence of Zn. It would make better sense to show both conformations side-by-side in the same figure.</p><p>- Figure 3—figure supplement 1B – The ResMap data could be presented for additional clarity by using an alternate coloring scheme or the same scale as in Figure 1—figure supplement 2.</p><p>- While the % particles in each image processing step used to determine the final map were included as previously requested, the % particles in the discarded maps from 3D classification and 3D refinement will provide additional clarity for data distribution.</p><p>- Indicate if RMSDs are based on C-α or all-atom.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58823.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The major concern is with the certainty that the authors claim the presence/absence of Zn<sup>2+</sup>, especially since the wild-type structures solved with and without Zn<sup>2+</sup> are at only ~4 Å and ~6 Å resolutions.</p><p>Throughout the entire manuscript and figures, there are no indications of statistical significance for interpreting cryo-EM densities.

We have normalized the cryo-EM map of HsZnT8-DM at 3.8 Å resolution to the same grey scale as the cryo-EM map of HsZnT8-WT in the presence of Zn<sup>2+</sup> at 4.1 Å resolution, by using the command “vop scale” in Chimera. We have stated the number of sigmas to which the densities of Zn<sup>2+</sup> are displayed in the figure legend of Figure 2. In addition, we calculated the density difference between the normalized cryo-EM maps of HsZnT8 in the absence and presence of Zn<sup>2+</sup>. This difference map is presented as orange blobs in Figure 2. Following reviewer’s comment, we also removed all the strong assertions, such as “unequivocal”, from the text. The detailed approaches for normalizing the cryo-EM map and calculating the difference map are described in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Subsection “Structural determination of HsZnT8”: building a relatively accurate model at 5.9 Å for the HsZnT8-WT in the absence of Zn<sup>2+</sup> is quite a bit of a stretch, and side chains cannot accurately be modeled at this resolution.

Therefore, the conformational changes of ZnT8 TMD between outward- to inward-facing states are only depicted and discussed at the secondary structure level throughout the entire manuscript. We have removed all the side-chains from the model of HsZnT8-WT in the absence of Zn<sup>2+</sup>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) HsZnT8-DM in the absence of Zn<sup>2+</sup> (Figure 1—figure supplement 2), there appears to be quite a bit of variation in the central TMs (TM6 and TM3) after initial 3D refinement.

Additionally, were the other classes refined? If so, to what resolutions? Even at 6 Å, as in HsZnT8-WT, some interpretations could expand the understanding of the protein dynamics.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank this reviewer for raising this question. After we align all classes shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 2 together, all the TMs between different classes can be perfectly overlapped with each other (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>), suggesting that there are no conformational variations in TMs among all these classes. It has been well known that the extreme hydrophobic air-water interface on the cryo-EM grids may potentially damage protein complex. It is possible that the particles from other “bad” classes may be damaged more than those selected from this single “good” class, which could explain why the 3D reconstruction for other classes were determined in similar conformations but at lower resolution.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-58823-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The data is presented in a way that it is very difficult to assess the statement &quot;the two conformations appear to be energetically equivalent, allowing the transporter to be evenly distributed between the two conformations.&quot; (See subsection “The mechanism for Zn<sup>2+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporting in HsZnT8”).

Indeed, we don’t know for certain that the outward- and inward-facing conformations are energetically equivalent in HsZnT8. We also can’t provide more evidence to support this statement. We, therefore, remove this statement from the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors should include additional discussion of what is known about the Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding affinity for each of the sites and physiologically relevant available Zn<sup>2+</sup> concentrations?

As there are totally 4 different Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding sites in each subunit of ZnT8, it would be difficult to measure the Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding affinity for each site individually.</p><p>The free Zn<sup>2+</sup> concentration in cytosol is between 200 pM to 1.5 nM; whereas the free Zn<sup>2+</sup> concentration in insulin secretory granule is about 120 nM. Thus, there are always Zn<sup>2+</sup> present on both cytosolic and luminal sides of ZnT8, although the Zn<sup>2+</sup> concentration difference between the two sides are more than 100 fold. We have added this information in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors have proposed that the structures will provide insights into human disease, but fail to follow through on this.

We have repeated all the uptake assays. The results of western blot analysis of HsZnT8 WT and mutants are shown in Figure 2H, indicating the protein expression level in each uptake assay. β-actin was used as the loading control. The relative expression level for each HsZnT8 sample was calculated through the quantification of the western blotting results of HsZnT8 and β-actin, by using ImageJ. Subsequently, the relative uptake rate for each HsZnT8 sample was calculated from the vesicular zinc uptake assay (Figure 2H and more detail in method section). Finally, the uptake rates were normalized to the HsZnT8 expression levels, and are shown in Figure 2I.

Having this multiple sequence alignment would help the readers significantly.</p></disp-quote><p>We have prepared a new figure supplement (Figure 1—figure supplement 6) to show the multiple sequence alignment between HsZnT8, EcYiiP and SoYiiP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19) The authors do not particularly indicate the concentrations of Zn used in their work. It is not clear from the methods or the text as to what is the concentration of zinc when they say 'presence of Zn'.</p></disp-quote><p>We have explicitly indicated the Zn<sup>2+</sup> concentration used in this work in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>20) The Zn uptake assay displaying activity is a fairly qualitative one and does not report any kinetic parameters. Would the authors be able to provide KM and Vmax values for the transport and their mutants as part of the revision?</p></disp-quote><p>The uptake assay used in this study only aims to provide qualitative comparison of the transporter activity between WT and mutants. In our assay, the concentration of contaminated zinc, zinc chelator 1,10-phenanthroline and added zinc are all in the μM range, so we can’t calculate the free zinc concentration accurately. This means we cannot use this assay to accurately measure the KM and Vmax.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>21) The discussion of the putative Zn-binding site at the luminal face of the transporter as potential 'luminal Zn sensor' is speculative at best since the earlier citation by Gola et al., 2019, suggests that there is a loss of transport activity upon mutations of E88 and D103. While this suggests that the residues are important for Zn permeation, it does not indicate as to why the site could sense Zn. Also, if the site senses Zn at high concentrations the transport activity is likely to be retained except at high luminal Zn levels. The authors may consider altering this part of the Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this reviewer that the discussion for this putative Zn-binding site is very speculative, and the previously published results on ZnT2 can’t support our speculation. We have completely removed this part in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>22) The dual conformation found in the WT ZnT8 structure in the absence of Zinc is a rather interesting observation. While it is plausible that the transporter has a two-state model without a likely occluded state it would be interesting for the authors to discuss the possibility of the two protomers, transporting Zn, to be decoupled from the dimerization helices and the CTD and transport Zn independent of each other.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and this is actually what we have suggested in the manuscript, which stated: “the Zn<sup>2+</sup> transport activity of HsZnT8 is unlikely to be coupled between the two subunits within a dimer, allowing each subunit to carry out Zn<sup>2+</sup> transport activity independently”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>23) The summary figure (Figure 4) can be improved by adding the pH gradients and Zn concentration gradients across the bilayer. The release of Zn inside the secretory granule can be directly depicted as being released from the molecule upon protonation rather than as arrows between two states.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised Figure 4, as suggested.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors have addressed most of the points that were raised in the initial review. I do appreciate the authors' responses, and new analyses and discussions added to the revised manuscript. However, the manuscript still lacks a satisfactory discussion related to the lipids identified in the in HsZnT8 structure. Specific points are given below and need to be addressed.</p><p>- Subsection “Overall structure of HsZnT8 in the outward-facing conformation”: &quot;Notably, clear lipid density is visible in the space between the two TMDs&quot;. While the authors have provided a new figure displaying anticipated lipid density (Figure 1—figure supplement 3C), it remains unclear why these densities were ascribed to lipid molecules. The data presented does not support the identification of a lipid. There is only a small density, no bulky head group and no continuous density to lipid bilayer boundaries. What evidence do you have to support ascribing density as lipid? This density could be due to image processing artifacts, noise, bound detergent, etc. It would be impactful to provide clarification/discussion on identity of lipid-like densities or remove this supposition from the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks to this reviewer for the critical comment. We agree with this reviewer that these two density blobs, shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 3C, could be lipid, detergent, or even noise. Due to the uncertainty in assigning this density, we have completely removed this supposition and Figure 1—figure supplement 3C in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 1A legend – the authors should indicate a threshold level used to display the EM density map; if the map was filtered for this display, it should be also indicated in the figure legend.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the map threshold level in the legend of Figure 1A, as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 1—figure supplements 3 – &quot;Lipid densities….&quot; – please provide statistical definition of visualized lipid-like densities.
