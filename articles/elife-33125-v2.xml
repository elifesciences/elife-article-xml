protein binding and diffusion dynamics in live cells. However, accurately inferring information from SPT studies is challenging due to biases in both data analysis and experimental design. To address analysis bias, we introduce ‘Spot-On’, an intuitive web-interface. Spot-On implements a kinetic modeling framework that accounts for known biases, including molecules moving out-of-focus, and robustly infers diffusion constants and subpopulations from pooled single-molecule trajectories. To minimize inherent experimental biases, we implement and validate stroboscopic photo-activation SPT (spaSPT), which minimizes motion-blur bias and tracking errors. We validate Spot-On using experimentally realistic simulations and show that Spot-On outperforms other methods. We then apply Spot-On to spaSPT data from live mammalian cells spanning a wide range of nuclear dynamics and demonstrate that Spot-On consistently and robustly infers subpopulation fractions and diffusion constants.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33125.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins, the molecules that make up the cells’ internal machinery, are responsible for almost every process that keeps cells alive. Watching how proteins move and interact within a living cell can help scientists to better understand these biological mechanisms. Single-particle tracking is a recent technique that makes these observations possible by taking ‘live’ recordings of individual proteins in a cell. Typically, the goal of a single-particle tracking experiment is to assign proteins into groups, or subpopulations, based on the way they move in the cell. For example, one subpopulation may be bound to other cellular structures, a second moving freely at a high speed, and a third diffusing slowly. This informs on the biological roles of the proteins.</p><p>The method involves an experimental stage and an analysis stage. During the experiment, proteins of interest are labeled with a small dye molecule that produces light when excited by a laser. The laser then illuminates the cell, stimulating all the labels in a thin layer. The position of each molecule is then determined with a microscope and a ‘snapshot’ taken. By repeating this process over multiple images, the movement of each molecule over time can be tracked. However, experimental problems can make the interpretation difficult. Motion blurring takes place when the proteins move so fast they appear as blurs in the images; tracking errors happen when so many proteins are present in the same space their trajectories overlap.</p><p>Here, Hansen, Woringer et al. combine two pre-existing methods to improve the experimental set-up. Using lasers that flash like a strobe light reduces motion blurring by essentially taking snapshots of the proteins at short time intervals. Tracking errors are addressed by a technique whereby only one protein at a time produces light.</p><p>Once the images are obtained and analyzed to yield trajectories, the trajectories themselves need to be analyzed to determine the number and properties of the protein subpopulations. Several factors can skew this analysis stage. For example, there is often a bias against fast-moving particles because the laser only lights up a thin layer of the cell. The proteins travelling slowly stay in focus long enough to be detected across many images; the fast ones quickly move out of the layer and are therefore counted less often. Hansen, Woringer et al. designed a free and user-friendly algorithm package called Spot-On to correct for this issue. Spot-On was thoroughly benchmarked against other solutions, demonstrating both its accuracy and robustness.</p><p>Single-particle tracking can lead to misleading results if used incorrectly. It is essential to publically share solutions that help make this technique more rigorous, especially since a growing number of scientists have already started to use the method.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>single particle tracking</kwd><kwd>transcription factor</kwd><kwd>dynamics</kwd><kwd>single molecule</kwd><kwd>kinetic modeling</kwd><kwd>super-resolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UO1-EB021236</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Darzacq</surname><given-names>Xavier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54-DK107980</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Darzacq</surname><given-names>Xavier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000900</institution-id><institution>California Institute for Regenerative Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LA1-08013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Darzacq</surname><given-names>Xavier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>003061</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tjian</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lavis</surname><given-names>Luke D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Siebel Stem Cell Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hansen</surname><given-names>Anders S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Spot-On is an easy-to-use website that makes a rigorous and bias-corrected modeling framework for analysis of single-molecule tracking experiments available to all.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Advances in imaging technologies, genetically encoded tags and fluorophore development have made single-particle tracking (SPT) an increasingly popular method for analyzing protein dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). Recent biological applications of SPT have revealed that transcription factors (TFs) bind mitotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Teves et al., 2016</xref>), how Polycomb interacts with chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhen et al., 2016</xref>), that ‘pioneer factor’ TFs bind chromatin dynamically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Swinstead et al., 2016</xref>), that TF binding time correlates with transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Loffreda et al., 2017</xref>) and that different nuclear proteins adopt distinct target search mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Izeddin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rhodes et al., 2017</xref>). Compared with indirect and bulk techniques such as Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) or Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS), SPT is often seen as less biased and less model-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Goulian and Simon, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mueller et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shen et al., 2017</xref>). In particular, SPT makes it possible to directly follow single molecules over time in live cells and has provided clear evidence that proteins often exist in several subpopulations that can be characterized by their distinct diffusion coefficients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mueller et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shen et al., 2017</xref>). For example, nuclear proteins such as TFs and chromatin binding proteins typically show a quasi-immobile chromatin-bound fraction and a freely diffusing fraction inside the nucleus. However, while SPT of slow-diffusing membrane proteins is an established technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Weimann et al., 2013</xref>), 2D-SPT of proteins freely diffusing inside a 3D nucleus introduces several biases that must be corrected for in order to obtain accurate estimates of subpopulations. First, while a frame is acquired, fast-diffusing molecules move and spread out their emitted photons over multiple pixels causing a ‘<italic>motion-blur</italic>’ artifact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Berglund, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Deschout et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Frost et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Goulian and Simon, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Izeddin et al., 2014</xref>), whereas immobile or slow-diffusing molecules resemble point spread functions (PSFs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This results in under-counting of the fast-diffusing subpopulation. Second, high particle densities tend to cause <italic>tracking errors</italic> when localized molecules are connected into trajectories. This can result in incorrect displacement estimates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Third, since SPT generally employs 2D imaging of 3D motion, immobile or slow-diffusing molecules will generally remain in-focus until they photobleach and therefore exhibit long trajectories, whereas fast-diffusing molecules in 3D rapidly move out-of-focus, thus resulting in short trajectories (we refer to this as ‘<italic>defocalization</italic>’; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This results in a time-dependent under-counting of fast-diffusing molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Goulian and Simon, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kues and Kubitscheck, 2002</xref>). Fourth, SPT <italic>analysis methods</italic> themselves may introduce biases; to avoid this, an accurate and validated method is needed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33125.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Bias in single-particle tracking (SPT) experiments and analysis methods.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) ‘Motion-blur’ bias. Constant excitation during acquisition of a frame will cause a fast-moving particle to spread out its emission photons over many pixels and thus appear as a motion-blur, which make detection much less likely with common PSF-fitting algorithms. In contrast, a slow-moving or immobile particle will appear as a well-shaped PSF and thus readily be detected. (<bold>B</bold>) Tracking ambiguities. Tracking at high particle densities prevents unambiguous connection of particles between frames and tracking errors will cause displacements to be misidentified. (<bold>C</bold>) Defocalization bias. During 2D-SPT, fast-moving particles will rapidly move out-of-focus resulting in short trajectories, whereas immobile particles will remain in-focus until they photobleach and thus exhibit very long trajectories. This results in a bias toward slow-moving particles, which must be corrected for. (<bold>D</bold>) Analysis method.

Spot-On then generates useful meta-data for assessing the quality of the experiment (e.g. localization density, number of trajectories etc.). Spot-On also allows a user to upload multiple datasets (e.g. different replicates) and merge them. Spot-On then calculates and displays histograms of displacements over multiple time delays. The next step is model fitting. Spot-On models the distribution of displacements for each subpopulation using Brownian motion under steady-state conditions without state transitions (full model description in Materials and Methods). Spot-On also accounts for localization errors (either user-defined or inferred from the SPT data). Crucially, Spot-On corrects for defocalization bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) by explicitly calculating the probability that molecules move out-of-focus as a function of time and their diffusion constant (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). In fact, Spot-On uses the gradual loss of freely diffusing molecules over time as additional information to infer the diffusion constant and size of each subpopulation.</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-33125-video1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33125.005</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</title><p>Illustration of defocalization bias.

For instance, TFs in nuclei can generally exist in both a chromatin-bound state characterized by slow diffusion and a freely diffusing state associated with rapid diffusion. In this case, a 2-state model is generally appropriate (‘bound’ vs. ‘free’). Spot-On allows a user to choose their desired model and parameter ranges and then fits the model to the data. Using the previous example of TF dynamics, this allows the user to infer the bound fraction and the diffusion constants. Finally, once a user has finished fitting an appropriate model to their data, Spot-On allows easy download of publication-quality figures and relevant data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; Full tutorial in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Validation of Spot-On using simulated SPT data and comparison to other methods</title><p>We first evaluated whether Spot-On could accurately infer subpopulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and successfully account for known biases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) using simulated data. We compared Spot-On to a popular alternative approach of first fitting the mean square displacement (MSD) of individual trajectories of a minimum length and then fitting the distribution of estimated diffusion constants (we refer to this as ‘MSD<sub>i</sub>’) as well as a sophisticated Hidden-Markov Model-based Bayesian inference method (vbSPT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Persson et al., 2013</xref>). Since most SPT data is collected using highly inclined illumination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tokunaga et al., 2008</xref>) (HiLo), we simulated TF binding and diffusion dynamics (2-state model: ‘bound vs. free’) confined inside a 4 µm radius mammalian nucleus under realistic HiLo SPT experimental settings subject to a 25 nm localization error (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We considered the effect of the exposure time (1 ms, 4 ms, 7 ms, 13 ms, 20 ms), the free diffusion constant (from 0.5 µm²/s to 14.5 µm²/s in 0.5 µm²/s increments) and the bound fraction (from 0% to 95% in 5% increments) yielding a total of 3480 different conditions that span the full range of biologically plausible dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">3</xref>; Appendix 1).</p><p>Spot-On accurately inferred subpopulation sizes with minimal error (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), but slightly underestimated the diffusion constant (−4.8%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). However, this underestimate was due to particle confinement inside the nucleus: Spot-On correctly inferred the diffusion constant when the confinement was relaxed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>; 20 µm nuclear radius instead of 4 µm).

First, we considered a mostly bound and relatively slow diffusion case (<italic>D</italic><sub>FREE</sub>: 2.0 µm²/s; <italic>F</italic><sub>BOUND</sub>: 70%; <italic>Δ</italic>τ: 7 ms; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Spot-On and vbSPT accurately inferred both <italic>D</italic><sub>FREE</sub> and <italic>F</italic><sub>BOUND</sub>. In contrast, MSD<sub>i</sub> (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.8) greatly underestimated <italic>F</italic><sub>BOUND</sub> (13.6% vs. 70%), whereas MSD<sub>i</sub> (all) slightly overestimated <italic>F</italic><sub>BOUND</sub>. Since MSD<sub>i</sub>-based methods apply two thresholds (first, minimum trajectory length: here five frames; second, filtering based on <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>) in many cases less than 5% of all trajectories passed these thresholds and this example illustrate how sensitive MSD<sub>i</sub>-based methods are to these thresholds. Note that although we show the fits to the probability density function since this is more intuitive (PDF; histogram), we performed the fitting to the cumulative distribution function (CDF). Second, we considered an example with a slow frame rate and fast diffusion, such that the free population rapidly moves out-of-focus (<italic>D</italic><sub>FREE</sub>: 14.0 µm²/s; <italic>F</italic><sub>BOUND</sub>: 50%; <italic>Δ</italic>τ: 20 ms; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Spot-On again accurately inferred <italic>F</italic><sub>BOUND</sub>, and slightly underestimated <italic>D</italic><sub>FREE</sub> due to high nuclear confinement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Although vbSPT generally performed well, because it does not correct for defocalization bias (vbSPT was developed for bacteria, where defocalization bias is minimal), vbSPT strongly overestimated <italic>F</italic><sub>BOUND</sub> in this case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Consistent with this, Spot-On without defocalization-bias correction also strongly overestimates the bound fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). We conclude that correcting for defocalization bias is critical. The MSD<sub>i</sub>-based methods again gave divergent results despite seemingly fitting the data well. Thus, a good fit to a histogram of log(D) does not necessarily imply that the inferred <italic>D</italic><sub>FREE</sub> and <italic>F</italic><sub>BOUND</sub> are accurate. A full discussion and comparison of the methods is given in Appendix 1. Finally, we extended this analysis of simulated SPT data to three states (one ‘bound’, two ‘free’ states) and compared Spot-On and vbSPT. Spot-On again accurately inferred both the diffusion constants and subpopulation fractions of each population and slightly outperformed vbSPT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p><p>Having established that Spot-On is accurate, we next tested whether it was also robust. Spot-On’s ability to infer <italic>D</italic><sub>FREE</sub> and <italic>F</italic><sub>BOUND</sub> was robust to misestimates of the axial detection range of ~100–200 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7</xref>), was minimally affected by the number of timepoints considered and fitting parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s8">Figure 3—figure supplements 8</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s9">9</xref>; see also Appendix 2 for parameter considerations) and was not strongly affected by state changes (e.g. binding or unbinding) provided the time-scale of state changes is significantly longer than the frame rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s10">Figure 3—figure supplement 10</xref>). Moreover, Spot-On inferred the localization error with nanometer precision provided that a significant bound fraction is present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s11">Figure 3—figure supplement 11</xref>). Finally, we sub-sampled the data sets and found that just ~3000 short trajectories (mean length ~3–4 frames) were sufficient for Spot-On to reliably infer the underlying dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s12">Figure 3—figure supplement 12</xref>). We conclude that Spot-On is robust.</p><p>Taken together, this analysis of simulated SPT data suggests that Spot-On successfully overcomes defocalization and analysis method biases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>), accurately and robustly estimates subpopulations and diffusion constants across a wide range of dynamics and, finally, outperforms other methods.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>spaSPT minimizes biases in experimental SPT acquisitions</title><p>Having validated Spot-On on simulated data, which is not subject to experimental biases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>), we next sought to evaluate Spot-On on experimental data. To generate SPT data with minimal acquisition bias we performed stroboscopic photo-activation SPT (spaSPT; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), which integrates previously and separately published ideas to minimize experimental biases. First, spaSPT minimizes motion-blurring, which is caused by particle movement during the camera exposure time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), by using stroboscopic excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Elf et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Frost et al., 2012</xref>). We found that the bright and photo-stable dyes PA-JF<sub>549</sub> and PA-JF<sub>646</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Grimm et al., 2016a</xref>) in combination with the HaloTag (‘Halo’) labeling strategy made it possible to achieve a signal-to-background ratio greater than 5 with just 1 ms excitation pulses, thus providing a good compromise between minimal motion-blurring and high signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Second, spaSPT minimizes tracking errors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) by using photo-activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Grimm et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Manley et al., 2008</xref>). Tracking errors are generally caused by high particles densities. Photo-activation allows tracking at extremely low densities (≤1 molecule per nucleus per frame) and thereby minimizes tracking errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Izeddin et al., 2014</xref>), whilst at the same time generating thousands of trajectories. To consider the full spectrum of nuclear protein dynamics, we studied histone H2B-Halo (overwhelmingly bound; fast diffusion; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), Halo-CTCF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hansen et al., 2017</xref>) (largely bound; slow diffusion; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) and Halo-NLS (overwhelmingly free; very fast diffusion; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) in human U2OS cells and Halo-Sox2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Teves et al., 2016</xref>) (largely free; intermediate diffusion; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). We labeled Halo-tagged proteins in live cells with the HaloTag ligands PA-JF<sub>549</sub> or PA-JF<sub>646</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Grimm et al., 2016a</xref>) and performed spaSPT using HiLo illumination (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>).

We experimentally determined the axial detection range to be ~700 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) and performed spaSPT at 200 Hz, 167 Hz, 134 Hz, 100 Hz, 74 Hz and 50 Hz using the four cell lines. Spot-On consistently inferred the diffusion constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) and total bound fraction across the wide range of frame rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). This is notable since all four proteins exhibit apparent anomalous diffusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) and this demonstrates that Spot-On is also robust to anomalous diffusion despite modeling Brownian motion. While the ground-truth is unknown when considering experiments, Spot-On gave biologically reasonable results: histone H2B was overwhelmingly bound and free Halo-3xNLS was overwhelmingly unbound (comparison with vbSPT: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). These results provide additional validation for the bias corrections implemented in Spot-On. We also note that although Spot-On was validated on spaSPT data, SPT data with non-photoactivatable dyes is also suitable for Spot-On analysis provided that the density is sufficiently low to minimize tracking errors (see also Appendix 3: &quot;Which datasets are appropriate for Spot-On?”). Finally, we demonstrated above that just ~3000 short trajectories (mean length ~3–4 frames) were sufficient for Spot-On to accurately infer <italic>D</italic><sub>FREE</sub> and <italic>F</italic><sub>BOUND</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s12">Figure 3—figure supplement 12</xref>). Here we obtain well above 3000 trajectories per cell even at ~1 localization/frame. More generally, with spaSPT this should be generally achievable for all but the most lowly expressed nuclear proteins. Thus, this now makes it possible to study biological cell-to-cell variability in TF dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Effect of motion-blur bias on parameter estimates</title><p>Having validated Spot-On on experimental SPT data, we next applied Spot-On to estimate the effect of motion-blurring on the estimation of subpopulations. As mentioned, since most localization algorithms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chenouard et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sergé et al., 2008</xref>) achieve super-resolution through PSF-fitting, this may cause motion-blurred molecules to be undersampled, resulting in a bias towards slow-moving molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We estimated the extent of the bias by imaging the four cell lines at 100 Hz and keeping the total number of excitation photons constant, but varying the excitation pulse duration (1 ms, 2 ms, 4 ms, 7 ms, constant; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). For generality, we performed these experiments using both PA-JF<sub>549</sub> and PA-JF<sub>646</sub> dyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Grimm et al., 2016a</xref>). We used Spot-On to fit the data and plotted the apparent free diffusion constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>) and apparent total bound fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>) as a function of the excitation pulse duration. For fast-diffusing proteins like Halo-3xNLS and H2B-Halo, motion-blurring resulted in a large underestimate of the free diffusion constant, whereas the effect on slower proteins like CTCF and Sox2 was minor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). Regarding the total bound fraction, motion-blurring caused a ~2 fold overestimate for rapidly diffusing Halo-3xNLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>), but had a minor effect on slower proteins like H2B, CTCF and Sox2. Similar results were obtained for both dyes for proteins with a significant bound fraction, but we note that JF<sub>549</sub> appears to better capture the dynamics of proteins with a minimal bound fraction such as Halo-3xNLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J–K</xref>). Finally, we note that the extent of the bias due to motion-blurring will likely be very sensitive to the localization algorithm. Here, using the MTT-algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sergé et al., 2008</xref>), motion-blurring caused up to a 2-fold error in both the <italic>D</italic><sub>FREE</sub> and <italic>F</italic><sub>BOUND</sub> estimates.</p><p>Taken together, these results suggest that Spot-On can reliably be used even for SPT data collected under constant illumination provided that protein diffusion is sufficiently slow and, moreover, provides a helpful guide for optimizing SPT imaging acquisitions (we include a full discussion of considerations for SPT acquisitions and a proposal for minimum reporting standards in SPT in Appendix 3 and 4).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In summary, SPT is an increasingly popular technique and has been revealing important new biological insight. However, a clear consensus on how to perform and analyze SPT experiments is currently lacking.

Several methods are available for localization/tracking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chenouard et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sergé et al., 2008</xref>) and for classification of individual trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Monnier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Persson et al., 2013</xref>). Spot-On now complements these tools by providing a bias-corrected, comprehensive open-source framework for inferring subpopulations and diffusion constants from pooled SPT data and makes this platform available through a convenient web-interface. This platform can easily be extended to other diffusion regimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Metzler et al., 2014</xref>) and models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lee et al., 2017</xref>) and, as 3D SPT methods mature, to 3D SPT data. Moreover, spaSPT provides an acquisition protocol for tracking fast-diffusing molecules with minimal bias. We hope that these validated tools will help make SPT more accessible to the community and contribute positively to the emergence of ‘gold-standard’ acquisition and analysis procedures for SPT.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>Halo-CTCF</td><td>Hansen <italic>et al</italic>. <italic>eLife</italic> 2017;6:e25776; <break/>PMID 28467304; <break/>doi: 10.7554/eLife.25776</td><td>U2OS C32 <break/>FLAG-Halo-CTCF</td><td>Previously reported homozygous <break/>endogenous knock-in cell line where <break/>all endogenous copies of CTCF <break/>have been N-terminally tagged with <break/>FLAG-HaloTag</td></tr><tr><td>cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>Halo-3xNLS</td><td>Hansen <italic>et al</italic>. <italic>eLife</italic> 2017;6:e25776; <break/>PMID 28467304; <break/>doi: 10.7554/eLife.25776</td><td>U2OS Halo-3xNLS</td><td>U2OS cell line stably expressing <break/>Halo-3xNLS (3 copies of the SV40 Nuclear <break/>Localization Signal) generated by <break/>G418 selection.

Model fitting and parameter optimization was performed using a non-linear least squares algorithm (Levenberg-Marquardt). Random initial parameter guesses are drawn uniformly from the user-specified parameter range. The optimization is then repeated several times with different initialization parameters to avoid local minima. Spot-On constrains each fraction to be between 0 and 1 and for the sum of the fractions to equal 1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Theoretical characteristics and limitations of the model</title><p>Although Spot-On performs well on both experimental and simulated SPT data, the model implemented by Spot-On has several limitations. First, the kinetic model assumes diffusion to be <italic>ideal Brownian motion</italic>, even though it is widely acknowledged that the motion of most proteins inside a cell shows some degree of anomalous diffusion. Nevertheless, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> show that the parameter inference for experimental data of proteins presenting various degrees of anomalous diffusion is quite robust.</p><p>Second, Spot-On models the localization error as the <italic>static mean localization error</italic> and this feature can be used to infer the actual localization error from the data. However, the localization error is affected both by the position of the particle with respect to the focal plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lindén et al., 2017</xref>) and by motion blur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Deschout et al., 2012</xref>). Even though a high signal-to-background ratio and fast framerate/stroboscopic illumination help to mitigate these disparities, it is likely that the localization error of fast moving particles will be higher than the bound/slow-moving particles. In that case, one would expect Spot-On to infer a localization error that is the weighted mean of the ‘bound/static’ localization error and the ‘free’ localization error. However, in many situations D<sub>free</sub><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf42"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>&gt;&gt; <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf43"><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> (even assuming a 2 µm²/s particle imaged at a 5 ms framerate with a ~30 nm localization error, there is still an order of magnitude difference between the two terms). As a consequence, the estimate of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf44"><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> reflects the static localization error (that is, the localization error of the bound fraction), and the localization error estimate becomes less reliable if the bound fraction is very small (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s11">Figure 3—figure supplement 11</xref>).</p><p>Third, following (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kues and Kubitscheck, 2002</xref>) the <italic>axial detection profile</italic> is assumed to be a step function, which is an approximation. However, all simulations here were performed using a detection profile with Gaussian edges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref> Spot-On still works quite well and moreover is relatively robust to slight mismatches in the axial detection range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7</xref>).</p><p>Fourth, unlike the original implementation by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mazza et al. (2012)</xref>, Spot-On ignores <italic>state transitions</italic>. This reduces the number of fitted parameters and simplifies the generalization to more than two states, but as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s10">Figure 3—figure supplement 10</xref> it also causes the parameter inference to fail unless the timescale of state changes is at least 10–50 times longer than the frame rate. Thus, in cases where a molecule is known to exhibit state changes on a time-scale of tens to a few hundreds of milliseconds, Spot-On may not be appropriate.</p><p>Fifth and finally, Spot-On ignores correlations between adjacent displacements, although taking such information into account can potentially improve the parameter inference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vestergaard et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Halo-Sox2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Teves et al., 2016</xref>) knock-in JM8.N4 mouse embryonic stem cells ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pettitt et al., 2009</xref>) Research Resource Identifier: RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_J962">CVCL_J962</ext-link>; obtained from the KOMP Repository at UC Davis) were grown on plates pre-coated with a 0.1% autoclaved gelatin solution (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, G9391) under feeder free conditions in knock-out DMEM with 15% FBS and LIF (full recipe: 500 mL knockout DMEM (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, #10829018), 6 mL MEM NEAA (ThermoFisher #11140050), 6 mL GlutaMax (ThermoFisher #35050061), 5 mL Penicillin-streptomycin (ThermoFisher #15140122), 4.6 μL 2-mercapoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich M3148), 90 mL fetal bovine serum (HyClone Logan, UT, FBS SH30910.03 lot #AXJ47554)) and LIF. mES cells were fed by replacing half the medium with fresh medium daily and passaged every two days by trypsinization.

evaluate the performance of Spot-On as well as other common analysis tools such as MSD<sub>i</sub> and vbSPT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Persson et al., 2013</xref>), we developed simSPT, a simulation tool to generate a comprehensive set of realistic SPT simulations spanning the range of plausible dynamics (almost a billion trajectories were simulated in total). simSPT is freely available at GitLab: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gitlab.com/tjian-darzacq-lab/simSPT.">https://gitlab.com/tjian-darzacq-lab/simSPT.</ext-link> simSPT simulates 3D SPT trajectories arising from an arbitrary number of subpopulations confined inside a sphere under HiLo illumination and takes into account a limited axial detection range, realistic photobleaching rates and optionally state interconversion. The simulation methods are described in detail at GitLab.</p><p>Briefly, we parameterized simSPT to consider that particles diffuse inside a sphere (the nucleus) of 8 µm diameter illuminated using HiLo illumination (assuming a HiLo beam width of 4 µm), with an axial detection range of ~700 nm with Gaussian edges, centered at the middle of the HiLo beam. Molecules are assumed to have a mean lifetime of 4 frames (when inside the HiLo beam) and of 40 frames when outside the HiLo beam.</p><p>For the 2-state comparisons, the localization error was set to 25 nm and the simulation was run until 100,000 in-focus trajectories were recorded. More specifically, the effect of the time between frames (1 ms, 4 ms, 7 ms, 13 ms, 20 ms), the free diffusion constant (from 0.5 µm²/s to 14.5 µm²/s in 0.5 µm²/s increments) and the fraction bound (from 0% to 95% in 5% increments) were investigated, yielding a dataset consisting of 3480 simulations. All 3480 simulated datasets are also available (see Data Availability section). The advantage of simulations is that the ground truth is known.</p><p>For the 3-state comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>), the localization error was set to 40 nm and the simulation was run until 100,000 in-focus trajectories were recorded.

The origin of the error is the undercounting of the bound population due to considering only the first 4 jumps. Since bound molecules remain in focus until they bleach, they always yield only a single trajectory, whereas a single freely diffusing molecule has a probability of yielding multiple trajectories by diffusing in-focus for a while, then moving out-of-focus for a while and then moving back in-focus.

However, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">4</xref>, the slight underestimate of the free diffusion constant is not due to a limitation of Spot-On, but instead due to confinement inside the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). For example, a diffusing molecule close to the nuclear boundary moving towards the nuclear boundary will ‘bounce back’ resulting in a large distance travelled, but only a smaller recorded displacement.

This also helps to emphasize the point that diffusion constants measured inside a nucleus should be interpreted as apparent diffusion constants.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s7-4"><title>MSD<sub>i</sub> (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>&gt;0.8)</title><sec id="s7-4-1"><title>Rational and parameters</title><p>A large number of papers have use different variations of the MSD<sub>i</sub> approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Knight et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schmidt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhen et al., 2016</xref>). This approach is of course very sensitive to how the MSD is estimated. For example, it is well-known that accurately estimating diffusion constants from short trajectories (&lt;100 frames) subject to significant localization error is all but impossible as shown by Michalet and Berglund (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Michalet and Berglund, 2012</xref>). Nevertheless, several papers assign diffusion constants to individual trajectories based on a MSD-fit. While the exact method differs somewhat from paper to paper, the most popular approach is to set a threshold of a certain number of localizations per trajectory (most commonly 5; though we note that some reports explicitly attempt to compensate for the bias introduced by setting such a threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhen et al., 2016</xref>)). Each trajectory with at least five localizations are then fit, often using the Matlab library MSDAnalyzer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tarantino et al., 2014</xref>), and thus assigned an apparent diffusion constant. An additional threshold is then applied: only if the fit to the MSD curve is judged sufficiently good, is the diffusion constant then used. Otherwise the trajectory is ignored. This fitting threshold is frequently set based on the coefficient of determination as <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>&gt;0.8 in some recent papers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Knight et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schmidt et al., 2016</xref>). Next, after analyzing all trajectories in this way, a distribution of diffusion constants is then obtained. The analysis is then performed on the logarithm of these diffusion constants (‘LogD histogram’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Knight et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schmidt et al., 2016</xref>). Both the CDF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Knight et al., 2015</xref>) and PDF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Knight et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schmidt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhen et al., 2016</xref>) can be considered. These are then fitted with a sum of Gaussian distributions: either two (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Knight et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schmidt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhen et al., 2016</xref>) or three (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schmidt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhen et al., 2016</xref>). We note that it is not immediately clear which distribution fitted diffusion constants should actually follow (e.g. Log-normal, Gamma, Normal, etc.). No justification is given for sums of Gaussians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Knight et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schmidt et al., 2016</xref>), though we note that the fit is often quite good both in the previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Knight et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schmidt et al., 2016</xref>) and also here as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>. Please note that fitting a sum of normal distributions to the LogD histogram is equivalent to fitting a sum of log-normal distributions to the D histogram. We also note here, that in a theoretical study Michalet previously showed that the distribution of diffusion constants is approximately Gaussian, but only under a set of stringent criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Michalet, 2010</xref>). Since CDF-fitting is generally less susceptible to noise from binning and since in this comparison Spot-On also uses CDF-fitting, we fit the LogD histogram with a sum of 2 Gaussians using CDF-fitting. We refer to this whole procedure as MSD<sub>i</sub> (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>&gt;0.8). Examples of fits are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> and the Matlab code to perform the fitting is available together with the data (see “Data availability’).

Although the bias for <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf116"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>FREE</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> is much smaller, in ~5% of all cases, the error in estimating <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf117"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>FREE</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> is bigger than 2-fold. Moreover, in a few very rare cases, not a single trajectory out of the 100,000 simulated trajectories pass both thresholds (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>&gt;0.8; at least five frames). Why is MSD<sub>i</sub> (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>&gt;0.8) fitting so unreliable? It is instructive to consider an example. In the example dataset provided with the MSD<sub>i</sub> code (simulation with <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf118"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>FREE</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>=2; <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf119"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>BOUND</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>0.75; 1 ms frame rate), the estimated <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf120"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>FREE</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>=2.06 is very good, but the estimated <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf121"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>BOUND</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>0.16 is extremely poor. Even though the simulation dataset contains 100,000 simulated trajectories, only 3726 of them actually pass the threshold (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>&gt;0.8; at least five frames). Thus, MSD<sub>i</sub> (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>&gt;0.8) only uses around 4% of the data. Since the tiny fraction of the dataset that is used for analysis is chosen based on how well it fits an MSD-curve and since displacements of bound molecules are dominated by localization errors and therefore generally poorly fit by MSD-analysis, the procedure enriches for the free population, which is why the estimated bound fraction (16%) is so much lower than the true bound fraction (75%). Additionally, we note that MSD<sub>i</sub>-based analysis is extremely sensitive to the fitting threshold: if instead of <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>&gt;0.8, all trajectories had been used the estimated bound fraction would be 87% instead of 16%.</p><p>In conclusion, MSD<sub>i</sub> (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>&gt;0.8) is unreliable for estimating <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf122"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>BOUND</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> when short trajectories are at stake, which is the usual case when performing intracellular SPT of fast-diffusing molecules. MSD<sub>i</sub> (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>&gt;0.8) most likely fails due to a combination of the following reasons among others. First, it poorly handles localization errors, which dominate the displacements of bound molecules. Second, by only considering trajectories of a certain length (normally at least five frames), it only analyzes a small subsample of the dataset. Third, there is no correction for defocalization bias. Since fast-diffusing molecules move out-of-focus and thus have shorter trajectories, the 5-frame threshold introduces a large bias against freely-diffusing molecules. Fourth, the fitting threshold (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>&gt;0.8) is relatively arbitrary and the results of the analysis is extremely sensitive to this threshold. Accordingly, in these simulations MSD<sub>i</sub> (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>&gt;0.8) only analyzes a small fraction (~5%) of all the trajectories; note that this bias against the bound population provides a compensatory bias against the bound population to account for the bias against the free population due to defocalization bias. Fifth, it is difficult to justify the use of Gaussian distributions. Even in cases where the CDF-fit to the data is excellent, the fitted <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf123"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>BOUND</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>-value is often very far off the ground truth. Thus, the goodness of the fit cannot be used to judge how well the parameter-estimation went. Finally, we note that several variants of the MSD<sub>i</sub>-based method exist (e.g. the approach used by Zhen <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhen et al., 2016</xref>)) is a bit different than the one used here.

In the case of MSD<sub>i</sub> (all), the main reason for the unreliable estimates is due to defocalization bias. Since fast-diffusing molecules move out-of-focus and thus have shorter trajectories, the 5-frame threshold introduces a large bias against freely-diffusing molecules.

Why would we want to limit the number of jumps that were used? Since freely-diffusing molecules move out-of-focus, almost all very long trajectories will be bound molecules. For example, a single trajectory of 21 localizations will provide 20 displacements to the 1<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf163"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> histogram, whereas freely diffusing molecules with short trajectories will provide fewer (e.g. 10 trajectories with three localizations would be necessary to also provide 20 displacements to the 1<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf164"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> histogram). Thus, by limiting JumpsToConsider, one is biasing the displacement histogram against bound molecules. However, as demonstrated in the simulations shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, whether all jumps or JumpsToConsider = 4 is used has almost no effect on the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf165"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>FREE</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>-estimate, but using JumpsToConsider = 4 causes <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf166"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>BOUND</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> to be underestimated by on average of −5% (percentage points) relative to SpotOn (all).

As we have discussed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hansen et al., 2017</xref>), restricting JumpsToConsider to four is a way one can compensate for all the many acquisition biases (such as motion-blur) that generally cause undercounting for fast-diffusing molecules and which cannot readily be taken into account in simulations. While the optimal value will depend on the trajectory length distribution (JumpsToConsider should not take a value much smaller than the mean trajectory length), we found that JumpsToConsider = 4 provides a good compromise for our experimental data. We strongly recommend including experimental controls (such as histone H2B-Halo and Halo-3xNLS to ensure that experimental and analysis parameters have been reasonably set).</p></sec><sec id="s8-2"><title>Number of timepoints</title><p>Spot-On considers how the histogram of displacement changes over time for multiple <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf167"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>.

How many timepoints to consider will depend on how much data you have and the frame-rate. For example, if the mean trajectory length is two frames, setting timepoints to 20 will cause problems since only a tiny fraction of trajectories will be at least 20 frames long and thus contribute to the 19<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf171"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> histogram. Moreover, the correction for defocalization is approximate, so considering timepoints where more than &gt;95% of free molecules have moved out-of-focus is also not recommended; when this happens will further depend on the free diffusion constant. Nevertheless, as long as there is sufficient data to reasonably populate the displacement histograms at all timepoints, Spot-On is highly robust to how this parameter is set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s8">Figure 3—figure supplement 8</xref>). As a rule of thumb we generally do not recommend setting timepoints above 10 or considering <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf172"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> beyond 80 ms.</p></sec><sec id="s8-3"><title>Iterations for fitting</title><p>Spot-On almost always converges optimally in the first iteration, so generally 2 or three is more than sufficient when using the 2-state model.

In cases, where the bound population is very small, fitting the localization error can be less accurate.

In part, deviations from the 2-state model will be due to anomalous diffusion and confinement inside cells, which cause deviation from the ideal Brownian motion model implemented by Spot-On. For this reason, traditional model-selection techniques such as Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) or the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) can also be misleading.</p></sec></boxed-text></sec></app><app id="appendix-3"><title>Appendix 3</title><sec id="s9" sec-type="appendix"><title>SPT acquisition considerations in spaSPT experiments</title><boxed-text><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33125.029</object-id><sec id="s9-1"><title>Considerations for minimizing bias in SPT acquisitions</title><p>To obtain a good single-molecule tracking dataset, a series of requirements have to be met.

But we note that many other imaging modalities, e.g. light-sheet or even epi-fluorescence imaging can generate high-quality single-molecule tracking data.</p><p>Thus, in the following we will assume that the above condition is met: namely, that single protein molecules can be tracked inside live cells at high signal-to-noise ratio. Nevertheless, even if this condition is met, there are at least four other major sources of bias:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Detection: minimize ‘motion-blurring’</p></list-item><list-item><p>Tracking: minimize tracking errors</p></list-item><list-item><p>3D loss: correct for molecules moving out-of-focus (defocalization bias)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Analysis methods: infer subpopulations with minimal bias</p></list-item></list><p>Spot-On addresses point 3 and 4, as described elsewhere, but point 1 and 2 must be addressed in the experimental design.

Detection – minimizing ‘motion-blurring’</title><p>Almost all localization algorithms achieve sub-diffraction localization accuracy (‘super-resolution’) by treating individual fluorophores as point-source emitters, which generate blurred images that can be described by the Point-Spread-Function (PSF) of the microscope. Modeling of the PSF (typically as a 2-dimensional Gaussian) then allows extraction of the particle centroid with a precision of tens of nanometers. But as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, while this works extremely well for bound molecules, fast-diffusing molecules will spread out their photons over many pixels during the camera exposure and thus appear as ‘motion-blurs’. Thus, localization algorithms will reliably detect bound molecules, but may fail to detect fast-moving molecules as has also been observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Berglund, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Deschout et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Elf et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Izeddin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lindén et al., 2017</xref>).

The most straightforward solution, therefore, is to limit the exposure time: in the limit of an infinitely short exposure time, there is no motion-blur. In practice, most EM-CCD cameras can only image at ~100–200 Hz for reasonably sized ROIs. Moreover, it is generally desirable for the mean jump lengths to be significantly bigger than the localization error, thus for most nuclear factors in mammalian cells it is not desirable to image at above &gt;250 Hz. Accordingly, a reasonable solution is therefore to use stroboscopic illumination. That is, using brief excitation laser pulses that last shorter than the camera frame rate (e.g. 1 ms excitation pulse, 10 ms camera exposure time for a 100 Hz experiment): this achieves minimal motion-blurring while maintaining a useful frame-rate. However, this highlights a key experimental trade-off: shorter excitation pulses minimize motion-blurring, but also minimize the signal-to-noise. Therefore, a reasonable compromise has to be determined. Here we use 1 ms excitation pulses: this achieves minimal motion blurring (0.067% &gt; 320 nm using <italic>D</italic> = 3.5 μm<sup>2</sup>/s) and still yields very good signal (signal-to-background &gt;5). But users will need to decide this based on their expected <italic>D</italic> and their experimental setup (signal-to-noise). Moreover, different localization algorithms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chenouard et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Deschout et al., 2012</xref>) have different sensitivities to motion-blurring; thus, the extent of the bias will also depend on the user’s localization algorithm. As we show here, in the case of the MTT-algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sergé et al., 2008</xref>), the estimation of <italic>D</italic> is quite sensitive to motion-blurring, but the estimation of the bound fraction is less sensitive as long as the diffusion constant is &lt;5 μm<sup>2</sup>/s. But other localization algorithms may be more or less sensitive. Generally speaking, we do not recommend imaging at a signal-to-background &lt;3 and do not recommend using excitation pulses &gt;5 ms, but the optimal conditions will need to be determined on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>In conclusion, experimentally implementing stroboscopic excitation makes it possible to minimize the bias coming from motion-blurring, while still achieving a sufficient signal for reliable localization.</p></sec><sec id="s9-3"><title>2. Tracking – minimizing tracking errors</title><p>It is necessary to minimize tracking errors in order to obtain high-quality SPT data. Tracking errors bias the estimation of essentially all parameters we could want to estimate from SPT experiments including diffusion constants, subpopulations, anomalous diffusion etc. While many different tracking algorithms exist, it is fundamentally impossible to perform tracking, that is connecting localized molecules between subsequent frames, at high densities without introducing many tracking errors. Thus, the simplest solution is to image at low densities: in principle, if there is only one labeled molecule per cell, there can be no tracking errors. Yet, because dyes generally bleach quite quickly under most SPT imaging conditions, this has traditionally led to a serious trade-off between data quality and the number of trajectories which can be obtained. However, with the recent development of bright photo-activatable JF-dyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Grimm et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2016b</xref>) (PA-dye), it is now possible to combine the superior brightness of the Halo-JF dyes with photo-activation SPT (also called sptPALM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Manley et al., 2008</xref>)). That is, a large fraction of Halo-tagged proteins in a cell can be labeled with Halo-PA-JF dyes and then photo-activated one at a time: this allows imaging at extremely low densities (&lt;1 fluorescent molecule per cell per frame) and nevertheless tens of thousands of trajectories from a single cell can be obtained. Thus, PA-dyes now make it possible to nearly eliminate tracking errors without compromising on signal-to-noise or amount of data. In fact, imaging at extremely low densities generally also improves signal-to-noise since out-of-focus background is reduced and overlapping point emitters are avoided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Izeddin et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Nevertheless, even with paSPT it is still necessary to decide on an optimal density. The key parameters are size of the ROI (ideally the whole nucleus for studies in cells) and <italic>D</italic>: a large nucleus and a slow <italic>D</italic> can support a higher density than fast-diffusing molecules in a small nucleus. As a general rule of thumb, we recommend a density of ~1 fluorescent molecule per ROI per frame. This will keep tracking errors at a minimum and still support rapid acquisition of large datasets. All data acquired for this study was acquired at approximately this density.</p><p>In practice, keeping an optimal density will require some trial-and-error optimization of the 405 nm photo-activation laser intensity. 405 nm excitation does contribute background fluorescence, so we prefer to pulse the 405 nm laser during the camera ‘dead-time’ (~0.5 ms in our case) to avoid this. Moreover, this also makes it easier to keep the photo-activation level constant when changing the frame rate. However, the optimal photo-activation power will depend on the expression level of the protein, protein half-life and the dye concentration and will therefore have to be optimized in each case. We recommend recording initial datasets and then analyzing them using Spot-On which reports the mean number of localizations per frame and then using this information to determine the optimal photo-activation level. However, even then some cell-to-cell variation may be unavoidable: especially in transient transfection experiments where there is large cell-to-cell variation in expression level or when studying proteins expressed from stably integrated transgenes (e.g. Halo-3xNLS and H2b-Halo in our case). In these cases, some cells will likely exhibit too high a density. To deal with this, Spot-On includes the option to analyze datasets from individual cells first and then excluding a cell with too high a density before analyzing the merged dataset.</p></sec><sec id="s9-4"><title>Which datasets are appropriate for Spot-On?</title><p>In the sections above, we have discussed how to minimize common experimental biases in SPT experiments and proposed spaSPT as a general solution. However, many 2D SPT datasets recorded under different conditions are also appropriate for Spot-On. For example, SPT experiments without photo-activation or with continuous illumination may also be appropriate for analysis with Spot-On. For example, there may be situations where photo-activation SPT is not possible: in such cases, it will be essential to keep the labeling density sufficiently low that tracking errors are minimized and it might thus be necessary to image substantially more cells to get enough statistics. Likewise, as we show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4JK</xref>, motion-blurring is a major concern for fast-diffusing molecules, but for a slowly diffusing molecule like Halo-CTCF it makes only a small difference. Thus SPT datasets recorded with continuous illumination may also be appropriate provided that the protein of interest is known to diffuse sufficiently slowly.</p><p>We also note that since Spot-On uses the loss of fast-diffusing molecules over time to correct for bias and to estimate the free population, it is essential that all trajectories are included in Spot-On for analysis. For example, some tracking and localization algorithms ignore all trajectories below a certain length (e.g. five frames), but this will cause Spot-On to misestimate the loss of molecules moving out-of-focus and thus it is imperative that trajectories of all lengths be included when analyzing data using Spot-On. Furthermore, trajectories of only a single localization are required to accurately compute the average number of localizations per frame, which is a key quality-control metric for SPT data.</p><p>Moreover, Spot-On does not currently support 3D SPT data. Furthermore, Spot-On assumes diffusion to be Brownian. This is a reasonable approximation even for molecules exhibiting some levels of anomalous diffusion as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, but Spot-On is not appropriate for molecules undergoing directed motion (e.g. a protein moving on microtubules). Additionally, in cases where there are frequent state transitions at a time-scale similar to the frame rate (e.g. transcription factor with a 10 ms residence time imaged at 100 Hz), Spot-On may give inaccurate results since it ignores state transitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s10">Figure 3—figure supplement 10</xref>). Finally, the correction for molecules moving out-of-focus assumes that molecules are not fully confined within small compartments, that prevent molecules from moving out-of-focus.</p></sec></boxed-text></sec></app><app id="appendix-4"><title>Appendix 4</title><sec id="s10" sec-type="appendix"><title>Proposed minimal reporting guidelines for SPT data and kinetic modeling analysis</title><boxed-text><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33125.030</object-id><p>To ensure reproducibility of results and subsequent analyses, datasets, statistics and analysis metrics should be provided.

We understand that a package for 3D analysis may be out of the scope of the present article, but whether there is a prospect for such a package in the future might be indicated/commented on.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting suggestion and one we have thought a lot about. Currently, there are two main options for 3D tracking: 1) PSF shaping (such as astigmatism)-based 3D SPT (e.g. cylindrical lens or adaptive optics) and 2) 3D SPT using a Multi-Focal Microscope (MFM) (Abrahamsson et al., Nature Methods, 2013). We will discuss both here.</p><p>1) astigmatism-based 3D SPT data will give a truncated 3D displacement distribution. In x,y there are minor restrictions on displacement lengths, but in z, the max displacement will be equal to the axial detection range (~700 nm total; 0 +/- 350 nm). For example, a molecule 200 nm above the focal plane, will defocalize if it moves more than 150 nm up or more than 550 nm down. For this reason, the expected distribution of 3D displacements is not the simple 3D Brownian distribution, but a complicated convolution of a truncated axial distribution (max 700 nm; position-dependent) and the 2D x,y-distribution considered by Spot-On. To our knowledge there is no straightforward way of extending the z-correction currently implemented in Spot-On to 3D. The simulations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> compare the jump length distributions derived from data simulated (D=6.0µm²/s, dt=13ms, sigma=35nm) inside a nucleus of diameter 8µm with increasing axial detection range (400nm, 700nm and full nucleus). Although (right panel) the 2D projection from simulated data is only marginally affected by changes in the axial detection depth, in 3D (left panel), the jump length distribution is sensitive to the axial detection depth, and the lower the axial detection depth, the more truncated the distribution. More work is necessary to determine how mathematically tractable this problem is (and we agree that this will be an interesting future direction), but currently we are not sure if the additional information justifies the approach and of course 3D-astigmatism data can always be 2D-projected and then analyzed by Spot-On.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33125.032</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-33125-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>2) the truncated 3D displacement distribution issue can in theory be solved with MFM which can in principle yield whole-nucleus 3D SPT data. However, this comes with serious limitations. First, in the 9-focal plane implementation, the signal is split into 9 and due to other losses, the signal-to-noise is reduced by about a factor of ~15-20. Although the JF-dyes are very bright, this big a loss of signal is a serious limitation. Second, since the full field-of-view is required, the frame rate is necessarily slow (33 Hz in Chen Cell 2014 with EM-CCD). While sCMOS cameras might solve the speed issue, this comes at the cost of further loss of signal. Thus, in MFM-based 3D SPT, continuous illumination was necessary to collect enough signal resulting in 30 ms continuous exposure time. This leads to serious motion-blurring and likely undercounting of the fast-moving population. Third, while incredibly elegant, the MFM microscope is quite complicated to set up (we have set it up in our lab recently) and not in regular use in many labs. But as the reviewers also suggest, this is likely to improve in the future, though we note that no Z-correction for defocalization would be necessary in whole-nucleus MFM.</p><p>In summary, we believe that 3D tracking methods are currently not sufficiently mature to provide enough added value. But we nevertheless fully agree with the reviewers that this is very likely to change in the future and we have now added a sentence to the Discussion that extending Spot-On to 3D SPT data is an exciting future direction and one that we are potentially interested in pursuing. Specifically, we now write that: “This platform can easily be extended to other diffusion regimes (Metzler et al., 2014) and models (Lee et al., 2017) and, as 3D SPT methods mature, to 3D SPT data.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Along with the software, the authors describe spaSPT as a beneficial approach to minimize motion-blur and tracking errors. What would be the difference between spaSPT and SPT with very low concentration of non-photoactivatable JF dyes?

It’s just that with non-PA dyes, once the dyes have bleached no more data can be obtained from the cell in question and thus, many more cells have to be imaged to obtain enough data. So spaSPT is more convenient. But to clarify this important point, we now write: “We also note that although Spot-On was validated on spaSPT data, SPT data with non-photoactivatable dyes is also suitable for Spot-On analysis provided that the density is sufficiently low to minimize tracking errors. (see also Appendix 3: “Which datasets are appropriate for Spot-On?”)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It would be desirable to have a function for visualising tracks with the option to differentially select and display subsets of tracks that fall into different categories (immobile/mobile or other criteria).

Indeed, track visualization is crucial as it can be used both to (1) perform quality controls and spot several kinds of biases and (2) refine data analysis, for instance using track segmentation and we discuss both below.</p><p>Quality controls (1): visual inspection of the output of the tracking algorithm is indeed crucial, and can be used to detect biases such as tracking errors or issues with a detection threshold. In that case, such visual inspection is much more useful when trajectories and raw images can be overlayed. To draw the full potential of such approach, one would need to upload the raw data to Spot-On, in addition to the tracked data.</p><p>Although tracked datasets (trajectories) are easily amenable to online processing (a typical SPT tracking file has a size of the order of a few MB), raw images often weigh several GB, making their interactive processing more challenging. For this reason, we do not believe such an option will work for a web-based platform like Spot-On.</p><p>Conversely, several imageJ/Fiji plugins are capable of interactive display of raw images and trajectories. In our opinion, one of the most mature Fiji plugins is TrackMate (Tinevez et al., Methods, 2017). TrackMate can save/reopen tracking files that contain a full description of the tracking parameters, allowing for a careful inspection of the raw movies and overlaid trajectories.</p><p>In order to facilitate the integration between a track-visualization software (TrackMate) and a SPT analysis tool (Spot-On), we developed a “TrackMate to Spot-On connector” (available at: https://gitlab.com/tjian-darzacq-lab/Spot-On-TrackMate). This plugin adds an extra menu to TrackMate that allows a one-click upload of a dataset to Spot-On. Thus, a manually inspected file can automatically be uploaded to Spot-On.</p><p>We now mention this tool: “Spot-On does not directly analyze raw microscopy images, since a large number of localization and tracking algorithms exist that convert microscopy images into single-molecule trajectories (for a comparison of particle tracking methods, see (Chenouard et al., 2014); moreover, Spot-On can be interfaced with TrackMate (Tinevez et al., 2017), which allows inspection of trajectories before uploading to Spot-On).” Finally, we acknowledge that this approach restricts the inspection of trajectories to the ones tracked using the TrackMate software, and that a tool accepting a wider range of file formats would be desirable. Our group is currently pursuing efforts in that direction, but this is a longer-term project that is not within the scope of this paper.</p><p>Track segmentation/classification (2): even though Spot-On can infer diffusion constants and relative fraction of several subpopulations, it does not perform single-trajectory classification. Indeed, this latter problem is significantly harder, or even impossible, depending on the length of the track to classify (see for instance Michalet and Berglund, 2012), and several recently developed approaches already deal with this problem (Persson et al. 2013, Monnier et al., 2015), mostly relying on hidden Markov models (HMMs). Furthermore, since trajectories derived from 3D-diffusing factors entering and exiting the focal plane are inherently short, only a very small fraction of them are actually amenable to single-trajectory inference. Therefore, while we agree that assigning trajectories into particular subcategories (e.g. immobile vs. mobile) is interesting, since HMM-based approaches already exist, we feel that adding this functionality is outside the scope of this paper.</p><p>In summary, we thank the reviewers for the suggestion and have implemented a one-click open-source connector between TrackMate and Spot-On that makes visualizing the trajectories before uploading them to Spot-On easy and intuitive.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) i) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref> and subsection “Effect of motion-blur bias on parameter estimates”, first paragraph: Why is there is a small but significant difference between PA-JF<sub>549</sub> and PA-JF<sub>646</sub>?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point and we have noticed this as well. For proteins with a significant bound fraction (i.e. &gt;25%), we find that both PA-JF<sub>549</sub> and PA-JF<sub>646</sub> give identical results. However, we find that for proteins with a negligible bound fraction (e.g. Halo-3xNLS or Halo-CTCF without the DNA binding domain), PA-JF<sub>646</sub> has a “bound fraction floor” of about 10-15% which it cannot go below, whereas PA-JF<sub>549</sub> appears to be able to capture the dynamics of all proteins and we have observed bound fractions &lt;5% for PA-JF<sub>549</sub>. We believe this is the reason for the difference and we are pretty confident in this effect: it has been highly reproducible in both U2OS and mES cells and we have observed it for several different proteins. We do not have a clear explanation for this, however; one possibility is that JF<sub>646</sub> and its conjugates are a little more hydrophobic due to the extra methyl groups in the Si-rhodamine structure. This effect is unlikely to be a case of tracking “free dye ligand”, since JF<sub>646</sub> shows negligible photoactivation unless bound to the HaloTag (see Grimm 2016) and since small dyes like JF<sub>549/646</sub> are expected to have diffusion constants ~250 um2/s and thus are unlikely to be trackable. Since we do not have a clear explanation of this effect, we prefer not to speculate in the manuscript, but we now state that JF<sub>549</sub> appears to be more reliable for SPT (which could be helpful to know for other labs) and specifically write that “Similar results were obtained for both dyes for proteins with a significant bound fraction, but we note that JF<sub>549</sub> appears to better capture the dynamics of proteins with a minimal bound fraction such as Halo-3xNLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J-K</xref>)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii) Subsection “Validation of Spot-On using spaSPT data at different frame rates”: The axial detection range should be specified (around 700 nm?).</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we agree and have updated the sentence.
