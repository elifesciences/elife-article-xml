predominant pathway that repairs DNA double-strand breaks in vertebrates. During NHEJ DNA ends are held together by a multi-protein synaptic complex until they are ligated. Here, we use <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> egg extract to investigate the role of the intrinsically disordered C-terminal tail of the XRCC4-like factor (XLF), a critical factor in end synapsis. We demonstrate that the XLF tail along with the Ku-binding motif (KBM) at the extreme C-terminus are required for end joining. Although the underlying sequence of the tail can be varied, a minimal tail length is required for NHEJ. Single-molecule FRET experiments that observe end synapsis in real-time show that this defect is due to a failure to closely align DNA ends. Our data supports a model in which a single C-terminal tail tethers XLF to Ku, while allowing XLF to form interactions with XRCC4 that enable synaptic complex formation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DNA repair</kwd><kwd>non-homologous end joining</kwd><kwd>DNA double strand break</kwd><kwd>single-molecule FRET</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM115487</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loparo</surname><given-names>Joseph J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA197506</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stark</surname><given-names>Jeremy M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA240392</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stark</surname><given-names>Jeremy M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32GM129913</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carney</surname><given-names>Sean M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM008313</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Piatt</surname><given-names>Sadie C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The disordered C-terminal tail allows XRCC4-like factor (XLF) to find and bind the XRCC4-Lig4 complex, enabling DNA end synapsis and subsequent ligation during non-homologous end joining.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are a particularly toxic form of DNA damage. Within vertebrates the majority of DSBs are repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rothkamm et al., 2003</xref>). In contrast to homologous recombination (HR), the other major DSB repair pathway, NHEJ does not use a DNA template to guide repair. Instead, a synaptic complex comprised of core and accessory NHEJ factors holds DNA ends together until they are ultimately ligated. Recognition of the DSB is carried out by the ring-shaped Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer (Ku) which rapidly binds DNA ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Walker et al., 2001</xref>) and subsequently recruits downstream NHEJ factors including the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit, DNA-PKcs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Uematsu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jette and Lees-Miller, 2015</xref>), whose kinase activity is essential for DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>). As DSBs arise from a wide-range of sources, DNA ends are often initially incompatible with ligation. A host of end processing enzymes, including NHEJ-associated polymerases and nucleases, act on these ends to allow for ligation by DNA ligase IV (Lig4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grawunder et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stinson et al., 2020</xref>). Ligation requires at least two additional factors: XRCC4, a scaffolding factor to which Lig4 is constitutively bound and the structurally related XRCC4-like factor (XLF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grawunder et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buck et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahnesorg et al., 2006</xref>). Together these factors must assemble into a synaptic complex that recognizes, synapses, aligns, processes, and ligates DNA ends.</p><p>The NHEJ synaptic complex holds DNA ends together through a complicated network of intermolecular interactions. Emerging single-molecule approaches in cell-free extracts and reconstitutions have provided new mechanistic details of how these interactions evolve during repair reactions. Using single-molecule FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) experiments to monitor the distance between DNA ends in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> egg extract, we have shown that there are at least two distinct synaptic states that precede ligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Graham et al., 2016</xref>). First, Ku and DNA-PKcs (but not kinase activity) are required to weakly tether DNA ends at a distance where they are protected from processing, a state we named the long-range (LR) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stinson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Graham et al., 2016</xref>). Next, DNA-PKcs kinase activity, XRCC4, Lig4, and XLF are required to transition from the initial LR complex to a stable short-range (SR) synaptic complex in which the DNA ends are closely aligned for processing and ligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stinson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Graham et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, the catalytic activity of Lig4 is not required to form the SR complex, demonstrating that the ligase plays a structural role in end synapsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Graham et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cottarel et al., 2013</xref>). Subsequent biochemical reconstitutions of human NHEJ proteins also found evidence for these two synaptic states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that the architecture of the NHEJ synaptic complex is conserved from <italic>Xenopus</italic> to humans.</p><p>While XLF has been implicated in DNA end synapsis, there are conflicting models of its role in NHEJ. XLF, as well as the structurally similar XRCC4 and PAXX, exist as homodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Xing et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ochi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2008</xref>). Each of these paralogues consists of an N-terminal globular head domain, an extended coiled-coil stalk that mediates dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2008</xref>), and a flexible C-terminal tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andres et al., 2007</xref>). XLF and XRCC4 interact through their head domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andres et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Malivert et al., 2010</xref>), and this interaction is essential for NHEJ in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Roy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Roy et al., 2012</xref>). In minimal reconstitutions of XRCC4 and XLF, this interaction can lead to the formation of extensive XLF-XRCC4 filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andres et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ropars et al., 2011</xref>),Â which have been proposed to be important for repair in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mahaney et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Reid et al., 2015</xref>). However, single-molecule imaging of fluorescently labeled XLF in egg extract by our laboratory revealed that a single XLF dimer is sufficient for SR complex formation, although it must interact with XRRC4 through both of its head domains for optimal end joining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Graham et al., 2018</xref>). These results suggest that a single XLF dimer makes several contacts within the SR complex to mediate synapsis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The Ku binding motif (KBM) of XLF is critical for end joining in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic of the domain organization of XLF.

Deletion of the KBM ablates cellular recruitment of XLF to sites of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yano et al., 2011</xref>) and mutations within the KBM result in varying defects in cellular end joining assays and cell survival in the presence of DSB inducing agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nemoz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhargava et al., 2018</xref>). The contributions of the remainder of the C-terminal tail, henceforth referred to as the tail, are unknown, although it has been shown to be a target for phosphorylation by DNA-PKcs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yu et al., 2008</xref>). Across vertebrate species, there is poor sequence conservation within this region, and yet the tail is invariably retained with a similar length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Deleting the entire C-terminal region of XLF (including the KBM) still allows for interaction with XRCC4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andres et al., 2007</xref>). However, minimal reconstitutions show that the C-terminal region of XLF is necessary for an interaction with DNA in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andres et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andres et al., 2012</xref>) and variably stimulates (1.5â40 fold) end joining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andres et al., 2007</xref>). It remains unclear if these defects arise solely from the loss of the XLF KBM or if the tail also contributes to NHEJ.</p><p>Here, we investigate the role of the XLF C-terminal tail in NHEJ synaptic complex assembly. We show that both the KBM and the tail are essential for robust end joining in both <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract and in cells. Ablation of potential phosphorylation sites and shuffling the sequence of the tail region did not alter repair efficiency, demonstrating that, independent of sequence, the length of this region is important for NHEJ. Using asymmetric mutants of XLF, we show that a single KBM within the XLF dimer is sufficient for end joining. These observations rule out models where both XLF tails are required to span the break via interactions with opposing Ku molecules. Instead, the length of the tail is required for XLF-mediated stabilization of XRCC4-Lig4 at DNA ends. We propose that the XLF tail acts to tether XLF to DSBs through its interaction with Ku while simultaneously allowing XLF to interact with XRCC4 and drive formation of the SR complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The KBM of XLF is essential for end joining in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract</title><p>To test whether the KBM of XLF is necessary for end joining, we performed a time course end joining assay in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract. In this assay, we monitored the conversion of radiolabeled linear DNA to joined products (open circular DNA, supercoiled closed DNA, and in some cases multimers) over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Immunodepletion of XLF from extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>) abolished end joining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), consistent with prior results in extract and in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Graham et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Roy et al., 2015</xref>). A mock immunodepletion did not alter end joining, and joining in XLF-depleted extract was rescued by adding back physiological concentrations (~75 nM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">WÃ¼hr et al., 2014</xref>) of recombinant wild type (wt) XLF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Notably, an XLF mutant lacking the KBM, XLF<sup>ÎKBM</sup>, did not rescue end joining in XLF-depleted extract, demonstrating that the KBM is necessary for end joining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To further characterize the severity of this defect, we performed titrations of wt XLF and XLF<sup>ÎKBM</sup> in XLF-depleted extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). While wt XLF was able to robustly rescue joining at sub-nanomolar concentrations, the XLF<sup>ÎKBM</sup> supported little end joining even at micromolar concentrations. Collectively, these results are consistent with the KBM playing a critical role in recruiting XLF to DSBs through its interaction with Ku (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yano et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nemoz et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The interior region of the C-terminal tail of XLF is essential for end joining</title><p>Given the importance of the KBM, we next tested whether the tail of XLF is also required for end joining. We constructed several mutants in which the tail was truncated while retaining the KBM at the very C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The three truncation constructs XLF<sup>1-285+KBM</sup>, XLF<sup>1-265+KBM</sup>, and XLF<sup>1-245+KBM</sup> removed 6, 26, and 46 residues respectively from the tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To determine if the unstructured tail of XLF is necessary for NHEJ, we examined the ability of each C-terminal truncation mutant to rescue end joining in XLF-depleted extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). At 75 nM the more severe truncations, XLF<sup>1-265+KBM</sup> and XLF<sup>1-245+KBM</sup>, showed no significant joining activity, while the most conservative truncation, XLF<sup>1-285+KBM</sup>, was able to rescue end joining. Even at a concentration of 500 nM, joining by XLF<sup>1-245+KBM</sup> was barely detectable while joining by XLF<sup>1-265+KBM</sup> was clearly much slower than the wild type. In contrast, joining by XLF<sup>1-285+KBM</sup> was similar to the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). To ensure that these defects in end joining did not arise due to protein misfolding, we measured the stability of each mutant using differential scanning fluorimetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Consistent with all three mutants being stably folded, we found that the melting temperatures (T<sub>m</sub>) of the mutants were similar to the T<sub>m</sub> of wt XLF.

This assay utilizes a 2 kb linear DNA labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 dyes seven nt from each blunt end of the substrate and contains an internal biotin that is used to immobilize it on the surface of a flow cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Graham et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Graham et al., 2017</xref>). FRET between Cy3 and Cy5 only occurs within the SR complex with the average FRET efficiency being indistinguishable from the ligated product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Graham et al., 2016</xref>). For these experiments, extract depleted of XLF was supplemented with either buffer or recombinant protein and flowed into the flow cell. Each replicate consisted of a movie of three fields of view (FOVs) imaged for 15 min each. Example trajectories from the ÎXLF + wt XLF condition are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3BâC</xref>. In these trajectories two distinct FRET states are observed: a low- or no-FRET state corresponding to unpaired DNA ends or the LR complex and a high-FRET state that corresponds to the SR complex and ultimately the ligated DNA product. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> shows an example trajectory where the SR complex forms and subsequently falls apart. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> shows an example where SR complex formation leads to the high-FRET state that persists until the end of the observation window. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3DâF</xref>, the FRET signal is plotted as a normalized histogram for each 15 min interval of the experiment. In the case of the ÎXLF + wt XLF condition, we observed a time-dependent increase in the high-FRET population (FRET efficiencyÂ ~Â 0.5) due to accumulation of the SR complex along with ligated products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In contrast, the high-FRET population was not observed in the ÎXLF + buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref>) or ÎXLF + XLF<sup>1-245+KBM</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B</xref>) conditions. The absence of a high-FRET population in the XLF<sup>1-245+KBM</sup> condition could be due to (1) a substantial decrease in the stability of the SR complex or (2) an inability of the SR complex to form. To distinguish between these possibilities, we measured the rate of SR complex formation by recording the number of individual FRET events detected from all single molecules tracked (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The SR complex formation rate for wt XLF (1.7 Ã 10<sup>â3</sup>Â Â±Â 3.4 Ã 10<sup>â4</sup> s<sup>â1</sup>) agrees well with a previously published value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Graham et al., 2018</xref>), while the rates for the buffer and XLF<sup>1-245+KBM</sup> conditions wereÂ &gt;Â 25 fold lower, at 6.4 Ã 10<sup>â5</sup>Â Â±Â 1.0 Ã 10<sup>â5</sup> s<sup>â1</sup> and 4.6 Ã 10<sup>â5</sup>Â Â±Â 1.3 Ã 10<sup>â5</sup> s<sup>â1</sup>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). As we observed a similarly low number of high FRET events (SR complex formation) for the buffer and XLF<sup>1-245+KBM</sup> conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), these results show that XLF<sup>1-245+KBM</sup> is deficient in forming the SR complex. Given the severe defect in SR complex formation rates for these conditions, we were unable to collect enough events to compare the stability of the SR complex.

Both DNA-PKcs and ATM are known to target sites within the XLF tail for phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yu et al., 2008</xref>). To test whether phosphorylation sites within the tail are required for end joining, we mutated all serines to glycines and all threonines to alanines between residues 226 and 292.

Having previously shown that a single XLF dimer mediates synapsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Graham et al., 2018</xref>), we considered whether each C-terminal tail of the XLF dimer must bind the Ku molecules located on opposing DNA ends of the DSB. If this network of interactions is critical for the formation of the SR complex, decreasing the length of the XLF tail or removing one of the KBMs from the XLF dimer should block end joining. To test this Ku-XLF-Ku bridge model, we constructed a tandem dimer of XLF (tdXLF), which allows for the introduction of asymmetric KBM mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Graham et al., 2018</xref>). In this construct, the two subunits of XLF were expressed as a singleÂ polypeptide connected by a flexible linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>We generated mutants of the tdXLF construct in which either the KBM in subunit 1 is replaced by additional flexible linker sequence (tdXLF<sup>ÎKBM/WT</sup>), the KBM in subunit 2 is deleted (tdXLF<sup>WT/ÎKBM</sup>), or both the KBM in subunit 1 is replaced by linker sequence and the KBM in subunit 2 is deleted (tdXLF <sup>ÎKBM /ÎKBM</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Robust end joining was observed when tdXLF<sup>WT/WT</sup> or tdXLF<sup>ÎKBM/WT</sup> were used to rescue XLF-depleted egg extract, but little to no joining was observed with either tdXLF<sup>WT/ÎKBM</sup> or tdXLF <sup>ÎKBM /ÎKBM</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The loss of end joining observed when we delete or mutate the C-terminal KBM within subunit 2, even if the KBM in subunit 1 is intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4BâC</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2A</xref>) is likely because the C-terminal residues of the XLF KBM bind Ku80 in an internal hydrophobic pocket with the âCOO group at the C-terminus forming an electrostatic contact with Lys238 of Ku80 (in the human) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nemoz et al., 2018</xref>). The combination of losing this electrostatic contact and having to sterically accommodate the flexible linker within the hydrophobic pocket likely inhibits the KBM of subunit 1 in the tandem dimer from binding Ku80 effectively. A similar trend was observed when we used tdXLF constructs containing a previously characterized point mutation within the KBM (Leu 301 to Glu) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). The homologous mutation in human XLF was shown to reduce the affinity of XLF for KuÂ ~Â 5-fold in vitro and impaired recruitment to DNA damage in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nemoz et al., 2018</xref>).

To that end, we purified a XLF heterodimer in which one tail was deleted including the KBM. Heterodimers of XLF were generated by simultaneously expressing two versions of XLF, one His tagged and the other Flag-Avi tagged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Graham et al., 2018</xref>). Subsequent tandem affinity purification allows for the isolation of the heterodimer, as it is the only species with both affinity tags. Similar to full-length XLF heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Graham et al., 2018</xref>), we verified that there is little to no exchange of subunits after expression and purification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2BâC</xref>). Size-exclusion chromatography and multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) experiments confirmed that these heterodimer constructs exist as dimers in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2D</xref>). A comparison of joining efficiency for the Flag-Avi-XLF/His10-XLF<sup>ÎtailÎKBM</sup> construct and the wild-type Flag-Avi-XLF/His10-XLF revealed that both constructs can rescue end joining in XLF-depleted extracts, whereas dimers of His10-XLF<sup>ÎtailÎKBM</sup> cannot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). However, the linear substrate persisted at later times in the Flag-Avi-XLF/His10-XLF<sup>ÎtailÎKBM</sup> rescue relative to Flag-Avi-XLF/His10-XLF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Consistent with these observations, a comparison of these same constructs using the smFRET SR complex formation assay showed that while both Flag-Avi-XLF/His10-XLF<sup>ÎtailÎKBM</sup> and Flag-Avi-XLF/His10-XLF form the SR complex, Flag-Avi-XLF/His10-XLF<sup>ÎtailÎKBM</sup> does so less efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3AâD</xref>). We expect this defect is due to decreased XLF recruitment, but we cannot rule out other mechanisms by which end joining could be enhanced by the presence of two full-length C-terminal tails.

As XRCC4-Lig4 is known to be recruited in the absence of XLF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wu et al., 2007</xref>), these results are consistent with the interaction between XLF and XRCC4 stabilizing the XRCC4-Lig4 complex at DNA ends.

Similarly, XLF<sup>1-245+KBM</sup> failed to restore XRCC4-Lig4 stability even though it was robustly recruited.

To determine if the same interactions are important in cells, we used a chromosomal end joining assay (EJ7-GFP) that reports on error-free repair of DSBs induced by Cas9 and single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhargava et al., 2018</xref>). In this assay, a green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression cassette, with a 46 nt insert that disrupts GFP, is integrated into the <italic>Pim1</italic> locus in <italic>Xlf</italic> <sup>-/-</sup>mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Two tandem DSBs induced by Cas9/sgRNAs excise this insert, and subsequent error-free repair between the distal DSB ends restores GFP. Thus, determining the %GFP+ cells provides the frequency of this end joining event, which is normalized to transfection efficiency (see MaterialsÂ andÂ methods). With this assay, error-free end joining depends solely on canonical NHEJ factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhargava et al., 2018</xref>). We transfected various human XLF constructs into <italic>Xlf</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mESCs, along with the Cas9/sgRNA plasmids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), and measured the percentage of GFP+ cells. As previously observed, GFP+ cells are dependent on XLF in that transfections with wt XLF causes a high frequency of GFP+ cells (~50%), but without XLF (i.e. empty vector) GFP+ cells are near background levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Similar to our results in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract we observed that the XLF KBM and tail were both important for efficient end joining in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). As compared to wt XLF, XLF<sup>ÎKBM</sup> led to a severe joining defect (sixfold), and XLF<sup>1-243+KBM</sup> led to a substantial reduction (3.2-fold). Next, we introduced tdXLF constructs into <italic>Xlf</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mESCs to test whether a single KBM is sufficient for XLF function. Consistent with our results in egg extract, transfection of tdXLF<sup>(WT/WT)</sup> and tdXLF<sup>(ÎKBM/WT)</sup> rescued repair as efficiently as wt XLF. However, tdXLF<sup>(ÎKBM/ÎKBM)</sup> showed a severe defect compared to wt XLF (12.2-fold). Overall, these results demonstrate that a single KBM within an XLF dimer is sufficient for end joining in cells, but the tail of XLF must be sufficiently long to facilitate efficient end joining.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>A single XLF tail is required for end joining in cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the cellular GFP NHEJ reporter (EJ7-GFP).Â A 46 bp insertion is located within a region of the GFP gene that is critical for fluorescence.

Among the core NHEJ factors, the role of XLF in end joining has remained particularly elusive. Using <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract to recapitulate physiological end joining, our findings further articulate the intermolecular interactions formed between XLF and other NHEJ factors that mediate end synapsis. We show that both the XLF KBM and the tail are necessary for end joining. Notably, the length of the XLF tail, and not its sequence, is important for NHEJ. We propose that the C-terminal tail of a single XLF monomer acts as a âleashâ that tethers XLF to Ku via its KBM and allows it to form required interactions with XRCC4 within the synaptic complex.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The role of the XLF Ku-binding motif in NHEJ</title><p>Recruitment of NHEJ factors to DSBs depends largely on Ku (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Frit et al., 2019</xref>), and XLF is strictly required for end joining in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Graham et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we show that deleting the XLF KBM also largely ablates end joining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This defect is likely due to a loss of XLF localization to DSBs, as has been observed in cells upon KBM deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yano et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, the KBM recruits XLF to DNA ends, which facilitates formation of the synaptic complex.</p><p>Similar to our results in egg extract, we found that introduction of XLF<sup>ÎKBM</sup> into cells leads to a large decrease in error-free NHEJ, although end joining remains higher than in cells lacking XLF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). As end joining could be partially rescued by high concentrations of XLF<sup>ÎKBM</sup> in egg extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), these results suggest that XLF does not need the KBM to promote end joining when the local XLF concentration is high enough. Altogether, these findings indicate that the XLF KBM is critical for NHEJ, although without the KBM, XLF retains a weak residual activity that is likely mediated through its interaction with XRCC4.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Recruitment of XLF to DSBs is necessary but not sufficient for NHEJ</title><p>Recruitment of XLF to DSBs is required for end joining but is not sufficient. In addition to the KBM, we show that the tail is critical for DNA end synapsis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) and subsequent end joining in egg extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Similarly, introducing an XLF mutant with a truncated tail that maintained the KBM (human XLF<sup>1-243+KBM</sup>) resulted in a substantial drop in NHEJ efficiency in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Prior to this study, the role of the KBM and the rest of the C-terminal tail had not been analyzed systematically. Structural studies of XLF have commonly deleted both the tail and KBM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andres et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andres et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ropars et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hammel et al., 2011</xref>) to facilitate crystallization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andres et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andres et al., 2012</xref>). This construct still interacts with XRCC4 and promotes minimal end joining in in vitro reconstitution assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andres et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hammel et al., 2011</xref>). Within human cells, the XLF C-terminal tail was reported to be dispensable for V(D)J recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Malivert et al., 2009</xref>). As we observe a substantial reduction in NHEJ efficiency in mESCs upon removal of either the tail or KBM, this result may reflect a differential requirement of intermolecular interactions during V(D)J recombination as compared to spontaneous DSB repair. Our results demonstrate that both the flexible C-terminal tail and the KBM are required for canonical NHEJ under physiological conditions.</p><p>How does the tail of XLF contribute to NHEJ? Experiments in which we shuffled the sequence of the tail demonstrated that outside the KBM there are no additional motifs that are required for end joining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Similarly, ablating all known and potential phosphorylation sites within this region did not affect end joining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), consistent with prior results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Normanno et al., 2017</xref>). These observations suggest that the length of the tail is the critical requirement for NHEJ and informs models of how XLF promotes end joining. Therefore, we considered a model in which the two tails of the XLF dimer enable the formation of a Ku-XLF-Ku bridge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Frit et al., 2019</xref>) that is required to synapse DNA ends. Using synthetic tandem dimers of XLF, we generated asymmetric XLF dimers to show that a single KBM within an XLF dimer is sufficient to promote NHEJ in both <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4BâC</xref>) and in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These results point toward a model where a single XLF-Ku contact is sufficient for end joining.</p><p>Alternating XLF and XRCC4 filaments have been proposed to synapse DNA ends and the tail of XLF has been implicated in stabilizing these filaments in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andres et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hammel et al., 2011</xref>). We disfavor this model as we have previously shown that these filaments do not form during NHEJ in egg extract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Graham et al., 2018</xref>). While minimal mixtures of <italic>Xenopus</italic> XLF and XRCC4 form large aggregates that bridge DNA â similar to their human homologs â quantitative single-molecule imaging showed that a single XLF dimer colocalizes with DNA shortly before the formation of the SR complex. Furthermore, significant numbers of XLF dimers fail to accumulate on DNA indicating that filament formation does not occur during any stage of the repair reaction. Recent work in a human reconstitution of NHEJ also suggests that XLF filaments are not necessary for end synapsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>). During repair, Lig4, which is required to recruit and stabilize XRCC4 at DNA ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Costantini et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wu et al., 2007</xref>), likely blocks XLF molecules from interacting with both XRCC4 monomers thereby preventing filament formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Recuero-Checa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ochi et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A model for XLF in DNA end synapsis during NHEJ</title><p>Our data supports a sequential model that describes how XLF facilitates formation of the NHEJ SR synaptic complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). A single XLF dimer is first recruited to Ku via its KBM. Subsequently, the tail enables XLF to find and engage with other binding partners within the complex. In this way, the tail acts as a flexible connector that allows Ku-bound XLF to diffuse locally and make additional contacts that promote the transition from the LR to SR complex. One of these potential interactions is between XLF and XRCC4, an interaction that is required for NHEJ in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Malivert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Roy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Roy et al., 2012</xref>). We have previously shown that a single XLF dimer must engage two XRCC4-Lig4 complexes, one through each head domain, for efficient SR complex formation and end joining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Graham et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that a sufficient XLF tail length is required for both SR complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) and for XLF to stabilize XRCC4-Lig4 at DNA ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). These results mimic XLF<sup>L117D</sup>, an XLF mutant deficient in interaction with XRCC4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Graham et al., 2018</xref>). We propose that the tail of XLF facilitates the formation of an XLF-XRCC4 bridge that spans the DNA break or positions XRCC4-Lig4 so that Lig4 can engage the DNA ends. These models need not be mutually exclusive and future studies will be needed to elucidate the structural role of both XRCC4 and Lig4 in end synapsis during NHEJ.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>The tail enables XLF to stabilize XRCC4-Lig4 in the short-rangeÂ (SR) complex.</title><p>Cartoon model representing the evolution of the NHEJ synaptic complex.

IPTG was then added to cultures at a final concentration of 1 mM. The cultures were then moved to 25â30Â°C for 3 hr for protein expression. Cultures were then centrifuged to collect cells. Cell pellets were washed in 1x PBS buffer, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at â80Â°C. The pellets were thawed and resuspended in 15 mL lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 M NaCl, 30 mM imidazole, 5 mM BME, and 1 mM PMSF) per liter of culture and sonicated. The resulting lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 1 hr at 20,000 rpm in a SS34 fixed angle rotor at 4Â°C. The supernatant was incubated with Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) equilibrated in lysis buffer for 1 hr at 4Â°C to allow for binding of His-tagged proteins. The Ni-NTA resin was then was washed with lysis buffer followed by washing with salt reduction buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 350 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazole, 5 mM BME). Proteins bound to the Ni-NTA resin were then eluted by incubating the Ni-NTA resin in elution buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 350 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole, 5 mM BME) for 2 min. This elution step was repeated several times. Peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed against His-SUMO dialysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 350 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 5 mM BME, and 10% glycerol) at 4Â°C in the presence of H6-Ulp1 protease, which was added to cleave the H10-SUMO tags from the XLF constructs. After two rounds of dialysis, each being more than 4 hr long, the dialysate was incubated with fresh Ni-NTA resin equilibrated in dialysis buffer at 4Â°C for 1.5 hr. Any remaining H10-SUMO-protein, cleaved H10-SUMO, or H6-Ulp1 should remain bound to the Ni-NTA at this step.

Cultures were then spun down, washed in 1x PBS buffer, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at â80Â°C. The same His10-SUMO purification steps described for wild-type XLF above were then followed for the tandem dimer constructs. The flow through from the second Ni-NTA agarose resin (Qiagen) incubation was spun at 20,000 x g for 1 hr at 4Â°C. The sample was then diluted with 2.5 volumes of SP Buffer (50 mM Na-MES, pH 6.5, 10% glycerol, 5 mM BME) so that final [NaCl] was 100 mM in the sample before being loaded onto a HiTrap SP HP column that was equilibrated in SP Buffer A (50 mM Na-MES, pH 6.5, 10% glycerol, 5 mM BME, 100 mM NaCl). The column was then washed with five column volumes of SP Buffer A. Protein bound to the column was eluted using a 100â1000 mM NaCl gradient over 30 column volumes. Peak fractions were pooled and concentrated using a 3- or 10 kDa MWCO centrifugal spin filter (Amicon). In the case of the H10-SUMO-tdXLF <sup>ÎKBM/ ÎKBM</sup> mutant, the isoelectric point is significantly lower than that of the wild type XLF (6.13 vs. 8.00), and this mutant did not stick to the SP HP column.

The titration end joining assay was assembled on a thermocycler at 2Â°C. These reactions were initiated by moving the thermocycler to 22Â°C for 20 min. At the 20 min time point, the thermocycler was moved back to 2Â°C, and stop solution was added to each reaction. All reaction samples were then digested for 1 hr at 37Â°C by adding proteinase K. Digested samples were then run on a Tris-borate-EDTA 0.8% agarose gel. The gel was then pressed and dried onto a HyBond-XL nylon membrane (GE Healthcare) and exposed to a storage phosphor screen. Exposed screens were scanned using a Typhoon FLA 7000 imager (GE Healthcare).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Microscope and flow cell construction</title><p>Single-molecule experiments were performed using a through-objective TIRF microscope built around an Olympus IX-71 inverted microscope. 532 nm and 641 nm laser beams (Coherent Sapphire 532 and Coherent Cube 641) were expanded, combined using dichroic mirrors, expanded again, and focused on the rear focal plane of an oil immersion objective (Olympus UPlanSApo, 100x; NA, 1.40). The focusing lens was placed on a vertical translation stage to permit manual adjustment of the TIRF angle. The emission light was separated from the excitation light using a multipass dichroic mirror. The laser lines were further attenuated with a StopLine 488/532/635 notch filter (Semrock, Rochester, NY, USA). A home-built beamsplitter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Graham et al., 2017</xref>) was used to separate Cy3 and Cy5 emission signals. These two channels were imaged on separate halves of an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device camera (Hamamatsu, Hamamatsu, Japan. ImageEM 9100â13), which was operated at maximum EM gain. An automatic microstage (Mad City Labs, Madison, WI, USA) was used to position the sample and move between fields of view.</p><p>Microfluidic flow cells were constructed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stinson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Graham et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, holes for an inlet and an outlet were drilled in a glass microscope slide and PE tubing was placed into each and sealed with epoxy. A channel was cut out of a strip of double-sided SecureSeal Adhesive Sheet (Grace Bio-Labs, Bend, Oregon, USA), and this channel was placed onto the glass slide so that the two holes are at opposing ends of the channel. A glass coverslip was placed on the bottom of the flow cell on the second side of the double-sided adhesive. This coverslip was functionalized with a mixture of mPEG-SVA-5000 (Laysan Bio, Inc Arab, AL, USA) and biotin-mPEG-SVA-5000 (Laysan Bio, Inc). The edges of the channel were then sealed with epoxy.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Single-molecule FRET SR complex formation assay</title><p>The protocol for the intramolecular end joining single-molecule FRET assay generally follows a previously established protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Graham et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Graham et al., 2017</xref>). One mg/mL streptavidin in PBS buffer was flowed into the flow cell and left to incubate at room temperature for 5 min. This solution was then washed out with egg lysis buffer (ELB; 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.7, 50 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) before introducing the DNA substrate. This 2 kb blunt-ended linear DNA substrate contains an internal biotin for immobilization within the flow cell. Cy3 and Cy5 flourophores are positioned seven nucleotides from each opposing end so that energy can be transferred from Cy3 to Cy5 upon Cy3 excitation if those opposing ends are synapsed. The construction of this substrate has been described in detail previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Graham et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Graham et al., 2017</xref>). The DNA substrate was flowed into the flow cell in the presence of an oxygen scavenging system (5 mM protocatechuic acid (PCA) and 100 nM protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygensae (PCD)). One mM trolox was also included and serves as a triplet state quencher. This oxygen scavenging system with trolox was included in every solution introduced into the flow cell and imaged. AfterÂ ~Â 5 min, the DNA solution was washed out of the flow cell with ELB supplemented with the oxygen scavenging system.</p><p>Samples of extract were immunodepleted, supplemented with the oxygen scavenging system with trolox, the ATP-regeneration system described above, and recombinant protein as described above. Recombinant protein was included at 500 nM for the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and 75 nM for the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3</xref>. Data acquisition began 30 to 60 s after flowing the extract sample into the flow cell. OneÂ second exposures were collected every other second, and laser excitation was alternated so that during a single excitation cycle four 532 nm excitation frames were followed by a single 641 nm excitation frame. These excitation cycles were repeated while imaging a single field of view within the flow cell for 15 min. After 15 min, the flow cell was moved via the automatic microstage so that a new and distinct field of view was now centered under the objective and brought into focus. The same imaging procedure was repeated for 15 additional minutes in this new field of view. This process was repeated so that distinct fields of view were imaged from 0 to 15 min, 15â30 min, and 30â45 min. Previously described custom MATLAB scripts were used to analyze the data and are provided here as (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode1">Source code 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode2">Source code 2</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Graham et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Graham et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Graham et al., 2017</xref>). Trajectories were truncated prior to photobleaching events that were detected automatically during data processing and analysis. Additionally, trajectories were excluded if they exhibited low signal-to-noise, multistep photobleaching, large fluctuations in fluorescence intensity not due to FRET, or if there was more than one peak present within a region of interest. SR complex formation events were identified manually using five consecutive frames above a FRET threshold (0.25) as a guideline. The rate of SR complex formation was calculated by dividing the number of SR complex formation events by the total time that SR complex formation was possible (the total time that Cy3 and Cy5 emission signal are both present and the ends were not already joined, summed over all substrate molecules that were tracked for a certain experimental condition). Sample sizes are reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. The plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> was generated using the notBoxPlot MATLAB function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Campbell, 2020</xref>).

This protocol is outlined below with any alterations described in detail.</p><p>Biotinylated primers were used to generate a 1 kb DNA fragment with biotin molecules attached to the 5â² termini. Streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (36 ÂµL per biological replicate) were washed twice in 2x Bead Wash Buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 2 M NaCl, and 20 mM EDTA), and subsequently resuspended in 1x Bead Wash Buffer with 30 nM of the biotinylated DNA substrate described above at room temperature for 20 min. The DNA-bound beads were again washed twice in 2x Bead Wash Buffer and then washed twice in 1x Cutsmart Buffer (New England Biolabs (NEB), Ipswich, MA, USA) before being resuspended in 80 ÂµL of 1x Cutsmart Buffer. The DNA-bead suspension was then split so that plasmid control and DSB samples could be prepared and tested in parallel. One ÂµL of Xmn1 (NEB) was added to the DSB sample to generate the DSB, and both samples were incubated at 37Â°C for 6 hr. Samples were then washed 3x with 2x Bead Wash Buffer and once in Egg Lysis Blocking Buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.7, 50 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 250 mM sucrose, and 0.02% Tween20) to remove the Xmn1 and reduce non-specific binding to the beads.

Of the DNA-beads sample, 15Â ÂµLÂ was mixed with an equal volume of extract and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Thirty ÂµL of the reaction was then layered over 180 ÂµL of ELB-Sucrose Cushion Solution (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.7, 50 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 500 mM sucrose) in a horizontal rotor (Komp-spin, Ku Prima-18R). The pelleted DNA-beads were then washed in 180 ÂµL of Egg Lysis Blocking Buffer and resuspended in 20 ÂµL of 1x reducing Laemmli sample buffer. Extract was diluted 1:40 in 1x reducing Laemmli sample buffer to be used as input sample for western blotting. Samples were separated on a 4â15% precast SDS-PAGE gel (BioRad) for 30 min at 200V and subsequently transferred to a PVDF membrane for 60 min at 103V at 4Â°C. Membranes were blocked with 5% powdered nonfat milk dissolved in 1x PBST for 30 min and then incubated with primary antibody diluted in 1xPBST containing 2.5% BSA (OmniPur, (MiliporeSigma), Burlington, MA, USA) for 12â16 hr at 4Â°C.

A Sepax SRT SEC-300 column was equilibrated in SEC buffer (50 mM Na-MES, pH 6.5, 350 mM Tris, 10% glycerol, and 1 mM DTT) at 0.1 mL/min flow rate and subsequently at 0.5 mL/min flow rate for 1 hr. As a control, 100 Î¼L of 2 mg/mL BSA solution (ThermoFisher (Pierce) Cat#23209) was run over the column, which produced expected monomer and dimer peaks. Prior to running XLF samples through SEC-MALS, they were put through a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column in the same SEC buffer. For each sample, a single, strong peak was observed eluting from the Superdex 200 increase 10/300 GL column. Peak fractions were pooled and concentrated using 0.5 mL Amicon centrifugal concentrator with a 3 kDa MW cutoff. For each XLF sample, 100 Î¼L of sample (10â15 Î¼g) was injected into the SEC-MALS system for analysis. The ASTRA software suite (Wyatt) was used to process and analyze all SEC-MALS data.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank TGW Graham for generating and sharing the His10-SUMO-xl XLF, His10-SUMO-xl XLF<sup>L117D</sup>, His10-SUMO-xl XLF<sup>WT/WT</sup>, and His10-xl XLF: Flag-Avi-xl XLF plasmids and for his MATLAB smFRET analysis scripts, K Arnett (HMS Center for Macromolecular Interactions) for assistance with SEC-MALS and DSF assays, and members of the Loparo lab, in particular BM Stinson, for constructive feedback.

XRCC4-like factor (XLF) is an important player in this process. This manuscript builds on the lab's prior work, which suggested a model whereby a single XLF dimer is able to sustain NHEJ (Graham et al., 2018). Current work presents a careful study that investigates the role of the unstructured tail of XLF. Using ensemble reactions in <italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts, single-molecule experiments, and functional cell-based assays, the authors convincingly show that only one tail of the XLF dimer, of sufficient length (but not its sequence) and ending with the Ku-binding motif (KBM), is needed to sustain NHEJ. Thus a single XLF-Ku contact is sufficient for the two ends to join.</p><p>After discussing the paper, the reviewers agree that the data are solid and substantiate the key points of the authors' findings; the paper is well written and concise. The main point of the reviewers' discussion concerned whether the authors' observation that a single XLF-Ku contact is sufficient for the two DNA ends to join unambiguously excludes the role of XLF-XRCC4 filaments in NHEJ. The authors state that they disfavor the filament model. In light of the reviewers' argument, which did not yield a clear agreement, a more thorough discussion of the XLF dimer vs. XLF/XRCC4 filaments will help the readers to navigate the current models of NHEJ.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please expand the discussion of the XLF dimer vs. XLF/XRCC4 filaments models. While a single XLF-Ku contact seems sufficient (as clearly shown here) for the two DNA ends to join when the DBS is ready for ligation, the filaments may play a role earlier in the pathway before the actual repair process that is mediated by KU and ligation (e.g. as proposed by Brouwer et al., 2016). It will be informative for the readers and the field to delineate the time and place for the proposed step-by-step mechanism and/or provide a more articulated argument against the filament.</p><p>2) A tandem affinity purification approach is used to isolate XLF heterodimers. Both dimers and higher order oligomers can elute from both affinity resins. A calibrated SEC trace could be informative to distinguish the species.</p><p>3) Do the heterodimer mutants promote the Short Range (SR) complex in the FRET assay?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61920.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please expand the discussion of the XLF dimer vs. XLF/XRCC4 filaments models.

Please see the revised text below.</p><p>âHow does the tail of XLF contribute to NHEJ? [â¦] During repair, Lig4, which is required to recruit and stabilize XRCC4 at DNA ends (Costantini et al., 2007; Wu et al., 2007), likely blocks XLF molecules from interacting with both XRCC4 monomers thereby preventing filament formation (Recuero-Checa et al., 2009; Ochi et al., 2012).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A tandem affinity purification approach is used to isolate XLF heterodimers. Both dimers and higher order oligomers can elute from both affinity resins. A calibrated SEC trace could be informative to distinguish the species.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed SEC-MALS experiments on both heterodimer constructs, Flag-Avi-XLF/H10-XLF and Flag-Avi-XLF/H10-XLF<sup>ÎTailÎKBM</sup>, as well as wild type XLF. This data is shown in a new figure, Figure 4âfigure supplement 2D, and figure legends and Materials and methods sections have been updated to reflect these new data. Each sample produced a single peak that corresponded to a molecular mass that measured within 10% of the expected molecular weight of a dimer for each construct. The XLF tandem dimer has previously been shown to exist solely as a dimer (Graham, et al., 2018). We believe these data provide strong evidence that the XLF heterodimer constructs used in this manuscript exist primarily as dimers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Do the heterodimer mutants promote the Short Range (SR) complex in the FRET assay?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now done single-molecule FRET experiments to show that the heterodimer mutant, Flag-Avi-XLF /H10-XLF<sup>ÎtailÎKBM</sup> forms the SR complex, although less efficiently than the Flag-Avi-XLF /H10-XLF heterodimer. This defect is likely due to reduced recruitment as the mutant only has a single KBM instead of two. However, we cannot formally rule out contributions from other unknown mechanisms involving two C-terminal tails that could enhance end joining. We have updated the text (see below) to incorporate these results. The data from these new experiments are shown in Figure 4âfigure supplement 3A, and example trajectories are shown in Figure 4âfigure supplement 3B-D. Supplementary file 1 and Supplementary file 2 have been updated to include the data from these experiments, and the source data for Figure 4âfigure supplement 3A are available. We have modified the text in the Results section to address these new data (see below).</p><p>âSize-exclusion chromatography and multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) experiments confirmed that these heterodimer constructs exist as dimers in solution (Figure 4âfigure supplement 2D). [â¦] Overall, these results demonstrate that a single KBM on a single tail of XLF is sufficient for robust end joining.â</p></body></sub-article></article>
