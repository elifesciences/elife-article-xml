and the SNARE complex cooperate to trigger neurotransmitter release. Structural studies elucidated three distinct synaptotagmin-1-SNARE complex binding modes involving ‘polybasic’, ‘primary’ and ‘tripartite’ interfaces of synaptotagmin-1. We investigated these interactions using NMR and fluorescence spectroscopy. Synaptotagmin-1 binds to the SNARE complex through the polybasic and primary interfaces in solution. Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free synaptotagmin-1 binds to SNARE complexes anchored on PIP<sub>2</sub>-containing nanodiscs. R398Q/R399Q and E295A/Y338W mutations at the primary interface, which strongly impair neurotransmitter release, disrupt and enhance synaptotagmin-1-SNARE complex binding, respectively. Ca<sup>2+</sup> induces tight binding of synaptotagmin-1 to PIP<sub>2</sub>-containing nanodiscs, disrupting synaptotagmin-1-SNARE interactions. Specific effects of mutations in the polybasic region on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent synaptotagmin-1-PIP<sub>2</sub>-membrane interactions correlate with their effects on release. Our data suggest that synaptotagmin-1 binds to the SNARE complex through the primary interface and that Ca<sup>2+</sup> releases this interaction, inducing PIP<sub>2</sub>/membrane binding and allowing cooperation between synaptotagmin-1 and the SNAREs in membrane fusion to trigger release.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Inside the brain, cells called neurons relay messages from one place to another in the form of electrical signals. When an electrical signal reaches a junction between two neurons (known as a synapse) it triggers small particles called calcium ions to enter one of the cells. This influx of calcium causes vesicles to fuse with the membrane surrounding the neuron and release molecules called neurotransmitters into the small gap between the two neurons. These molecules travel across the gap to activate an electrical signal in the second neuron which then carries the message onwards.</p><p>A protein known as synaptotagmin-1 senses calcium ions at synapses and works together with a group of proteins known as the SNARE complex to help vesicles fuse with the cell membrane. Previous studies have reported three different structures of synaptotagmin-1 bound to the SNARE complex in a different way. But it was unclear which of these binding states actually result in the release of neurotransmitters. To address this question, Voleti, Jaczynska and Rizo studied how and when synptotagmin-1 and the SNARE complex bind together using two approaches known as NMR spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy.</p><p>The experiments suggest that before calcium enters the synapse, synaptotagmin-1 is already bound to a surface on the SNARE complex. This binding inhibits the release of neurotransmitters and has been reported in previous studies. Adding calcium ions causes synaptotagmin-1 to be released from the SNARE complex. This allows synaptotagmin-1 to interact with the membrane and cooperate with the SNARE complex to trigger vesicle fusion.</p><p>Finding out how neurons release neurotransmitters at synapses may help us to understand how the brain works. This could provide new insights into how defects in the synapse lead to neurological disorders, such as schizophrenia, and potentially aid the development of new treatments for such conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neurotransmitter release</kwd><kwd>membrane fusion</kwd><kwd>synaptotagmin-1</kwd><kwd>SNARE complex</kwd><kwd>NMR</kwd><kwd>nanodiscs</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 NS097333</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rizo</surname><given-names>Josep</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-1304</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rizo</surname><given-names>Josep</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Voleti</surname><given-names>Rashmi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free synaptotagmin-1 binds to neuronal SNARE complexes anchored on nanodiscs, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> releases this interaction to induce tight, specific binding to PIP<sub>2</sub>-containing membranes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The release of neurotransmitters by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked synaptic vesicle exocytosis is an exquisitely regulated process that is critical for communication between neurons. Release involves tethering of synaptic vesicles to presynaptic active zones, priming of the vesicles to a release-ready state, and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion of the vesicle and plasma membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Südhof, 2013</xref>). Extensive research has allowed reconstitution of basic features of synaptic vesicle fusion with the central components of the neurotransmitter release machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ma et al., 2013</xref>) and led to defined models for their functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brunger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rizo, 2018</xref>). The SNAP receptors (SNAREs) syntaxin-1, SNAP-25 and synaptobrevin form a tight four-helix bundle called the SNARE complex that brings the vesicle and plasma membranes together and is key for membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hanson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Poirier et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Söllner et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sutton et al., 1998</xref>). This complex is disassembled by N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor (NSF) and soluble NSF adaptors proteins (SNAPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Söllner et al., 1993</xref>), whereas SNARE complex assembly is organized in an NSF-SNAP-resistant manner by Munc18-1 and Munc13s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Prinslow et al., 2019</xref>). Release is triggered very fast (&lt;1 ms) after Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx by the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor Synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fernández-Chacón et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Syt1 is a synaptic vesicle protein with two C<sub>2</sub> domains (named C<sub>2</sub>A and C<sub>2</sub>B) that form most of its cytoplasmic region and adopt β-sandwich structures that bind multiple Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions through loops at the top of the β-sandwich (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fernandez et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sutton et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ubach et al., 1998</xref>). These loops also mediate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent binding to phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chapman and Davis, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Frazier et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 1998</xref>), which is crucial for neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fernández-Chacón et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rhee et al., 2005</xref>). A polybasic region on the side of the C<sub>2</sub>B domain β-sandwich also contributes to membrane binding, in part via interactions with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, the Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>B domain can bind simultaneously to two membranes in a Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent manner through its Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops and two arginines at the bottom of the β-sandwich (R398,R399) that are crucial for Syt1 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xue et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting that Syt1 cooperates with the SNAREs in bringing the vesicle and plasma membranes together to mediate membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Araç et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Seven et al., 2013</xref>). Induction of membrane curvature by insertion of the C<sub>2</sub> domain Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops into the bilayer was also proposed to stimulate membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martens et al., 2007</xref>). While these ideas are attractive, the mechanism of action of Syt1 remains enigmatic, in part because dozens of papers have described Syt1-SNARE interactions but it is unclear which of these interactions is physiologically relevant and which ones arise merely from the high promiscuity of these proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jahn and Scheller, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rizo et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, Syt1 is believed to function in a tight interplay with complexins whereby complexins play both inhibitory and stimulatory functions and Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to Syt1 releases the inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Giraudo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schaub et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tang et al., 2006</xref>), but the underlying mechanism is unknown.</p><p>Potentially critical insights were provided by three structures of Syt1-SNARE complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brewer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>), but the observed binding modes were drastically different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–G</xref>). Analysis in solution by NMR spectroscopy revealed a dynamic interaction involving the polybasic region of the Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>B domain, while R398,R399 at the bottom of C<sub>2</sub>B remain available for membrane binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brewer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The functional relevance of this binding mode was supported by the finding that release was disrupted by mutations of basic residues that contact the SNAREs (including R322E,K325E), but not by nearby basic residues that do not point toward the SNAREs (K324E,K326E) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), while both mutations disrupted PIP<sub>2</sub> binding similarly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brewer et al., 2015</xref>). The second structure, determined by X-ray crystallography, revealed a so-called primary interface involving two regions of the C<sub>2</sub>B domain, one formed largely by E295 and Y338 (region I) and another including R398,R399 (region II) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,E,F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). In this structure, the polybasic region is available for PIP<sub>2</sub> binding, an arrangement that was supported by a low-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of Syt1-SNARE complexes coating lipid tubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grushin et al., 2019</xref>). The physiological relevance of the primary interface was supported by the strong impairments of release caused by mutations in both region I and II (E295A/Y338W and R398Q/R399Q). However, Syt1-SNARE co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) was not significantly altered by the R398Q/R399Q mutation and only moderately disrupted by the E295A/Y338W mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>B domain binds to CpxSC through the polybasic region and the primary interface in solution.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Ribbon diagrams illustrating the structures of the Syt1-SNARE complex solved by NMR spectroscopy (<bold>A</bold>) or X-ray crystallography without (<bold>B</bold>) or with a bound complexin-1 fragment (<bold>C</bold>), which revealed the binding modes mediated by the polybasic region, the primary interface and the tripartite interface, respectively.

Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) supported the existence of this interaction in solution and suggested that Syt1 cooperates with complexin-1 for binding to the SNARE complex, providing an explanation for the finding that the dominant negative effect on release caused by mutation of the Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>B domain Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mackler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wu et al., 2017</xref>) requires complexin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>). The functional importance of the tripartite interface was supported by the observation that a L387Q/L394Q mutation disrupted binding and impaired neurotransmitter release. However, as pointed out in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>, the primary interface was also observed in these crystals, which had a 1:1:1 Syt1-SNARE complex-complexin-1 stoichiometry. Hence, one of the two interfaces might constitute a crystal contact. Moreover, a screen for mutations that abrogate the dominant negative effect of mutations in the Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>B domain Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites in <italic>Drosophila</italic> yielded a large number of mutations in the primary interface but none in the tripartite interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guan et al., 2017</xref>), indicating that the dominant negative effect may require Syt1-SNARE complex binding through the primary rather than the tripartite interface.</p><p>The role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in Syt1-SNARE interactions has also been enigmatic.

Paradoxically, the Syt1 Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops are not involved in SNARE complex binding in the structures described above, although Ca<sup>2+</sup> is believed to stimulate binding by increasing the positive electrostatic potential of the C<sub>2</sub>B domain, as the SNARE complex is negatively charged. Note also that Ca<sup>2+</sup> disrupted Syt1-SNARE complexes assembled on lipid tubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grushin et al., 2019</xref>), but another study reported binding of Syt1 to membrane-anchored SNARE complex in the absence and presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Conversely, ATP was reported to abolish Syt1-SNARE complex at physiological ionic strength, with or without Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Park et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To shed light into this strikingly confusing picture and decipher how the functions of Syt1 and the SNAREs are coupled, we performed a systematic analysis of Syt1-SNARE complex interactions in solution and on membranes. NMR data show that a soluble complexin-1-SNARE complex binds to the polybasic region and the primary interface of the Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>B domain with similar affinities, but binding to the tripartite interface could not be detected. Analyses of binding of a Syt1 fragment spanning the two C<sub>2</sub> domains (C<sub>2</sub>AB) to nanodiscs or nanodiscs containing anchored SNARE complexes using FRET show that C<sub>2</sub>AB binds to membrane-anchored SNARE complexes under a variety of conditions, and that complexin-1 does not affect the affinity. Binding of the SNARE complex to the primary interface is impaired by the R398Q/R399Q mutation but is enhanced by the E295A/Y338W mutation, both in solution and on nanodiscs, showing that the primary interface is involved in binding to the nanodisc-anchored SNARE complex. Importantly, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent binding of C<sub>2</sub>AB to SNARE complexes anchored on PIP<sub>2</sub>-nanodiscs is almost abolished in the presence of ATP, but Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent binding remains. We also observed that the R322E/K325E mutation disrupts Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent binding of C<sub>2</sub>AB to PIP<sub>2</sub>-containing nanodiscs much more strongly than the K324E/K326E mutation, in correlation with the effects of these mutations on release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brewer et al., 2015</xref>). Together with previous data, these results suggest a model whereby Syt1 binds to the SNARE complex through the primary interface and to PIP<sub>2</sub> through the polybasic region before Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx; Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the C<sub>2</sub>B domain induces a specific, PIP<sub>2</sub>-dependent interaction with the plasma membrane, disrupting the interaction with the SNARE complex and allowing cooperation between the SNAREs and Syt1 in inducing membrane fusion.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The SNARE complex binds to the C<sub>2</sub>B domain polybasic region and to the primary interface with similar affinity in solution</title><p>The tendency of the Syt1 C<sub>2</sub> domains to precipitate with the SNARE complex formed by the SNARE motifs of synaptobrevin, syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25, particularly in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, hindered analysis of their interactions in solution by NMR spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>). Inclusion of 125 mM KSCN allowed NMR analyses in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brewer et al., 2015</xref>), but KSCN might have favored binding of the SNARE complex to the C<sub>2</sub>B domain polybasic region over binding to the primary interface. In attempts to solve the solubility problem without addition of KSCN, we found that including the complexin-1 fragment that we used for crystallization with the SNARE complex [residues 26–83; Cpx1(26-83)] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2002</xref>) dramatically improved the solubility of mixtures containing the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound C<sub>2</sub>B domain and the SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Taking advantage of this observation, we analyzed the binding sites of the SNARE complex on the Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>B domain in the presence of Cpx1(26-83) using NMR spectroscopy. Note that the Syt1 C<sub>2</sub> domains do not bind to complexin-1 under the conditions that we used for the NMR experiments and that Cpx1(26-83) binds to the SNARE complex with high affinity (K<sub>D</sub> ca. 25 nM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xu et al., 2013</xref>). Hence, the assembly formed by Cpx1(26-83) and the SNARE motifs of synaptobrevin, syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25 can be considered as a single complex that we refer to as CpxSC. For improved sensitivity, we prepared samples of the C<sub>2</sub>B domain that were <sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-labeled and specifically <sup>13</sup>CH<sub>3</sub>-labeled at the Ile δ1 and Met methyl groups (<sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-IM-<sup>13</sup>CH<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B).

Mapping of the residues corresponding to the cross-peaks that exhibited the largest shifts induced by CpxSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>) onto the structure of the C<sub>2</sub>B domain clearly showed that the residues are clustered on two sides of the β-sandwich, one containing the polybasic region and another corresponding to the primary interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). There were no significant shifts in cross-peaks from residues in the tripartite interface, which is largely formed by the α-helix spanning residues 384–395, except for residues at the very C-terminus of this helix that are near the primary interface. We could not obtain accurate K<sub>D</sub>s for the interactions of CpxSC with the polybasic region and the primary interface from these data because we did not achieved saturation at the highest concentration of CpxSC that we reached (85 μM) and, at these concentrations, some cross-peaks broadened beyond detection or exhibited odd behavior that did not correlate with the previous titration points (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref> by the cross-peaks from two residues corresponding to the polybasic region, K325 and K369, and two residues from the primary interface, V283 and Y339).

Since the C<sub>2</sub>B domain Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding region is not involved in binding and Ca<sup>2+</sup> did not affect the binding modes, these experiments were performed in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. We first analyzed the effects of the R322E/K325E mutation that we designed previously to disrupt SNARE complex binding to the polybasic region and strongly impaired neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brewer et al., 2015</xref>). A titration with CpxSC revealed substantial shifts for selected cross-peaks of the C<sub>2</sub>B mutant HSQC spectrum, but the patterns were somewhat distinct from those observed for the WT C<sub>2</sub>B domain (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> with 1H). The cross-peaks from the β-strand containing the mutated residues shifted and their positions could not be ascertained. However, we could identify the diagnostic cross-peak from K369, which is in the same face of the C<sub>2</sub>B domain as the polybasic region. The position of this cross-peak was unaffected even at 85 μM CpxSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), confirming that binding to the polybasic region was abolished by the R322E/K325E mutation. We also observed that the diagnostic cross-peaks from the primary interface corresponding to V283 and Y339 shifted faster in the titration of the R322E/K325E mutant than observed for the WT C<sub>2</sub>B domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), which is a natural consequence of the lack of competition with the polybasic region for binding to CpxSC. Interestingly, multiple cross-peaks from the primary interface exhibited much more substantial CpxSC-induced shifts for the mutant than for the WT C<sub>2</sub>B domain, including cross-peaks from R398 and I401 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,D</xref>), residues that are near V283 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These results suggest that binding of CpxSC to the primary interface is more extensive for the R322E/K325E mutant C<sub>2</sub>B and that the polybasic region not only competes with the primary interface for binding to CpxSC but also hinders full C<sub>2</sub>B-SNARE engagement at the primary interface.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Mutations in the polybasic region and the primary interface of the C<sub>2</sub>B domain abrogate binding to CpxSC.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) Superposition of <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N TROSY-HSQC spectra of R322E/K325E (<bold>A</bold>) or R398Q/R399Q (<bold>B</bold>) <sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-IM-<sup>13</sup>CH<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B domain in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and the presence of different concentrations of CpxSC as indicated by the color code (C<sub>2</sub>B concentrations gradually decreased from 32 to 12 μM).

To investigate the contribution of these tandem arginines to Syt1-SNARE complex binding at the primary interface, we analyzed binding of CpxSC to the R398Q/R399Q mutant C<sub>2</sub>B domain. We observed that the CpxSC-induced shifts of the cross-peaks from the primary interface were almost abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and expansions for the V283 and Y339 cross-peaks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), showing that the mutation strongly impairs binding of CpxSC to this interface.

Since individual R398Q and R399Q mutations also impair release considerably (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xue et al., 2008</xref>), we also tested binding of CpxSC to R398Q C<sub>2</sub>B and R399Q C<sub>2</sub>B mutants. Both single mutations impaired CpxSC binding substantially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), although to a smaller extent than the double R398Q/R399Q mutation. These results show that both R398 and R399 play important roles in binding of Syt1 to CpxSC through the primary interface.</p><p>We also prepared a mutant C<sub>2</sub>B domain bearing both the R322E/K325E mutation in the polybasic region and the R398Q/R399Q mutation in the primary interface.

Binding of an unlabeled protein or complex to a <sup>15</sup>N-labeled protein is expected to cause not only cross-peak shifts but also decreased cross-peak intensities due to the larger size of the resulting complex compared to the isolated <sup>15</sup>N-labeled protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rizo et al., 2012</xref>), as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–C</xref> by the gradual decreases in intensities of selected cross-peaks of WT C<sub>2</sub>B caused by increasing CpxSC concentrations. In contrast, the cross-peak intensities of R322E/K325E/R398Q/R399Q C<sub>2</sub>B did not decrease appreciably as increasing concentrations of CpxSC were added. Thus, the ratios of the intensities in the presence of 85 μM CpxSC versus the intensities in the absence of CpxSC for the same selected cross-peaks of R322E/K325E/R398Q/R399Q C<sub>2</sub>B were close to 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). Analysis of these ratios for all cross-peaks showed a relatively homogeneous distribution, with an average ratio of 0.947 and some natural variability due to the noise in the data, particularly for the weakest cross-peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>). The average ratio for five cross-peaks that are in well-resolved regions of the spectrum and correspond to residues in the α-helix involved in the tripartite interface (T383, G384, L387, R388 and S391) is 0.945. These data show that the quadruple R322E/K325E/R398Q/R399Q mutation abolishes binding of the Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>B domain to CpxSC and the mutant does not bind through the tripartite interface under these conditions.</p><p>To corroborate this conclusion, we also analyzed samples where Cpx1(26-83) was <sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-labeled and formed <sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-CpxSC to analyze perturbations on Cpx1(26-83) upon C<sub>2</sub>B domain binding.

Importantly, C<sub>2</sub>B did not induce significant shifts in any of the cross-peaks from residues at or near the tripartite interface (residues 66–75; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We note that K73, K74 and K75 are flexible in the complex but their cross-peaks are in unique positions that are very sensitive to changes in their environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pabst et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Trimbuch et al., 2014</xref>). Hence, the absence of shifts in these cross-peaks and those of residues 66–75 in general show that the C<sub>2</sub>B domain does not bind to CpxSC through the tripartite interface under these conditions. Moreover, R322E/K325E/R398Q/R399Q C<sub>2</sub>B did not cause shifts or intensity decreases in the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N TROSY-HSQC spectrum of <sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-CpxSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), showing again that the quadruple mutation abrogates binding of the Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>B domain to CpxSC. Hence, we do not find any evidence for binding of the C<sub>2</sub>B domain to CpxSC through the tripartite interface even after abolishing the interactions involving the polybasic region and the primary interface. These results contrast with ITC data suggesting the existence of a Syt1-complexin-1-SNARE complex interaction involving the tripartite interface in experiments performed with Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>B bearing seven mutations designed to disrupt binding via the polybasic region and the primary interface (KA-Q mutant), and a complexin-1-SNARE complex bearing five mutations to further disrupt such binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>).

Hence, it is plausible that the disruption of neurotransmitter release caused by the L387Q/L394Q mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>) arose from a general loss of function caused by protein instability.</p><p>In summary, our data show that binding of the Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>B domain to the Cpx1(26-83)-SNARE complex in solution involves the polybasic region and the primary interface, while binding via the tripartite interface is undetectable under the conditions of our NMR experiments even when CpxSC is added at 85 μM concentration and binding through the polybasic region and the tripartite interface is abolished. These results indicate that the tripartite interface observed in the complexin-1-Syt1-SNARE complex crystals might have arisen from crystal packing, but further research will be required to clarify this issue.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The E295A/Y338W mutation in the primary interface enhances C<sub>2</sub>B-CpxSC binding in solution</title><p>The primary interface involves two regions of the C<sub>2</sub>B domain, one containing R398 and R399 (region II), and the other E295 and Y338 (region I). The functional importance of region I was demonstrated by the strong disruption of neurotransmitter release caused by the E295A/Y338W mutation in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). To examine the effects of this mutation on Syt1-SNARE binding, we performed titrations of <sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-IM-<sup>13</sup>CH<sub>3</sub>-E295A/Y338W C<sub>2</sub>B with CpxSC. Interestingly, we found that CpxSC caused more extensive changes in the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N TROSY-HSQC spectrum of this mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) than those observed for WT C<sub>2</sub>B domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Analysis of these changes showed that cross-peaks from residues in or near the polybasic region shifted less extensively and more slowly than observed for WT C<sub>2</sub>B, particularly in the initial points of the titration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). Conversely, cross-peaks from the primary interface moved faster and more extensively for E295A/Y338W C<sub>2</sub>B than for WT C<sub>2</sub>B; indeed, some cross-peaks that did not shift or barely shifted in WT C<sub>2</sub>B exhibited considerable shifts for E295A/Y338W C<sub>2</sub>B domain, including the R398 cross-peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,D</xref>). These effects in cross-peaks from the primary interface are reminiscent of those observed for the R322E/K325E mutant C<sub>2</sub>B domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C,D</xref>), but the shifts observed for the primary interface of the E295A/Y338W C<sub>2</sub>B mutant are even larger. These results show that the E295A/Y338W mutation actually increases the affinity of the Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>B domain for CpxSC rather than impairs binding, and also appears to make the interaction at the primary interface more extensive, as observed for the R322E/K325E mutation. The basis for this behavior is unclear, but the increased affinity caused by the E295A/Y338W mutation may arise from replacing a tyrosine with a tryptophan, which increases the hydrophobic surface area of this residue. This change may be readily accommodated because the packing in this region of the interface with the SNARE complex is not optimal. We note that the movement of some cross-peaks with increasing CpxSC concentration was curved in some cases (e.g. those of K325 and R398, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). This finding suggests that there is an interplay between binding of CpxSC to the primary interface and to the polybasic region. CpxSC appears to bind exclusively to one or the other site at low concentrations, likely because of steric hindrance disfavors simultaneous binding of two CpxSC complexes to one C<sub>2</sub>B domain. However, simultaneous binding to both sites might be allowed at higher CpxSC concentrations by slight alterations in both binding modes, leading to the curved cross-peak movement.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The E295A/Y338W mutation enhances the affinity of the Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>B domain primary interface for CpxSC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Superposition of <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N TROSY-HSQC spectra of E295A/Y338W <sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-IM-<sup>13</sup>CH<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B domain in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and the presence of different concentrations of CpxSC as indicated by the color code (C<sub>2</sub>B concentrations gradually decreased from 32 to 12 μM).

Since the polybasic region and the tandem arginines have been implicated also in membrane binding [e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Araç et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xue et al., 2008</xref>)], it is critical to analyze interactions between Syt1 and membrane-anchored SNARE complexes to assess whether either of these two binding modes still remain in the presence of membranes, or a different type of interaction might occur. For this purpose, we designed a strategy based on anchoring SNARE complexes on nanodiscs. For these studies we used the Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB fragment that spans both C<sub>2</sub> domains because the C<sub>2</sub>A domain contributes to binding of Syt1 to membranes and could contribute to binding to the SNARE complex directly or indirectly, for example through cooperativity between SNARE and lipid interactions of Syt1. As a scaffold for the nanodiscs, we chose MSP1E3D1 because it yields stable nanodiscs with a diameter of ca. 13 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nath et al., 2007</xref>) that can accommodate the SNARE complex and allow potential simultaneous interactions of Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB with the SNARE complex and the lipids. We prepared SNARE complexes with full-length syntaxin-1 and the SNARE motifs of SNAP-25 and synaptobrevin, anchoring the complexes on the nanodiscs through the syntaxin-1 transmembrane (TM) region to mimic the configuration expected to occur on the plasma membrane. The stoichiometry of MSP1D3 to syntaxin-1 was adjusted to form nanodiscs that on average contained one SNARE complex. We refer to these macromolecular assemblies as cisSC-NDs, while control nanodiscs prepared without the SNAREs are abbreviated as NDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

We observed a natural variability in the apparent K<sub>D</sub>s that may arise in part from different incorporation of SNARE complexes into the nanodiscs. Note also that some of the K<sub>D</sub>s are in the low nM range and may not be accurate because the concentration of C<sub>2</sub>AB* used for all experiments was 50 nM and the corresponding titration curves thus approach saturating binding conditions. Hence, these K<sub>D</sub>s and corresponding cooperativity factors must be interpreted with caution. For all these reasons, the conclusions described below were obtained by comparing experiments performed on the same day or over period of two days with the same preparations, and were confirmed by additional comparisons made with other preparations on different days.

Since Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB is able to bind simultaneously to two membranes in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Araç et al., 2006</xref>), which could cooperate with binding to the SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brewer et al., 2015</xref>), we also investigated binding of C<sub>2</sub>AB to trans-SNARE complexes formed between two nanodiscs (transSC-NDs). Because we wanted to compare binding to cis and trans SNARE complexes, in these experiments we placed a tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) acceptor fluorescent probe on the SNARE complex rather than on the nanodiscs to allow direct quantification of the SNARE complex concentrations from the UV-vis absorption of the probe. We chose residue 34 of SNAP-25 to place the acceptor probe because it is predicted to be sufficiently close to the donor probe at residue 346 of C<sub>2</sub>AB in any of the three structures of Syt1-SNARE complexes that have been elucidated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>), such that binding would be detected regardless of which binding mode occurs. Titrations of C<sub>2</sub>AB* with transSC-NDs and cisSC-NDs yielded similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) and comparable apparent K<sub>D</sub>s (118 nM and 96 nM, respectively). The lower K<sub>D</sub> obtained with cisSC-NDs labeled with 5% Rho-PE can be attributed to the negative charge added by the labeled lipids, which should increase their membrane affinity for C<sub>2</sub>AB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 1998</xref>). These results suggest that the affinity of C<sub>2</sub>AB* for cisSC-NDs and transSC-NDs is similar and ensuing experiments were performed with cisSC-NDs for simplicity.</p><p>We also analyzed binding of C<sub>2</sub>AB* to cisSC-NDs that were labeled at the N- or C-terminus of the SNARE complex (residue 16 or 76 of SNAP-25; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

The FRET efficiencies observed at saturating concentrations were similar for the labels at residues 34 and 76 of SNAP-25, and somewhat lower for the label at residue 16. The FRET efficiencies are consistent with the binding modes involving the polybasic region and the primary interface, which predict that the probe on C<sub>2</sub>AB* is located at comparable, short distances from residues 34 and 76, and farther from residues 16, but are not consistent with the tripartite complex, where residue 346 of C<sub>2</sub>AB* is expected to be much closer to residue 16 than to residue 76 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, these results are not conclusive, as other binding modes could also be consistent with the observed FRET efficiencies.

These results suggest that there is a strong synergy between binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free C<sub>2</sub>AB* to the SNARE complex and the nanodisc phospholipids. Since PIP<sub>2</sub> enhances binding of the C<sub>2</sub>B domain to membranes due to interactions with the polybasic region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2006</xref>), we performed titrations with NDs and cisSC NDs containing 1% PIP<sub>2</sub> and indeed observed much higher affinities at 50 mM KCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, black and red curves; apparent K<sub>D</sub>s 286 nM and 43 nM, respectively). Binding was weaker in 125 mM KCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, blue and green curves) but there was still a large difference in the K<sub>D</sub>s observed for NDs and cisSC-NDs (apparent K<sub>D</sub>s 4.9 μM and 366 nM, respectively). We also analyzed binding of C<sub>2</sub>AB* to NDs and cisSC-NDs containing 1% PIP<sub>2</sub> in the presence of 1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> and again observed increased affinity for the latter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>, black and red curves; apparent K<sub>D</sub>s 22 nM and 12 nM, respectively). Since the high affinity for cisSC-NDs containing PIP<sub>2</sub> implied that we were close to saturation binding conditions, which hindered analysis of the SNARE-induced enhancement on binding, we also performed experiments with NDs and cisSC-NDs containing 10% instead of 15% PS (i.e. composed of PC:PS:Rho-PE:PIP<sub>2</sub> 84:10:5:1) and indeed observed somewhat weaker binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>, green and orange curves; apparent K<sub>D</sub>s 29 nM and 20 nM, respectively). Overall, the increases in affinity caused by simultaneous binding of C<sub>2</sub>AB* to the nanodiscs and the SNARE complex were considerably lower in the presence than in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, particularly when the nanodiscs contained PIP<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Mutations in the polybasic region and R398,R399 disrupt Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent binding of C<sub>2</sub>AB* to nanodisc-anchored SNARE complex</title><p>To dissect the contributions of the polybasic region and R398,R399 at the primary interface to binding of C<sub>2</sub>AB* to NDs and cisSC-NDs, we performed titrations under various conditions using WT and mutant versions of C<sub>2</sub>AB* that were labeled with a donor probe at residue 346 and bore the R322E/K325E, R398Q/R399Q or R322E/K325E/R398Q/R399Q mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">6</xref>). Since the much stronger effects of the R322E/K325E mutation than the K324E/K326E mutation on SNARE complex binding and on neurotransmitter release supported the physiological relevance of Syt1-SNARE complex binding through the polybasic region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brewer et al., 2015</xref>), we also included C<sub>2</sub>AB* with the K324E/K326E mutation in these analyses. All NDs and cisSC-NDs included 5% Rho-PE. Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent binding of C<sub>2</sub>AB* to NDs was markedly impaired by all mutations, but mutations in the polybasic region impaired binding to NDs containing PIP<sub>2</sub> much more strongly than the R398Q/R399Q mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,C</xref>). Hence, binding to these nanodiscs is mediated largely by the polybasic region, as expected, but the tandem arginines also participate in binding to some extent. Binding to cisSC-NDs in EGTA was also impaired strongly by mutations in the polybasic region, but in this case the impairment caused by the R398Q/R399Q mutation was almost as strong (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,D</xref>). All mutations strongly decreased the cooperativity factors calculated from K<sub>D</sub> NDs/K<sub>D</sub> cisSC-NDs, which provide an idea of the contribution of C<sub>2</sub>AB*-SNARE complex interactions to cisSC-ND binding and ranged from 6.64 to 62.1 for WT C<sub>2</sub>AB* in the three conditions including EGTA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Thus, both the tandem arginines (R398,R399) and the polybasic region are important for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent, simultaneous binding of C<sub>2</sub>AB* to the SNARE complex and the lipids. These findings suggest that the underlying interactions are dynamic and involve at least two binding modes whereby either the primary interface containing R398,R399 or the polybasic region interacts with the SNAREs and the other basic sequence (the polybasic region or R398,R399) binds to the lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Effects of mutations in the Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>B domain on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent binding of C<sub>2</sub>AB* to NDs and cisSC-NDs.</title><p>(<bold>A–H</bold>) FRET efficiencies observed in titrations of WT, R398Q/R399Q (RQRQ), R322E/K325E (REKE), K324E/K326E (KEKE) or R322E/K325E/R398Q/R399Q (REKERQRQ) C<sub>2</sub>AB* with NDs (<bold>A,C,E,G</bold>) or cisSC-NDs (<bold>B,D,F,H</bold>) containing 15% PS and 5% Rho-PE (<bold>A,B,E,F</bold>), 15% PS, 5% Rho-PE and 1% PIP<sub>2</sub> (<bold>C,D</bold>), or 10% PS, 5% Rho-PE and 1% PIP<sub>2</sub> (<bold>G,H</bold>) in the presence of 1 mM EGTA and 50 mM KCl (<bold>A–D</bold>), or 1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> and 125 mM KCl (<bold>E–H</bold>).

These findings show that there is a specific Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent binding mode of Syt1 to PIP<sub>2</sub>-containing membranes that involves R322,K325 but not K324,K326, and suggest that the specific, strong disruption of neurotransmitter release induced by the R322E/K325E mutation but not the K324E/K326E mutation arises from impairment of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent binding of Syt1 to the (PIP<sub>2</sub>-containing) plasma membrane rather than to the SNARE complex.</p><p>The cooperativity factors calculated from K<sub>D</sub> NDs/K<sub>D</sub> cisSC-NDs in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> under various conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplements 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">6</xref>) ranged from 1.39 to 3.11 and hence were considerably smaller than those observed in EGTA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), indicating that interactions of WT C<sub>2</sub>AB* with the SNARE complex contributed much less to binding to cisSC-NDs in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> than in its absence. Interestingly, the cooperativity factors observed for WT C<sub>2</sub>AB* in the presence of PIP<sub>2</sub> were particularly small, suggesting that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent interactions of C2AB* with PIP<sub>2</sub> on the nanodiscs preclude interactions with the SNARE complex. The diminished cooperativity factors in the presence of PIP<sub>2</sub> were decreased further by the R398Q/R399Q, K324E/K326E and R322E/K325E/R398Q/R399Q mutations, but where substantially increased by the R322E/K325E mutation, presumably because the specific interactions of C<sub>2</sub>AB* with PIP<sub>2</sub> mediated by R322E,K325E were disrupted, allowing binding to the SNARE complex. These findings can be readily rationalized by modeling how the C<sub>2</sub>B domain binds to a PIP<sub>2</sub>-containing membrane in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner. Because Ca<sup>2+</sup> induces binding of the C<sub>2</sub>B domain in an approximately perpendicular orientation to the membrane that favors insertion of both Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops into the bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Araç et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rufener et al., 2005</xref>), this orientation allows binding of R322 and K325 to PIP<sub>2</sub>, but K324 and K326 point away from the membrane because they are on the opposite side of the same β-strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>; see also Figure 10B). In this configuration, interaction of the SNARE complex with the primary interface of the C<sub>2</sub>B domain is impossible because it would place the syntaxin-1 C-terminus far from the membrane where it is anchored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Simultaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent binding of the C<sub>2</sub>B domain to the membrane through its Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops and to the SNARE complex through its polybasic region is in principle compatible with anchoring of syntaxin-1 to the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D</xref>), but this binding mode is expected to be prevented by PIP<sub>2</sub> because PIP<sub>2</sub> binds to K322,R325, the same residues of the polybasic region that are key for SNARE complex binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brewer et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In summary, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent binding of C<sub>2</sub>AB* to PIP<sub>2</sub>-containing membranes is incompatible with the two major Syt1-SNARE complex binding modes, which involve the primary and polybasic interfaces.

The highest FRET efficiency was increased to some extent by the E295A/Y338W mutation and even more by the R322E/K325E mutation, but was decreased by the R398Q/R399Q mutation, which consistently led to a bimodal binding curve with a maximum at about 20 nM cisSC-PC/PS/PIP<sub>2</sub>-NDs in four independent experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D,F,H</xref>). These results are consistent with the notion that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent binding of C<sub>2</sub>AB* to PIP<sub>2</sub>-containing membranes is incompatible with SNARE complex binding through the primary and polybasic interfaces. In the absence of interactions with the SNARE complex, C<sub>2</sub>AB* may bind with similar probabilities to both sides of the nanodiscs, perhaps with some preference for the side lacking SNAREs where there are no steric clashes with the SNARE complex. Non-specific interactions of R398,R399 of WT C<sub>2</sub>AB* with acidic residues from the SNAREs may facilitate binding to the SNARE-containing side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2E</xref>), leading to some FRET, but mutation of these arginines may lead to preferential binding of the R398Q/R399Q mutant to the other side, particularly at high nanodisc concentrations when membrane availability is not limiting. The highest FRET efficiency was likely increased by the E295A/Y338W mutation because it enhances SNARE binding.

The recent determination of three structures of Syt1-SNARE complexes led to intriguing models of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brewer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>), but yielded a confusing picture because of the striking differences among the structures.

Together with available data, the study presented here suggests that Syt1 binds to the SNARE complex before Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, most likely through the primary interface, and that Ca<sup>2+</sup> actually releases this interaction, inducing tight membrane binding that involves specific interactions of the C<sub>2</sub>B polybasic region with PIP<sub>2</sub>.

Weak interactions can be dramatically enhanced by co-localization within the confines of a primed synaptic vesicle, but they must be distinguished from other, perhaps stronger but irrelevant interactions that are detectable in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Magdziarek et al., 2020</xref>). Another complicating aspect is that basic sequences such as the polybasic region and R398,R399 can bind to SNAREs and to membranes, both of which are acidic, and binding to a wrong molecule can occur in the absence of the bona fide target. Perhaps the most confusing factor was the observation by multiple labs that Ca<sup>2+</sup> strongly enhanced binding of Syt1 to SNAREs or SNARE complexes in solution (see introduction), leading to the widespread belief that elucidating how Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound Syt1 binds to the SNARE complex was a ‘Holy Grail’ to understand neurotransmitter release. However, it now seems clear that Ca<sup>2+</sup> releases Syt1 from SNARE complexes anchored on PIP<sub>2</sub>-containing membranes such as the plasma membrane and that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced increase in Syt1-SNARE binding in solution arose merely because Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases the positive electrostatic potential of the Syt1 C<sub>2</sub> domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fernandez et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shao et al., 1997</xref>). This enhanced Syt1-SNARE affinity is offset by the specific, Ca<sup>2+</sup> -dependent interaction of Syt1 with PIP<sub>2</sub>-containing membranes, which is incompatible with SNARE complex binding and is much stronger. This key conclusion arises from several lines of evidence.</p><p>First, our titrations with NDs and cisSC-NDs show that physiological conditions including Mg-ATP almost abolish Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent binding of C<sub>2</sub>AB* to the SNARE complex anchored on PIP<sub>2</sub>-containing membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>), consistent with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Park et al., 2015</xref>). A previous study reported that Syt1-SNARE complex interactions persist in the presence of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2016</xref>), but this conclusion was tested only in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and is thus consistent with our results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>).</p><p>Second, and particularly important is the observation of the high specificity of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent binding of C<sub>2</sub>AB* to PIP<sub>2</sub>-containing NDs, which is disrupted much more strongly by the R322E/K325E mutation than by the K324E/K326E mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9F</xref>), in correlation with the effects of these mutations on neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brewer et al., 2015</xref>). Note that, remarkably, the striking difference in the effects of the two mutations on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent binding of C<sub>2</sub>AB* to PIP<sub>2</sub>-containing NDs was not observed in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent binding to NDs lacking PIP<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) or Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent binding to NDs with or without PIP<sub>2</sub>, and with or without SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–D</xref>). As explained above, modeling readily explains these observations, as R322 and K325 (but not K324 and K326) are expected to be well positioned to interact with PIP<sub>2</sub> upon Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced binding of the C<sub>2</sub>B domain to the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). In the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, insertion of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops into the membrane is hindered by the negative charge of the loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fernandez et al., 2001</xref>) and, consequently, more parallel orientations of the C<sub>2</sub>B domain with respect to the membrane that allow simultaneous binding of the primary interface to the SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>) are favored. These parallel orientations bring K324 and K326 near the membrane and hence PIP<sub>2</sub> can readily interact with these residues as well as with R322 and K325.</p><p>Third, binding of the C<sub>2</sub>B domain to the membrane in the perpendicular orientation induced by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and PIP<sub>2</sub> is incompatible with the binding modes observed in the three structures of Syt1-SNARE complexes that have been determined. The elongated SNARE complex could not remain membrane-anchored or would have strong steric clashes if it remained bound to the C<sub>2</sub>B domain through the primary or tripartite interfaces, and binding of the SNARE complex to the polybasic region is hindered because this region interacts with PIP<sub>2</sub>. These conclusions are supported by the observation that highly efficient FRET between C<sub>2</sub>AB* and the SNARE complex labeled at residue 76 of SNAP-25 was observed under a variety of conditions except for those that allowed Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent binding of C<sub>2</sub>AB* to PIP<sub>2</sub>-containing SNARE complex nanodiscs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Note also that the physiological relevance of our NMR structure was supported by the differential disruption of C<sub>2</sub>B-SNARE complex binding and neurotransmitter release caused by the R322E/K325E and K324E/K326E mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brewer et al., 2015</xref>). However, the physiological data can now be explained by the differential effects of these mutations on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent binding of C<sub>2</sub>AB* to PIP<sub>2</sub>-containing membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9F</xref>), which occurs with high affinity (in the low nM range) and is much tighter than SNARE complex binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>).</p><p>Syt1 does bind to membrane-anchored SNARE complexes in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, even in the presence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Our NMR studies show that there are two main Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent binding modes between the C<sub>2</sub>B domain and CpxSC in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) that are mediated by the primary and polybasic interfaces. The strong disruption of CpxSC binding to the primary interface caused by the R398Q/R399Q mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>) shows that R398,R399 contribute substantially to the energy of binding at this interface. E295 and Y338 likely contribute also to the binding energy, but additional mutations will be necessary to assess this contribution, as the E295A/Y338W mutation actually enhances binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These observations contrast with the finding that co-IP of Syt1 with the SNAREs was not substantially affected by the R398Q/R399Q mutation and was moderately disrupted by the E295A/Y338W mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). This discrepancy might arise because co-IP likely detects SNARE binding to the polybasic region upon membrane solubilization, and depends not only on affinities but also on off rates. The effects of the R398Q/R399Q and E295A/Y338W mutations observed by NMR correlate with those observed on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent binding of C<sub>2</sub>AB* to cisSC-NDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6B,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9D</xref>), showing that binding to the SNARE complex on the nanodiscs is mediated in part by the primary interface. However, the R322E/K325E and K324E/K326E mutations also decreased the differences in the affinities of C<sub>2</sub>AB* for NDs and cisSC-NDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s3">Figure 9—figure supplement 3</xref>), indicating that there are additional binding modes where the C<sub>2</sub>B polybasic region interacts with the SNAREs. These other binding modes are unlikely to be biologically relevant, as the K324E/K326E mutation does not impair neurotransmitter release substantially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brewer et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The functional importance of binding of Syt1 to the SNARE complex through the primary interface is overwhelmingly supported by physiological data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). Hence, it is most likely that binding of C<sub>2</sub>AB* to the SNARE complex in cisSC-NDs through the polybasic region arises from limitations of our in vitro experiments and that Syt1 is bound to the SNARE complex through the primary interface before Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Although this interaction is rather weak, it is likely to be dramatically stabilized by co-localization at the site of fusion and may be favored over other binding modes by other factors. For instance, our experiments used 1% PIP<sub>2</sub>, which corresponds to the average PIP<sub>2</sub> content of the plasma membrane, but clusters containing 6% PIP<sub>2</sub> have been detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">James et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van den Bogaart et al., 2011</xref>). High PIP<sub>2</sub> concentration should favor simultaneous binding of the C<sub>2</sub>B domain polybasic region to this lipid and of the primary interface to the SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A,C</xref>). Such a state has been observed by cryo-EM on lipid nanotubes, albeit at limited resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grushin et al., 2019</xref>). The structure revealed a slanted orientation of the SNARE complex that should hinder full zippering at the C-terminus and was disrupted by Ca<sup>2+</sup>. It is unclear whether the orientation was dictated by helical packing on the nanotubes and whether Ca<sup>2+</sup> disrupted such packing, but these results are consistent with the notion that Ca<sup>2+</sup> releases the interaction between Syt1 and membrane-anchored SNARE complexes. Even if the SNARE complex is less slanted in the primed state, a more parallel orientation of the SNARE complex with respect to the membrane (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>) would still hinder C-terminal zippering, which could explain the increase in spontaneous release observed in Syt1 KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xu et al., 2009</xref>). The proposed state is also consistent with the observation that complexin-1 does not alter the affinity of C<sub>2</sub>AB* for cisSC-NDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>), as complexin-1 and Syt1 bind to opposite sides of the SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). In this state, the helix formed by complexin-1 would point toward the vesicle membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A,C</xref>), also hindering SNARE complex zippering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Trimbuch et al., 2014</xref>). This model provides a basis for the findings that complexin-1 is required for the dominant negative effect of Syt1 bearing mutations in the C<sub>2</sub>B domain Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>) and that Syt1 is necessary for the inhibition of spontaneous release by complexin in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jorquera et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Our finding that the R398Q/R399Q mutation strongly disrupts binding of the C<sub>2</sub>B domain to the SNARE complex through the primary interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>) suggests that such disruption underlies the dramatic impairment of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked neurotransmitter release caused by this mutation, as well as the abrogation of clamping of spontaneous release by Syt1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xue et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). The E295A/Y338W mutation in the primary interface also disrupted neurotransmitter release but still allowed clamping of spontaneous release, which resembles the phenotype observed for the R322E/K325E mutation in the polybasic region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). These findings are readily explained by our model and our biochemical data, as the E295A/Y338W enhances (rather than weakens) Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent binding of Syt1 to the SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9D</xref>) and hence hinders release of the inhibitory Syt1-SNARE interaction. Similarly, the R322E/K325E mutation impairs Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and PIP<sub>2</sub>-dependent membrane binding, which is critical to release this inhibitory interaction.</p><p>Altogether, the available data support the notion that, before Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, the trans-SNARE complex, complexin-1 and Syt1 form a macromolecular assembly between the vesicle and plasma membranes that inhibits release but is ready to trigger fast membrane fusion upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx because it brings Syt1 close to the SNAREs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref> left panel). In this model, Ca<sup>2+</sup> triggers tight, specific binding of the C<sub>2</sub>B domain to PIP<sub>2</sub> and other lipids in the plasma membrane while binding of C<sub>2</sub>B to the SNARE complex is released. The mechanisms underlying the last events leading to membrane fusion are still unclear, but we speculate that the Syt1 C<sub>2</sub> domains bridge the vesicle and plasma membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Araç et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>, middle panel). This action could cooperate with the SNAREs in bringing the membranes together, and insertion of the C<sub>2</sub> domain Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops into the membrane can induce membrane curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martens et al., 2007</xref>) to facilitate membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>, right panel). Note that R398,R399 are critical for the membrane-membrane bridging activity of Syt1 and therefore the strong disruption of neurotransmitter release caused by mutating these arginines might arise from impairment of this activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Araç et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xue et al., 2008</xref>) in addition to abrogating SNARE binding.</p><p>Clearly, the proposed model needs further testing and multiple aspects need to be unraveled to understand the mechanism of neurotransmitter release. Thus, syntaxin-1 is known to form clusters on the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khuong et al., 2013</xref>), and formation of Syt1 oligomers has been proposed to underlie the primed state and to exert an inhibitory activity that is released by Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Such clusters and oligomers could not be present in our nanodisc experiments. However, the Syt1 oligomers are compatible with the state proposed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tagliatti et al., 2020</xref>) and hence can be readily incorporated into the model of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>. Note also that, while our NMR studies could not detect binding of the Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>B domain to CpxSC through the tripartite interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), it is premature to completely rule out the relevance of the tripartite structure given the potential functional importance of very weak interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Magdziarek et al., 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, it is also premature to accept this structure as physiologically relevant, and further evidence for such relevance needs to be obtained, ideally using mutations that exclusively replace residues in the interface rather than interior residues that are important for protein stability. The model of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> provides a strong foundation to address these issues and incorporate additional proteins that may play key roles in the last steps of neurotransmitter release.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pGEX-KG-GST-Syt1_C2B</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brewer et al., 2015</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Protein expression plasmid for <italic>E. coli</italic> (rat synaptotagmin-1 C<sub>2</sub>AB domain, residues 271–421)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pGEX-KG-GST-Syt1_C2AB</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Araç et al., 2006</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Protein expression plasmid for <italic>E. coli</italic> (rat synaptotagmin-1 C<sub>2</sub>AB domain, residues 140–421)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pMSP1E3D1</td><td valign="top">Addgene</td><td valign="top">20066</td><td valign="top">Protein expression plasmid for <italic>E. coli</italic> (MSP1E3D1)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">DEUTERIUM OXIDE (D, 99.8%)</td><td valign="top">Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc</td><td valign="top">DLM-4–99.8</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">AMMONIUM CHLORIDE (<sup>15</sup>N, 99%)</td><td valign="top">Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc</td><td valign="top">NLM-467</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">D-GLUCOSE (1,2,3,4,5,6,6-D<sub>7</sub>,97–98%)</td><td valign="top">Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc</td><td valign="top">DLM-2062</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">L-Methionine-(methyl-<sup>13</sup>C)</td><td valign="top">Sigma-aldrich</td><td valign="top">299146</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">2-Ketobutyric acid-4–<sup>13</sup>C,3,3-d<sub>2</sub> sodium salt hydrate</td><td valign="top">Sigma-aldrich</td><td valign="top">589276</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">PC</td><td valign="top">Avanti polar lipid</td><td valign="top">850457</td><td valign="top">1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">PS</td><td valign="top">Avanti polar lipid</td><td valign="top">840035</td><td valign="top">1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine (sodium salt)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">PIP2</td><td valign="top">Avanti polar lipid</td><td valign="top">840046</td><td valign="top">L-α-phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (Brain, Porcine) (ammonium salt)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">RhoPE</td><td valign="top">Avanti polar lipid</td><td valign="top">810158</td><td valign="top">1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl) (ammonium salt)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Tetramethylrhodamine-5-Maleimide</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">T-6027</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Alexa Fluor488 C5 Maleimide</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td valign="top">A10254</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">β-OG (octyl-beta-glucoside)</td><td valign="top">Gold biotechnology</td><td valign="top">O-110–50</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Detergent Removal Resin</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td valign="top">87780</td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>Constructs to express the following proteins or protein fragments were described previously: rat synaptobrevin-2 SNARE motif (residues 29–93), rat synaptobrevin-2 (residues 49–93), human SNAP-25A fragments encoding its SNARE motifs (residues 11–82 and 141–203), full-length rat synaptobrevin, full-length rat syntaxin-1A, rat syntaxin-1A (residues 191–253), rat syntaxin-1A (residues 2–253), human SNAP-25A (residues 11–82 and 141–203), rat synaptotagmin-1 C<sub>2</sub>B domain with a C277A mutation (residues 271–421;

These mixtures were dried under a stream of nitrogen and stored overnight in a vacuum desiccator. The lipids were solubilized in a 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4 125 mM KCl 1% β-OG (octyl-beta-glucoside) buffer by vortexing for 5 min. To form nanodiscs, MSP1E3D1 was incubated with solubilized lipids at a ratio of 1:110 in the presence of 1% β-OG (final concentration) at 4°C for 30 min. The mixture was passed over a 4 cm-high Thermo Scientific Pierce Detergent Removal Resin (87780) column (approximately 3 mL of the slurry; the final volume of the mixture was always between 3–4 mL).

The detergent was removed using Thermo Scientific Pierce Detergent Removal Resin, as described for the isolated nanodiscs, and size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 column (GE 16/60). Fractions from size exclusion chromatography were assessed by SDS-PAGE and fractions that contained approximately one cisSNARE-complex, activated t-SNARE-complex or full-length synaptobrevin-2 per 2 MSP1E3D1 molecules were pooled together, mixed with protease inhibitor cocktail A and concentrated. TransSNARE-complex was formed by incubating nanodiscs containing activated t-SNARE complex with 2-fold excess of synaptobrevin nanodiscs overnight at 4°C. This method leads to quantitative formation of trans-SNARE complexes between nanodiscs based on the complete release of the synaptobrevin-2 (49–93) peptide, which was assessed by labeling the peptide with <sup>15</sup>N and acquiring <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectra, or labeling the peptide with Cy5 at residue 79 and monitoring the fluorescence anisotropy of the dye. For experiments comparing binding of C<sub>2</sub>AB* to cisSC-NDs and transSC-NDs, the cisSC-NDs were formed by incubating nanodiscs containing activated t-SNARE complex with 2-fold excess of synaptobrevin-2 (29–93) overnight at 4°C.</p><p>To estimate the concentration of the resulting ND, cisSC-ND or transSC-ND samples, a stock solution of solubilized lipids containing 5% RhoPE was prepared as previously described in the Materials and methods section. Dilutions of this stock solution were made and the absorbance at 570 nm was measured to make a standard curve. Samples were solubilized in 1% b-OG and their absorbance at 570 nm was measured. This measurement and the standard curve were used to estimate the total lipids in nanodisc samples.

Other components such as 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EGTA, 2.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM ATP or a combination of these reagents were added after the concentration step.

Dilutions of the ND stock solutions were used if less than 5 µL of the original stock had to be pipetted to minimize errors caused by pipetting small volumes. The volume was made up to 200 µL by adding buffer. The tube was vortexed for 2-3 s and 180 µL of the solution was pipetted into an SOG cuvette (Fischer Scientific: NC9040289). Emission scan of the sample was immediately collected on a PTI Quantamaster 400 spectrofluorometer (T-format) at room temperature. All slits were set to 1.2 mm. The samples were excited at 480 nm and emission spectra from 500 to 620 nm were acquired. After the scan was collected, the sample was discarded, and the cuvette was washed with water followed by ethanol and dried using a stream of air. Multiple cuvettes were used during the experiment. This did not change the emission scans. Collecting the spectra after 5 min incubation at room temperature also did not change the emission scan. FRET efficiency was calculated using the formula: FRET = (I<sub>0</sub> –I)/ I<sub>0</sub>, where I<sub>0</sub> is the fluorescence intensity of 50 nM Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>AB* at 518 nm and I is the fluorescence intensity of the sample at 518 nm.

Your article has been reviewed by Olga Boudker as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Angel Perez Lara (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers and I have discussed the reviews with one another and I as Reviewing Editor have drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is 'in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>'. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>All three reviewers and I agree that your paper is a very good <italic>eLife</italic> candidate. Our consensus is that your work represents a strong addition to our understanding of the synaptic vesicle fusion process by describing important aspects of the functional interplay between SNAREs, membranes, synaptotagmin, and complexin.</p><p>At the same time, the reviewers commented on a series of issues that we think need to be dealt with before your work can be published in <italic>eLife</italic>. The corresponding comments concern a set of more conceptual, interpretational, and methodological aspects, which can mostly be dealt with by careful revision of the manuscript text (A below), and include suggestions for a set of additional experiments and data analyses that we think are needed to support some of the key conclusions (B below).</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>A) Conceptual, Interpretational, and Methodological Aspects:</p><p>i) While Zhou et al., (2017) used Cpx1-1-83 (crystallography) and Cpx1-48-73 (ITC), the present study employed Cpx1-26-83. This issue needs to be discussed as it may be problematic to compare characteristics of complexes formed with these different Cpx1 constructs. In essence it is possible that the type of Cpx1 fragment contributes to the relative stability and dynamics of the tripartite versus primary interface. Unless comparative experiments with exactly the same constructs are done, it is difficult to resolve discrepancies between the present and previous studies.</p><p>ii) Related to the point above (i), the 'assault' on the tripartite complex published by Zhou et al., (2017) appears overdone in some places and not always fully supported by the data. Zhou et al., (2017) really only observed the impact of the tripartite perturbations (LLQQ mainly) when they mutated away the primary interface using the quintuple C<sub>2</sub>B and quintuple SNAP25. In the present study the equivalent experiment was not done, and different protein fragments were used, so it is not clear if similar observations would have been made with NMR if exactly the same conditions/fragments would have been used. This issue should be taken into account when discussing the study by Zhou et al., (2017).</p><p>iii) The present study claims that LLQQ destabilizes Syt1, which then explains the published impact of this variant on synaptic transmission. This should be documented in the evidence as it is a crucial and impactful finding.</p><p>iv) Solution-state NMR is closer to physiologically significant conditions than crystallography. However, there are still major unresolved discrepancies between the present data and the ITC data of Zhou et al., (2017), where the experimental conditions are more comparable. In view of this and some other aspects, the 'physiological accuracy' of the experimental conditions in the present study appears oversold.</p><p>v) The discussion of the nanodisc-based data should consider the fact that clusters of SNAREs or Syt1 cannot form under these conditions even though these clusters do/may exist under physiological conditions and thus impose specific constraints on the prefusion complex and its relative stability. In essence, there is a possibility that physiologically important complexes are missed in the nanodisc scenario.</p><p>vi) In the study by Zhou et al., (2015), the destruction of the primary interface eliminated Syt1 function for both Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion and inhibition of spontaneous release (clamping function), while the REKE and EAYW both strongly impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion without disrupting clamping. These perturbations occur on opposite sides of the β sandwich pointing in opposite directions and yet they cause very similar phenotypes at the synapse. Do both perturbations stabilize the primary interface at the expense of some other competitive interaction required for breaking the clamp upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding? Or is there another interface not utilized during clamping but important for fusion that both these regions could contribute to? None of the three model interfaces (polybasic, primary, tripartite) simultaneously incorporate the RK and EY residue pairs at a shared interface. The authors of the present study should elaborate on the effects of REKE and EAYW in this context, perhaps by clarifying their own thinking on the issue.</p><p>B) Additional Data Analyses and Experiments:</p><p>i) The interpretation of NMR results is based on crystal structures. ITC experiments indicate a SNARE:C<sub>2</sub>B ratio of 2:1 – thus some of the results could be explained by cooperativity effects instead of competition between different binding sites. This should be analysed/discussed.</p><p>ii) In order to properly compare the Syt1 RQRQ, REKE, KEKE, and REKERQRQ variants, cooperativity factors need to be determined in order to assess the contribution of SNARE binding vs. membrane binding. Corresponding analyses of the WT, REKE, and RQRQ variants would suffice.</p><p>iii) To distinguish effects of variants on SNARE vs. membrane binding, additional experiments in the absence of anionic phospholipids are important. For instance, SNAP-25 could be used to monitor Syt11 C<sub>2</sub>AB binding (RQRQ, REKE, KEKE and REKERQRQ) to SNAREs using nanodisc with or without PS and PIP<sub>2</sub>, and with and without calcium. This would provide insight into the relative contribution of SNARE binding vs. membrane binding. Corresponding analyses of the WT, REKE, and RQRQ variants would suffice.</p><p>iv) Cooperativity factors (K<sub>D</sub> cisSC-ND/K<sub>D</sub> ND, K<sub>D</sub> cisSC-ND/K<sub>D</sub> cisSC-ND, K<sub>D</sub> ND/K<sub>D</sub> ND ratios) in the presence and absence of ATP/magnesium need to be determined, compared, and discussed.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested, as described below.]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>I continue to be enthusiastic about this manuscript, which I think is substantially above the bar for publishing in eLife. For reference, I am including below my original, positive review (slightly edited).</p><p>This manuscript represents a strong addition to our understanding of the functional interplay between SNAREs, membranes, synaptotagmin and, to a somewhat lesser extent perhaps, complexin. The authors have performed extensive NMR and fluorescence-based binding experiments with wild-type and informative mutant proteins, both in soluble form and (for the SNAREs) embedded in nanodiscs of various compositions. Although at first I found the sheer length of the manuscript daunting, I became convinced as I read it that the length is justified by the wealth of data and the need to carefully integrate the results with the extensive existing literature. I think the authors have succeeded to an impressive degree, and that this manuscript will be seen as a landmark contribution to our ever-improving understanding of this remarkably complex system.</p><p>There are many, many interesting results, but I would point single out three as deserving of special mention:</p><p>1. The striking differences, in vivo and in vitro, between two different double mutants (R322E/K325E versus K324E/K326E) in the same portion of synaptotagmin's polybasic region. The former has a much stronger effect that the latter on both PIP2-dependent membrane binding (this work) and neurotransmitter release (Brewer 2015). This can be beautifully reconciled by a detailed consideration of how the calcium-binding loops and the polybasic region cooperate in membrane binding of Ca2+-bound synaptotagmin (see Fig. 10B) and thereby promote fusion.</p><p>2. The remarkable finding that the E295A/Y338W mutation in the primary interface, previously claimed to abrogate synaptotagmin-SNARE binding (Zhou 2015), actually strengthens it. Given that this mutation compromises neurotransmitter release, the results highlight that overly avid binding can be as deleterious as compromised binding in vivo. I'm not sure why the Brunger lab reached the opposite conclusion about the impact of this double mutation on in vitro binding (Zhou 2015), but I found the results presented here to be convincing.</p><p>3. The strong implication that the tripartite SNARE:synaptotagmin:complexin interface, which was the main point of the Brunger lab's Nature paper and supported by ITC analysis of wild-type and mutant proteins (Zhou 2017), is a nonetheless a crystallization artifact, possibly induced by the artificial tether used in that work to link synaptotagmin to the SNARE bundle. Further work is underway, in collaboration with the Brunger lab, to resolve the contradiction, but my hunch is that the tripartite interface may not actually be physiologically important.</p><p>This manuscript represents an enormous amount of careful work, complemented by a highly intelligent and generally quite balanced synthesis of previous data from the author's and other labs. As such, I believe that it will be viewed as essential reading for anyone interested in the question of how, at a molecular mechanistic level, synaptic vesicles fuse in response to calcium.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><p>The authors have addressed my main concerns.

This issue needs to be discussed as it may be problematic to compare characteristics of complexes formed with these different Cpx1 constructs. In essence it is possible that the type of Cpx1 fragment contributes to the relative stability and dynamics of the tripartite versus primary interface. Unless comparative experiments with exactly the same constructs are done, it is difficult to resolve discrepancies between the present and previous studies.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a valid point, but it is important to note that the difference between Cpx1-26-83 used in our study and Cpx1-1-83 used for crystallography is at the Cpx1 N-terminus, which is very far from the tripartite interface and hence is not expected to affect binding. Note also that Cpx1-48-73 used for ITC is truncated near the putative binding interface and hence binding results obtained with longer fragments such as Cpx1-26-83, which do not lack residues near the interface, are expected to be more reliable. In fact, Cpx126-83 binds with substantially higher affinity to the SNARE complex than Cpxl1-48-73 (Xu et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2017).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii) Related to the point above (i), the 'assault' on the tripartite complex published by Zhou et al., (2017) appears overdone in some places and not always fully supported by the data. Zhou et al., (2017) really only observed the impact of the tripartite perturbations (LLQQ mainly) when they mutated away the primary interface using the quintuple C<sub>2</sub>B and quintuple SNAP25. In the present study the equivalent experiment was not done and different protein fragments were used, so it is not clear if similar observations would have been made with NMR if exactly the same conditions/fragments would have been used. This issue should be taken into account when discussing the study by Zhou et al., (2017).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that we should tone down the ‘assault’ on the tripartite complex, even though we believe that the data shown in the paper already provide very strong evidence that the tripartite interface is not substantially populated at the concentrations used in the NMR experiments. Thus, we have shortened the paragraph describing the conflict between our NMR data and the ITC data, and have softened the tone. The paragraph now reads (subsection “Mutation of R322,K325 at the polybasic region and R398,R399 at the primary interface abolishes C<sub>2</sub>B SNARE complex binding in solution”):</p><p>“These results contrast with ITC data suggesting the existence of a Syt1-complexin-1SNARE complex interaction involving the tripartite interface in experiments performed with Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>B bearing seven mutations designed to disrupt binding via the polybasic region and the primary interface (KA-Q mutant), and a complexin-1-SNARE complex bearing five mutations to further disrupt such binding (Zhou et al., 2017). We are collaborating with the laboratory of Axel Brunger to determine the reasons underlying these conflicting results, and the results of these efforts will be published elsewhere.”</p><p>We have also shorted and softened the summary paragraph where in the original manuscript we were strongly suggesting that the tripartite complex arises from crystal contacts, which now reads (subsection “Mutation of R322,K325 at the polybasic region and R398,R399 at the primary interface abolishes C<sub>2</sub>B SNARE complex binding in solution”):</p><p>“In summary, our data show that binding of the Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>B domain to the Cpx1(26-83)SNARE complex in solution involves the polybasic region and the primary interface, while binding via the tripartite interface is undetectable under the conditions of our NMR experiments even when CpxSC is added at 85 μM concentration and binding through the polybasic region and the tripartite interface is abolished. These results indicate that the tripartite interface observed in the complexin-1-Syt1-SNARE complex crystals might have arisen from crystal packing, but further research will be required to clarify this issue.”</p><p>We also note that, in the last paragraph of the Discussion section of the original manuscript, we left open the possibility that the tripartite complex might be physiologically relevant, although reminded the reader that ‘the instability caused by the L387Q/L394Q mutation might underlie the phenotypes caused by this mutation, rather than disruption of the tertiary interface’. We have removed this reminder and the relevant part of this paragraph now reads:</p><p>“Note also that, while our NMR studies could not detect binding of the Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>B domain to CpxSC through the tripartite interface (Figure 2E, Figure 3), it is premature to completely rule out the relevance of the tripartite structure given the potential functional importance of very weak interactions (Magdziarek et al., 2020). Nevertheless, it is also premature to accept this structure as physiologically relevant, and further evidence for such relevance needs to be obtained, ideally using mutations that exclusively replace residues in the interface rather than interior residues that are important for protein stability.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iii) The present study claims that LLQQ destabilizes Syt1, which then explains the published impact of this variant on synaptic transmission. This should be documented in the evidence as it is a crucial and impactful finding.</p></disp-quote><p>We made this claim based on the NMR data shown in Figure 4 of the original manuscript, on the observation that this mutant has much higher tendency to precipitate with CpxSC and, most of all, on the thermal denaturation data described by Zhou et al., 2017 (Extended data Figure 3). To make the latter point more clear, we now describe the Zhou et al., 2017 data in a little more detail in the sentence (subsection “Mutation of R322,K325 at the polybasic region and R398,R399 at the primary interface abolishes C<sub>2</sub>B SNARE complex binding in solution”):</p><p>“These results show that the L387Q/L394Q causes a considerable destabilization of the Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>B domain, which is consistent with the finding that this mutation decreases the thermal denaturation temperature of the C<sub>2</sub>B domain by about 10 <sup>o</sup>C (Zhou et al., 2017).”</p><p>In the spirit of tempering the ‘assault’ on the tripartite complex (point ii above), in the revised manuscript we have moved the NMR data of the old Figure 4 to a supplementary figure (Figure 3—figure supplement 1), and we have moved the sentence suggesting that the phenotypes caused by the L387Q/L394Q mutation arise from protein destabilization from the summary paragraph (subsection “Mutation of R322,K325 at the polybasic region and R398,R399 at the primary interface abolishes C<sub>2</sub>B SNARE complex binding in solution”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iv) Solution-state NMR is closer to physiologically significant conditions than crystallography. However, there are still major unresolved discrepancies between the present data and the ITC data of Zhou et al. (2017), where the experimental conditions are more comparable. In view of this and some other aspects, the 'physiological accuracy' of the experimental conditions in the present study appears oversold.</p></disp-quote><p>We are not sure which parts of the original manuscript led to this concern, as we had pointed out explicitly the limitations of our own data in multiple places of the manuscript (e.g. lack of membranes in our NMR experiments and the potential contributions of non-specific interactions to the results obtained with nanodiscs). In any case, we imagine that the paragraphs that we have modified to address concerns ii-iii above contributed to concern iv. We hope that we have properly addressed this concern with the modifications introduced in those paragraphs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>v) The discussion of the nanodisc-based data should consider the fact that clusters of SNAREs or Syt1 cannot form under these conditions even though these clusters do/may exist under physiological conditions and thus impose specific constraints on the prefusion complex and its relative stability. In essence, there is a possibility that physiologically important complexes are missed in the nanodisc scenario.</p></disp-quote><p>We had mentioned the oligomers at the end of the Discussion section of the original manuscript and we now include the possibility of cluster formation in the same paragraph of the revised manuscript:</p><p>“Thus, syntaxin-1 is known to form clusters on the plasma membrane (Khuong et al., 2013), and formation of Syt1 oligomers has been proposed to underlie the primed state and to exert an inhibitory activity that is released by Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Wang et al., 2017). Such clusters and oligomers could not be present in our nanodisc experiments. However, it is worth noting that the Syt1 oligomers are compatible with the state proposed in Figure 10A (Tagliatti et al., 2020) and hence can be readily incorporated into the model of Figure 10C.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>vi) In the study by Zhou et al., (2015), the destruction of the primary interface eliminated Syt1 function for both Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion and inhibition of spontaneous release (clamping function), while the REKE and EAYW both strongly impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion without disrupting clamping. These perturbations occur on opposite sides of the β sandwich pointing in opposite directions and yet they cause very similar phenotypes at the synapse. Do both perturbations stabilize the primary interface at the expense of some other competitive interaction required for breaking the clamp upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding? Or is there another interface not utilized during clamping but important for fusion that both these regions could contribute to? None of the three model interfaces (polybasic, primary, tripartite) simultaneously incorporate the RK and EY residue pairs at a shared interface. The authors of the present study should elaborate on the effects of REKE and EAYW in this context, perhaps by clarifying their own thinking on the issue.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very good point. Our data suggest that the EAYW and REKE mutations give similar phenotypes because they both hinder release of the Syt1-SNARE complex interactions, the former by strengthening the interaction, the latter by hindering the specific Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and PIP<sub>2</sub>-dependent interaction of the C<sub>2</sub>B domain with the membrane that releases Syt1-SNARE complex binding. Release of this binding is likely to be necessary not only for evoked release but also for spontaneous release. Basically, we believe that the two mutations represent ‘two sides of the same coin’ much as the mutated residues are on two sides of the β-sandwich. In the revised manuscript we have added the following paragraph (Discussion section):</p><p>“The E295A/Y338W mutation in the primary interface also disrupted neurotransmitter release but still allowed clamping of spontaneous release, which resembles the phenotype observed for the R322E/K325E mutation in the polybasic region (Zhou et al., 2015). […] Similarly, the R322E/K325E mutation impairs Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and PIP<sub>2</sub>dependent membrane binding, which is critical to release this inhibitory interaction.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) Additional Data Analyses and Experiments:</p><p>i) The interpretation of NMR results is based on crystal structures. ITC experiments indicate a SNARE:C<sub>2</sub>B ratio of 2:1 – thus some of the results could be explained by cooperativity effects instead of competition between different binding sites. This should be analysed/discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We are not aware of any published ITC data that definitively demonstrate a 2:1 stoichiometry for binding of the SNARE complex to the C<sub>2</sub>B domain, even if the data might suggest this stoichiometry. In any case, our NMR results are compatible with such stoichiometry, but argue against cooperativity. The NMR results are interpreted based in part on the three structures available (one elucidated by NMR spectroscopy and two by X-ray crystallography), but also on the observation of the behaviors of the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC cross-peaks observed in the titrations. As discussed in the paper (subsection “Mutation of R322,K325 at the polybasic region and R398,R399 at the primary interface abolishes C2B SNARE complex binding in solution” and subsection “The E295A/Y338W mutation in the primary interface enhances C2B-CpxSC binding in solution”), comparison of the titrations performed with the WT C<sub>2</sub>B domain and the R322E/K325E and E295A/Y338W mutants show clear evidence of competition between binding of CpxSc to the polybasic and primary interfaces of the WT C<sub>2</sub>B domain at low CpxSC concentrations. However, the curved behavior of some cross-peaks at high CpxSc concentrations suggest that simultaneous binding to both interfaces might occur with slight alterations of the binding modes due to steric hindrance between the two bound CpxSCs. We have tried to explain better this conclusion rephrasing a few sentences (subsection “The E295A/Y338W mutation in the primary interface enhances C<sub>2</sub>B-CpxSC binding in solution”):</p><p>“This finding suggests that there is an interplay between binding of CpxSC to the primary interface and to the polybasic region. CpxSC appears to bind exclusively to one or the other site at low concentrations, likely because of steric hindrance disfavors simultaneous binding of two CpxSC complexes to one C<sub>2</sub>B domain. However, simultaneous binding to both sites might be allowed at higher CpxSC concentrations by slight alterations in both binding modes, leading to the curved cross-peak movement.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii) In order to properly compare the Syt1 RQRQ, REKE, KEKE, and REKERQRQ variants, cooperativity factors need to be determined in order to assess the contribution of SNARE binding vs. membrane binding. Corresponding analyses of the WT, REKE, and RQRQ variants would suffice.</p></disp-quote><p>Supplementary file 2 now describes cooperativity factors obtained by dividing the K<sub>D</sub>s observed with NDs by the K<sub>D</sub>s observed with cisSC-NDs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iii) To distinguish effects of variants on SNARE vs. membrane binding, additional experiments in the absence of anionic phospholipids are important. For instance, SNAP-25 could be used to monitor Syt11 C<sub>2</sub>AB binding (RQRQ, REKE, KEKE and REKERQRQ) to SNAREs using nanodisc with or without PS and PIP2, and with and without calcium. This would provide insight into the relative contribution of SNARE binding vs. membrane binding. Corresponding analyses of the WT, REKE, and RQRQ variants would suffice.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed new titrations of C<sub>2</sub>AB* with cisSC-NDs that contained only PC or 84% PC, 15% PS and 1% PIP<sub>2</sub>, and that were labeled with an acceptor TMR probe on residue 76 of SNAP-25. This design is expected to yield high FRET efficiency for binding of C<sub>2</sub>AB* to the SNARE complex via the primary or polybasic interfaces. We included WT, REKE and RQRQ C<sub>2</sub>AB* in these experiments, as suggested by the reviewers, and also the EAYW C<sub>2</sub>AB* mutant that enhances SNARE binding. We compared the results with parallel titrations performed with soluble SNARE complex formed with the cytoplasmic region of syntaxin-1 (for comparison with the cisSC-ND data) or with only the syntaxin-1 SNARE motif (for comparison with the NMR data and to assess the potential contribution of the syntaxin-1 N-terminal region to binding). The results are presented in the new Figure 8 and Figure 8—figure supplement 1.</p><p>The results generally confirmed the conclusions obtained with our previous FRET experiments and, importantly, yielded a striking result: while most of the experiments revealed high FRET efficiency at high SNARE complex concentrations, the maximum FRET efficiency was about 0.4 for titrations of WT C<sub>2</sub>AB* with cisSC-PC/PS/PIP<sub>2</sub>-NDs, even though the affinity was higher than under all other conditions. This result and the effects of the mutations on the affinity and maximum FRET efficiency (Figure 8H) strongly support the conclusion that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent binding of C<sub>2</sub>AB* to PIP<sub>2</sub>-containing membranes competes with the Syt1-SNARE complex interaction, as explained in more detailed in the new section describing these data (subsection “The E295A/Y338W mutation in the primary interface enhances Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent binding of C2AB* to cisSNARE complex-nanodiscs”). Models of how the Syt1 C<sub>2</sub>B domain can interact with the SNARE complex and the nanodiscs are now shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 2 to help rationalizing these data and, more generally, the results of the FRET assays shown in Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8, Figure 9. In addition, in Supplementary file 2 we describe cooperativity factors calculated by dividing the K<sub>D</sub>s measured with soluble SNARE complexes by the K<sub>D</sub>s measured with cisSC-NDs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iv) Cooperativity factors (K<sub>D</sub> cisSC-ND/K<sub>D</sub> ND, K<sub>D</sub> cisSC-ND/K<sub>D</sub> cisSC-ND, K<sub>D</sub> ND/K<sub>D</sub> ND ratios) in the presence and absence of ATP/magnesium need to be determined, compared, and discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>In Supplementary file 2 we now describe cooperativity factors calculated by dividing K<sub>D</sub>s measured in the presence of Mg-ATP by K<sub>D</sub>s measured in the absence of Mg-ATP. However, to avoid lengthening of the manuscript, we limit the discussion of cooperativity factors to places where these factors are particularly informative (e.g. subsection “Mutations in the polybasic region and R398,R399 disrupt Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent binding of C<sub>2</sub>AB* to nanodisc-anchored SNARE complex”, subsection “Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and PIP<sub>2</sub>-dependent binding of the C<sub>2</sub>B domain to membranes hinders SNARE complex binding” and subsection “Effects of phospholipids on C<sub>2</sub>AB* binding to the SNARE complex”).</p><p><italic>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested, as described below.]</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>I continue to be enthusiastic about this manuscript, which I think is substantially above the bar for publishing in eLife. For reference, I am including below my original, positive review (slightly edited).</p><p>This manuscript represents a strong addition to our understanding of the functional interplay between SNAREs, membranes, synaptotagmin and, to a somewhat lesser extent perhaps, complexin. The authors have performed extensive NMR and fluorescence-based binding experiments with wild-type and informative mutant proteins, both in soluble form and (for the SNAREs) embedded in nanodiscs of various compositions. Although at first I found the sheer length of the manuscript daunting, I became convinced as I read it that the length is justified by the wealth of data and the need to carefully integrate the results with the extensive existing literature. I think the authors have succeeded to an impressive degree, and that this manuscript will be seen as a landmark contribution to our ever-improving understanding of this remarkably complex system.</p><p>There are many, many interesting results, but I would point single out three as deserving of special mention:</p><p>1. The striking differences, in vivo and in vitro, between two different double mutants (R322E/K325E versus K324E/K326E) in the same portion of synaptotagmin's polybasic region. The former has a much stronger effect that the latter on both PIP2-dependent membrane binding (this work) and neurotransmitter release (Brewer 2015). This can be beautifully reconciled by a detailed consideration of how the calcium-binding loops and the polybasic region cooperate in membrane binding of Ca2+-bound synaptotagmin (see Fig. 10B) and thereby promote fusion.</p><p>2. The remarkable finding that the E295A/Y338W mutation in the primary interface, previously claimed to abrogate synaptotagmin-SNARE binding (Zhou 2015), actually strengthens it. Given that this mutation compromises neurotransmitter release, the results highlight that overly avid binding can be as deleterious as compromised binding in vivo. I'm not sure why the Brunger lab reached the opposite conclusion about the impact of this double mutation on in vitro binding (Zhou 2015), but I found the results presented here to be convincing.</p><p>3. The strong implication that the tripartite SNARE:synaptotagmin:complexin interface, which was the main point of the Brunger lab's Nature paper and supported by ITC analysis of wild-type and mutant proteins (Zhou 2017), is a nonetheless a crystallization artifact, possibly induced by the artificial tether used in that work to link synaptotagmin to the SNARE bundle. Further work is underway, in collaboration with the Brunger lab, to resolve the contradiction, but my hunch is that the tripartite interface may not actually be physiologically important.</p><p>This manuscript represents an enormous amount of careful work, complemented by a highly intelligent and generally quite balanced synthesis of previous data from the author's and other labs. As such, I believe that it will be viewed as essential reading for anyone interested in the question of how, at a molecular mechanistic level, synaptic vesicles fuse in response to calcium.</p></disp-quote><p>We are very thankful for the kind comments and for the nice distillation of the most important among our results. We could not agree more.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors have addressed my main concerns.

ITC is a powerful technique to quantify the affinity of binding interactions when strong heats and nicely sigmoidal curves are observed, but is much less informative when heats are smaller and the curves are not clearly sigmoidal. Moreover, analysis of this kind of data is further complicated when there is more than one binding mode. Hence, while it is true that the black curve in Fig. 3b of Zhou et al. could be explained by a 2:1 stoichiometry of binding (N = 0.5), this conclusion is far from definitive. For instance, the data could also arise if an endothermic binding mode dominates at the beginning of the titration and the endothermic signal is progressively cancelled by the signal from a weaker exothermic interaction at higher C2B concentrations. There may also be factors that contribute to weak ITC signals and are difficult to account for. For instance, the data of Fig. 3d mentioned by the reviewer is also compatible with N = 0.5, but these data were acquired with the mutant proteins where presumably binding through the polybasic and primary interfaces was abolished; thus, it is highly unclear how a 2:1 complex could be formed.</p><p>With respect to the NMR data mentioned by the reviewer, the scenario is certainly possible, but the proposed 2:1 complex does not appear to be the dominant species, as the cross-peak shifts observed for the residues of the polybasic region occur more slowly than for the WT C2B domain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Despite of the above comments, I am aware of the effort carried out by the authors and in my opinion they addressed my main concerns and I suggest and support the publication of the manuscript in eLife.</p></disp-quote><p>We very much appreciate the kind comments and the multiple constructive comments from the reviewer, which have helped us to substantially improve the quality of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The authors have dealt with my major scientific concerns (comparisons of identical CPX constructs with Brunger lab results) and clarified their conclusions/interpretations of the EAYW vs REKE mutations.
