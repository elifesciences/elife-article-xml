visual environment in the tectum. A zebrafish larva typically detects a prey object in its peripheral visual field. As it turns and swims towards the prey, the stimulus enters the central, binocular area, and seemingly expands in size. By volumetric calcium imaging, we show that posterior tectal neurons, which serve to detect prey at a distance, tend to respond to small objects and intrinsically compute their direction of movement. Neurons in anterior tectum, where the prey image is represented shortly before the capture strike, are tuned to larger object sizes and are frequently not direction-selective, indicating that mainly interocular comparisons serve to compute an object’s movement at close range. The tectal feature map originates from a linear combination of diverse, functionally specialized, lamina-specific, and topographically ordered retinal ganglion cell synaptic inputs. We conclude that local cell-type composition and connectivity across the tectum are adapted to the processing of location-dependent, behaviorally relevant object features.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The retina is the thin layer of tissue in the eye that can receive light stimuli and convert them into electric signals to be transmitted to the brain. The cells that sense fine detail cluster at the center of the retina while the motion-sensing cells that keep track of movement lie at the periphery.</p><p>When zebrafish larvae hunt, their motion-sensing cells are triggered as a prey crosses their peripheral field of view. They then turn and swim towards it. As they approach, the prey image moves to the detail-sensing part of the retina and appears larger, filling more of the field of view at close range. The signals are then processed in defined parts of the brain, in particular in a region called the optic tectum. How this area is organized in response to the organization of the eye and the requirements of the hunt is still unclear.</p><p>Förster et al. set out to explore how the hunting routine of zebrafish larvae shapes the arrangement of neurons in the optic tectum. The larvae were exposed to different images representing the various aspects of the prey capture process: small moving dots represented passing prey at a distance, while large moving dots stood for prey just before capture. Measuring activity in the neurons of the optic tectum revealed that, like the eye, different areas specialize in different tasks. The back of the tectum was frequently activated by small dots and worked out which direction they were moving in during the first hunting steps. The front of the tectum responded best to large dots, often ignoring their direction, and helped the larvae to track their prey straight ahead. To test these findings, Förster et al. destroyed the large object-responsive cells with a laser and watched the larvae hunting real prey. Without the cells, the fish found it much harder to track and catch their targets.</p><p>These results shed light on the link between behavior and how neurons are arranged in the brain. Future work could explore how the different neurons in the optic tectum are connected, and the behaviors they trigger in the fish. This could help to reveal general principles about how sensory information guides behavior and how evolution has shaped the layout of the brain.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ethology</kwd><kwd>visual system</kwd><kwd>tectum</kwd><kwd>retinal ganglion cell</kwd><kwd>retinotectal map</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max Planck Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Förster</surname><given-names>Dominique</given-names></name><name><surname>Helmbrecht</surname><given-names>Thomas O</given-names></name><name><surname>Mearns</surname><given-names>Duncan S</given-names></name><name><surname>Jordan</surname><given-names>Linda</given-names></name><name><surname>Mokayes</surname><given-names>Nouwar</given-names></name><name><surname>Baier</surname><given-names>Herwig</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The retinotectal map in zebrafish exhibits location-specific, functional specializations to match prey object movement in the visual field during the hunting sequence.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Theories of efficient sensory coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barlow, 1961</xref>) often make the implicit assumption that the goal of sensory processing is a veridical representation of the external world. However, it is clear that the ultimate arbiter of efficiency is natural selection and that genetic information, developmental time, space, and material impose constraints on the design of the nervous system. Each of these evolutionary constraints has contributed to the neural implementations as we witness them in today’s animal brains, making the ultimate goal of calculating an optimization function difficult to achieve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chalk et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Machens et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Simoncelli, 2003</xref>). To understand why circuits are organized as they are and develop as they do, it is of paramount importance to identify constant and pervasive selective pressures that arise from the species-specific lifestyle of the animal. This study provides experimental support for the notion that the local statistics of the sensory environment, which changes dynamically as the animal interacts with the outside world, shape the topographic specializations of higher-order sensory and sensorimotor circuitry.</p><p>For many decades the retinotectal projection of zebrafish has served as a paradigmatic example for a visual map. Retinal inputs to the tectum are ordered retinotopically such that the position of an object in the visual field matches a corresponding focus of activity in tectal space (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Muto et al., 2013</xref>). Neighborhood relationships in the environment, as they are projected onto the two-dimensional sheet of photoreceptors in the retina, are represented by neural activity in neighboring regions of the tectum. Visual stimuli in the front of the larva are detected by temporal regions of the retina, which transmit pre-processed information via the axons of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) to anterior regions of the tectum. Similarly, stimuli in the peripheral visual field behind the animal activate nasal retina and posterior tectum, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The tectum then ultimately transforms visual information into behavioral commands (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Helmbrecht et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental paradigm for studying location-specific processing in the tectum.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In a typical hunting sequence, the fish detects prey in its peripheral visual field (1), ultimately turns and approaches to bring the prey image into its central binocular field (2). Hypothetically, the retinotectal map might be adapted to this location- and size-specific representation of the prey object.

The remaining layers are innervated by axons from the somatosensory lateral line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thompson et al., 2016</xref>) or contain dendrites and axons of interneurons and projection neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Helmbrecht et al., 2018</xref>). The tectal neuropil layers are schematically depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. Recent work has revealed an enormous functional and morphological diversity of RGC types, which serve as local feature detectors for specific aspects of the visual scene, such as direction of motion, onset or offset of light, object size or chromaticity. Earlier studies have shown that individual RGCs select one layer each, in which they arborize and make synapses onto tectal dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xiao and Baier, 2007</xref>). Thus, each retinorecipient layer contains a complete, yet feature-selective, map of visual space. RGCs that respond to visual features resembling the speed and size of prey project to the most superficial layer (SO; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Semmelhack et al., 2014</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), whereas RGCs that are specifically tuned to a rapidly expanding (looming) dark object, simulating an approaching predator or an obstacle on a collision course, terminate in deeper layers (SFGS5/6; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Temizer et al., 2015</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>Asymmetries in visual feature processing have been recognized across the retina of several vertebrates (for a recent review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baden et al., 2020</xref>). Prime examples for such functional specializations are the fovea of primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sinha et al., 2017</xref>), the asymmetric distributions of RGC types and photoreceptors in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baden et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bleckert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Szatko et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Warwick et al., 2018</xref>) and of bipolar cells, photoreceptors and RGCs in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yoshimatsu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zimmermann et al., 2018</xref>). The two retinotopic dimensions of the tectum, the anterior-posterior and the dorsal-ventral axis, have so far received little attention in this regard. Zebrafish larvae do not possess a <italic>prima facie</italic> fovea, although they have evolved a high-acuity subarea in the temporal-ventral quadrant of the retina in which RGCs are more densely packed than in the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schmitt and Dowling, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). This region holds the image of prey in the final phase of hunting behavior and, similar to the mammalian fovea, occupies a disproportionately large area of the visual map in the tectum. Despite a wealth of data on tectal neuron morphologies (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Förster et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nevin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Robles et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Scott and Baier, 2009</xref>), systematic changes in cell-type composition or connectivity along the anterior-posterior or dorsal-ventral axes of the tectum, resulting in gradients or other asymmetries of feature selectivity, have just begun to be revealed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Here, we ask if such asymmetries can be predicted from first principles and related to the behavioral ecology of the zebrafish larva. As the animal interacts with a visual object through its own movements, relevant stimulus features continually change within the retinotopic coordinate frame. For example, in a typical hunting cycle, a zebrafish larva detects a prey item at a distance in its peripheral, monocular visual field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mearns et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Patterson et al., 2013</xref>). Posterior tectal circuits might therefore have evolved to respond to small-sized objects of ca. 5° and to locally compute their direction of movement. As the fish turns toward and approaches the prey, the stimulus enters the central, binocular visual field and expands to ca. 30° in visual angle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Activation of the anterior tectum has previously been described during this late hunting phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Muto et al., 2013</xref>). Neurons in the anterior tectum should therefore be tuned to larger object sizes and may rely on interocular comparisons to compute the object’s displacement from the midline. At all positions, the tectum should be able to distinguish between prey and looming threats and process them separately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barker and Baier, 2015</xref>). The laminar segregation of functional channels, which are established by RGC inputs, is therefore expected to be maintained by tectal circuits independent of retinotopic location.</p><p>Using volumetric two-photon calcium imaging to map out the feature space along the anterior-posterior retinotopic axis and across the layers of the tectum, we discovered a neural substrate for each of above predictions. Moreover, we show that the broad range of tectal responses originate to a large extent, but not exclusively, from a linear combination of functionally diverse RGC inputs. The dendrites of tectal cells are positioned in layers that predict their stimulus selectivity. We conclude that the cellular architecture underlying local processing in the tectum is adapted to the expected features of a prey object as it moves across the visual field during a hunting pursuit.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Tectal neurons respond to a broad range of visual features</title><p>To broadly sample responses to object features, we designed a battery of simplified visual stimuli and controls. We employed two-photon calcium imaging of 5 to 7 dpf old larvae, which received monocular visual stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). At this larval stage, panneuronal expression of the nuclear-localized calcium indicator GCaMP6s (driven by the <italic>elavl3</italic> promoter) labels on average 5793 ± 202 cells per tectum (n = 10 fish; mean ± SEM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The stimulus set consisted of a moving dot of 5° (‘small’), which approximates the size of prey at the onset of hunting behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bianco and Engert, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Patterson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Semmelhack et al., 2014</xref>), a moving dot of 30° (&quot;large&quot;), which is the approximate size of prey directly before the capture strike, and an expanding disc at different velocities, which simulates an approaching object and is able to evoke escape responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bhattacharyya et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dunn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Temizer et al., 2015</xref>). We further added controls for global luminance changes (dark and bright ramps and flashes), as well moving gratings with high spatial (5°) and temporal frequency as a negative control for small-dot responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; see Materials and methods). With this battery of visual stimuli, we obtained reproducible calcium responses in up to 30% of all tectal cells per imaging plane. We created 15 regressors for the different stimulus variants and calculated a score value for each tectal cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To classify functional response types, we performed hierarchical clustering of representative response vectors obtained by affinity propagation (see Materials and methods). This resulted in a dendrogram for 76 exemplars, which are representative of the 1759 sampled tectal cells in total (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

To show that the measured tectal cell responses were significantly different from chance, we shuffled the scores for each regressor 1000 times and calculated the PCs. Taking the average of the explained variance per shuffling, we consistently found a lower average explained variance, that is 57.6% for the three main PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>), indicating that tectal cells do not respond randomly to our set of stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Responses of tectal neurons are enriched for various forms of object motion</title><p>Overall, we found a broad spectrum of different response types in the tectum. Few cells responded to only one of the presented stimuli; most cells we imaged were multi-responsive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). 43.6% of all cells responded to a looming stimulus (with a score &gt;0.2), 41.1% responded to a small dot, and 33.1% responded to a large dot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Only a small number of cells responded to a bright ramp (2.7%) or a bright flash (2.2%), and these cells were rarely sensitive to other stimuli. Responses to dark ramp and dark flash often coincided with each other and with responses to looming stimuli (fast and slow), but rarely overlapped with responses to small or large moving dots. Responses to a slow-looming stimulus showed a gradual overlap with moving-dot responses; more than half of all cells that were sensitive to a large dot also responded to a slow-looming stimulus. The 5° grating did not trigger significant responses in the tectum, suggesting a selectivity to individual objects rather than to high spatial frequency.</p><p>Next, we characterized the tuning properties of tectal cells whose somata reside inside the tectal neuropil. Superficial interneurons (SINs), with cell bodies in the SO to SFGS1 neuropil layers, have previously been reported to receive size-tuned retinal inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Del Bene et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Preuss et al., 2014</xref>). The largest fraction of SINs was mapped to our large-dot responsive cluster (~45%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>), whereas only a small number of SINs (~6%) were sensitive to a 5° dot. Neuropil interneurons (NINs), residing within deeper layers of the neuropil, predominantly belong to the looming/dark ramp-responsive cluster (~30%), with about 20% of NINs responding to large dots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, the majority of tectal cells, both in the periventricular layer and embedded in the neuropil, respond to object motion, that is small, or large, or looming dots, sometimes in combination.

Likewise, ablation of small-dot responsive cells, either in the anterior or posterior tectum did not result in significant behavioral changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B–D</xref>). This suggests that for cells, which tile the visual field by only 5°, the ablated cell numbers were not sufficient to observe an effect on behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Both tectal hemispheres cooperate in guiding capture of prey in the frontal visual field</title><p>Intriguingly, we observed in our imaging experiments, that a substantial number of cells in the left tectum were responsive to prey-like stimuli presented to the left (ipsilateral) eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These cells are probably activated by the right (contralateral) tectum via an intertectal commissure. We hypothesized that these cells help to sharpen responses across both tecta by suppressing background activity in the tectum that is not directly stimulated by RGC inputs. To test this hypothesis, we laser-ablated large-dot responsive cells in the anterior tectum on both sides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B–D</xref>). (Note that these cells were identified by imaging responses in both tecta to stimulation of only the left eye.) In bilaterally ablated animals, the tendency to increase right J-turns and reduce left J-turns in response to prey was even more pronounced than in right-tectum-only ablated larvae, supporting our hypothesis.</p><p>Background suppression of the tectal activity ipsilateral to the stimulated eye might enhance activity in the contralateral, visually stimulated tectum. To investigate this possibility, we imaged the tectum of fish in which the right eye was removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1E</xref>). In these animals, we observed a significant increase in the number of large-dot responsive cells in the right, visually stimulated tectum, that is ipsilateral to the enucleated side. This result suggests that stimulus-evoked activity is normally dampened by background activity in the contralateral tectum by intertectal inhibitory connections. This background activity is suppressed, either physiologically by strong unilateral, stimulus-evoked activation of the other tectum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C and D</xref>), or experimentally by removal of its own retinal inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Taken together, our ablation results begin to reveal the logic of intertectal coordination of responses to prey in the frontal visual field.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we have discovered how the topographic layout of retinotectal circuitry is adapted to demands of the zebrafish larva’s behavioral ecology. We postulate that natural selection has favored the evolution of position-dependent specializations in the neural architecture underlying the processing of object motion as it is caused by both the prey’s and the fish’s movements. The tectum is critically involved in identification, localization, pursuit, and capture of prey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gahtan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Semmelhack et al., 2014</xref>). In the following, we will go through circuit adaptations to each of these functions.</p><p>Identifying prey, and distinguishing it from a potential predator, is critical for the larva’s survival. In previous studies, we discovered that this distinction is made by size and movement characteristics of the perceived object (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barker and Baier, 2015</xref>). Small, sideways-moving dots are readily approached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Semmelhack et al., 2014</xref>), whereas expanding (looming) dots, displayed to the side of the fish while it is immobilized, are categorized as threatening and avoided by vigorous escape attempts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bhattacharyya et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Temizer et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we show that the RGC axon populations that respond to these two categories terminate in different layers of the tectum. Retinal inputs carrying prey-like signals mainly enter the tectum in layers SO and SFGS1-4, and looming-sensitive RGC axons are largely restricted to SFGS5/6 and SGC. In addition, broadly-tuned OFF signals are transmitted to the deep retinorecipient layers SGC and SAC/SPV. These include sudden and gradual transitions from light to dark.</p><p>The tectal cells that respond to these stimulus categories exhibit morphologies that match their predicted input channels, as previously shown for direction-selective RGC inputs and tectal cell dendritic arborizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gabriel et al., 2012</xref>). Prey-selective neurons extend dendrite branches into the superficial layers of the tectum, while looming-sensitive neurons tend to arborize in middle to deep layers. As a general principle, most of the feature selectivities of tectal neurons are inherited from their functionally diverse RGC inputs. A simple excitation-only, feed-forward model showed that more than a third of the tectal response classes match a single RGC input class. The vast majority of the remaining responses were explained by a linear combination of two, or sometimes more, RGC inputs. In one experimentally accessible case, we could directly show that RGCs pass their small-dot responsive tuning on to downstream tectal cells. A similar modeling approach was recently performed to study functional connectivity between RGCs and the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) in the mouse thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Román Rosón et al., 2019</xref>). Analogous to our findings, the authors described a high correlation between functional dLGN in- and output, and thus a low level of signal convergence.</p><p>The zebrafish tectum, however, is not merely a passive relay station for retinal inputs. First, we found that responses to large objects are markedly reduced in the tectum compared to RGCs. Second, direction selectivity to backward-moving objects is calculated de novo in the tectum. This was especially striking for the 5° dot stimulus. A circuit involving feed-forward inhibition by SINs, which suppresses tectal responses to non-preferred directions, could account for this computation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbas et al., 2017</xref>). Third, a substantial number of tectal cells selectively respond to a dark ramp stimulus; such cells were not observed in our RGC dataset. Thus, tectum-intrinsic circuitry adds direction selectivity to a subset of channels and generally refines and sharpens the responses.</p><p>The anatomical separation of small-dot responsive and looming-sensitive circuits probably reflects functional segregation of the two processing streams. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barker and Baier, 2015</xref> postulated a circuit motif that implements balanced, reciprocal inhibition of the two systems driving approach vs. avoidance. Such a circuit could generate a winner-take-all mechanism capable of coordinating behavioral responses to stimuli of opposite valence. The visual system needs to rapidly distinguish between prey and threat across the entire visual field. A specialization of tectal layers for the processing of key features orthogonal to the two retinotopic axes, as reported here, seems to be an adaptive solution for that challenge. Moreover, bundling in space the visual processing of object valence, global patterns and luminance levels by laminar separation may also serve to minimize wiring lengths of the corresponding neural elements in the tectal neuropil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baier, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chklovskii et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>By sampling feature-selective responses along the anterior-posterior axis of the tectum, we uncovered functional specializations of tectal regions, which probably reflect systematic changes in cell-type composition and connectivity. Object translation across the visual field is caused by a combination of both the prey’s movement and the fish’s own swimming, the latter often in response to position of the prey. Larval zebrafish are able to detect a prey item at a distance of several millimeters. A typical prey object, such as a paramecium or a rotifer, of 250 µm length, which is 3 mm away, subtends a visual angle of approximately 5°. Previously, we and others had detected responses of head-fixed larvae, embedded in agarose, to virtual, high-contrast objects of 2–6° diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bianco et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Semmelhack et al., 2014</xref>). Moving dots of 1° rarely elicited a response. This seems to be the resolution limit of the larval fish’s visual system and is in agreement with the physical limit posed by photoreceptor spacing in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Haug et al., 2010</xref>). As the fish turns toward and approaches the prey, the prey ‘image’ slides from nasal to temporal zones of the retina and from posterior to anterior regions of the tectum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). At the same time, the visual angle covered by the prey gradually increases. This might explain a shared sensitivity to slow-looming stimuli, which is featured by more than half of all large dot-responsive cells. Interestingly, this overlap is negligible for fast looming stimuli, what might indicate a separation of approach and avoidance circuits. The fish executes a capture strike when the prey is in the upper central field of both eyes at a distance range of 0.3–0.7 mm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mearns et al., 2020</xref>). This corresponds to 20–40° of visual angle. Two tasks of successful hunting, the detection of distant prey in the peripheral visual field and the fixation of prey at close range in front of the animal shortly before the capture strike, informed our choice of 5° (‘small’) and 30° (‘large’) virtual objects for our imaging experiments. We discovered two asymmetries in the retinotectal map that appear to support these two different phases of hunting behavior.</p><p>First, an overrepresentation of small-dot responsive, direction-selective cells in the posterior tectum appears to be an adaptation to the preponderance of small prey objects in the peripheral field of view, whose movement is, at least initially, independent of the fish’s own. These tectal cells acquire their direction selectivity by de novo computations from size-tuned, non-DS RGC inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Determining the direction of prey by a local mechanism is particularly important for the lateral field of view, which is entirely monocular. The further away from the midline the prey’s location is the greater the turning angle that is needed to steer the fish toward its food. Fish will preferentially orient towards prey in their lateral visual field, because it gives them more time to move their body into the right position for a successful strike. Moreover, turning is energetically costly and may alert nearby predators and prey alike. For a prey object that already moves from back to front and whose image therefore slides from the nasal to the temporal retina, the turn angle will be smaller: the food may swim right in front of the fish, from where it might even be sucked into the mouth without extensive pursuit. Zebrafish larvae have been observed to use such a sit-and-wait mode of hunting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Patterson et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Second, the anterior tectum is enriched for large-dot responsive tectal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>), which appear to facilitate the initiation of prey capture-associated J-turns, as shown here by laser ablation. J-turns are fine adjustments of body posture characteristic of hunting. These cells are frequently not direction-selective and communicate via commissural connections with the contralateral tectum. Initial imaging and behavioral experiments following ablations suggest that activation of large-dot selective cells suppresses responses in the contralateral tectum. We propose that such an intertectal inhibitory mechanism helps to correct slight displacements of the prey from the midline (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gebhardt et al., 2019</xref>). This signal may be transformed into fine orienting tail movements by one of the tectorecipient premotor areas in the hindbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Helmbrecht et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, this work has revealed a neural architecture of the tectum that is well adapted to the demands of the animal’s behavioral ecology. More generally, we demonstrate that the well-studied retinotectal map is spatially organized by function along both its retinotopic and laminar axes. The visual map in the tectum is thus not a veridical, unbiased representation of all positions in visible space, but rather warped by location-dependent feature statistics. Future work will undoubtedly uncover additional adaptations and will shed light on both the proximate, developmental mechanisms and the ultimate, evolutionary forces that are shaping this important visuomotor hub in the vertebrate brain.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

ROIs smaller than 400 voxels were removed and the number of ROIs was analyzed in 3D.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Functional imaging and visual stimulation</title><p>In vivo calcium imaging was performed on a previously described two-photon microscope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Förster et al., 2017</xref>) on 5–7 dpf transgenic zebrafish larvae expressing either cytoplasmic GCaMP6s in RGCs or nuclear-localized GCaMP6s panneuronally. Larvae were mounted in 2% low-melting-point agarose. The stimulus was projected onto a white diffusive screen using the red channel of a LED projector, in a distance of 4 cm from the larva. The projection was presented monocularly and covered ~120° of the larva’s field of view. GCaMP6 signals were recorded by scanning at 920 nm, at ~2 Hz, at a resolution of ~0.6 µm/pixel. The tectum was covered in depth by acquiring z-planes with a distance of ~7 µm.</p><p>Visual stimulation was designed using PsychoPy2 and consisted of a dark ramp (red to black, 3 s), a bright ramp (black to red, 3 s), a dark flash (red to black), and a bright flash (black to red). This was followed by a small horizontally moving dot (5°, 90°/s) in forward (temporal to nasal) and backward (nasal to temporal) directions (two repetitions each), and at two elevations of the screen, first at equatorial plane and then elevated by ~20° (two repetitions each). We chose dark dots on a bright (red) background. Published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antinucci et al., 2019</xref>) and our own unpublished results have shown that these stimuli are efficient at eliciting hunting-like behavior in a dark 2P microscope environment, in the absence of UV stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yoshimatsu et al., 2020</xref>). Subsequently, a big dot was moving horizontally (30°, 90°/s) in forward and backward directions (repeated twice), at an elevation of ~10°, thus covering the two horizontal planes of the small dot. The frequency control consisted of black gratings with a spatial frequency of 5° and a temporal frequency of 90°/s, moving in forward and backward directions (repeated twice). The looming stimuli consisted of a fast (~60°/s, linear expansion) and a slow-looming disc (~20°/s, linear expansion), both ending with a black screen (two repetitions each). This stimulus protocol was repeated twice with a total acquisition length of 515 s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Analysis of imaging data</title><p>Recorded imaging data were pre-processed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Helmbrecht et al., 2018</xref>). In brief, images were motion-corrected using the CaImAn package, uniformly filtered over three frames and the dF/F was calculated using the 5<sup>th</sup> percentile of the traces. In total 15 regressors for all stimulus components were created and convolved with a corresponding GCaMP6 kernel. Neuronal activity was analyzed pixel-wise for RGC and ROI-wise for tectal imaging data, by calculating a score of all regressors to the calcium responses of each pixel using a linear regression model of the selected response window with the regressor (Python scikit-learn). For the score, the coefficient of the regression (CR; corresponding to the dF/F) was multiplied by the correlation value R<sup>2</sup>. All pixels and ROIs were imaged twice using the same stimulus and the final score was calculated via a weighted average of the scores by the corresponding R<sup>2</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Clustering of functional responses</title><p>To determine overall response types, the scores were normalized per fish to the 99<sup>th</sup> percentile of all pixels/ROIs recorded.</p><p>For the functional clustering of the responsive tectal ROIs, three fish (7594 ROIs) expressing <italic>elavl3:nls-GCaMP6s</italic> were analyzed by first removing ROIs with maximum scores smaller than 0.2 (1908 ROIs remaining). Next, to reduce noise and to find local structure in the dataset, affinity propagation clustering (scikit learn – preference: median of similarities) was performed (151 clusters). Keeping clusters with at least 5 ROIs, yielded in total 80 clusters with chosen exemplars. To extract the global cluster structure, these 80 exemplars were further clustered using hierarchical clustering (scipy.cluster) using correlation as distance metric. Clusters with less than 20 ROIs were removed. We calculated a silhouette coefficient to validate the clustering. A distance threshold of 0.25 was chosen, which yielded a minimal number of clusters (14) with the highest silhouette coefficient. This finally resulted in 14 tectal cell clusters with a total of 76 exemplars and 1759 ROIs (92.2%). Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the score values of each stimulus for all tectal cells.</p><p>Similarly to the clustering of tectal neurons, the responsive RGC pixels of one fish (14 planes; each 297 × 303 pixel) expressing <italic>ath5:Gal4 UAS:GCaMP6s</italic> were analyzed by again removing pixels with maximum scores smaller than 0.4 (remaining 58,910 pixel) and performing affinity propagation clustering (scikit learn – preference: median of similarities).

These 1243 exemplars were further ordered by hierarchical clustering (scipy.cluster) using correlation as distance metric. Cluster with less than 589 pixels (1% of all pixels) were removed. After silhouette analysis, a distance threshold of 0.45 was chosen, which yielded ten clusters with a total of 1157 exemplars and 55,153 pixels (93.6%). Although four RGC clusters yielded a higher silhouette coefficient, we chose ten clusters, which resulted in a significantly higher correlation value (R<sup>2</sup><sub>score</sub>) for the following linear modeling analysis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>To quantify the number of pixels per RGC cluster in tectal compartments and layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>), we used ImageJ to manually draw ROIs and to count pixels for each compartment/lamina in each image plane.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Mapping of functional responses from independent experiments onto our clustered datasets</title><p>To map response types of SINs, NINs and enucleated fish, functional imaging was performed as described.

Swim bouts were identified using a change point algorithm on the derivative of the tail angle with respect to time. Eye tracking was performed similarly using background subtraction, thresholding and contour detection. For each animal independently, we calculated the distribution of eye convergence angles over the experiment and used the local minimum in the resulting bimodal distribution as the prey capture threshold. Since eye convergence is a reliable indicator of prey capture in zebrafish larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bianco et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Patterson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mearns et al., 2020</xref>), we defined hunting events as any time the eye convergence angle was above this threshold. Initial orienting J-turns were defined as any bout where the eyes were unconverged before and converged after the bout. The bout integral was calculated by summing the tail tip angle values over the duration of the bout, with positive values indicating a rightward turn and negative values indicating a leftward turn. The direction of the turn was defined by the sign of the bout integral (positive for right, negative for left). The direction selectivity index was computed as [(# right J-turns - # left J-turns) / (total # J-turns)] for each fish, with a value of 1 indicating all J-turns were to the right, −1 indicating all J-turns were to the left, and 0 indicating no overall bias in J-turn direction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical tests were two-tailed t-tests, if not stated otherwise.

tectal cells to prey-like visual stimuli by combining 2P imaging, photoactivatable GFP, and ablation and behavioral experiments, and elegantly demonstrate that the feature selectivity and connections of neurons in the optic tectum may be adapted to the detection of prey swimming across the visual field. Specifically, they show that the topographic organization of retinotectal circuitry is well matched to the behavioral ecology of the fish, establishing a possible link between specific functional/anatomical circuits and processing of the visual features of potential prey.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Retinotectal circuitry of larval zebrafish is adapted to detection and pursuit of prey&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Koichi Kawakami as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Andrew King as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jiulin Du (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments (if the authors think necessary) and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors analyzed responses of tectal cells to prey-like visual stimuli by combining 2P imaging, photoactivatable GFP and ablation and behavioral experiments, and discovered that posterior neurons respond to small objects and compute their direction of movement dependently on monocular vision, and anterior neurons are tuned to larger objects (not direction-selective) dependently on binocular vision. Interestingly, the tectal cells with different functionalities have characteristic morphology and arborizations specific to retinal ganglion cell synaptic inputs. Thus, the authors demonstrated that links between specific functional/anatomical circuits and perception of a prey. Overall, the experiments are well-designed and the results presented are clear and interesting. The manuscript was clearly written and easily understandable.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) Citations are generally sparse and selective. For example, the first page of the Introduction (the first and second paragraphs ), which makes claims about efficient coding, natural vision, and corresponding neural organization, is unreferenced.</p><p>Of the first six references that appear on the next page, five are by the same lab as the present study. A lack of important citations is notable across the paper.</p><p>Introduction: &quot;the position of an object in the visual field matches a corresponding focus of activity in tectal space&quot; Especially this was clearly shown by calcium imaging by Muto et al., 2013. Also, in Muto et al., the correlation between activation of the anterior tectum and initiation of prey capture was described.</p><p>Wang et al., 2020, showed asymmetries in the encoding of different types of motion in the larval zebrafish tectum (not cited). This contrasts the author's assertion: &quot;systematic changes in cell type composition of connectivity along the anterior-posterior or dorsal-ventral axes of the tecum, resulting in gradients of other asymmetries of feature selectivity, have to our knowledge not been reported&quot;.</p><p>In addition, the asymmetry is perhaps not all that surprising since RGCs coming out of the eye are already asymmetric (Robles et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2020 bioRxiv). Clearly, the authors have gone beyond what was previously shown in the above papers, but it would be good to see a broader acknowledgement of previous work.</p><p>Moreover, some assertions might be seen as grandiose.

However, the natural prey of zebrafish larvae in the wild is not known, and it is plausible that larvae also prey on items that are darker than the background. Indeed, the RGCs believed to underpin prey capture have dendritic arbors in both ON and OFF layers of the IPL and respond to OFF, as well as ON, stimuli (Semmelhack et al., 2014; Zhou and Bear et al., 2020). Under 2P imaging conditions, dark spots are just as efficient as bright spots at eliciting hunting-like behavior (Bianco and Engert, 2015; Antinucci et al., 2019; unpublished observations from our lab). It should be noted that in a dark 2P microscope environment larvae may be less efficient at detecting a bright red dot since shorter wavelengths, which are believed to drive hunting behavior towards paramecia in the light, are either blocked by filters or not present within the spectrum of the projector. To clarify this stimulus decision, we added a comment to the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Stimulus sizes used (5 deg for small, 30 deg for large) seem quite large, and based on the assumption that zebrafish prey (paramecia) are 250 microns in length, which is very large for a paramecium, and it also implies that they are viewed from the side.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated in the Materials and methods section, we were using paramecia of the type <italic>Paramecium multimicronucleatum</italic> for our experiments. The size of this type ranges from 180-310 µm (Wichterman, R., 2012. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://books.google.com/books?id=JB_pBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=biology+of+paramecium#v=onepage"><italic>The Biology of Paramecium</italic></ext-link>. Springer Science and Business Media. ISBN 9781475703726). 250 µm also is the average size of rotifers, which are frequently used for rearing zebrafish larvae (Aoyama et al., 2015. <italic>A Novel Method for rearing zebrafish by using freshwater rotifers.</italic> Zebrafish. DOI: 10.1089/zeb.2014.1032).

However, initiation of prey capture behavior, i.e. approach swimming, is already triggered when a distant, small prey object appears in the peripheral visual field and does not rely on binocular cues (Mearns et al., 2020). Furthermore, zebrafish larvae have their eyes positioned quite laterally and have only a small binocular zone when embedded. Consequently, presenting visual stimuli from the side allowed us to map A-P positional differences for size-selectivity in the tectum, which would not have been as easy had we presented stimuli in front of the fish.</p></body></sub-article></article>
