unknown. Using single-cell RNA-seq, we identified prohemocytes, monocytic hemocytes, and granulocytes as the three major cell-types in the white shrimp hemolymph. Our results identified a novel macrophage-like subset called monocytic hemocytes 2 (MH2) defined by the expression of certain marker genes, including <italic>Nlrp3</italic> and <italic>Casp1</italic>. This subtype of shrimp hemocytes is phagocytic and expresses markers that indicate some conservation with mammalian macrophages. Combined, our work resolves the heterogenicity of hemocytes in a very economically important aquatic species and identifies a novel innate immune cell subset that is likely a critical player in the immune responses of shrimp to threatening infectious diseases affecting this industry.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>myeloid cell evolution</kwd><kwd>differentiation</kwd><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd>invertebrate</kwd><kwd>Penaeus vannamei</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd><kwd>Penaeus vannamei</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>41976123</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Fan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007162</institution-id><institution>Guangdong Science and Technology Department</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>14600703</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Fan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007421</institution-id><institution>Li Ka Shing Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2020LKSFG01E</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Yueling</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel innate immune cell subset in shrimp shows similarities with human macrophage.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Compared with vertebrates, invertebrates do not have B- and T-cell-based adaptive immunity, which makes them primarily reliant on innate immunity as defense against various pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Little et al., 2005</xref>). Although invertebrates have developed diverse forms of innate immunity in order to adapt to various environmental challenges, the innate immune cells themselves contribute significantly because they have âtrained immunityâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lanz-Mendoza and Contreras-GarduÃ±o, 2022</xref>). However, the evolution of innate immune systems has diverged into many branches in the metazoan tree of life, making invertebrate immune cell-typing extremely complex. In contrast, the cells of the vertebrate immune system are conserved from chordates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rosental et al., 2018</xref>). Recent advances in single-cell sequencing technology have shed light on this issue. For example, recent research in mosquito cellular immunity revealed that mosquito hemocytes are of four major types (prohemocytes, granulocytes, oenocytoids, and megacytes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kwon et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Raddi et al., 2020</xref>). Hemocytes from another invertebrate model â <italic>Drosophila melanogaster â</italic> can be divided into eight subgroups, including crystal cells, lamellocytes, unspecified plasmatocytes, proliferative plasmatocytes, PSC-like hemocytes, antimicrobial plasmatocytes, phagocytic plasmatocytes, and secretory plasmatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cattenoz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cho et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tattikota et al., 2020</xref>). These classifications cover the major innate immune cell functions, including proliferation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, phagocytosis, and effector secretion, suggesting some shared similarities in innate immunity between invertebrates and vertebrates.</p><p>To explore these analogies, we used the marine invertebrate <italic>Penaeus vannamei</italic> to characterize immune cell subsets using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). This species was selected because it is a popular mariculture species due to being fast growing and delectable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, this invertebrate has an open circulatory system filled with hemolymph, which consists of plasma and hemocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin and SÃ¶derhÃ¤ll, 2011</xref>). The shrimp hemolymph bears high similarity to that of the vertebrate peripheral blood in terms of functions such as transportation of nutrients and metabolic waste, maintenance of acidâbase equilibrium, defense against various invading pathogens, and hemostatic effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McNamara and Faria, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tassanakajon et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, the circulating plasma contains more than 400 proteins, many of which are vertebrate homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Luo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tao et al., 2019</xref>). The circulating hemocytes comprise proliferating cells, phagocytic cells, and effector secreting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin and SÃ¶derhÃ¤ll, 2011</xref>), which are functionally similar to vertebrate peripheral myeloid cells. Among these cells, the phagocytes have been identified in all metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Musser et al., 2021</xref>), although they appear to be different in invertebrates and vertebrates. Some recently performed functional assays suggest that the bacterial engulfment in phagocytes may be conserved from invertebrates to vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kokhanyuk et al., 2021</xref>). In this study, we attempted to analyze shrimp hemocytes via single-cell sequencing and redefined their classification according to their functional marker gene distribution. We also attempted to understand evolutionary phagocyte development along the metazoan tree of life.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Major cell-types among the circulating hemocytes in shrimp</title><p>Previously, we identified a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced shrimp plasma protein CREG and noticed that recombinant CREG (rCREG) was more effective than recombinant EGFP (rEGFP) in activating the shrimp hemocytes (Huang, Yang, &amp; Wang, 2021). Based on this observation, we performed scRNA-seq for rCREG-treated shrimp hemocytes to further explore their function. To maximize the collection of circulating hemocytes from shrimp, we applied iodixanol gradient centrifugation to concentrate the hemocytes for the Gel Bead-In-Emulsion (GEM) preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tattikota et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). A total of 34,693 cells including control (12544), rEGFP- (12640), and rCREG-treated (9509) cells were retained for further analyses, and these cells exhibited a median of 5656, 6837, and 7916 transcripts and 1089.5, 1245, and 1364 genes per cell, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The rCREG-treated samples had the highest unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) and detected genes compared with that of the other two groups. This observation is consistent with our previous conclusion that CREG is a hemocyte activation factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Huang et al., 2021</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Major cell types identified in shrimp hemolymph.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic workflow of sample preparation.

We then aggregated the cell clusters and identified five major groups of isolated hemocytes, including prohemocytes (PHs) (6838, 19.7%), granulocytes (GHs) (13871, 40%), monocytic hemocytes (MHs) (11112, 32%), transitional cells (TCs) (2090, 6%), and germ-like cells (GCs) (782, 2.3%), which were annotated according to their potential functions implied by the marker genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Granulocytes are characterized by their ProPO system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sun et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we found that prophenoloxidase activating factors 1 and 2 (<italic>PPAF1</italic> and <italic>PPAF2</italic>) were highly expressed in this population. In addition to ProPO system genes, secreted proteins, including crustin-like protein (<italic>CRUL</italic>), penaeidin 3 a.1 (<italic>PEN-3</italic>), and crustacean hematopoietic factor-like protein (<italic>CHF</italic>), were also highly expressed in this population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). The MHs were named thus because they shared some critical genes with mammalian monocytes. For example, NOD-like receptor protein 3 (<italic>Nlrp3</italic>) is a key component of the inflammasome and is highly expressed in monocytes and macrophages for processing of IL-1Ã (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">He et al., 2016</xref>). Lysosome (<italic>Lyz1</italic>), another canonical antibacterial enzyme, is a well-known macrophage-secreting hydrolase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Short et al., 1996</xref>). <italic>Vago5</italic> encodes an IFN-like antiviral cytokine and plays a role in the anti-white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) resistance (C. Li, Yang, Hong, Zhao, &amp; Wang, 2021) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref><italic>,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). Generally, these cells secrete antibacterial and antiviral effectors. In PHs, histone1 (<italic>h1f0</italic>) is the key component of heterochromatin assembly, and its high expression is associated with reduced gene expression and cell stemness properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pan and Fan, 2016</xref>). In a previous study, hemocyte transglutaminase (<italic>TGM1</italic>) was identified as an immature hemocyte marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Koiwai et al., 2021</xref>). The gene <italic>Igfbp7</italic> has been shown to promote hemocyte proliferation in the small abalone <italic>Haliotis diversicolor</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2C</xref>). TCs were difficult to characterize due to the lack of exclusively expressed genes. Hence, we identify the top five significantly upregulated genes and analyzed the distribution of the top three (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2D</xref>); we found that this group of cells had no significant marker genes, thus the name. We found some reproduction-related genes in the GC group. For example, <italic>lhx9</italic> encodes a key transcription factor in gonadal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balasubramanian et al., 2014</xref>), and <italic>spir</italic> localization is critical for mouse oocyte asymmetric division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2E</xref>). Hence, we annotated this group of cells as GCs.</p><p>To further determine whether CREG is a differentiation factor for shrimp hemocytes, we examined the ratio of the five annotated major cell types in different treatments. Recombinant protein injection slightly increased the proportion of GHs and PHs and decreased the ratio of MHs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). However, there were no significant differences between the rEGFP and rCREG treatments, which suggests that CREG is probably an activation factor rather than a differentiation factor for shrimp hemocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Subtyping of shrimp immune cell clusters and construction of their differentiation trajectory</title><p>While classifying the immune cells in shrimp hemolymph, the TC group that lacks gene markers and GC group that is not a typical immune cell are not further explored in this study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). To further trace the immune cell lineages in shrimp hemolymph, we subtyped the remaining three major classes of cellsâPHs, MHs, and GHs; each major class type was divided into two subtypes and labelled PH1 (1577, 4.5%) and PH2 (5261, 15.2%), MH1 (10463, 30.2%) and MH2 (649, 1.9%), and GH1 (10353, 29.8%) and GH2 (3518, 10.1%), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We identified some unique marker genes located at the edge of the t-SNE map for the subpopulations PH1, GH2, and MH2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>), but could not identify exclusive marker genes for the subpopulations PH2, GH1, and MH1, which constituted the main body of the t-SNE map. The marker genes for PH2, GH1, and MH1 were also highly expressed in PH1, GH2, and MH2, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>). Thus, these six subtypes of hemocytes might have lineage differentiation relationships. To explore this, we performed cell cycle analyses of the six subtypes of hemocytes. PH1 was characterized by high expression of all marker genes for the G1, G2, and M stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This observation was consistent with a previous report that approximately 2â5% of circulating hemocytes were proliferating hemocytes and could be labelled with BrdU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sun et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, we set PH1 as the initiating cell and applied a Monocle to construct differentiation trajectories for PHs, GHs, and MHs. Two major branchesâMH lineage and GH lineageâwere identified to have differentiated from one common PH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2DâE</xref>). This is similar to the development of human myeloid cells, in which granulocyteâmonocyte progenitor (GMP) differentiates into monocyte and granulocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bassler et al., 2019</xref>). To further compare innate immune cell differentiation between shrimp and humans, we screened shrimp homologs of human myeloid differentiation-related transcription factors (TFs) because TFs are the key regulators of cell fate determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Friedman, 2002</xref>). In total, 3790 differentially expressed genes among different branches were identified and are shown as a specific heatmap on which three shrimp homologs of human TFs were labeled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9">Supplementary file 9</xref>). <italic>Fli1</italic> is specifically expressed in the granulocyte lineage, which is consistent with previous observations that <italic>Fli1</italic> deletion decreases granulocytic cell number in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Starck et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>MAF</italic> and <italic>c-Rel</italic> were highly expressed in the MH lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). <italic>c-Rel</italic> is a key TF in the NF-ÎºB pathway and plays important roles in monocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2020</xref>). <italic>MAF</italic> is a bZip TF that could induce monocytic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kelly et al., 2000</xref>).

Their ability for fast response protects animals from various pathogenic invasions. However, invertebrates have experienced a long evolution in a diversified environment, which has led to the fact that invertebrate immunity is extremely complex and immune cell typing in various invertebrates seems quite different (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp10">Supplementary file 10</xref>). Fortunately, proteins seem to have evolved at a much slower rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jayaraman et al., 2022</xref>), and cell-specific functional proteins are therefore the key to define cell subsets. Thus, in this study, we compared shrimp immune cell marker genes with their human homologs to identify evolutionary traces of innate immune cells between invertebrates and vertebrates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp11">Supplementary file 11</xref>). Our data revealed macrophage-like phagocytes in shrimp hemolymph. This group of cells exhibited phagocytic activity. Additionally, <italic>Nlrp3</italic> and <italic>Casp1</italic>, two well-known mammalian macrophage inflammasome components were identified in these cells, suggesting that inflammasome-mediated anti-pathogenic processes might exist in invertebrate innate immunity and play a role in microbial restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). NAGA, another enzyme found in macrophages, could inhibit macrophage activation via deglycosylation of macrophage activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saburi et al., 2017</xref>). The existence of NAGA in shrimp phagocytes implies that this subset of cells might share similar negative regulatory mechanisms recently partially uncovered in vertebrate macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Luo et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, VEGF3, a well-known angiogenic factor, was also identified in this subtype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eswarappa and Fox, 2015</xref>). Shrimp have an open circulation system with partial blood vessels; whether this factor plays a role in wound healing needs to be answered by future studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">SÃ¶derhÃ¤ll, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Phagocytic ability is one of the fundamental functions in an organism. Unicellular organisms employ phagocytosis for this purpose. Cells in multicellular organisms have functional specializations that increase their adaptability. Thus, the phagocytic ability of metazoans is limited to certain cells. The ratio of phagocytic cells in the different species varies. For example, in the primitive oyster <italic>Crassostrea gigas,</italic> approximately 40â60% of hemocytes engulf pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sun et al., 2021</xref>). In fish, most immune cells, including monocytes, granulocytes, B cells, and red blood cells, possess phagocytic activity against invading pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Heimroth et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xu et al., 2021</xref>). In humans, most myeloid cells, including monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils, engulf pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bassler et al., 2019</xref>). Shrimps contain fewer phagocytes than do other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alenton et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Huang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2021</xref>). Our data suggest that at least a part of the phagocytes in the shrimp hemolymph originated from a macrophage-like subset. Moreover, vertebrate macrophages include large populations of cells that reside in different tissues with diversified roles. Whether invertebrate macrophages have similar tissue-specific functions is yet unknown and future studied are needed to elucidate the evolution of these helper cells in maintaining homeostasis.</p><p>Over the past decades, crustacean hemocytes have been classified into hyalinocytes, semi-granulocytes, and granulocytes based on their morphology and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">SÃ¶derhÃ¤ll, 2016</xref>). However, morphology-based classification has caused several problems. For example, crustacean hyalinocytes are generally regarded as small phagocytes with few granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin and SÃ¶derhÃ¤ll, 2011</xref>), but some researchers believe that these cells may be immature or prematurely released prohemocytes of the semi-granulocyte or granulocyte lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">van de Braak et al., 2002</xref>). In this study, our data clearly indicated that the small cells though similar in morphology include both prohemocytes and phagocytic hemocytes, and these two subtypes of cells have different marker genes and varied functional roles in the shrimp hemolymph. In addition, semi-granulocytes were considered a major component of circulating hemocytes that were involved in both melanization and phagocytosis. This conclusion cannot be accurate because less than 20% of circulating hemocytes are phagocytic cells, whereas approximately 65% of total hemocytes are considered to be semi-granulocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alenton et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin and SÃ¶derhÃ¤ll, 2011</xref>). Our results indicated that the cells sorted as semi-granulocytes contain both monocytic hemocytes and cells of granulocyte lineage.</p><p>In this study, we selected <italic>Penaeus vannamei</italic> as a crustacean model and proposed a novel crustacean hemocyte classification system. A new functional monocytic hemocyte lineage for circulating shrimp hemocytes was identified. The terminally differentiated cells of this lineage share several functional genes with mammalian macrophages, which suggests that this monocytic hemocyte lineage might be an invertebrate evolutionary homolog of the vertebrate monocyte lineage. Although crustaceans contain diverse species with different morphologies and evolutionary histories, our data, to some extent, provide a different interpretation for the current crustacean immune cell subtyping. This classification is far from complete but might provide insights about crustacean cellular immunity in the future. Moreover, this study is at an early stage of investigating cellular immunity in shrimp. For example, we could not systematically validate our conclusion at this moment due to the lack of specific monoclonal antibodies to label the three proposed major immune cell subtypes. Some fundamental questions remain unresolved, such as: can shrimp macrophage-like phagocytes infiltrate various tissues and where do the circulating shrimp prohemocytes originate? In future studies, we plan to find answers to such questions to improve our understanding of this important mariculture species and find solutions to serious shrimp diseases that have caused tremendous economic losses worldwide.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

Upon delivery, the shrimp were cultured in water tanks filled with aerated seawater at 20 Â°C and acclimatized for 2â3 days before the experiments. All animal-related experiments were conducted in accordance with Shantou University guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Collection of shrimp hemocytes with different treatments</title><p>Recombinant EGFP and CREG were purified, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Huang et al., 2021</xref>). Sixty shrimp were divided equally into three groups. One group was left untreated and labelled as control. The other two groups were injected with rEGFP or rCREG (1 Î¼g/g), respectively. The hemolymph was collected 8 hr post-injection from each group and mixed well. Hemolymph (1.5 mL) was loaded onto an OptiPrep (Axis-shield, NO) separation solution (1.09 g/mL) and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min at 4 Â°C. Circulating hemocytes were concentrated between the hemolymph and the separation solution and carefully collected with a pipettor. The collected hemocytes were stained with 0.4% trypan blue to estimate cell viability. Next, cells with &gt;85% viability were subjected to further scRNA-seq experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Library preparation and ScRNA sequencing</title><p>The hemocyte suspensions were loaded onto a 10 X Genomics GemCode Single-cell instrument to generate single-cell GEMs. Libraries were generated using Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3âReagent Kits v3.1 (10X Genomics, USA). Upon dissolution of the GEM, primers containing (i) an Illumina R1 sequence (read 1 sequencing primer), (ii) a 16 nt 10 X Barcode, (iii) a 10 nt UMI, and (iv) a poly-dT primer sequence were released and mixed with the cell lysate and Master Mix. Barcoded full-length cDNAs were then reverse-transcribed from poly adenylated mRNA and amplified using PCR to generate sufficient mass for library construction. R1 (read 1 primer sequence) was added during the GEM incubation. P5, P7, a sample index, and R2 (read 2 primer sequence) were added during library construction via end repair, A-Tailing, adaptor ligation, and PCR. Reads 1 and 2 were standard Illumina sequencing primers used for paired-end sequencing. All raw sequencing data were stored in the genome sequence archive of the Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, gsa.big.ac.cn (accession nos. PRJCA006297).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Bioinformatics analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data</title><p>Raw BCL files were converted into FASTQ files using 10 X Genomics Cell Ranger software (version 5.0). The reads were then mapped to the shrimp genome (taxid:6689), and the reads that uniquely intersected at least 50% of an exon were considered for UMI counting. Valid barcodes were identified using the EmptyDrops method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lun et al., 2019</xref>). The hemocytes by gene matrices for control, rEGFP treatment and rCREG treatment were individually imported to Seurat version 3.1.1 for the following analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Butler et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Cells with UMIs (â¥17,000), mitochondrial genes (â¥10%), â¤230 detected genes, or â¥2200 detected genes were excluded.

The integrated expression matrix was then scaled and subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensional reduction. Subsequently, the significant principal components (PCs) were identified as those with a strong enrichment of low-p-value genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung and Storey, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Seurat was used for cell clusters based on principal component analysis (PCA) scores with a subset of the data (1% by default), constructing a ânull distributionâ of gene scores. A graph-based approach that calculates the distance based on previously identified PCs was implemented for cell clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung and Storey, 2015</xref>). Finally, a resolution of 0.2 was chosen as the clustering parameter, which identified 8 clusters. The t-SNE was then performed to visualize the data in a two-dimensional space.</p><p>Differentially expressed gene (up-regulation) analysis: The median expression patterns across all cells in each cluster were calculated to identify genes that were enriched in a specific cluster. The expression value of each gene in the given clusters was compared against the rest of the cells using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Camp et al., 2017</xref>). The significantly upregulated genes were identified using several criteria. First, genes had to be at least 1.28-fold overexpressed in the target cluster. Second, genes had to be expressed in more than 25% of the cells belonging to the target cluster. Third, the p-value had to be less than 0.05.</p><p>Cell trajectory analysis: Single-cell trajectories were analyzed using a matrix of cells and gene expression by Monocle (Version2.10.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Trapnell et al., 2014</xref>). Monocle reduced the space to one with two dimensions and ordered the cells (sigma = 0.001, lambda = NULL, param.gamma=10, tol = 0.001) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Qiu et al., 2017</xref>). Once the cells were ordered, we visualized the trajectory in reduced dimensional space. The trajectory had a tree-like structure, including tips and branches. Monocle was used to identify genes that were differentially expressed between the groups of cells. The key genes were identified as having a false discovery rate (FDR)&lt;1e-5. Additionally, genes with similar trends in expression such as shared common biological functions and regulators were grouped. Finally, the Monocle developed BEAM to analyze branch-dependent gene expression by formulating the problem as a contrast between the two negative binomial GLMs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Phagocytic cell labeling and sorting</title><p>Shrimp phagocytic cells were labeled as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Huang et al., 2021</xref>). In brief, FITC labeled <italic>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</italic> (VP) (2Ã10<sup>6</sup> particles/g) were injected into the shrimp. The hemocytes were collected from 30 to 40 shrimp 2 hr post-injection. Each sorting was performed on a FACSMelody cell sorter (BD Biosciences, USA). The fluorescence boundary was set based on the detection of shrimp hemocyte self-fluorescence without VP injection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Morphological analysis of sorted hemocyte and phagocytosis inhibition assay</title><p>Phagocytic hemocytes (R1) were collected, stained with Hoechst 33342 (Beyotime, Shanghai, China), and observed using an LSM800 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Germany). The phagocytosis inhibition assay was performed according to a previously described method with some modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kokhanyuk et al., 2021</xref>). In brief, each shrimp was injected with either FITC-VP (2Ã10<sup>6</sup> particles/g) or FITC-VP (2Ã10<sup>6</sup> particles/g)+cytochalasin D (5 Î¼M/g). The hemocytes were collected 2 hr post-injection and immediately analyzed with a BD Accuri C6 Plus Flow Cytometer (Becton Dickinson, USA). The phagocytic hemocytes were quantified based on fluorescence intensity, and the fluorescence boundary was set based on the detection of self-fluorescence of untreated hemocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Collection of sorted hemocyte RNA and proteins for RT-qPCR and immunoblot analyses</title><p>For each experiment, 50â100 k events from phagocytic hemocytes (R1) and control hemocytes (R2) were collected. Total RNA from the collected samples was purified using the RNAprep Pure Micro Kit (TIANGEN, Beijing, China) and reverse-transcribed into cDNA using a First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China). qPCR was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Luo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp10">Supplementary file 10</xref>), and the gene expression level was recorded as relative expression to <italic>EF-1Î±</italic>. This experiment was repeated five times. Total proteins from sorted hemocytes were precipitated by adding 1/100 volume of 2% sodium deoxycholate (Macklin, Shanghai, China) and 1/10 volume of 100% trichloroacetic acid (Macklin), followed by vortexing and centrifugation at 15,000Ãg for 15 min at 4 Â°C. The pellet was collected for performing SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Luo et al., 2022</xref>). This experiment was repeated thrice. The following antibodies were used: Î²-actin (AF5003; Beyotime, Shanghai, China), anti-NAGA (13686-T24; SinoBiological, Beijing, China), and anti-LYZ1 (bs-0816R; Bioss Antibodies, MA, USA).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Irene Salinas as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Carla Rothlin as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Beatriz Novoa (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The title needs to be revised according to the reviewers' comments.</p><p>2) Please revise the hypothesis and goal of the study in the introduction so that the experimental work actually matches the hypothesis and goals. This is very important because all three reviewers agree that the evolutionary hypothesis presented is vague and not the main point of the work.</p><p>3) It is critical to address all the experimental concerns regarding the phagocytosis assays and data presented in Figure 3 (see reviewer #1 comments).</p><p>4) Please include light microscopy or electron microscopy images of sorted phagocytes.</p><p>5) Please include in a supplementary table the % nucleotide and % amino acid identity scores between vertebrate and shrimp gene markers used in the single cell RNA-Seq dataset.</p><p>6) As brought up by all reviewers, data interpretation and discussion need to be completely reorganized. The discussion should be much more thorough and include very careful interpretation of the findings.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The present study provides a single cell transcriptional atlas of the white shrimp, P. vannamei, immune cells in the hemolymph, known as hemocytes. White shrimp ScRNA-Seq studies uncovered two macrophage-like populations, one of them with markers similar to mammalian macrophages. The study also shows that this new population is phagocytic and expresses proteins such as NLRP3, LYS, and NAGA. These findings redefine the current classification of shrimp immune cells which has been done using morphological approaches and via targeted qPCR studies but never using single cell transcriptomics.</p><p>Currently, the manuscript is heavily focused on the single cell dataset which should be the start to formulate hypotheses, not the main focus of the paper. The authors do a good job at identifying the MH2 subset and suggesting that they are phagocytic but further experiments are needed to substantiate this observation and increase the significance of these results.</p><p>Abstract:</p><p>1. The following sentence does not make any sense &quot;How myeloid cells evolved from invertebrate to vertebrate is still a mystery.&quot; I suggest rephrasing to: Despite the importance of innate immunity in invertebrates, the diversity and function of myeloid cells in invertebrates are largely unknown.</p><p>2. The abstract needs to be rewritten to just say: Using single-cell RNA-Seq we uncover XXX in the white shrimp hemolymph. Our results identified a novel macrophage-like subset defined by the expression of the XXX gene MH2. MH2+ hemocytes are phagocytic and express markers that indicate some conservation with mammalian macrophages.</p><p>3. Combined, our work resolves the heterogeneity of hemocytes in the very economically important aquatic species and identifies a novel myeloid subset that is likely a critical player in the immune responses of shrimp to threatening infectious diseases affecting this industry.</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>The introduction should start by stating the importance of innate immunity in invertebrates since there is no B and T cell-based adaptive immunity. Innate immune cells in invertebrates are also very important because they have trained immunity.</p><p>After the introductory paragraph, the authors can describe what is known based on single-cell RNA-Seq from invertebrate hemocytes, basically what is already written in the current version of the manuscript from lines 66-79.</p><p>Line 80-81: I do not think the question is properly formulated. Of course, there is a common ancestor between vertebrates and invertebrates, and therefore there may be a conservation of many myeloid-like characteristics in invertebrate and vertebrate myeloid subsets. However, invertebrates may have also evolved their own subsets of myeloid cells over evolutionary time. Some may have co-opted some of the same molecules that vertebrate myeloid cells also use but many new functions may have been acquired from other genes/gene families that may have been expanded. I really beg authors to ask themselves again if this is the real question they want to answer.</p><p>Line 82: Intrigued by this question, we here use the marine invertebrate XXX to characterize immune cell subsets using scRNA-Seq. The reason to select this species is because of XXX.</p><p>Line 91: remove various.</p><p>Lines 94-99 read very strangely. If this is the end of the introduction, the authors need to frame the conceptual question and the goal of the study. For instance, if single-cell RNA-Seq has not been done before in P. vannamei please state so.</p><p>Line 204: dendritic, not dendric.</p><p>Results:</p><p>â According to Figure 1C, MH cells express not only lyz1, nlrp3 but also VEGF5. The authors do not comment on this very interesting finding. VEGF expression may confer MH cells the ability to penetrate tissues and induce angiogenesis. I do not see any VEGF5 expression data in Figure 2 so I do not know if it was differentially expressed in MH1 and MH2 populations. Can the authors please clarify? If VEGF5 is, in fact, a marker for MH2 it needs to be shown and discussed in the discussion given that VEGF is also a marker for Hofbauer cells (see my comments below). Lastly, the VEGF pathway plays a very important role in the immune response of shrimp to infection with the very important virus WSSV (doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2017.01457).

The written manuscript, particularly the introduction, does not align with the expectations set by the manuscript title. As it is written, this paper seems as though it is an investigation into the role of CREG in hemocyte development/differentiation. It seems as though the expectations that CREG would influence hemocyte development did not pan out, and the myeloid evolution angle became the focus. The manuscript introduction and discussion should be refocused to better guide the reader through other invertebrate studies, some of which are single-cell analyses, that contribute to our current understanding of myeloid cell evolution.</p><p>2. The methods are generally vague and at times, seem conflicting. For example, DropSeq is mentioned in the Figure 1 caption whereas 10x is mentioned elsewhere. More detail could be included for nearly all method sections.</p><p>3. Based on the information provided, primarily in the supplemental tables, it is unclear how similar the vertebrate homologs are to the shrimp genes. These vertebrate factors are used to assign a function to the shrimp transcripts, however, without a % nucleotide or amino acid identity, it is not possible to evaluate how appropriate those putative functions are. This is a cruz of the manuscript, as the conclusions that these factors can be used to define hemocyte subtypes as evolutionarily related to vertebrate myeloid cells appear to be hinged on the fact that they are functionally the same. The % nucleotide and % amino acid identity scores should be included in the supplementary tables.</p><p>4. I do not think it is sufficient to suggest that expression patterns of marker genes are strong evidence of developmental relationships between hemocyte subtypes. The authors even use the word 'probably' on line 177 when explaining this analysis. To demonstrate the differentiation relationships being proposed, the authors should sort the hemocyte subtypes using the markers identified and then experimentally show that those subtypes proposed as being 'progenitor cells' can in fact differentiate into effector subtypes.</p><p>5. The discussion is incredibly brief and speculative. Statements such as &quot;Crustacean seems possess less phagocytic cells compared with other species, which may be due to its unique endosymbiosis with microbes in its hemolymph, which has been partially unveiled by recent studies&quot; are unsupported and seem tangential to the stated theme of the manuscript. In other instances, the use of terms such as 'a lot' (line 171) seems sloppy and does little to inform the reader. Substantial effort should be directed at focusing the manuscript towards the intended theme.</p><p>6. Given the breadth of invertebrate species out there, it seems inappropriate to suggest that shrimp hemocytes are the only invertebrate key to unlocking myeloid cell evolution. The authors should, at the least, create a summary table of other single-cell analyses and hematopoietic hemocyte studies undertaken in invertebrates, highlighting whether there is consistency with the findings of this study in other vertebrate phyla. This type of analysis would lend itself to supporting a primarily sequence-based conclusion of myeloid cell evolution from an invertebrate origin.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled <bold>&quot;</bold>Single cell RNA sequencing analysis of shrimp immune cells identifies macrophage-like phagocytes<bold>&quot;</bold> for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Carla Rothlin (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below.</p><p>Specifically, reviewers have still identified issues with the English grammar which needs further improvement, the comparison with other invertebrate single-cell data sets beyond arthropods, and the tone down of some of the conclusions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #5 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) In the manuscript entitled: &quot;Single cell RNA sequencing analysis of shrimp immune cells identifies macrophage-like phagocytes&quot; by Peng Yang et al. The authors describe the characterization on a single cell level of hemocytes and immunocytes of the Shrimp Penaeus vannamei. Moreover, they find on the molecular level similarities to vertebrate myeloid lineage, specifically macrophage-like cells. They show that those cells are functionally phagocytic cells and have macrophage markers on the RNA and protein levels. Moreover, they compare their findings with the previous characterization of shrimp hemocytes.</p><p>2) This is important work since the authors use a commercially important species. The single-cell analysis is laying the base for future cellular understanding. The authors validate their sequencing data for the macrophage-like population using phagocytic function and RT-PCR and protein validation. The manuscript is well written and explained.</p><p>There are some overstatements that should be addressed. While the authors are very couscous in making homology overstatement regarding the macrophage-like cells, they are using the myeloid cell lineage as a given to exist and be homolog between vertebrates and invertebrates. Due to that please revise the second sentence in the abstract (line 19) to &quot;innate immune cells&quot; or something like that instead of myeloid. The same is also true for the third line of the discussion (lines 247-248). Since myeloid is a specifically defined subpopulation in vertebrates' hematopoietic system, it is not parallel to phagocytes or innate immune cells. The authors by the end of the manuscript can discuss their findings and that the myeloid lineage might evolve in arthropods already.</p><p>An additional issue related to that is to do with the first paragraph of the introduction, while the authors are trying to make a general statement of myeloid lineage in invertebrates, they give only examples from other arthropods. I think to make it a general discussion they should discuss additional works, such as the work of Rosental et al., Nature 2018, where myeloid lineage was shown in tunicates (Botryllus) on the molecular and functional levels. This way the authors can make a more general statement about the earlier emergence of the myeloid lineage.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80127.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The title needs to be revised according to the reviewers' comments.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your kindly suggestion.

Of course, there is a common ancestor between vertebrates and invertebrates, and therefore there may be a conservation of many myeloid-like characteristics in invertebrate and vertebrate myeloid subsets.

Some may have co-opted some of the same molecules that vertebrate myeloid cells also use but many new functions may have been acquired from other genes/gene families that may have been expanded.

The authors do not comment on this very interesting finding. VEGF expression may confer MH cells the ability to penetrate tissues and induce angiogenesis. I do not see any VEGF5 expression data in Figure 2 so I do not know if it was differentially expressed in MH1 and MH2 populations. Can the authors please clarify? If VEGF5 is, in fact, a marker for MH2 it needs to be shown and discussed in the discussion given that VEGF is also a marker for Hofbauer cells (see my comments below). Lastly, the VEGF pathway plays a very important role in the immune response of shrimp to infection with the very important virus WSSV (doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2017.01457). Because of this, this finding is important and deserves careful examination and discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your kindly reminder. Figure 1C shows that MH cells express VEGF3. Below are the reasons that why we donât talk about VEGF:</p><p>1. Currently, five VEGF subtypes (VEGF1-5) have been identified in shrimp (doi: 10.1016/j.fsi.2015.10.026 doi: 10.1016/j.dci.2016.05.020 doi: 10.1016/j.fsi.2018.10.019). However, shrimp holds an open circulation system with partial blood vessel. Until now it is not quite sure that whether angiogenesis in adult is important or not.</p><p>2. Besides VEGF3, other VEGFs could express almost all tissues in shrimp (doi: 10.1016/j.fsi.2015.10.026 doi: 10.1016/j.dci.2016.05.020 doi: 10.1016/j.fsi.2018.10.019) although different subtypes may have some tissue preference. People donât know whatâs the difference for all these VEGF subtypes in shrimp. Here, we used bubble chart to characterize the expression of VEGF3 in different types of blood cells of shrimp (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>This Figure indicates that VEGF3 has no significant differentially expression in MH1 and MH2 populations.</title><p>Thus, we donât list this gene in Figure 2B and give a discussion for this marker. Moreover, it is difficult to address this point because VEGFs in shrimp have five subtypes. All five subtypes play some roles during WSSV infection (doi: 10.1016/j.fsi.2015.10.026 doi: 10.1016/j.dci.2016.05.020 doi: 10.1016/j.fsi.2018.10.019). Only VEGF3 was highly expressed in MH subtype. This system is too complicated and far away from being clarified at this moment.

This is a cruz of the manuscript, as the conclusions that these factors can be used to define hemocyte subtypes as evolutionarily related to vertebrate myeloid cells appear to be hinged on the fact that they are functionally the same. The % nucleotide and % amino acid identity scores should be included in the supplementary tables.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your kindly suggestion.

I do not think it is sufficient to suggest that expression patterns of marker genes are strong evidence of developmental relationships between hemocyte subtypes. The authors even use the word 'probably' on line 177 when explaining this analysis. To demonstrate the differentiation relationships being proposed, the authors should sort the hemocyte subtypes using the markers identified and then experimentally show that those subtypes proposed as being 'progenitor cells' can in fact differentiate into effector subtypes.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your kindly suggestion. I recognized that I have over-interpreted the data shown in this manuscript. Thus, I have carefully rewritten the whole manuscript and shifted my major claim from myeloid cell evolution to identification of a novel invertebrate macrophage-like phagocytes. We are trying hard to screen the markersâ monoclonal antibodies for major subtypes listed in this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The discussion is incredibly brief and speculative. Statements such as &quot;Crustacean seems possess less phagocytic cells compared with other species, which may be due to its unique endosymbiosis with microbes in its hemolymph, which has been partially unveiled by recent studies&quot; are unsupported and seem tangential to the stated theme of the manuscript. In other instances, the use of terms such as 'a lot' (line 171) seems sloppy and does little to inform the reader. Substantial effort should be directed at focusing the manuscript towards the intended theme.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your kindly comment. we have deleted the sentenceâ Crustacean seems possess less phagocytic cells compared with other species, which may be due to its unique endosymbiosis with microbes in its hemolymph, which has been partially unveiled by recent studiesâ.

Given the breadth of invertebrate species out there, it seems inappropriate to suggest that shrimp hemocytes are the only invertebrate key to unlocking myeloid cell evolution. The authors should, at the least, create a summary table of other single-cell analyses and hematopoietic hemocyte studies undertaken in invertebrates, highlighting whether there is consistency with the findings of this study in other vertebrate phyla. This type of analysis would lend itself to supporting a primarily sequence-based conclusion of myeloid cell evolution from an invertebrate origin.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your kindly suggestion. I have added Supplementary file 10 to compare our study with other invertebrate cellular immunity studies.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: what follows is the authorsâ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #5 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) In the manuscript entitled: &quot;Single cell RNA sequencing analysis of shrimp immune cells identifies macrophage-like phagocytes&quot; by Peng Yang et al. The authors describe the characterization on a single cell level of hemocytes and immunocytes of the Shrimp Penaeus vannamei. Moreover, they find on the molecular level similarities to vertebrate myeloid lineage, specifically macrophage-like cells. They show that those cells are functionally phagocytic cells and have macrophage markers on the RNA and protein levels. Moreover, they compare their findings with the previous characterization of shrimp hemocytes.</p><p>2) This is important work since the authors use a commercially important species. The single-cell analysis is laying the base for future cellular understanding. The authors validate their sequencing data for the macrophage-like population using phagocytic function and RT-PCR and protein validation. The manuscript is well written and explained.</p><p>There are some overstatements that should be addressed. While the authors are very couscous in making homology overstatement regarding the macrophage-like cells, they are using the myeloid cell lineage as a given to exist and be homolog between vertebrates and invertebrates. Due to that please revise the second sentence in the abstract (line 19th) to &quot;innate immune cells&quot; or something like that instead of myeloid. The same is also true for the third line of the discussion (lines 247-248). Since myeloid is a specifically defined subpopulation in vertebrates' hematopoietic system, it is not parallel to phagocytes or innate immune cells. The authors by the end of the manuscript can discuss their findings and that the myeloid lineage might evolve in arthropods already.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion, I have replaced âmyeloid cellâ with âinnate immune cellâ for invertebrate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>An additional issue related to that is to do with the first paragraph of the introduction, while the authors are trying to make a general statement of myeloid lineage in invertebrates, they give only examples from other arthropods. I think to make it a general discussion they should discuss additional works, such as the work of Rosental et al., Nature 2018, where myeloid lineage was shown in tunicates (Botryllus) on the molecular and functional levels. This way the authors can make a more general statement about the earlier emergence of the myeloid lineage.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion, I have weakened the myeloid lineage claim for invertebrate and replace them with âinnate immune cellâ. In addition, I have mentioned the work of Rosental et al., Nature 2018 in line 39.</p></body></sub-article></article>
