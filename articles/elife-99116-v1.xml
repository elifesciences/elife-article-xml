Here, we integrated analysis of sequencing and image-based data to compare genome organization in four human cell types relative to three different nuclear locales: the nuclear lamina, nuclear speckles, and nucleoli. Although gene expression correlates mostly with nuclear speckle proximity, DNA replication timing correlates with proximity to multiple nuclear locales. Speckle attachment regions emerge as DNA replication initiation zones whose replication timing and gene composition vary with their attachment frequency. Most facultative LADs retain a partially repressed state as iLADs, despite their positioning in the nuclear interior. Knock out of two lamina proteins, Lamin A and LBR, causes a shift of H3K9me3-enriched LADs from lamina to nucleolus, and a reciprocal relocation of H3K27me3-enriched partially repressed iLADs from nucleolus to lamina. Thus, these partially repressed iLADs appear to compete with LADs for nuclear lamina attachment with consequences for replication timing. The nuclear organization in adherent cells is polarized with nuclear bodies and genomic regions segregating both radially and relative to the equatorial plane. Together, our results underscore the importance of considering genome organization relative to nuclear locales for a more complete understanding of the spatial and functional organization of the human genome.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>genome organization</kwd><kwd>nuclear structure</kwd><kwd>nuclear lamina</kwd><kwd>nuclear speckles</kwd><kwd>nucleoli</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54DK107965</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gilbert</surname><given-names>David M</given-names></name><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Jian</given-names></name><name><surname>van Steensel</surname><given-names>Bas</given-names></name><name><surname>Belmont</surname><given-names>Andrew S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UM1HG011593</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gilbert</surname><given-names>David M</given-names></name><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Jian</given-names></name><name><surname>Belmont</surname><given-names>Andrew S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>New insights into nuclear genome organization were generated by comparing genome localization relative to three major nuclear locales- nuclear lamina, nuclear speckles, and nucleoli- across several human cell lines.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Over 100 years of cytology has recognized characteristic features of nuclear genome organization, including blocks of condensed chromatin enriched at the nuclear and nucleolar peripheries and varying degrees of condensation/decondensation throughout the nuclear interior.

Two current models for nuclear genome organization prevail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belmont, 2022</xref>).</p><p>The radial genome organization model describes a radial gradient of higher gene expression activity toward the nuclear center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bickmore, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Croft et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Girelli et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kölbl et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Küpper et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Takizawa et al., 2008</xref>). The binary model of genome organization describes the differential intranuclear positioning of two discrete chromatin states: heterochromatin primarily to the nuclear lamina, and to a lesser extent the nucleolar periphery and clusters of PCH, and euchromatin to the remaining nuclear space or ‘interior’. Originally supported by the differential intranuclear segregation of Alu repeat-enriched, early replicating versus LINE1 repeat-enriched, late replicating chromosome bands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Korenberg and Rykowski, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bolzer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Solovei et al., 2009</xref>), three orthogonal genomic methods – DamID, Repli-seq, and Hi-C – have segmented the genome into similar Lamin Associated Domains (LADs)/ late replicating/ B compartment versus inter-LAD (iLADs), early replicating/ A compartment binary divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guelen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kind et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Peric-Hupkes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ryba et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">White et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>However, neither model acknowledges the considerable cell-type-specific variability in nuclear shape and size, as well as the size, number, and relative positioning of nuclear bodies. This variability could dramatically affect chromosome trajectories and the distribution of active and inactive chromatin regions among nuclear locales. Additionally, neither model acknowledges the variation between cell types in how different heterochromatin regions distribute between the nuclear periphery, the nucleolar periphery, and the nuclear interior as well as how active genes might segregate to different regions of the nuclear interior. In fact, these differences comprise a major element of histology and pathology textbooks and are used routinely for clinical diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fischer, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Skinner and Johnson, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Indeed, high-resolution Hi-C has identified two active A subcompartments and three major repressive B subcompartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rao et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, TSA-seq, NAD-seq, and SPRITE have distinguished between types of heterochromatin localizing preferentially at nucleoli versus the nuclear lamina and have revealed a type of active chromatin specifically localizing near nuclear speckles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Németh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Quinodoz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Quinodoz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">van Koningsbruggen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vertii et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). However, a major limitation with these previous studies is that they typically focused on one type of measurement (i.e. Hi-C, DamID, or NAD-seq), one or two nuclear compartments, and/or one or a limited number of cell types.</p><p>To address these problems, we integrated multiple spatial and functional genomic measurements and light microscopy across multiple cell lines. We focused on the specific goal of relating nuclear genome features to three nuclear locales – the nuclear periphery (NP), nucleoli, and nuclear speckles – while also developing improvements to DamID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">van Schaik et al., 2020</xref>), TSA-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>), and Repli-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>). In a companion paper, we extended and validated our improved TSA-seq 2.0 protocol to map the nuclear genome relative to the nuclear lamina and nucleoli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kumar et al., 2024</xref>), adding to our previous TSA-seq 2.0 mapping relative to nuclear speckles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>) and our improved-resolution 16-fraction Repli-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Here, we integrate this nuclear locale genomic mapping with light microscopy imaging of the same three nuclear locales to investigate how the genome is both spatially and functionally organized relative to these nuclear locales across four human cell types- hTERT-immortalized human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFc6, abbreviated hereafter as HFF), H1 human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), HCT116 (HCT) colon carcinoma epithelial cells, and K562 erythroleukemia cells.</p><p>Our results show that both radial and/or binary divisions of the genome are oversimplified. Multiple types of active versus inactive chromatin states can be recognized by their varying association with nuclear locales. Moreover, nuclear genome organization varies among cell types both because of changes in genome positioning relative to individual nuclear locales as well as changes in the intranuclear positioning of these locales relative to each other. Gene expression shows much stronger correlation with distance to nuclear speckles versus either the nuclear lamina or nucleoli. Finally, we demonstrate a nuclear polarity to the genome organization beyond a simple radial axis which further spatially divides active versus repressive genomic states as well as DNA replication timing.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cell types differ widely in morphology and arrangement of nuclear locales</title><p>Prior genomic analyses of nuclear locales have largely ignored variation in nuclear morphology. However, differences in position relative to nuclear locales can result from either differences in chromatin location or to differences in the relative positioning or even morphologies of nuclear locales. Therefore, we began by comparing nuclear, nucleolar, and nuclear speckle sizes and shapes, as well as nucleolar and nuclear speckle positioning relative to each other and the NP, across the four human cell lines – H1, HCT116, HFF, and K562.</p><p>To measure sizes and shapes of nuclei and nuclear bodies, cell lines were stained for nuclear speckles (hereafter referred to simply as speckles), nucleoli, and the NP with anti-SON, anti-MKI67IP, and anti-glycosylated nucleoporin (anti-RL1) antibodies, respectively, and for DNA using DAPI.

However, despite various cell-line-specific differences in nuclear locale morphologies, the four cell lines divide approximately into round (K562, H1) nuclei with radial organization of nuclear bodies versus flat nuclei (HCT116, HFF) with nuclear bodies distributed differentially relative to distance from both the x-y equatorial plane as well as distance from the nuclear center.

DamID is a well-established molecular proximity assay; DamID applied to the nuclear lamina divides the genome into lamina-associated domains (LADs) versus non-associated ‘inter-LADs’ or ‘iLADs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guelen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van Steensel and Belmont, 2017</xref>). In contrast, TSA-seq measures relative distances to targets on a microscopic scale corresponding to 100 s of nm to ~1 µm based on the measured diffusion radius of tyramide-biotin free-radicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). Exploiting the measured exponential decay of the tyramide-biotin free-radical concentration, we showed how the mean distance of chromosomes to nuclear speckles could be estimated from the TSA-seq data to an accuracy of ~50 nm, as validated by FISH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). While lamin DamID segments LADs most accurately, lamin TSA-seq provides distance information not provided by DamID- for example, variations in relative distances to the nuclear lamina of different iLADs and iLAD regions. These differences between the lamin DamID and TSA-seq signals are also crucial to a computational approach, SPIN, that segments the genome into multiple states based on their varying nuclear localization, including biochemically and functionally distinct lamina-associated versus near-lamina states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dekker et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Thus, lamin DamID and TSA-seq complement each other, providing more information together than either one separately. For these reasons, we set out to develop both SON and nucleolar DamID and nucleolar TSA-seq with the goal of mapping the genome relative to the nuclear lamina, nuclear speckles, and nucleoli in each case using both DamID and TSA-seq. We successfully developed nucleolar TSA-seq, which we extensively validated using comparisons with two different orthogonal genome-wide approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kumar et al., 2024</xref>)- NAD-seq, based on the biochemical isolation of nucleoli, and previously published direct microscopic measurements using highly multiplexed immuno-FISH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Su et al., 2020</xref>). As previously demonstrated for both SON and lamin TSA-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2018</xref>), nucleolar TSA-seq was also robust in the sense that multiple target proteins showing similar nucleolar staining showed similar TSA-seq results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kumar et al., 2024</xref>); this robustness is intrinsic to TSA-seq being a microscopic rather than molecular proximity assay, and therefore not sensitive to the exact molecular binding partners and molecular distance of the target proteins to the DNA.</p><p>In contrast, we were unsuccessful with both the SON and nucleolar DamID. SON DamID showed narrow, several hundred bp peaks near the promoters of most active genes, similar to previous SON ChIP-seq profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2016</xref>), consistent with measurement of the local accumulation of SON molecules at these sites rather than chromosome contact with nuclear speckles. Nucleolar DamID instead showed broad positive peaks over large chromatin domains, largely overlapping with LADs mapped by LMNB1 DamID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). However, this nucleolar DamID signal, while strongly correlated with lamin DamID, showed poor correlation with either NAD-seq or nucleolar distances mapped by multiplexed immuno-FISH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kumar et al., 2024</xref>). We suspect the problem is that DamID is a molecular rather than microscopic proximity assay; therefore, both the SON and nucleolar DamID output signals should be disproportionally dominated by the small fraction of target proteins juxtaposed in sufficient proximity to the DNA to produce a signal, rather than by the amount of protein concentrated in the microscopically adjacent target nuclear body.</p><p>For these reasons, our analyses focused on those measurements that proved robust in measuring relative proximity to the nuclear lamina, nucleoli, and nuclear speckles locales: lamina (LMNB1) DamID and, as described in previous papers, lamina (LMNB1) and nucleolar (MKI67IP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kumar et al., 2024</xref>), and speckle (SON; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>) TSA-seq 2.0.</p><p>Speckle TSA-seq is highly conserved across all four cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>) and supported here by the high correlations for speckle TSA-seq comparisons between pairs of cell lines, despite a lower dynamic range in HCT116 and especially HFF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Global changes in nuclear genome intranuclear positioning and their correlations with changes in gene expression and DNA replication timing.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Chr1 left arm browser view suggests chromosome trajectory alternating between positioning of early replicating regions near nuclear speckles and late-replicating regions at either the nucleolar (H1, K562) or the nuclear periphery (HCT116, HFF); Top to bottom- nuclear speckle (SON, green), nucleolus (MKI67IP, orange), and nuclear lamina (LMNB1, purple) TSA-seq, LMNB1 (purple) DamID, and 2-fraction Repli-seq (Replication timing, brown).

More specifically, analogously to how gene expression hot-zones appeared as local maxima in speckle TSA-seq with early DNA replication timing, we asked whether iLAD regions that appeared as local maxima in lamina proximity mapping signals would correspond to iLAD regions with locally reduced gene expression levels and later DNA replication timing relative to their flanking iLAD sequences.

Whereas the late replicating, low gene density/expression ‘T1 LAD’ state showed very high overlap (98%) with LADs defined by DamID, the intermediate replicating, intermediate gene expression ‘T2 LAD’ state showed only 47% overlap with LADs defined by DamID. This was partly a result of the HMM segmentation algorithm but also due to substantial differences between the lamina ChIP-seq versus DamID signals for reasons that remain unclear. The subset of p-w-v iLADs included in T2 comprise only a small percentage of the total T2 LAD coverage, which includes both other iLAD and LAD regions. Thus, the p-w-v iLADs we identified here represent a novel and distinct class of iLAD chromatin domains, not previously described.</p><p>In summary, our analysis revealed that most LAD to iLAD transitions between different cell types correspond to a transition to a partially repressive, heterochromatic state which still shows some residual association with the lamina and, in some cases, with nucleoli.

One possibility is that while many heterochromatic regions might exchange a repressive environment near the lamina for another repressive environment within the nuclear interior, a smaller number of chromosome regions might instead show a dependence of gene expression on differences in distance relative to the lamina. Indeed, we did observe that most of the ~10% of chromosome regions between cell types which showed differences in location relative to nuclear speckles also showed inverse differences in location relative to the lamina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, we set out to experimentally manipulate genome association with the lamina by making LMNA, LBR, and double LMNA/LBR K562 knockout (KO) lines to probe the functional consequences of changes in genome distance to the lamina. In at least some post-mitotic mouse cell types, LMNA/LBR double KO creates an ‘inverted’ nuclear morphology, with loss of peripheral heterochromatin, accumulation of most heterochromatin in the nuclear interior, and positioning of euchromatin toward the NP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Solovei et al., 2013</xref>). This inverted nuclear morphology is seen normally in retinal rod cells of nocturnal mammals, which lack both LBR and LMNA expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Solovei et al., 2013</xref>), but Hi-C reveals largely unchanged A and B compartments, despite the inversion of euchromatin and heterochromatin nuclear positioning in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Falk et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Whereas the LMNA KO shows little change in lamina DamID from K562 wild-type (WT) or the parental clone, the LBR KO and the LMNA/LBR double knockout (DKO) lines show similar but partial reduction in the lamina DamID for most LADs and increases for some iLADs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Immunostaining against LMNB1 revealed the normal ring of staining around the NP seen in WT cells (images deposited as metadata in the deposited sequencing data sets). Based on DamID and TSA-seq, most LADs in DKO cells decrease their interaction and relative proximity with the lamina and increase their proximity to nucleoli but maintain their positioning to speckles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>); nuclear and nuclear locale morphologies change as well in the DKO cells compared to WT K562 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

What is the actual explanation for these fLADs showing even higher lamin B TSA-seq scores than cLADs in HCT116 cells but not in K562 cells? The noticeably weaker inverse relationship between speckle and lamina TSA-seq in cells with flat (HCT116, HFF) versus round nuclei (K562, H1) was due specifically to changes in lamina TSA-seq as lamina DamID scores showed less variation across cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>The inactive X chromosome, a classic example of facultative heterochromatin, was previously inferred to be localizing preferentially to the NP contained within the equatorial plane of fibroblast nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Belmont et al., 1986</xref>).

We hypothesized that these LADs would have the highest lamina TSA-seq scores: after lamina TSA-staining they would be exposed to a higher concentration of tryamide free-radicals generated and diffusing from the nearby side, top, and bottom of the nuclear lamina as compared to LADs at either the top or bottom of the nuclear lamina.</p><p>To test this we turned to a highly multiplexed, immuno-FISH dataset from IMR90 human fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Su et al., 2020</xref>), published after our TSA-seq profiling of HFF human fibroblasts. We reasoned that the nuclear genome organization in the two human fibroblast cell lines would be sufficiently similar to justify using the IMR90 FISH dataset as a proxy for our analysis of HFF TSA-seq data. Indeed, the high inverse correlation (<italic>R</italic>=–0.86) of distances to speckles measured by MERFISH in IMR90 cells with HFF SON TSA-seq scores is nearly identical to the inverse correlation (<italic>R</italic>=–0.89) measured instead using IMR90 SON TSA-seq scores, published elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

Overall, our results significantly extend previous nuclear genome organization models, while also demonstrating a cell-type-dependent complexity of nuclear genome organization. Briefly, in contrast to the previous radial model of genome organization, we reveal a primary correlation of gene expression with relative distances to nuclear speckles rather than radial position. Additionally, beyond a correlation of nuclear genome organization with radial position, in cells with flat nuclei we show a pronounced correlation of nuclear genome organization with distance from the equatorial plane. In contrast to previous binary models of genome organization, we describe how both iLAD / A compartment and LAD / B compartment contain within them smaller chromosome regions with distinct biochemical and/or functional properties that segregate differentially with respect to relative distances to nuclear locales and geometry.</p><p>More specifically, we describe five significant new insights into genome organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). First, across the four cell lines examined, differences in gene expression correlate primarily with differences in the genome positioning of these genes relative to nuclear speckles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>) rather than distance from the nuclear lamina and despite variations in speckle positioning relative to the nuclear lamina and nucleoli. Consistent with previous observations showing a more interior nuclear localization of genes after their activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bickmore, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Takizawa et al., 2008</xref>), we demonstrate an inverse trend between changes in speckle and lamina distances for the small fraction of genomic regions that show significant changes in their relative speckle distances. For these regions, there is a strong bias toward increased (decreased) gene expression with decreased (increased) speckle distance. However, several-fold more genomic regions significantly change their relative lamina distances without significantly changing their speckle distances or gene expression. Similarly, LBR/LMNA DKO in K562 cells results in many genomic regions increasing or decreasing their lamina association without changes in their speckle distance or gene expression. In contrast, changes in DNA replication timing correlate with changes in positioning relative to all three nuclear locales – speckles, lamina, and nucleoli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>New insights into nuclear genome organization revealed by nuclear locale genome mapping.</title><p>Human nucleus schematic (middle) shows nuclear speckles (NS, green), nucleolus (orange), and nuclear lamina (NL, purple).

Regions close to nuclear speckles replicate early, while regions close to nucleolus and/or nuclear lamina replicate late during S-phase. (<bold>B</bold>) Two types of speckle association domains (SPADs), with similarly elevated levels of gene expression but genes of different lengths and relative intron/exon fraction, associate with NS. Type-I SPADs, with shorter, more exon-rich genes, have higher NS association frequencies compared to Type-II SPADs, with longer, more intron-rich genes. (<bold>C</bold>) fLADs can assume at least three different chromatin states across different cell types: (i) a B-compartment LAD (positive lamina DamID signal) with high NL association, low gene expression levels and late DNA replication (cell type 1); (ii) an A-compartment p-w-v fiLAD (peak-within-valley lamina DamID signal) with low NL association, intermediate gene expression and middle-to late DNA replication (cell type 2); (iii) an A-compartment v fiLAD (valley lamina DamID signal) with no NL association, high gene expression and early DNA replication (cell type 3).

Type I regions contain shorter, more exon-rich genes as compared to Type II regions and are more highly conserved across cell lines than Type II regions. IZs within strong speckle attachment sites replicate earlier than IZs within weak speckle attachment zones with the very earliest DNA replication foci appearing adjacent to nuclear speckles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>).</p><p>Third, Hi-C A compartment/iLADs are also punctuated by partially repressed fiLADs which retain weak lamina interaction and, in some cases, elevated nucleolar interactions. Identified as local maxima in lamina TSA-seq and/or DamID, these &quot;p-w-v fiLADs&quot; comprise ~2/3 of all fiLADs across the four cell lines examined. P-w-v fiLADs show gene expression levels intermediate between LADs and typical iLADs while retaining late or shifting to middle DNA replication timing. Only approximately 1/3 of fiLADs, identified as valleys in lamina DamID (v fiLADs), convert to an active, early-replicating, interior chromatin state. The same fLADs across different cell lines can associate strongly with the lamina as a LAD, retain weak lamina association as a partially repressive p-w-v fiLAD, or show a true transition to an interior, active, early DNA replicating state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Upon LMNA/LBR double KO, p-w-v fiLADs shift closer to the lamina, suggesting they compete with LADs for lamina association in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>).</p><p>Fourth, we show how LAD regions showing different histone marks- either enriched in H3K9me3, H3K9me2 plus H2A.Z, H3K27me3, or none of these marks- can differentially segregate within nuclei. These results support the previous suggestion of different ‘flavors’ of LAD regions, based on the sensitivity of the autonomous targeting of BAC transgenes to the lamina to different histone methyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bian et al., 2013</xref>). Differential nuclear localization also was recently inferred by the appearance of different Hi-C B-subcompartments, which similarly were differentially enriched in either H3K9m3, H3K27me3, or the combination of H3K9me2 and H2A.Z (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Spracklin et al., 2023</xref>). More recently, and while this paper was in revision, a new study described segmenting mouse embryonic fibroblast LADs into three clusters using histone modification profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Martin et al., 2024</xref>). Interestingly, these three LAD clusters also most notably differed by their dominant enrichment of either H3K9me3, H3K9me2, or H3K27me3. Thus, three orthogonal approaches have converged on identifying different LAD regions showing differential enrichment either of H3K9me3, H3K9me2, or H3K27me3. Here, our use of TSA-seq directly measures and assigns the intranuclear localization of these different LAD regions to different nuclear locales.</p><p>Fifth, beyond the previously described dependence of genome organization relative to the radial axis in the x-y plane, there exists an unexpectedly high degree of nuclear polarity with respect to an orthogonal z-axis in HCT116 and HFF cells with flat nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Strong speckle attachment regions localize closer to the equatorial plane than weak speckle attachment regions. A subset of LADs, primarily at the ends of long chromosome arms, preferentially localize at the lamina within this equatorial plane. Using SPIN states, ordered by DNA replication timing and levels of gene expression, we show that this overall nuclear polarity applies to nearly the entire genome, suggesting a corresponding overall gradient in both later DNA replication timing and lower gene expression with increased distance from the equatorial plane.</p><p>In conclusion, by examining genome organization relative to multiple nuclear locales, we were able to demonstrate a higher correlation than previously apparent between nuclear location and functions such as DNA replication timing and gene expression. We anticipate future mapping of the genome relative to additional nuclear locales will reveal a still more deterministic relationship between nuclear positioning and genome function.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>H1, HCT116, and HFF cells were cultured according to standard operation protocols established by the NIH 4D Nucleome Consortium (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.4dnucleome.org/cell-lines.html">https://www.4dnucleome.org/cell-lines.html</ext-link>).

Briefly, nuclei were first identified by segmenting DAPI using Otsu thresholding method. RL1 signal was first segmented using a modified nup153 workflow from Segmenter. In H1 cells, there are some cytoplasmic signals for RL1 which were removed using the DAPI nucleus mask. RL1 signals are puncta and the alpha-shapes algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Edelsbrunner et al., 1983</xref>) was used to calculate a 3D mesh-surface enclosing all the puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This surface was used to measure the nuclei’s volume (V), surface area (SA), and SA/V. We segmented SON using the SON workflow, and MKI67IP using ‘masked object thresholding’ workflow from Segmenter. The binary segmented images were used to measure the total number of locales in each nucleus and average and total V, SA. Nuclei images and segmentations were manually curated for quality control and are available online. To measure locale distances in each cell line, the SON and MKI67IP binary images were converted to mesh surfaces using a marching cube algorithm. An asymmetric locale to locale distance was then calculated by measuring the closest distance between a pair of vertices from locales mesh-surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Next, a local maximum filter with window size (w) was applied, which recorded the maximum SON TSA-seq score within this window for each genomic locus. Then the data after the maximum filter were subtracted from the original smoothed data. Peaks were retained only if they showed a reduction in value, which indicates true local peaks. A parameter optimization procedure was conducted in order to maximize the peak agreement between two SON TSA-seq replicates. As a result, a smoothing factor (span = 0.005) and a window size (w=50) were selected.

Their datasets define how interactions between the genome and the different nuclear landmarks relate to each other and change across cell types. They also identify how these relationships change in K562 cells in which LBR and LMNA are knocked out.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Overall, there are a number of datasets that are provided, and several &quot;integrative&quot; analyses performed. This is a major strength of the paper, and I imagine the datasets will be of use to the community to further probed and the relationships elucidated here further studied. An especially interesting result was that specific genomic regions (relative to their association with the speckle, lamina, and other molecular characteristics) segregate relative to the equatorial plane of the cell.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The experiments are primarily descriptive, and the cause-and-effect relationships are limited (though the authors do study the role of LMNA/LBR knockdown with their technologies).</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>I have no additional comments. I appreciate the authors responding to my previous comments. I anticipate the datasets and concepts raised will be helpful to many investigators in the field.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id

Hence, the pwv-LAD should be contextualized within these findings (which they do relative to v-fiLADs).&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and for these references. We think that the best place to go into depth about how our work relates to these references would be in an appropriate review article.</p><p>However, we did read these references carefully and responded, as described below, by adding additional clarifying text in the manuscript as well as mention of articles specifically relevant to our description of our results.</p><p>(1) Reviewer 2 wrote specifically, &quot;Hence, the pwv-LAD should be contextualized within these findings (which they do relative to v-fiLADs)&quot;</p><p>We are not sure exactly what Reviewer 2 means here. In this manuscript we defined p-w-v iLADs, not LADs. So, it would be inappropriate to compare a subset of iLAD regions with different types of LADs.</p><p>If this was the meaning of Reviewer 2, then other readers might have similar confusion. Therefore, we added the following clarifying text in red:</p><p>&quot;Several previous studies have used varying approaches to subdivide LADs further into distinct subsets of LADs with different biochemical and/or functional properties (Martin et al., 2024; Meuleman et al., 2013; Shah et al., 2023; Zheng et al., 2015). However, in this Section we focused instead on asking whether regions specifically within iLADs might show differential localization relative to the lamina and/or nucleoli and, if so, whether these regions would show different levels of gene expression. More specifically, analogously to how gene expression hot-zones appeared as local maxima in speckle TSA-seq with early DNA replication timing, we asked whether iLAD regions that appeared as local maxima in lamina proximity mapping signals would correspond to iLAD regions with locally reduced gene expression levels and later DNA replication timing relative to their flanking iLAD sequences. Our rationale was that these iLAD regions might represent chromatin domains that together with their flanking iLAD regions would typically localize well within the nuclear interior but in a fraction of the cell population would loop back and attach at the nuclear periphery.&quot;</p><p>(2) We also added the following text near the end of the section about p-w-v iLADs to place them in the context of one class of &quot;LADs&quot; identified by ChIP-seq rather than DamID. We use quotation marks since the approach used produced a segmentation that included a nearly 50/50 mix of iLAD and LAD regions, as identified by DamID, for this class of domains.</p><p>&quot;We note that in a previous study a three-state Hidden Markov Model (HMM) segmented lamin B ChIP-seq data into two chromatin domain states with extensive overlap with LADs defined by lamina DamID (Shah et al., 2023). Whereas the late replicating, low gene density/expression &quot;T1 LAD&quot; state showed very high overlap (98%) with LADs defined by DamID, the intermediate replicating, intermediate gene expression &quot;T2 LAD&quot; state showed only 47% overlap with LADs defined by DamID. This was partly a result of the HMM segmentation algorithm but also due to substantial differences between the lamina ChIPseq versus DamID signals for reasons that remain unclear. The subset of p-w-v iLADs included in T2 comprise only a small percentage of the total T2 LAD coverage, which includes both other iLAD and LAD regions. Thus, the p-w-v iLADs we identified here represent a novel and distinct class of iLAD chromatin domains, not previously described.&quot;</p><p>(3) Alternatively, what Reviewer 2 might be suggesting implicitly is that we should start with the regions identified as p-w-v iLADs in one cell type and then identify all of those p-w-v iLADs which instead exist as LADs in a second cell type. Once we have identified their LAD equivalents in a second cell type we could then ask whether they possess special characteristics such that they correspond to a specific type of LAD subset. Finally, we could then ask how that specific type of LAD subset compared to the different subtypes of LADs identified by other groups and, in particular, the references Reviewer 2 provided.</p><p>We agree that would be an interesting future direction, but we consider that as outside the scope of this current manuscript. We note that we did no such analysis of the characteristics of LADs which existed as p-w-v iLADs in a different cell line. We save that for a possible future analysis, ideally in the same cell types as used in the cited references to allow a more direct comparison.</p><p>(4) Finally, we added text in the Discussion that relates our analysis of the differential SON and LMNB1 TSA-seq signals for different LAD regions, and how these correlate with different histone modifications, with results from the recent preprint cited by Reviewer 2. Note that we could not directly correlate our results from human cells with the three classes of LADs described in MEFs by this preprint.</p><p>&quot;Fourth, we show how LAD regions showing different histone marks- either enriched in H3K9me3, H3K9me2 plus H2A.Z, H3K27me3, or none of these marks- can differentially segregate within nuclei. These results support the previous suggestion of different &quot;flavors&quot; of LAD regions, based on the sensitivity of the autonomous targeting of BAC transgenes to the lamina to different histone methyltransferases (Bian et al., 2013). Differential nuclear localization also was recently inferred by the appearance of different Hi-C Bsubcompartments, which similarly were differentially enriched in either H3K9m3, H3K27me3, or the combination of H3K9me2 and H2A.Z (Spracklin et al., 2023). More recently, and while this paper was in revision, a new study described segmenting mouse embryonic fibroblast LADs into three clusters using histone modification profiling (Martin et al., 2024). Interestingly, these three LAD clusters also most notably differed by their dominant enrichment of either H3K9me3, H3K9me2, or H3K27me3. Thus, three orthogonal approaches have converged on identifying different LAD regions showing differential enrichment either of H3K9me3, H3K9me2, or H3K27me3. Here, our use of TSA-seq directly measures and assigns the intranuclear localization of these different LAD regions to different nuclear locales.&quot;</p></body></sub-article></article>
