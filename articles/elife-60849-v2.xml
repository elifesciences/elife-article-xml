of different cellular proteins, such as CD14, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein to the plasma membrane important for LPS signaling via TLR4. Circulating CD14 has been found at elevated levels in sepsis, but the exact mechanism of CD14 release in sepsis has not been established. Here, we show for first time that P2X7 receptor induces the release of CD14 in extracellular vesicles, resulting in a net reduction in macrophage plasma membrane CD14 that functionally affects LPS, but not monophosphoryl lipid A, pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Also, we found that during a murine model of sepsis, P2X7 receptor activity is important for maintaining elevated levels of CD14 in biological fluids and a decrease in its activity results in higher bacterial load and exacerbated organ damage, ultimately leading to premature deaths. Our data reveal that P2X7 is a key receptor for helping to clear sepsis because it maintains elevated concentrations of circulating CD14 during infection.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>When the immune system detects an infection, it often launches an inflammatory response to fight off the disease. This defense mechanism is activated by a cascade of signaling molecules that can aggravate inflammation, causing it to damage the body’s own tissues and organs. This life-threatening reaction is referred to as sepsis, and kills around 11 million people each year. New approaches are therefore needed to help alleviate the damage caused by this condition.</p><p>The inflammatory response is often triggered by proteins called receptors, which sit on the surface of immune cells. When these receptors are activated, they induce cells to secrete proteins that travel around the body and activate immune cells that can eliminate the infection. In 2016, a group of researchers showed that a receptor called P2X7 stimulates the release of a signaling molecule called CD14. Patients with sepsis often have elevated amounts of CD14 in their bloodstream. Yet, it remained unclear what causes this rise in CD14 and what role this molecule plays in the development of sepsis.</p><p>Now, Alarcón-Vila et al. – including some of the researchers involved in the 2016 study – have investigated the role of P2X7 in mice undergoing sepsis. This was done by puncturing the mice’s intestines, causing bacteria to leak out and initiate an over-active immune response. Alarcón-Vila et al. found that mice lacking the P2X7 receptor had less CD14 and struggled to eliminate the bacterial infection from their system. This increase in bacteria caused excessive damage to the mice’s organs, ultimately leading to premature death.</p><p>These findings suggest that P2X7 plays an important role in preventing the onset of sepsis by helping maintain high levels of CD14 following infection. This result could help to identify new therapies that reduce the mortality rates of septic infections.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>sepsis</kwd><kwd>purinergic signaling</kwd><kwd>CD14</kwd><kwd>LPS</kwd><kwd>cytokines</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>FEDER/Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades - Agencia Estatal de Investigación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SAF2017-88276-R</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pelegrin</surname><given-names>Pablo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>614578</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pelegrin</surname><given-names>Pablo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>899636</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>García-Palenciano</surname><given-names>Carlos</given-names></name><name><surname>Pelegrin</surname><given-names>Pablo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007801</institution-id><institution>Fundación Séneca</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21081/PDC/19</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pelegrin</surname><given-names>Pablo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007801</institution-id><institution>Fundación Séneca</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20859/PI/18</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>García-Palenciano</surname><given-names>Carlos</given-names></name><name><surname>Pelegrin</surname><given-names>Pablo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A murine model of sepsis shows that the purinergic P2X7 receptor controls the release of CD14 in extracellular vesicles playing a key role in cytokine production, bacterial clearance, and survival.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Purinergic signaling controls many different processes during infection and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eltzschig et al., 2012</xref>) and the P2X7 receptor is one of the key purinergic receptors in modulating the macrophage functions that orchestrate the inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Di Virgilio et al., 2017</xref>). The P2X7 receptor in LPS-primed macrophages activates the nucleotide-binding domain and the leucine-rich repeat receptor pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, which in turn leads to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from the interleukin (IL)−1 family, such as IL-1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Di Virgilio et al., 2017</xref>). However, the P2X7 receptor can also block NLRP3 if it is activated before the LPS priming of the macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Martínez-García et al., 2019</xref>). This means that the P2X7 receptor can cause different pro- or anti-inflammatory responses depending when it is activated. In macrophages, the P2X7 receptor also induces the release of extracellular vesicles that contain IL-1β and MHCII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">MacKenzie et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pellegatti et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Qu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Qu et al., 2007</xref>); however, apart from these proteins, the cargo of P2X7 receptor-induced extracellular vesicles, remains largely unknown. A large fraction of IL-1β and other cytosolic proteins are also released via pyroptosis, a type of cell death dependent on inflammasome activation and the formation of large plasma membrane pores by gasdermin D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Broz et al., 2020</xref>). The secretome of the P2X7 receptor in macrophages includes many soluble proteins released by pyroptosis and some prototypic proteins of extracellular vesicles, such as annexin A1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Torre-Minguela et al., 2016</xref>). One of the plasma membrane-associated proteins identified as part of the P2X7 receptor secretome is CD14, a well-known myeloid cell marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Torre-Minguela et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Setoguchi et al., 1989</xref>). CD14 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored membrane protein important for transferring LPS to Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and for controlling TLR4 translocation to endosomes that activate TRAM-TRIF-dependent pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zanoni and Granucci, 2013</xref>). Therefore, CD14 is important for ensuring that TLR4 responds optimally to LPS and that macrophages produce pro-inflammatory cytokines. CD14 could be released from the cells by the action of proteinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wu et al., 2019</xref>); however, there are also different release mechanisms independent of proteinase that are not known. The pool of extracellular CD14 in vivo, known as soluble CD14, is detected in different fluids during infection and particularly during sepsis, a life-threating condition resulting from exacerbated inflammation in response to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barratt-Due et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bas et al., 2004</xref>). Extracellular CD14 during microbial infection is important for host defense, in particular for bacterial clearance, but little is known about the release of CD14 in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Qin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Knapp et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sahay et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wieland et al., 2005</xref>). Despite the fact that the P2X7 receptor induces the release of CD14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Torre-Minguela et al., 2016</xref>), it is not known if P2X7 contributes to the extracellular pool of CD14 during infection or what its role is in defending the host during sepsis. In this study, we found for first time that CD14 is a cargo of extracellular vesicles released by P2X7 receptor activation and functionally that the lack of cellular CD14 compromises the production of macrophage pro-inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, we also found that during sepsis there is a decrease in the extracellular pool of CD14 in <italic>P2rx7</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, which results in high bacterial dissemination and a decreased mice survival and reveals that the P2X7 receptor is important for maintaining an optimum level of CD14 and thus ensuring survival of sepsis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>P2X7 receptor stimulation induces the release of extracellular vesicles containing CD14</title><p>In a previous study, we identified CD14 as a specific component of the P2X7 receptor secretome in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Torre-Minguela et al., 2016</xref>). After ATP stimulation of LPS-primed macrophages, we detected the appearance of extracellular CD14 in the 100K pellet together with the tetraspanin CD9, a well-known extracellular vesicle marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). This pellet contained extracellular vesicles with an average size of 167.4 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Most of the P2X7 receptor secretome examined, with the exception of IL-1β, was present in the soluble fraction and not associated with the 100K pellet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>). The presence of CD14 in extracellular vesicles obtained from macrophage supernatants after P2X7 receptor stimulation was also determined by using a protocol for extracellular vesicle isolation based in polymer-precipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). The treatment of whole cellular supernatants with Triton X100 before vesicle isolation resulted in a loss of CD14 from the 100K pellet fraction that was detected in the soluble fraction (100K supernatant) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), suggesting CD14 is a cargo of the vesicles. The CD14 in the 100K pellet was detected just after 5 min of ATP stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>) and was independent of the macrophage activation polarity, as it was detected from M1 and M2 macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). However the number of extracellular vesicles released in LPS-primed macrophages (M1) after P2X7 receptor stimulation was significantly higher than those released from IL-4 treated (M2) or resting macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref>). Interestingly, the release of CD14 induced by the P2X7 receptor in extracellular vesicles was highly dependent on the NLRP3 inflammasome, but not on caspase-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). Then, we found that the amount of extracellular vesicles released after activation of the P2X7 receptor in <italic>Nlrp3</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and <italic>Casp1/11</italic><sup>−/−</sup> macrophages was smaller when compared with wild-type macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b</xref>). The morphology of <italic>Nlrp3</italic><sup>−/−</sup>-derived extracellular vesicles was similar to that of resting or IL-4-primed wild-type macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a,b</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Casp1/11</italic><sup>−/−</sup>-derived extracellular vesicles were similar in morphology to LPS-primed wild-type macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a,b</xref>), indicating that a specific pool of extracellular vesicle dependent on LPS-priming and NLRP3 could be enriched in CD14 and explain the differences of released CD14 found among <italic>Nlrp3</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and <italic>Casp1/11</italic><sup>−/−</sup> macrophages. The release of CD14 observed in ATP-treated macrophages resulted in a significant decrease in cell surface CD14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>), thus suggesting that the P2X7 receptor could induce a decrease in CD14-dependent signaling in macrophages as well as being a source of extracellular CD14.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>P2X7 receptor stimulation induces the release of extracellular vesicles containing CD14.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Immunoblot for CD14 and CD9 in cell lysate (CL), cell-free supernatant (Sup) and supernatant fractions (100K pellet and 100K supernatant) obtained from extracellular vesicle (EV) isolation from BMDMs treated for 4 hr with LPS (10 ng/ml) and then stimulated or not for 20 min with ATP (3 mM); representative of <italic>n</italic> = 3 experiments.

Treatment of macrophages with extracellular ATP and then subjected to LPS activation resulted in a decrease in LPS-induced expression and a secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref>). This effect was abrogated when the specific P2X7 receptor antagonist A438079 was used or when macrophages were isolated from <italic>P2rx7</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref>), thus suggesting that the P2X7 receptor was affecting LPS signaling in macrophages. LPS is not able to activate TLR4 in the absence of CD14 at the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pizzuto et al., 2018</xref>). By contrast, lipopolysaccharides with smaller hydrophilic moiety, like monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA), signals independently of CD14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maeshima and Fernandez, 2013</xref>). In order to investigate the role of P2X7 receptor-induced CD14 release in the reduction of LPS signaling, we tested whether also MPLA signaling was impaired by P2X7 receptor activation. When macrophages were stimulated with MPLA, the production of IL-6 and TNF-α was not affected when P2X7 receptor was activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c,d</xref>). This effect was similar when CD14 was blocked with a specific antibody; when this was done, it decreased the production of both cytokines after LPS was added to stimulate the macrophages but not when MPLA was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>).

In fact, the release of CD14 was independent on caspase-1 activity. Due to the heterogeneity of extracellular vesicle populations released from cells and the fact that the P2X7 receptor has been associated with the release of different extracellular vesicles such as microvesicles and exosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kowal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">MacKenzie et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Qu et al., 2009</xref>), our data supports that CD14 could be mainly a component of exosomes because CD14 largely appears associated with the high-speed pellet containing ‘small’ vesicles of ~160 nm. However, we could not rule out CD14 containing extracellular vesicles and exosomes may originate in the plasma membrane because there is a net reduction in plasma-membrane-associated CD14 and the presence of CD9 or IL-1β in this fraction has been correlated with both exosomes and plasma membrane-derived ‘small’ vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kowal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">MacKenzie et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Qu et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, the inflammasome deficiency does not affect the release of CD14, but it does decrease the amount of ‘small’ extracellular vesicles after P2X7 receptor activation, being this finding in accordance with a previous study demonstrating that NLRP3 impairs the release of exosomes from P2X7 receptor-activated dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Qu et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, it remains difficult to determine the exact nature of the extracellular vesicles containing CD14.</p><p>The release of CD14 occurred 5 min after stimulation in resting macrophages after brief activation of the P2X7 receptor. Under these circumstances, the NLRP3 inflammasome is not primed and therefore is not activated, thus protecting the cells from pyroptotic cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Broz et al., 2020</xref>). However, it has been recently described that prolonged P2X7 receptor activation would lead to apoptosis in resting macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bidula et al., 2019</xref>). The brief P2X7 receptor activation in resting macrophages with millimolar concentrations of ATP used in this study did not compromise cell viability and may resemble physiological conditions where ectonucleotidases provoke a fast ATP degradation in the extracellular milieu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eltzschig et al., 2012</xref>). Under these conditions, there is a reduction in the subsequent production of pro-inflammatory cytokines after a smooth LPS activation that requires CD14 to signal via the TLR4-MD2 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pizzuto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ryu et al., 2017</xref>). This suggests that the release of CD14 from macrophages impairs CD14 signaling, and probably also the translocation of TLR4 complex to endosomes, thus impairing TRAM-TRIF-dependent pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zanoni and Granucci, 2013</xref>). However, cytokine production was not affected when macrophages were treated with MPLA after P2X7 receptor activation, because MLPA does not require CD14 to signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jiang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maeshima and Fernandez, 2013</xref>). The reduction in cytokine production upon LPS-priming induced by initial P2X7 receptor activation in macrophages is additional to the effect we have described on the inflammasome activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Martínez-García et al., 2019</xref>), because NLRP3 activation was affected when macrophages were primed using both LPS and MLPA. All these suggest that brief P2X7 receptor activation before LPS priming has a widespread inhibitory effect on the pro-inflammatory functions of the macrophage, which includes reduced CD14 signaling and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. However, it should be noted that the stimulation of P2X7 receptor after LPS priming enhance the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Torre-Minguela et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Solle et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>When P2X7 receptor is absent or pharmacologically blocked, the reduced levels of circulating CD14 during sepsis is accompanied by an increase of cytokine release. Lower levels of cytokines were restored by the addition of recombinant CD14. This strongly suggests that the release of CD14 induced by P2X7 receptor during sepsis reduces the induction of cytokine by bacterial LPS, being in line with the fact that a reduced amount of CD14 at the plasma membrane impairs LPS and other PAMPs signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akashi-Takamura and Miyake, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baumann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Weber et al., 2012</xref>) and circulating CD14 binds LPS and impair its signaling from plasma membrane receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kitchens and Thompson, 2005</xref>).</p><p>CD14 release has been described during infection due to proteinase-dependent shedding; however, there is also a proteinase-independent CD14 release that is less well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). Our study demonstrates that the release of extracellular vesicles induced by P2X7 receptor activation is a pathway contributing to the extracellular pool of CD14. During sepsis, cell-free CD14 is present in serum and other body fluids and has been proposed as a marker for septic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bas et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>); in fact, the presence of CD14 in the blood has been validated by different studies as a valuable prognostic capacity to predict mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Behnes et al., 2014</xref>). CD14 increases in plasma during the first 24 hr after sepsis initiation and remains elevated at least during the first 8 days, conferring an exceptional long-term prognostic value over acute phase proteins or IL-6 that quickly decrease after 3–8 days of sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Behnes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Martínez-García et al., 2019</xref>). This is similar to the CLP model presented in this study, where while serum IL-6 concentration remains constant between 1 and 2 days of sepsis initiation, CD14 increased. Extracellular CD14 is required for host defense and in particular for bacterial clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Qin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Knapp et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sahay et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wieland et al., 2005</xref>), being necessary for phagocytosis of bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grunwald et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lingnau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schiff et al., 1997</xref>). Likewise, we found that P2X7 receptor deficiency or its pharmacological inhibition reduces CD14 in peritoneal lavage and serum when mice are subjected to a sepsis model. In these circumstances, there is an increase in bacterial dissemination that was controlled by the exogenous reconstitution of extracellular CD14. The decreased levels of CD14 in the infection foci of our model, the peritoneum of P2X7-deficient mice, could be then the cause of the increased to bacterial dissemination from peritoneum and infection of distant tissues and organs, thus compromising animal viability. This is in agreement with a previous study that found the P2X7 receptor to be important for bacterial clearance during sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Csóka et al., 2015</xref>). The dissemination of bacteria in the blood during sepsis exacerbates the immune response and leads to life-threatening complications, such as organ failure and ultimately death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barratt-Due et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>P2rx7</italic>-deficient mice present aggravated damage to different organs and premature deaths during sepsis and the administration of recombinant CD14 restores survival in the <italic>P2rx7</italic><sup>−/−</sup>genotype mice. This effect is similar to wild-type mice, where the administration of CD14 increases survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haziot et al., 1995</xref>). Therefore, P2X7 receptor-dependent release of CD14 seems to have a role in bacterial infection restraint, and while we studied CD14 release from macrophages, there are also reports indicating that non-hematopoietic cells such as epithelial or endothelial cells that also express the P2X7 receptor could release CD14, thus also influencing innate immune functions during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jersmann, 2005</xref>) and in turn restoring homeostatic conditions after sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zanoni and Granucci, 2013</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we have identified the release of CD14 by extracellular vesicles as part of the previously identified P2X7 receptor secretome of macrophages. The release of CD14 induced by the P2X7 receptor affects CD14 signaling in macrophages because the activation by smooth LPS was affected and fewer pro-inflammatory cytokines were produced. During sepsis, the elevation of CD14 levels in the serum and peritoneal lavage, also depended on the P2X7 receptor, were important in controlling cytokine secretion, restricting bacterial dissemination and organ damage, increasing overall survival. Therefore, circulating CD14 is not only a marker for sepsis but also an important component of the host’s innate immune system because the P2X7 receptor releases it in a regulated manner in order to control infection and increase survival during sepsis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>S. minnesota</italic>)</td><td>Monophosphoryl Lipid A (MPLA)</td><td>Invivogen</td><td>Cat#: tlrl-mpla</td><td>Cell culture: <break/>1 µg/mL</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>, male)</td><td>P2RX7-deficient <break/>mice (<italic>P2rx7<sup>-/-</sup></italic>)</td><td>Jackson laboratories</td><td>B6.129P2-<italic>P2rx7<sup>tm1Gab</sup></italic>/J</td><td>In vivo mouse models and biological samples. <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:005576">IMSR_JAX:005576</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-MMR (rat monoclonal, clone MR5D3)</td><td>Acris antibodies</td><td>Cat#:SM1857P</td><td>WB (1:1000), <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_1611247">AB_1611247</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-Cystatin B (rat monoclonal, clone 227818)</td><td>R&amp;D Systems</td><td>Cat#: MAB1409</td><td>WB (1:1000), <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2086095">AB_2086095</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-Cathepsin B (rat monoclonal, clone 173317)</td><td>R&amp;D Systems</td><td>Cat#: MAB965</td><td>WB (1:1000), <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2086935">AB_2086935</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase A (rabbit monoclonal)</td><td>Abcam</td><td>Cat#: ab41684</td><td>WB (1:1000), <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_879768">AB_879768</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>KiCqStart SYBR Green Primers</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td><italic>Tnfa</italic> <break/>(NM_013693) <break/><italic>Il-6</italic> <break/>(NM_031168) <break/><italic>Il1b</italic> <break/>(NM_008361)</td><td>qRT-PCR</td></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>Human sCD14 recombinant protein</td><td>Preprotech</td><td>Cat#: 110–01</td><td>In vivo: 10 µg/g <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2877062">AB_2877062</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay, kit</td><td>ExoQuick-TC ULTRA EV isolation kit</td><td>System Biosciences (SBI)</td><td>Cat#: EQULTRA-20TC-1</td><td>Extracellular vesicle isolation</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay, kit</td><td>Mouse CD14 DuoSet Elisa kit</td><td>R&amp;D Systems</td><td>Cat#:DY982</td><td>Detection of CD14 in biological fluids and culture supernatants. <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2877065">AB_2877065</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay, kit</td><td>Magnetic Luminex Assay</td><td>R&amp;D Systems</td><td>Cat#: <break/>LXSAMSM-15</td><td>Multiplex for mice serum</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>ATP</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>A2383-5G</td><td>Cell culture: <break/>3 mM <break/>For FACS: <break/>5 mM</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td>A438079</td><td>Tocris</td><td>Cat#: 2972</td><td>Cell culture: <break/>10–20 µM <break/>In vivo: <break/>100 µg/kg <break/>For FACS: <break/>10 µM</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>NTA 3.1 software</td><td>Nano Sight Technology</td><td>NS300 instrument</td><td>Nanoparticle tracking analysis, <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014239">SCR_014239</ext-link></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All experimental protocols for animal handling were refined and approved by the Animal Health Service of the General Directorate of Fishing and Farming of the Council of Murcia (<italic>Servicio de Sanidad Animal, Dirección General de Ganadería y Pesca, Consejería de Agricultura y Agua Región de Murcia,</italic> reference A1320140201).

The blood samples were obtained from septic individuals within 24 hr of the diagnosis of sepsis. The inclusion criteria for septic patients were patients diagnosed with intra-abdominal origin sepsis confirmed by exploratory laparotomy, with at least two diagnostic criteria for sepsis (fever or hypothermia; heart rate &gt;90 beats per minute; tachypnea, leukocytosis, or leukopenia) and multiple organ dysfunction defined as physiological dysfunction in two or more organs or organ systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Singer et al., 2016</xref>).

Mice serum and peritoneal lavages were collected and the concentration of IL-6 and CD14 was also tested by ELISA (R and D Systems). Results were read in a Synergy Mx (BioTek) plate reader. Multiplexing in mice serum for MCSF, CRP, RAGE, Resistin, VEGF, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, MIP-2, CCL2, CCL5, IL-1α, IL-5 and IL-10was performed using the Luminex color-coded superparamagnetic beads array from R and D Systems following the manufacturer indications, and the results were analyzed in a Bio-Rad Bio-Plex analyzer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 7 (Graph-Pad Software, Inc, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002798">SCR_002798</ext-link>). For two-group comparisons, the Mann-Whitney test was used and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted and the log-rank test was undertaken to determine the statistical significance. The χ<sup>2</sup> test was used to determine whether there was a significant difference between different clinical variables among groups of septic patients, except for age, where a one-way ANOVA test was used.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Evangelos J Giamarellos-Bourboulis as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Sebastian Weis (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>All three reviewers agreed that your manuscript includes novel data that establish a causal link between P2X7 receptor signaling, the release of CD14 and sepsis outcome. I attach the comments of the reviewers and I ask that you particularly revise and perform the additional experiments asked by the third reviewer (third comment).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is a fascinating manuscript on the interaction of CD14 and the P2X7 receptor to modulate survival and bacterial growth in sepsis.

I suggest that either the authors provide such data or that they omit all clinical information from the manuscript.</p><p>• The Discussion should be enriched with literature on the kinetics of sCD14 in human sepsis.</p><p>• The authors need to better address how they achieved quantitative bacterial culture of 6log10 in serum (Figure 5).

This work appears to tie several of these previous findings together in the context of sepsis. However, I do have several important issues, especially regarding the novelty of this study and the congruency of the present results with previous findings, that preclude publication of this work in its present form.</p><p>1) Many findings of the current work have been shown before.

The authors need to clearly highlight which findings of the current work are novel.</p><p>2) The authors report increased cytokine (TNF, IL-6) release in P2rx7- LPS/ATP-treated BMDMs compared with WT BMDMs (Figure 2A, B). In agreement, they demonstrate increased serum pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in P2rx7- mice subjected to CLP compared with WT CLP mice. However, these results appear to be in contrast to previous data from their own group (de Torre-Minguela et al., 2016), who report less cytokine production in P2rx7- BMDMs stimulated with LPS/ATP.

P2X7 receptor presents an increase in surface expression in septic patients.

New data is shown in Figure 3A and text:</p><p>“Similarly, the presence of P2X7 receptor in monocytes was also elevated in septic individuals (Figure 3A), in accordance to previous studies (Martínez-García et al., 2019).”</p><p>We also describe the method in the subsection “Flow cytometry”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The Discussion should be enriched with literature on the kinetics of sCD14 in human sepsis.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now increased the Discussion with references about sCD14 in human sepsis, as in the last few years, the relevance of circulating CD14 in human sepsis has been widely investigated.

We dispense 100µL (of different serum dilutions) in Luria-Bertani (LB) agar (growth medium) and we distributed the sample with a sterile Drigalski spatula until the inoculum is fully dispersed on the agar surface. Plates are incubated (37ºC for 24h) until colony forming units (CFUs) were evident. We counted the CFUs in the various dilutions and we only use the plates in which separate colonies were obtained (maximum of 200 CFUs/plate). Then we calculated the bacterial load by multiplying CFUs to the corresponding dilution and divided by the volume inoculated to obtain CFUs/mL. We have now added a better description to the Materials and methods subsection “Quantification of bacterial colony forming units (CFU)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• What types of bacteria were isolated in tissues and peritoneal lavage?

In base to the literature the CLP model induces the dissemination of different types of enteric bacteria (mainly <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>) and we now present data of the type of bacteria isolated from the blood of intra-abdominal sepsis origin patients included in this study (see updated Supplementary file 1—table 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>With interest, I reviewed the manuscript by Alarcón-Vila et al., who investigated the role of the P2X7 receptor in the release of CD14 in extracellular vesicles and its role in the septic immune response and bacterial dissemination.

Moreover, we also found that the treatment of mice with soluble recombinant CD14 resulted in increase of survival, opening the possibility of new therapeutic avenues for sepsis. We have better highlighted this in the Abstract:</p><p>“Here we show for first time that P2X7 receptor induces the release of CD14 in extracellular vesicles, resulting in a net reduction in macrophage plasma membrane CD14 that functionally affects LPS, but not monophosphoryl lipid A, pro-inflammatory cytokine production.”</p><p>End of Introduction:</p><p>“In this study, we found for first time that CD14 is a cargo of extracellular vesicles released by P2X7 receptor activation and functionally that the lack of cellular CD14 compromises the production of macrophage pro-inflammatory cytokines.

How can the authors reconcile their current findings with these previous studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the point raised by the reviewer, in Figure 2A and B, we found that both treatments with LPS alone or stimulation with ATP and then with LPS resulted in increased TNFa and IL-6 production as the reviewer point out. We would like to highlight and clarify the point of this study, as in Figure 2A, B ATP was added before LPS, in contraposition with our own previous study (de Torre-Minguela et al., 2016) as well as Solle et al., 2001, where ATP was added <bold>after</bold> LPS priming. When P2X7 receptor is triggered by ATP before LPS, then CD14 shedding impairs optimal LPS priming, this is reverted in P2X7-KO macrophages, that eventually, potential autocrine P2X7 activation during cellular plating and previous to LPS application, could be slightly impairing cytokine production. We have indicated this peculiarity in the different panels of the Figure 2, as “ATP (pre LPS)”, and better explain this in the modified manuscript:</p><p>“Treatment of macrophages with extracellular ATP and then subjected to LPS activation resulted in a decrease in LPS-induced expression and a secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α”</p><p>“The reduction in cytokine production upon LPS-priming induced by initial P2X7 receptor activation in macrophages is additional to the effect we have described on the inflammasome activation (Martínez-García et al., 2019),”</p><p>“However, it should be noted that the stimulation of P2X7 receptor after LPS priming enhance the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (de Torre-Minguela et al., 2016; Solle et al., 2001).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 1B, the authors show that the LPS/ATP-induced release of extracellular CD14 by BMDMs can be counteracted by a P2X7 receptor antagonist. The authors should perform the same experiment in P2rx7- BMDMs to confirm that CD14 release is truly p2Rx7-dependent. They clearly have access to these cells (see Figures 2-6).</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have now confirmed data obtained with P2X7 receptor antagonist using P2X7-KO macrophages. Please see new data on Figure 1B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) How do the authors reconcile the findings in Figure 2F (coincubation with ATP strongly reduces LPS-induced IL-1β production by BMDMs) with those of Netea et al. (Blood 2009), who demonstrate that LPS alone is not sufficient for robust IL-1β production by macrophages, but that this response necessitates costimulation with ATP?</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry for this misinterpretation, in Figure 2F the release of IL-1b was induced by nigericin treatment after LPS, this was specified in the figure legend but not in the histogram. Now we indicate this in the Figure 2F histogram to avoid misinterpretation.</p><p>Nigericin is a K<sup>+</sup> ionophore widely used to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome (for review about nigericin induced NLRP3 see i.e. Próchnicki et al., F1000Research PMID: 27508077). Therefore, our data are in agreement with Netea et al., 2009 and many other studies (including our previous publications), where LPS alone does not induce IL-1b release, instead it requires a two-step model: first an LPS priming and then a second step with nigericin (or ATP) to induce NLRP3 activation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Figure 3B, there is still a lot of CD14 shedding in P2rx7- mice, what is the alternative mechanism?</p></disp-quote><p>During the complex scenario of the CLP model, there are multiple different pathways triggered besides P2X7 receptor activation, it is normal to expect that some of these pathways could be also contributing to extracellular CD14 in biological fluids as serum and in the peritoneal cavity. In fact, proteinase-dependent CD14 release has been described during infection (Wu et al., 2019). However, since the ‘90s other proteinase-independent pathways for circulating CD14 are known to exist but never described in detail (Wright et al., 1990, PMID: 1698311). Our study demonstrates for first time that the P2X7 receptor is one pathway responsible to induce extracellular CD14 in vivo during infection. This was commented in the Discussion:</p><p>“CD14 release has been described during infection due to proteinase dependent shedding; however, there is also a proteinase-independent CD14 release that is less well understood (Wu et al., 2019). Our study demonstrates that the release of extracellular vesicles induced by P2X7 receptor activation is a pathway contributing to the extracellular pool of CD14.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
