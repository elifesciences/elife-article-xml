In turn, contractions change membrane tension and impact ion channels. VGICs are mechanosensitive, but the mechanisms of mechanosensitivity remain poorly understood. Here, we leverage the relative simplicity of NaChBac, a prokaryotic voltage-gated sodium channel from <italic>Bacillus halodurans</italic>, to investigate mechanosensitivity. In whole-cell experiments on heterologously transfected HEK293 cells, shear stress reversibly altered the kinetic properties of NaChBac and increased its maximum current, comparably to the mechanosensitive eukaryotic sodium channel Na<sub>V</sub>1.5. In single-channel experiments, patch suction reversibly increased the open probability of a NaChBac mutant with inactivation removed. A simple kinetic mechanism featuring a mechanosensitive pore opening transition explained the overall response to force, whereas an alternative model with mechanosensitive voltage sensor activation diverged from the data. Structural analysis of NaChBac identified a large displacement of the hinged intracellular gate, and mutagenesis near the hinge diminished NaChBac mechanosensitivity, further supporting the proposed mechanism. Our results suggest that NaChBac is overall mechanosensitive due to the mechanosensitivity of a voltage-insensitive gating step associated with the pore opening. This mechanism may apply to eukaryotic VGICs, including Na<sub>V</sub>1.5.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sodium channel</kwd><kwd>mechanosensitivity</kwd><kwd>patch-clamp</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NIDDK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK052766</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Farrugia</surname><given-names>Gianrico</given-names></name><name><surname>Beyder</surname><given-names>Arthur</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NIDDK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK123549</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beyder</surname><given-names>Arthur</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>NIH</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AT010875</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beyder</surname><given-names>Arthur</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Force applied to the cell membrane reversibly changes a voltage-insensitive gating step of a prokaryotic voltage-gated sodium channel.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Electrically excitable tissues with mechanical functions like the heart and gut using VGICs to generate electrical activity, which drives mechanical activity via electro-mechanical coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hille, 2001</xref>). Conversely, mechanical movements change membrane tension and impact electrical function in a process called mechano-electrical feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kohl et al., 2005</xref>), which relies on specialized mechanically-gated ion channels, such as TREK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brohawn et al., 2014</xref>) and Piezo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ranade et al., 2015</xref>). However, studies dating back nearly 40 years suggest that VGICs are also mechanosensitive and thus may directly contribute to mechano-electrical feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Conti et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Conti et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Strege et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Terakawa, 1983</xref>). Indeed, most VGIC families display mechanosensitivity, including sodium (Na<sub>V</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Morris and Juranka, 2007</xref>), potassium (K<sub>V</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>), calcium (Ca<sub>V</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Farrugia et al., 1999</xref>), proton (H<sub>V</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pathak et al., 2016</xref>), and cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lin et al., 2007</xref>) channels. An important mechanistic advance was made in a recent study that showed that Kv channels are exquisitely mechanosensitive in their opening transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Mechano-electrical feedback via VGICs can play a distinct physiological role. Unlike the specialized mechano-gated channels whose activation is generally voltage-insensitive, mechanosensitive VGICs create a âvoltage-informedâ mechano-electrical feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gaub et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hao et al., 2013</xref>). Perhaps the best example is the voltage-gated sodium channel Na<sub>V</sub>1.5, responsible for the upstroke of cardiac action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gellens et al., 1992</xref>). Given the heartâs role as a pump, Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 is a natural target for mechanosensitivity investigations, and several studies showed that macroscopic Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 currents are mechanosensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beyder et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Morris and Juranka, 2007</xref>). Interestingly, disease-associated Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 mutations (channelopathies) can affect mechanosensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banderali et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Beyder et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Strege et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, lipid-permeable anesthetics and amphipathic drugs such as ranolazine that target Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 inhibit its mechanosensitivity, often with little effect on its voltage-dependent gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beyder et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Beyder et al., 2012b</xref>). Despite this abundant phenomenological evidence, it is unclear whether mechanosensitivity is intrinsic to the channel or emerges through interactions with other factors, and the mechanism of mechanosensitivity in Na<sub>V</sub> channels remains unknown.</p><p>Na<sub>V</sub> channels operate through a complex gating mechanism, where the voltage-dependent movement of the four voltage sensors can trigger a voltage-independent physical opening of the intracellular gate in the pore, immediately followed by a fast and thorough inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Patlak, 1991</xref>). Whether applied by fluid shear stress or membrane stretch, mechanical force alters the overall voltage sensitivity of macroscopic Na<sub>V</sub> currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beyder et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Morris and Juranka, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Strege et al., 2003</xref>), but we do not know how each gating transition is influenced by force. In principle, this information could be extracted by analyzing the response of single-channel events or macroscopic currents to mechanical stimuli, as recently shown for K<sub>V</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>). However, the complexities of the eukaryotic Na<sub>V</sub> channel structure, together with its fast activation and inactivation kinetics, would make this mechanistic analysis more challenging.</p><p>An alternative strategy is to use bacterial voltage-gated sodium channels, which have emerged as powerful models for eukaryotic Na<sub>V</sub>s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">BagnÃ©ris et al., 2014</xref>). Like their eukaryotic counterparts, prokaryotic Na<sub>V</sub>s are strongly voltage-sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ren et al., 2001</xref>), have similar pharmacological sensitivities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al., 2012b</xref>), and share some structural elements despite being homotetramers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">BagnÃ©ris et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Catterall and Zheng, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al., 2012b</xref>). NaChBac from <italic>B. halodurans</italic> is the first prokaryotic Na<sub>V</sub> channel discovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ren et al., 2001</xref>) and presents significant advantages for mechanistic studies: at one-fourth the coding sequence length of eukaryotic Na<sub>V</sub>s, NaChBac has simpler mutagenesis, structural symmetry, and thus potentially simpler gating, slower kinetics, and removable inactivation, which altogether facilitate detailed mechanistic investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al., 2012b</xref>). In this study, we examined the mechanism of NaChBac mechanosensitivity through a combination of macroscopic and single-channel recordings, kinetic modeling, structural analysis, and mutagenesis, and found that mechanosensitivity is intrinsic and likely resides with the channel pore.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mechanical stimulation of bacterial voltage-gated sodium channels</title><p>We first tested if prokaryotic sodium channels are mechanically sensitive, as previously shown for eukaryotic Na<sub>V</sub>s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beyder et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Morris and Juranka, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Strege et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

Together with rapid channel kinetics, these limitations have traditionally prevented single-channel studies on mechanosensitivity in VGICs. After careful mechanical and electrical optimization, despite the low signal-to-noise ratio typical for sodium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vandenberg and Bezanilla, 1991</xref>), and the noise introduced by the pressure clamp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1G</xref>), we were able to resolve single-channel events across a physiologically relevant voltage range, and with enough bandwidth (~1 kHz) to capture sufficiently fast kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p>Suction on the membrane patch exerts a mechanical force on the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Coste et al., 2010</xref>). Because patches have non-zero resting tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Suchyna et al., 2009</xref>), we designed stimulation protocols to test voltage- and mechano-sensitivity in a pairwise fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), enabling us to assess mechanosensitivity from the difference between the suction-induced currents and the no-suction baseline, for all channels and traces. Under these conditions, a non-zero patch tension is expected to slightly bias the kinetic properties at rest but not obscure the magnitude and location of mechanosensitive steps within the gating mechanism. Within each 400ms voltage step from â100 to â20 mV, the suction pressure alternated between 0 and â10, â30, or â50 mmHg. Thus, we could obtain and compare control and pressure data in the same cell, using test pressures relevant to mechanosensitive channel function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Coste et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gottlieb et al., 2012</xref>). As indicated by the current amplitude histograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), the single-channel current is less than 0.5 pA at â20 mV, but we could still separate the closed and open levels. Above â20 mV, the unitary current became too small for reliable analysis. Using a half-amplitude threshold method, we measured open-state occupancy between â100 and â20 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We cross-checked this approach against fitting all-point amplitude histograms with sums of two Gaussian distributions, one for each current level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), where the relative weight of the open-level Gaussian indicates the open-state occupancy probability (P<sub>O</sub>). The two methods produced similar results.</p><p>Under control conditions (zero applied patch pressure), P<sub>O</sub> was strongly voltage-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2AâC</xref>), as predicted by the whole-cell activation curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). P<sub>O</sub> was nominally zero at â80 mV and below, and P<sub>O</sub> increased as the voltage became more positive, reaching 0.525 at â20 mV. Relative to whole-cell activation, the P<sub>O</sub> curve is shallower and ~20 mV more positive. This discrepancy is likely an artifact of a scattered and non-zero resting potential, unmeasurable in cell-attached recordings (averaging sigmoid curves with a scattered and shifted midpoint results in a shallower and shifted sigmoid).</p><p>Patch suction altered the voltage-dependent P<sub>O</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2AâC</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). At extremely negative voltages (â100 and â80 mV), where the channel is closed under control conditions, P<sub>O</sub> remained zero under suction. However, pressure significantly increased P<sub>O</sub> at more positive voltages. Responses were dependent on suction strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>), but even at high negative pressures (â30 and â50 mmHg), the induced changes were confined to the voltage activation range (â80 to â20 mV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). These results agree with the whole-cell experiments, where shear stress stretched the curve vertically. As single-channel data yield the actual P<sub>O</sub> values under different pressures and voltages, we could establish that the increase in whole-cell conductance results from an increase in P<sub>O</sub> and not in single-channel conductance, which remained constant under pressure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Effect of pressure on the open probability of mutants D93A and I228G in the T220A NaChBac background.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Voltage</th><th align="left" valign="bottom" colspan="3">T220A background</th><th align="left" valign="bottom" colspan="3">D93A</th><th align="left" valign="bottom" colspan="3">I228G</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">(<bold>mV</bold>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Control</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Pressure</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Difference</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Control</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Pressure</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Difference</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Control</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Pressure</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Difference</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>â100</bold></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.023Â±0.013</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.028Â±0.014</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.004Â±0.002</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.079Â±0.022</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.109Â±0.062</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.030Â±0.043</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.021Â±0.009</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.019Â±0.008</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">â0.002Â±0.001</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>â80</bold></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.019Â±0.005</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.024Â±0.009</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.005Â±0.005</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.135Â±0.023</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.237Â±0.048<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table2fn2">*</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.103Â±0.037<sup><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table2fn3">â </xref></sup></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.028Â±0.020</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.032Â±0.019</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.003Â±0.002</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>â60</bold></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.176Â±0.044</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.271Â±0.069</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.096Â±0.043</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.471Â±0.082</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.554Â±0.080<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table2fn2">*</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.082Â±0.014</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.100Â±0.033</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.114Â±0.036</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.014Â±0.011<sup><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table2fn3">â </xref></sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>â40</bold></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.353Â±0.071</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.443Â±0.070<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table2fn2">*</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.090Â±0.025</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.657Â±0.051</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.665Â±0.045</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.008Â±0.023<sup><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table2fn3">â </xref></sup></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.379Â±0.062</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.391Â±0.066</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.012Â±0.011<sup><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table2fn3">â </xref></sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>â20</bold></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.525Â±0.067</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.551Â±0.070<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table2fn2">*</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.026Â±0.010</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.638Â±0.011</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.611Â±0.015</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">â0.027Â±0.016<sup><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table2fn3">â </xref></sup></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.537Â±0.069</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.524Â±0.067</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">â0.012Â±0.010</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Open probability;

If it did, we would see openings at voltages where the channel is typically closed, provided that we applied enough membrane tension. Instead, we see that force enhances openings (increases P<sub>O</sub>) that are already driven by membrane depolarization. A simple interpretation is that force does not create additional conformational states but modifies the energetics of the existing transitions. If this is true, then force will interact with at least one mechanistic component: (1) voltage sensor activation, (2) pore opening, or (3) inactivation. It seems to us that inactivation is unlikely to play a significant role. First, NaChBac T220A responds to patch pressure like the wild type does, even though the mutant virtually lacks inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). Second, eukaryotic Na<sub>V</sub> and wild-type NaChBac have similar responses to shear stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>), even though they inactivate via different mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gamal El-Din et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, the effects of force on inactivation could simply be due to the coupling of inactivation to activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aldrich et al., 1983</xref>). For these reasons, we focus here on the NaChBac T220A channels, which show minimal inactivation.</p><p>The remaining possibilities are that force interacts with (1) the voltage sensors or (2) the pore. While not necessarily mutually exclusive, the two extreme models corresponding to these interactions are easier to formulate and discriminate than mixed models. Hence, we examined the specific changes in kinetic properties driven by force and compared them against model predictions. We first formulated a kinetic model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) that encapsulates the homo-tetrameric nature of NaChBac T220A, its voltage-dependent activation, and its lack of inactivation. We made the rates along the activation pathway (closed states C<sub>1</sub> to C<sub>5</sub>) strongly voltage-dependent to agree with the whole-cell and single-channel activation curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2C</xref>).

With the MSA model, we can explain this result by ascribing positive tension sensitivity (i.e. negative pressure sensitivity) to the activation (forward) rates and/or negative tension sensitivity to the deactivation (backward) rates. A situation where both activation and deactivation rates have positive or negative tension sensitivities is also acceptable, as long as the forward sensitivities are more positive than the backward ones.</p><p>The MSA model predicts that the activation curve shifts toward more negative voltages when tension increases, but its slope and maximum value remain precisely the same (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, MSA). The activation midpoint would change because tension shifts the equilibrium of each activation step (C<sub>1</sub> to C<sub>5</sub>) toward C<sub>5</sub> at any given voltage. In contrast, the slope and maximum P<sub>O</sub> would be unchanged by tension because they are determined by the voltage sensitivity of activation and by the voltage- and force-independent opening transition (C<sub>5</sub> to O<sub>6</sub>), respectively. In other words, extreme tension would push the channel to reside in the C<sub>5</sub> and O<sub>6</sub> states, but the equilibrium between these two states â and hence maximum P<sub>O</sub> â would remain the same. However, we did not observe this behavior experimentally. Instead, when membrane tension increased, both the whole-cell activation curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and the P<sub>O</sub> curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) exhibited increased steepness and greater maximum value.

The maximum P<sub>O</sub> would change because it is determined by the tension-dependent pore opening rates, but why would the voltage activation curve shift and steepen under tension, when the tension-dependent rates are voltage-insensitive? The reason is that voltage acts through the voltage-dependent activation/deactivation rates to increase the joint occupancy of the final two states, C<sub>5</sub> and O<sub>6</sub>, while tension acts through the tension-dependent opening rates to increase the occupancy of the open state O<sub>6</sub>. Thus, under tension, an increase in voltage will lead to a proportionately larger increase in P<sub>O</sub>, compared to zero-tension conditions, and cause a shift in the activation curve, increased steepness, and a greater maximum value. Indeed, the MSO model supports the mechanically-induced changes in the whole-cell and single-channel activation curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>, MSO).</p><p>Having examined the changes in P<sub>O</sub> vs. voltage under different pressure values, we conversely examined P<sub>O</sub> vs. tension under different voltages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Reversing voltage and tension as independent variables does not create new information, as we are using the same data points as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, but it makes it easier to judge the fitness of each model. Thus, the MSA model predicts a significant shift in the P<sub>O</sub> vs. tension curve when the voltage increases but no change in the maximum value and the slope of the curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, MSA). In contrast, the MSO model predicts a significant change in the maximum value and the slope but only a small shift in the curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, MSO). The experimental P<sub>O</sub> data points align well with either the MSA or the MSO model at zero pressure. However, the MSO model becomes a significantly better match to the data as the pressure increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Mechanical force destabilizes the NaChBac closed state</title><p>The analysis so far clearly favors the MSO model. However, we used only the steady-state information in the data, and we do not know if the MSO model can also explain the observed kinetics. The MSO model assumes tension-dependent opening and closing rates (at least one, if not both), whereas the MSA model assumes these rates to be tension-independent. If the pore opening transition were tension-dependent, then the pore opening (C<sub>5</sub> to O<sub>6</sub>) and/or the closing (O<sub>6</sub> to C<sub>5</sub>) rate would be affected by force, which would be reflected in the single-channel closed and open lifetimes. In our simple NaChBac kinetic model, the open state lifetime distribution has only one component, with the time constant equal to the inverse of the closing rate constant (O<sub>6</sub> to C<sub>5</sub>). In contrast, the closed-state lifetime distribution has five components, without an easy way to isolate the opening rate constant. However, the deactivation rates are likely so small at extremely depolarizing voltages (e.g. â¥â20 mV) that the channel essentially flickers between the last two states (C<sub>5</sub> and O<sub>6</sub>). Hence, as an approximation, the closed lifetime distribution has only one component at these extreme voltages, with a time constant that approaches the inverse of the opening rate constant (C<sub>5</sub> to O<sub>6</sub>). Consequently, a truncated model with only the final two states would approximate the channel at â20 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p>Because NaChBac T220A has some residual inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1E, J</xref>), we used relatively short (200â500 ms) voltage/pressure stimulation episodes, so many recorded traces contained no events. To fit the single-channel data with the MIL algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Qin et al., 1996</xref>), we had to discard the first and last dwells in each trace because they are by necessity truncated and cannot be used for analysis, which means that all the eventless traces were also discarded. Under these conditions, the remaining traces that are suitable for analysis would slightly bias the estimated rates because of the inherently higher P<sub>O</sub>. Nevertheless, the mechanosensitivity of the opening and closing rates should emerge clearly from this analysis. As a verification, we also performed the analysis with the model parameters constrained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Navarro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Salari et al., 2018</xref>) to enforce a ratio between the opening and closing rate constants corresponding to the P<sub>O</sub> measured under control (zero added tension) conditions, and also to enforce the total pressure sensitivity, which can be reliably estimated from the P<sub>O</sub> data. The results obtained with these parameter constraints were similar to those obtained in the constraint-free analysis.</p><p>The closed state lifetime distribution shifts toward shorter dwell times by 15% under â10 mmHg pressure (k<sub>O</sub>: 124.9 Â± 5.7 s<sup>â1</sup> at 0 mmHg to 144.4 Â± 6.6 s<sup>â1</sup> at â10 mmHg; n=124 traces from 10 patches) and by 21% under â50 mmHg pressure (k<sub>O</sub>: 178.2 Â± 11.9 s<sup>â1</sup> at 0 mmHg to 217.0 Â± 14.7 s<sup>â1</sup> at â50 mmHg; n=23 traces from three patches) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). The average closed lifetime approaches the bandwidth limit (~1 ms) and, even though the fitting algorithm partially compensates for the missed events, itâs possible that the increase in the opening rate with pressure is underestimated. In contrast, the open state distribution remained virtually unchanged by tension under â10 mmHg pressure (k<sub>C</sub>: 48.1 Â± 2.2 s<sup>â1</sup> to â48.2 Â± 2.3 s<sup>â1</sup>), although it shifts toward longer dwell times under â50 mmHg (k<sub>C</sub>: 101.4 Â± 6.8 s<sup>â1</sup> to â87.5 Â± 6.1 s<sup>â1</sup>).</p><p>The observed shift in the closed state lifetimes further confirms that the channel is better represented by the MSO model, as the competing MSA model would exhibit no such shift at saturating voltages. Moreover, it suggests that force destabilizes the closed state, as the opening rate changes the most with tension. As we now have an idea about the magnitude of opening and closing dwell times, we can also examine activation kinetics. In principle, we can extract this information by fitting the single-channel data recorded at intermediate voltages (e.g. â60 mV), where the channel visits all states. However, the changes in voltage and pressure stimuli make these data non-stationary, and a more straightforward approach is to examine the macroscopic data created by averaging the single-channel recordings. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, the MSO model captures well the time course of the average current and gives us an idea about the magnitude of the activation rates. In all, our modeling of the whole-cell and single channel results suggest that the MSO model, which assigns tension sensitivity to the voltage-insensitive pore opening step, best fits the experimental data and associates the NaChBac mechanosensor with the pore structure.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Pressure may affect the stability of the intracellular gate</title><p>According to the âforce-from-lipidâ model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Martinac et al., 1990</xref>), ion channels gain mechanosensitivity when their cross-section expands or shrinks upon a conformational change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Perozo et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sachs and Morris, 1998</xref>).

Interestingly, previous structural modeling studies have predicted that when voltage sensors are suitably activated, mechanical energy is required to open the gate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fowler and Sansom, 2013</xref>), which implies that negative membrane tension (i.e. patch suction) would facilitate opening.

Because S6 helices move and open the pore only after voltage sensors activate, it follows that mechanosensitivity, which is associated with S6 movement, resides with the pore opening (C<sub>5</sub> to O<sub>6</sub> in the MSO model) and not with the voltage sensor activation (C<sub>1</sub> to C<sub>5</sub> in the MSA model). This interpretation agrees with the MSO model, with one potential caveat being that Na<sub>V</sub>Ab as a closed channel could represent other closed states along the activation pathway, rather than the fully activated closed conformation (C<sub>5</sub> in the MSO model). As a result, a mechanosensitive transition could still occur before the pore opening. In other words, although the pore opening is likely mechanosensitive, it might not be the only mechanosensitive transition, based solely on these structural models.</p><p>If mechanosensitivity were built into the pore opening, altering S6 lateral movement via mutagenesis would alter the effects of patch suction on P<sub>O</sub>. However, if voltage sensor activation were additionally mechanosensitive, then voltage sensor mutagenesis would only change the response to suction but not eliminate it. We tested these ideas via site-directed mutagenesis within the S6 hinge and the voltage sensor, using NaChBac T220A as background. Most mutations we tried within the pore resulted in non-expressing or non-functional channels, but we eventually settled on I228G in the S6 hinge region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Within the voltage sensor, we chose D93A to stabilize the sensor in the resting position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">DeCaen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We applied the same single-channel experimental paradigms to directly compare the double mutants (NaChBac T220A plus I228G or D93A) with the T220A results described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p>The voltage sensor NaChBac T220A+D93A double mutant shifted its voltage sensitivity relative to T220A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). However, its mechanosensitivity remained intact and followed the negative shift of voltage-dependent gating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). The pore NaChBac T220A+I228G double mutant channel exhibits some interesting properties. First, the channel could gate normally with voltage, like the single mutant controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Second, the effect of membrane tension on P<sub>O</sub> was nearly eliminated at all pressures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Thus, at â60 mV, membrane tension increased P<sub>O</sub> by 0.096 for the NaChBac T220A mutant but only by 0.014 for NaChBac T220A+I228G, corresponding to an approximate sevenfold difference in effects between the two mutants. At â40 mV, the difference was similar (~sevenfold): 0.090 with NaChBac T220A and only 0.012 with NaChBac T220A+I228G. We could explain the small remaining effect of tension on P<sub>O</sub> in the double mutant in two ways: either there is a partial displacement of S6 during pore opening and a resulting (smaller) cross-section expansion, or there is another (weakly) mechanosensitive transition in the gating mechanism. The first possibility seems more plausible, because some degree of S6 displacement is probably necessary for channel opening, and also because NaChBac T220A+D93A maintained a tension sensitivity similar to NaChBac T220A, even though its voltage sensitivity shifted by more than â30 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Overall, these mutagenesis results provide experimental evidence that strengthens our conclusion that mechanical forces interact primarily with the pore opening transition.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Electrically excitable cells depend on concerted efforts by VGICs to detect small changes in transmembrane voltage and amplify them to produce a wide range of action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hodgkin and Huxley, 1952</xref>). Some electrical organs, such as the heart, bladder, and gut, function primarily as mechanical pumps, using excitation-contraction coupling to drive muscle contractions.

Here, we used the relatively simple bacterial voltage-gated sodium channel NaChBac as a model, because it shares crucial structural and functional elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">BagnÃ©ris et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ren et al., 2001</xref>) with the more complex eukaryotic voltage-gated sodium channels (Na<sub>V</sub>s). We found that NaChBac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ren et al., 2001</xref>) is mechanosensitive, and, impressively, the mechanosensitive responses of NaChBac closely resemble those of Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), with force increasing the peak currents and accelerating the kinetics. These effects are consistent with previous studies using macroscopic currents to examine mechanosensitivity in eukaryotic Na<sub>V</sub>s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beyder et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Morris and Juranka, 2007</xref>) and other VGICs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Calabrese et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>), which further strengthens NaChBac as a model for studying eukaryotic VGICs. In response to physiological levels of mechanical stimuli traditionally used to stimulate a mechano-gated ion channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kefauver et al., 2020</xref>), NaChBac channels substantially increased their activity in a voltage-dependent manner, in both macroscopic and single-channel preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Force produced a rise in the peak current evoked by depolarizing the membrane to activate the channels. However, without membrane depolarization, force alone could not open NaChBac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), suggesting that mechanical force does not create new conformational states but rather impacts a single transition along the gating pathway. While whole-cell experiments proved informative, single-channel studies were required to more directly test our hypotheses.</p><p>We removed NaChBac inactivation (NaChBac T220A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al., 2012b</xref>), which allowed us to zoom in on the mechanosensitivity of voltage-dependent activation. Using the NaChBac T220A mutant, along with technical optimizations and a paired-stimulus configuration that controlled for the known resting elevated mechanical tension in patch bilayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Opsahl and Webb, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Suchyna et al., 2009</xref>), we were able to resolve sub-pA NaChBac events with mechanical stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Patch suction modified NaChBac voltage-gating, reversibly increasing NaChBac voltage-dependent open probability (P<sub>O</sub>) in a dose-dependent fashion. This effect was indeed state-dependent, suggesting that applied forces have a state-specific effect on the Na<sub>V</sub> channel, where the added mechanical energy appears to modify the energy landscape of gating but does not overcome voltage-gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fowler and Sansom, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sigg and Bezanilla, 2003</xref>).</p><p>To explain NaChBac mechanosensitivity, we favor a âmechanosensitive openingâ mechanism (the MSO model), rather than a âmechanosensitive activationâ (the MSA model). The MSO model features pore opening as one strongly mechanosensitive transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and is consistent with the previous findings in K<sub>V</sub> channels, where mechanosensitivity was examined in macroscopic currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>). Considering the simplicity of our MSO model, it is remarkable how well it could fit both whole-cell and single-channel data, under a fairly broad range of voltage and pressure values. The critical discriminator between the two competing models is the force-induced change in the macroscopic and single-channel voltage-dependent activation curves, i.e., increased maximum response and slope. The observed effects are by far better explained by the MSO model. The MSO model also accounts for the pressure-induced changes in pore opening kinetics, projecting that at maximally activating voltages, patch suction may shorten the closed state lifetimes and may destabilize the closed state. At higher pressure, patch suction may additionally lengthen the open-state lifetimes. While the structures responsible for voltage and force sensitivity may be distinct and function independently, from a kinetic mechanism standpoint, voltage and force sensitivities are state-dependent and intertwined: voltage acts on states C<sub>1</sub> through C<sub>5</sub>, whereas tension acts on states C<sub>5</sub> and O<sub>6</sub>. Consequently, channels must first activate by voltage before responding to tension. While simplified, this model captures the essence of the VGIC function and can apply to both prokaryotic and eukaryotic sodium channels.</p><p>By comparing the closed and open bacterial Na<sub>V</sub> crystal structures, we identified the intracellular gate as the site where the most extensive cross-section area changes occur during the transition from closed to open (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lenaeus et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McCusker et al., 2012</xref>). The bottom halves of S6 form the intracellular gate, working like hinges on a door latched by non-covalent interactions. Functional and modeling studies support the <italic>swinging door</italic> model: targeting S6 residues around the poreâs hinge impedes gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Webster et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Woolfson et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhao et al., 2004</xref>), and pore opening leads to a physical expansion of the inner leaflet, suggesting a significant area expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beyder and Sachs, 2009</xref>). Consistent with these studies, electrophysiology and modeling show that S6 in the pore stores the mechanical energy of gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fowler and Sansom, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Long et al., 2005</xref>). We targeted sites separately to differentiate between the effects of force on voltage sensors from those on the pore. The S4 positively charged residues that sense voltage are stabilized in the resting state within the lipid bilayer by counterbalancing acidic (negatively charged) residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">DeCaen et al., 2009</xref>). By mutating one of these acidic residues (D93), the half-activation and half-inactivation voltages shifted negative, but the channel maintained its responsiveness to patch pressure, confirming that voltage sensors do not significantly contribute to mechanosensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Our functional data suggested that S6, forming a highly conserved component of the intracellular gate, might influence NaChBac mechanosensitivity. After many mutants turned out to be non-functional, we eventually identified and mutated a conserved hydrophobic residue, I228, located in the S6 lining the channel pore. I228G eliminated the response to pressure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The dramatic loss of I228G NaChBac mechanosensitivity suggests a loss of pressure sensitivity in the final opening step. However, it is also possible that the overall gating scheme for I228G NaChBac changed compared to its T220A background, leading to a loss of apparent dependence on the pressure-sensitive opening step. Thus, these results agree with structural and functional data showing significant in-plane area expansion during channel gating, support the <italic>swinging door</italic> model of VGIC pore gating, and suggest that force and voltage cooperate to gate NaChBac.</p><p>Since broad structural aspects of the intracellular gate appear conserved across VGICs, from prokaryotes to eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">BagnÃ©ris et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shaya et al., 2014</xref>), we surmise that VGIC mechanosensitivity may be a generalizable, ubiquitous property, that can be observed across many families of VGICs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Morris, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>) and across each phylum, including unicellular to complex multicellular organisms.

For the tensed bilayer to perform work (Fâd) on the channel, conformational transitions leading to the open state must associate with in-plane area expansion during the opening, and with area contraction during closing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sachs and Morris, 1998</xref>). Bilayers self-assemble to minimize contact between lipid tails and water molecules. However, despite the minimization of free energy in assembled bilayers, the physical and energetic differences between phospholipid headgroups and lipid tails produce substantial intrinsic lateral forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cantor, 1997</xref>), reaching 1000 atm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gullingsrud and Schulten, 2004</xref>).

Specialized mechano-gated ion channels are logical candidates to take advantage of this physical arrangement, and indeed they leverage forces developed at the protein-lipid interface for their <italic>force-from-lipid</italic> gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cox et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kefauver et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Martinac et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Perozo et al., 2002b</xref>).

Lack of voltage or pressure dependence was encoded by setting <italic>k</italic><sub>v</sub> or <italic>k</italic><sub>p</sub> to zero. The rates along the activation pathway were in the expected 4:3:2:1 ratio (e.g. <italic>k</italic><sub>23</sub>=2 Ã <italic>k</italic><sub>45</sub>). The parameters of the model were tweaked by hand to match the macroscopic and single-channel data, collected within our unique experimental configuration defined above by the pipette geometry. First, we chose a set of <italic>k</italic><sub>0</sub> preexponential parameters for the C<sub>5</sub>-O<sub>6</sub> transition, to match the observed P<sub>O</sub> at saturating voltages (at â20 mV). Then, we adjusted the <italic>k</italic><sub>v</sub> exponential parameters that describe the voltage sensitivity of the C<sub>1</sub> through C<sub>5</sub> transitions, to match the normalized macroscopic activation curve under no-shear conditions. Next, we determined the statistical distribution (average and standard deviation) of the resting potential of the single-channel patched cellsâto match the voltage-dependent P<sub>O</sub> curveâwhich is voltage-shifted and shallower relative to the macroscopic activation curve. To generate a P<sub>O</sub> curve that takes into account the scattered and non-zero resting potential, the P<sub>O</sub> value at each voltage point was obtained by numerically integrating over the Gaussian distribution describing the resting potential. Next, we adjusted the <italic>k</italic><sub>0</sub> preexponential parameters for the C<sub>1</sub> through C<sub>5</sub> transitions to approximately match the observed single-channel lifetimes. Finally, for the MSO model, we adjusted the <italic>k</italic><sub>p</sub> exponential parameters describing the pressure sensitivity of the C<sub>5</sub> to C<sub>6</sub> transition, to match the P<sub>O</sub> curve under negative patch pressure. The same <italic>k</italic><sub>p</sub> values were also used for the MSA model.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Mechanosensitive pore opening of a prokaryotic voltage-gated sodium channel&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kenton Swartz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jon Sack (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Overall, we see a conceptual advance in that Nav channels respond to pressure and shear by affecting a conformational change with little voltage dependence. As this mechanism is similar to that established for Kv channels, we suggest that the manuscript be revised to make the centerpiece core finding that this type of mechanosensitive response extends to Nav channels. We suggest that other claims and speculation including those about the structural changes, physiological relevance, and evolution be more strongly supported or substantially softened.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>(1) The manuscript should make it abundantly clear that the physical mechanism proposed for the mechanosensitivity of Nav channels (a voltage-independent pore opening step) is identical to the mechanism established for a Kv channel (https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1204700109).</p><p>(2) Address patch tension issues as suggested by Rev #2 and #1: patch tensions may not be physiologically relevant, and the tensions produced by pressures are unknown without a calibration method.</p><p>(3) Determine whether the mechanosensitive response of Nav1.5 is reversible as suggested by Rev #3.</p><p>(4) Describe how shear force tension values were calculated.</p><p>(5) Clearly show the evidence that &quot;â¦ that, under tension, the closed state lifetime distribution shifts toward shorter dwell times.&quot;</p><p>(6) Resolve issues pointed out about the interpretation of I228G data by Rev #1. Ideally, present a more thorough characterization of I228G.</p><p>(7) Tone down (or remove) evolutionary speculation. See Rev #2 comments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This study contains an abundance of high-quality single-channel recordings and thoughtful analyses that have convinced me that a voltage-independent step is responding to membrane tension. A weakness of the manuscript is that the story seems to go a bit beyond the cautious interpretation of results at a few points, most notably in claiming that pressure reduces closed dwell times, and an interpretation of the I228G results. Additionally, the manuscript could be improved by further discussion of the physical basis of membrane tension in a cell vs a patch, and how flow vs pressure affects tension.</p><p>Specific suggestions:</p><p>Line 43 &quot; â¦ mutagenesis at the hinge abolished NaChBac mechanosensitivity.&quot; As some mechanosensitivity remained, abolished seems an inappropriate word choice, and &quot;diminished&quot; would be more appropriate.</p><p>line 239 &quot;with a relatively unchanged foot&quot; State more quantitatively?</p><p>line 245 &quot; membrane tension would not alter the voltage-dependent profile of the joint C5 and O6 occupancy&quot;</p><p>Doesn't tension decrease occupancy of C5 thus reducing the frequency of voltage-sensitive C5-&gt;C4 transitions?</p><p>line 248 &quot; asymmetrical shift in the activation curve at the top versus the bottom &quot;</p><p>Explain better?</p><p>Figure 4B Why does the 0 mmHg model saturate at 1 rather than 0.6 here?</p><p>Line 287 &quot;Although the single-channel fits are subject to inherent stochasticity (Figure 4E), they clearly show that, under tension, the closed state lifetime distribution shifts toward shorter dwell times.&quot;</p><p>I don't see the shift in the closed lifetimes in the data presented. Can the purported shift be backed up by a metric? Otherwise, the claim of a shift should be removed.

The observed pressure-induced increase in Po must be explainable by a change in some data parameter. Thus, we analyzed the single-channel data obtained from the T220A mutant at -20 mV using the model-based, maximum likelihood method implemented in the QuB software (the MIL algorithm described in Qin et al. <italic>Biophys J.</italic> 1996). This method is better than fitting exponentials because it accounts for missed events. We used a CO model, which is justified by the saturation of the G-V curve at -20 mV, where the channel is pushed into the last two kinetic states of the linear model. Thus, when the patch pressure is changed from 0 to -10 mmHg, the CÃ O rate constant changes from 127.7 Â±5.6 s<sup>-1</sup> to 142.4 Â±6.1 s<sup>-1</sup> (12%). This increase in the opening rate constant reduces the average duration of closed intervals, shifting the closed dwell time distribution toward shorter times. In contrast, the OâC rate constant remains virtually unchanged (48.6 Â±2.3 s<sup>-1</sup> vs. 48.4 Â±2.3 s<sup>-1</sup> [-0.5%]).

I think that panel D would be replaced by Supplementary 1C+F, which shed more light information regarding the impact of shear stress on gating energetics.</p></disp-quote><p>We carefully considered the reviewer's suggestion but ultimately decided to keep the current layout because we would like to emphasize the increase in G/Gmax, which is the signature parameter that changes with shear stress and becomes the critical difference between the MSO and MSA models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) I called my attention to the lack of effect of shear stress on Nav1.5 G-V curves at the same voltage range as NaChBac channels. I believe that to make both phenomena comparable, the impact (or lack of it) on channel energetics must be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>The fast activation and inactivation kinetics make direct comparisons between NaV1.5 and NaChBac very difficult. We lean on the impressive similarities between the mechanosensitive responses by both channels. We have adjusted the Discussion section to note that close comparison between NaV1.5 and NaChBac will require further simplification of NaV1.5 function and dramatic technical improvements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) I believe that to be able to extrapolate the current findings to the Nav1.5 channel and thereby highlight the physiological relevance of this work, it is necessary to evaluate the impact of pressure on Nav1.5, as shown in Figure supp 3 for NaChBac. I think that would be a good start to make crystal clear to what extent this bacterial channel is a reliable model to study mechanosensitivity in a channel that, as the authors pointed out, would otherwise remain inaccessible to these kinds of questions.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer brings up a fair point. Removing fast inactivation from Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 would allow us to evaluate NaV1.5 mechanosensitivity appropriately. We previously tried inactivation-removed Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 channels (e.g., WCW) but have encountered technical problems. We hope to solve these issues and be able to present the findings in future work. We have softened the generalizations in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It seems to me that the conclusions of the article would benefit from a discussion of the possible structural changes associated with the in-plane expansion of the pore between closed and open channel structures, and how does this correspond with the shear stress/pressure-induced âG you observed in your experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is asking an intriguing question. Unfortunately, this type of analysis is beyond our capabilities. Still, as suggested, we have alluded to such an evaluation in future studies in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) I suggest avoiding the use of &quot;voltage dependence of activation&quot; to identify the voltage of half-activation (V1/2) because voltage dependence is commonly associated with the apparent charge displacement (zd).</p></disp-quote><p>We replaced &quot;voltage dependence of activation&quot; with &quot;half-point of steady-state activation.&quot;</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The thoughtful revisions and additional experiments have improved the manuscript.

However, the manuscript does not address the issue of a calibration method: âTension/âPressure depends on the membrane area, and is thus expected to vary from patch to patch. Due to this issue, the pressure sensitivity in the Markov chain modules applies only to this specific experimental configuration.</p><p>Suggestions: Clearly acknowledge these issues in the manuscript. Describe the expected relationship between pressure and tension with membrane varying from patch to patch and cite literature that addresses this issue. Further details about pipettes would helpful as well. Initial pipette resistance was 1-2 MÎ©: was variance in pipette geometry documented? More detail on the pipette resistances, and ideally tip diameter and bevel, could be given, and how consistent the tip structure was for each mutant, to address concerns related to variable scaling between pressure and tension. Was there a correlation between initial pipette resistance, the timing of the seal, and the pressure response of channels?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this point. We have spent much time optimizing pipette geometry. Single-channel data for this paper were collected across 5 years. Several factors can contribute to variability, including heating filament and fire-polishing. We only used 1-2 Mâ¦ pipettes, but we did not document the initial pipette resistance, pipette geometry, or timing of the seal to be able to reconstruct a test looking for a correlation with pressure response in each experiment. In a present-day check of this method, we found that pipettes that we would use for successful patch experiments were within a narrow 1.2-1.5 Mâ¦ range (1.31Â±0.02 Mâ¦), measuring 4.23Â±0.06 Âµm in diameter and 14.03Â±0.30Â° from wall-to-wall (n = 16 pipette tips). We have added these methodological details to the manuscript.</p><p>As requested, we also acknowledge in Methods that (1) the change in tension resulting from applied pressure depends on the membrane area (Suchyna et al., <italic>Biophys J</italic> 2009; Slachov et al., <italic>J Phys Chem B</italic> 2014; Lewis and Grandl <italic>ELife</italic> 2015) and (2) the pressure sensitivity in the Markov model applies only to our experimental configuration, in terms of actual numbers, while model discrimination is general.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;(5) Clearly show the evidence that &quot;â¦ that, under tension, the closed state lifetime distribution shifts toward shorter dwell times.&quot;</p><p>The closed dwell distribution in Figure 4E still does not seem to provide compelling support for the conclusion that pressure alters microscopic opening rates. Although the manuscript now reports that fits with and without pressure show ~12% different opening rates, the distributions themselves do not show an obvious divergence. SEMs are given for the different opening rates but it is unclear what the SEMs refer to. There are no apparent replicates.</p><p>Suggestion: Eliminate the claim of experimental evidence for channel opening accelerated by pressure, or provide stronger evidence for the claim by providing sufficient replicates and a detailed description of the analysis methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We have taken the second suggested approach â âto strengthen the claim by providing sufficient replicates and a detailed description of the analyses methods.â We have added new data and have expanded the description of the methods, as we detail below.</p><p>Methods. We followed a standard procedure in the field for the single-channel kinetic analysis, consisting of two steps: (1) data âidealization,â where a dwell time sequence is generated by classifying each data point as coming from a closed or open channel, and (2) rate constant estimation, where a set of rate constants is obtained that maximizes the likelihood of the dwell time sequence. To âidealizeâ the data, we used the âSegmental K-Meansâ algorithm or the half-amplitude threshold method, as implemented in QuB software and pClamp. To estimate rate constants, we used QuBâs âMaximum Interval Likelihoodâ method (MIL), which features a correction for missed events due to finite bandwidth. The error should indicate standard deviation, not SEMs, calculated in QuB from n = 124 traces and 10 patches at -10 mmHg and n = 23 traces and 3 patches at -50 mmHg (see below). We apologize for the oversight and have corrected the methods.</p><p>The maximum likelihood approach is superior to fitting dwell time histograms, which do not account for missed events and cannot distinguish well between kinetic mechanisms. Nevertheless, we showed the dwell time histograms, together with the pdf curves calculated by the maximum likelihood algorithm (accounting for missed events), to give the reader a visual sense of data statistics and model fitness.</p><p>Data. The increase in p<sub>Open</sub> with pressure is very robust and can be observed in both single channel (Figure 2, 3, 3 Suppl 1) and whole cell (Figure 4B, 5 Suppl 2) data under a broad range of voltages. At extreme depolarizing voltages (i.e., â20 mV), the channel can be assumed to flicker between the last two states in the kinetic scheme, closed and open. Under these conditions, p<sub>Open</sub> can be calculated with the equation k<sub>Open</sub>/(k<sub>Open</sub> + k<sub>Close</sub>). Thus, a change in p<sub>Open</sub> with pressure can only be explained by changes in k<sub>Open</sub>, k<sub>Close</sub>, or both. However, a change in k<sub>Open</sub> or k<sub>Close</sub> by a factor as small as 1.5 may be sufficient to explain the observed change in p<sub>Open</sub> of ~0.1, upon application of -10 mmHg patch pressure. Such a small change in rate constants would entail a correspondingly small shift in the dwell time histograms, which would be difficult to detect in the presence of stochastic fluctuations, and especially when the histogram must be plotted on a logarithmic time scale that spans several decades.</p><p>To make it more obvious to the readers that patch pressure alters the rate constants of the pore opening transition, we took your advice and added new data collected at higher pressures (-50 mmHg), where the change in rate constants was more apparent. To eliminate the potential confusion raised by dwell time histograms, we have now graphed the estimated k<sub>Open</sub> and k<sub>Close</sub> rate constants (Figure 4E). The change in k<sub>Open</sub> is substantial and significant. Interestingly, at high pressures, we also saw small changes in k<sub>Close</sub>. Overall, these changes in the pore opening transition quantitatively explain the increase in p<sub>Open</sub> with pressure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;(6) Resolve issues pointed out about the interpretation of I228G data by Rev #1. Ideally, present a more thorough characterization of I228G. &quot;</p><p>I228G results now show nicely that the gating of the mutant is less pressure-sensitive. This is a very interesting, well-substantiated result! However, the logic remains unclear concerning conclusions derived from the S6 mutant which lessens mechanosensitivity. It seems that multiple explanations could account for the I228G results, even if a pressure-sensitive gating change was no longer detected. It remains unclear how the I228G could gate (relatively normally) if the opening conformational change (S6 displacement) no longer displaces.</p><p>Suggestion: Mention that multiple interpretations of the diminished pressure sensitivity of I228G are plausible: (A) The gating scheme has changed such that the pressure-sensitive step no longer measurably alters the gating process. (B) The pressure-sensitive step no longer occurs. (C) The pressure-sensitive step is longer pressure sensitive (the current interpretation).</p></disp-quote><p>We intended to phrase the I228G discussion to acknowledge that (as pointed out) the gating mechanism of I228G gating is unknown and that our interpretations are not the only plausible explanations. At your suggestion, we have added, âThe dramatic loss of I228G NaChBac mechanosensitivity suggests a loss of pressure sensitivity in the final opening step. However, it is also possible that the overall gating scheme for I228G NaChBac changed compared, leading to a loss of the pressure-sensitive opening step.â</p></body></sub-article></article>
