Recently, it was reported that UCH37 activity is stimulated by branched ubiquitin (Ub) chain architectures. To understand how UCH37 achieves its unique debranching specificity, we performed biochemical and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) structural analyses and found that UCH37 is activated by contacts with the hydrophobic patches of both distal Ubs that emanate from a branched Ub. In addition, RPN13, which recruits UCH37 to the proteasome, further enhances branched-chain specificity by restricting linear Ub chains from having access to the UCH37 active site. In cultured human cells under conditions of proteolytic stress, we show that substrate clearance by the proteasome is promoted by both binding and deubiquitination of branched polyubiquitin by UCH37. Proteasomes containing UCH37(C88A), which is catalytically inactive, aberrantly retain polyubiquitinated species as well as the RAD23B substrate shuttle factor, suggesting a defect in recycling of the proteasome for the next round of substrate processing. These findings provide a foundation to understand how proteasome degradation of substrates modified by a unique Ub chain architecture is aided by a DUB.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>UCH37</kwd><kwd>UCHL5</kwd><kwd>ubiquitin</kwd><kwd>DUB</kwd><kwd>branched ubiquitin chain</kwd><kwd>proteasome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM115997</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cohen</surname><given-names>Robert E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21 GM135818</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cohen</surname><given-names>Robert E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM065334</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fushman</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM074830</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Lan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM130144</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Lan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM098401</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yao</surname><given-names>Tingting</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Through interactions with both ubiquitin units that emanate from a branch point in polyubiquitin, UCH37 recognizes and hydrolyzes branched chains to promote proteasome-mediated degradation upon proteolytic stresses.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In eukaryotes, the ubiquitin (Ub)–proteasome system is responsible for regulated protein degradation that maintains protein homeostasis and plays a major role in the defense against proteolytic stresses. Ub in the form of a variety of polyUb chains serves as a signal that targets unwanted proteins to the 26S proteasome where the proteins are unfolded and translocated into the interior chamber of the 20S proteasome where they are degraded. During this process, Ub is removed and recycled by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). The timing of Ub removal is critical as premature deubiquitination can lead to unintended release of the substrate, whereas failure to remove Ub can inhibit substrate translocation. Additionally, polyUb chains released from the substrates need to be further disassembled in order to minimize competition with new substrates awaiting processing by the proteasome. Coordination of these actions relies on three DUBs associated with the proteasome: RPN11, USP14, and UCH37. Each of these DUBs has a nonredundant role in proteasome function. In recent years, significant progress has been made in our understanding of how RPN11 and USP14 are regulated to coordinate with substrate processing on the 26S proteasome, a role of UCH37 was discovered only recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deol et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Proteasome-associated DUBs can either promote or inhibit substrate degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2011</xref>). RPN11 (also called POH1) is a stoichiometric subunit of the 19S regulatory particle (RP) of the proteasome; it is the only essential DUB in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. RPN11 activity is coupled to substrate degradation by removing polyUb chains <italic>en bloc</italic> as the substrate is translocated through a narrow gate into the proteolytic chamber of the 20S proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yao and Cohen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Verma et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Worden et al., 2017</xref>). USP14 (UBP6 in yeast) is a dissociable subunit of the 19S RP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Leggett et al., 2002</xref>). It is activated upon forming a complex with the RP and removes Ub from substrates that are ubiquitinated at multiple sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). In vivo and in vitro evidence suggest that USP14/UBP6 inhibits proteasome degradation via both catalytic and noncatalytic mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hanna et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bashore et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast to RPN11, USP14 can act before substrate is translocated into the 20S core particle and committed to degradation. Inhibition of proteasome-associated DUBs have broad effects on cellular proteostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D’Arcy et al., 2011</xref>), highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting proteasomal DUBs.</p><p>UCH37 (also known as UCHL5) is a highly conserved DUB found from fission yeast to humans, but absent in the budding yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. It has a catalytic domain characteristic of the UCH family of DUBs and a unique C-terminal domain (CTD) that mediates interactions with two binding partners, RPN13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hamazaki et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Qiu et al., 2006</xref>) and NFRKB. We previously reported that RPN13 (also known as ADRM1) recruits UCH37 to the 19S RP of the proteasome whereas NFRKB recruits it to the INO80 chromatin remodeler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yao et al., 2008</xref>). Remarkably, whereas UCH37 is activated upon binding RPN13, it is held inactive in the complex with INO80. We and others have solved the crystal structures of UCH37 in both the activated and repressed states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vander Linden et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sahtoe et al., 2015</xref>). These structures revealed that, whereas RPN13 stabilizes UCH37 in a conformation that promotes Ub binding, NFRKB represses UCH37 by occluding the Ub-binding site. Despite that these structures provided clear understanding of how UCH37 activity is controlled in different contexts, they did not reveal how UCH37 contributes to the functions of the proteasome or INO80 complex. Deletion of UCH37 in mice is embryonic lethal, although the underlying cause is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Shami et al., 2010</xref>). Cellular functions that have been associated with UCH37 include TGFβ signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wicks et al., 2005</xref>), Hedgehog signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>), DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nishi et al., 2014</xref>), and cell cycle regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Randles et al., 2016</xref>); in these cases and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jacobson et al., 2014</xref>) UCH37 was reported to either promote or inhibit degradation of a proposed substrate. However, whether the effects seen on specific substrates were direct or indirect were not resolved, and therefore UCH37’s role in proteasome-mediated degradation remains enigmatic.</p><p>Among the variety of polyUb polymers in the cell, 10–20% have a branched architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Swatek et al., 2019</xref>) in which more than one Ub is attached to a single Ub acceptor. Branched polyUb chains have been reported to have a variety of functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haakonsen and Rape, 2019</xref>); most notably, polyUb branching enhances substrate degradation by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yau et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Meyer and Rape, 2014</xref>). Recently, Deol et al. revealed that UCH37 has a K48-linkage-specific debranching activity that promotes proteasomal degradation of substrates modified with branched polyUb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deol et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we set out to understand how the debranching specificity is achieved and how such an activity might contribute to proteasome function in vivo. Our work demonstrates that UCH37 binds to branched polyUb by engaging the hydrophobic patches on both distal Ubs at a branch point. RPN13 further enhances the branched-chain specificity by restricting UCH37 from engaging linear polyUb chains. In cells, polyUb conjugates that accumulate upon proteolytic stresses are greatly enhanced by the loss of UCH37 activity. We show that both binding and deubiquitination of branched polyUb by UCH37 facilitate proteasome-dependent clearance of stress-induced inclusions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>UCH37 and the UCH37–RPN13<sup>C</sup> complex prefer branched polyUb substrates</title><p>It was recently reported that UCH37 DUB activity with polyUb substrates is stimulated by branched-chain architectures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deol et al., 2020</xref>). To better understand this unusual specificity, we generated homotypic and heterotypic Ub<sub>3</sub> chains containing all-native isopeptide linkages and having linear or branched architectures (for nomenclature, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We also compared deubiquitination with UCH37 alone or in a complex with the minimal binding domain from RPN13 (RPN13<sup>C</sup>, amino acid 285–407 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vander Linden et al., 2015</xref>); also known as the DEUBAD domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sanchez-Pulido et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). By quantifying the release of the Ub<sub>2</sub> and Ub<sub>1</sub> products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), we drew the following conclusions: (1) The branched Ub<sub>3</sub> chains are strongly preferred as substrates (i.e., 10- to 100-fold faster hydrolysis) over their linear counterparts (e.g., [Ub]<sub>2</sub>–<sup>6,48</sup>Ub versus Ub–<sup>6</sup>Ub–<sup>48</sup>Ub or Ub–<sup>48</sup>Ub–<sup>6</sup>Ub). (2) Among the branched Ub<sub>3</sub> substrates, UCH37 strongly prefers K6/K48 over K11/K48 or K48/K63 branched chains. (3) Whereas RPN13<sup>C</sup> enhances UCH37 hydrolysis of most polyUb substrates, it strongly inhibits activity with linear K48 Ub<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). (4) Consistently, we found that Ub<sub>2</sub> and Ub<sub>1</sub> products were always produced in a 2:1 ratio quantified by mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), which is equivalent to a 1:1 molar ratio. Using linkage-specific anti-Ub antibodies, we found that only the K48 linkage in K6/K48-branched Ub<sub>3</sub> was cleaved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), indicative of a ‘debranching’ activity that thus far is unique to UCH37.

To better understand how UCH37 activity affects proteasomal degradation, we focused on UCH37-containing proteasomes isolated from WT, C88A, and EWI cells. From the whole-cell lysates, it was apparent that C88A and EWI cells accumulate K48, K11/K48 and, to a lesser extent, total polyUb conjugates; this was the case both with and without osmotic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). These results are consistent with the phenotypes observed by proteasome foci counting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). UCH37-containing proteasomes were immunoprecipitated from these cells under low salt conditions to preserve weakly associated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Whereas the C88A proteasomes accumulated polyUb conjugates, surprisingly, the EWI proteasomes behaved similar to WT. To confirm these observations, we also created HEK293 cell lines that inducibly express different forms of UCH37 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Again, polyUb accumulation was only observed with proteasomes containing C88A (lanes 7, 8, and 12). Enhanced polyUb association occurs in the context of the proteasome, not free UCH37, as UCH37ΔCTD, which cannot associate with RPN13, did not coimmunoprecipitate with either proteasomes or polyUb conjugates; this was observed with either WT or C88A UCH37ΔCTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). UCH37 with the EWI and C88A mutations combined had only slightly increased amounts of associated polyUb conjugates in comparison with EWI alone, confirming that the EWI mutations effectively eliminated most, if not all, Ub binding to UCH37 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We noticed that a fraction of C88A UCH37 were oligoubiquitinated at steady state. To address whether the ubiquitination status of UCH37 contributes to the phenotype observed with C88A proteasomes, we mutated the four primary ubiquitination sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hornbeck et al., 2015</xref>), K154, K158, K206, and K210, to arginines. The 4KR mutations substantially reduced the oligoubiquitinated species of C88A UCH37 but did not affect polyUb accumulation on C88A proteasomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>UCH37(C88A)-containing proteasomes accumulate polyUb species and RAD23B.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Soluble cell lysates were collected from WT, C88A, and EWI cells with or without 30 min 0.2 M sucrose treatment, analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) and immunblotting with indicated antibodies.

We found that both free and conjugated Ub species accumulated on C88A proteasomes at levels 4 times that of WT or EWI proteasomes. Additionally, the increased polyUb on C88A proteasomes was accompanied by increased association of the substrate shuttle receptor, RAD23B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

For the majority of the constitutive proteasome RP and CP subunits, we did not find any differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>). However, among dynamically associated proteasome-interacting proteins (PIPs), we found that Ub (UBA52), RAD23B, PA28 (PSME1 and PSME2), USP14, and 19S assembly chaperones (PSMD5 and PSMD10) were noticeably enriched in the C88S and, to a lesser extent, EWI proteasomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). The extent of Ub accumulation detected by TMT analysis is less than that detected by tUI-based assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), most likely due to ratio suppression commonly observed in TMT-based quantification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ting et al., 2011</xref>).

Our results have revealed multiple levels of control that contribute to the unique debranching specificity of UCH37. Like other UCH family of enzymes, the ASCL of UCH37 controls access to its active site. In the ground state, RPN13’s interaction with the ASCL promotes a conformation that prevents linear polyUb chains from accessing the active site. By microscale thermophoresis, we determined that UCH37–RPN13<sup>C</sup> bound to K48- and K6-linked Ub<sub>2</sub> with similarly weak affinities. Additionally, mixed-linkage linear polyUb chains, such as Ub–<sup>6</sup>Ub–<sup>48</sup>Ub and Ub–<sup>48</sup>Ub–<sup>6</sup>Ub, are poor deubiquitination substrates. This likely reflects that the ASCL is positioned to block linear polyUb binding regardless of linkage. Thus, the ASCL functions as a gate and RPN13 as a gatekeeper to prevent unintended hydrolysis of linear polyUb chains. Upon encountering branched chains, UCH37 engages the hydrophobic patches of both distal Ub units; this would enhance affinity and, crucially, affect the displacement of the ASCL to allow access to the active site. The geometry of a branched polyUb chain likely plays a key role in substrate binding, position of the ASCL, and K48 specificity in debranching by UCH37–RPN13. Our data suggest that the K6/K48-branched Ub<sub>3</sub> presents a favorable configuration to engage and activate the enzyme. Given that we did not observe significant NMR CSPs of Ub residues around the K48 linkage on the proximal Ub, we favor a model in which the configuration of the two distal Ubs at the branch point directs specificity for cleavage of the K48 linkage. Other than K48, there are six lysine residues and one N-terminal amine where another distal Ub can be attached, thereby giving rise to a variety of possible branched Ub<sub>3</sub> structures. Our model predicts that only some of these possible structures are ideal substrates for UCH37–RPN13; thus, polyUb substrates with Ub units branching from different lysine residues will not be hydrolyzed with equal efficiencies. The finding that the efficiency of substrate disassembly is in the order of K6/K48 &gt; K11/K48 &gt;&gt; K63/K48 supports this idea. Currently, we do not know if UCH37–RPN13 is active with branched polyUb lacking a K48 linkage.</p><p>The minimal branched polyUb chain has three Ub units. Using K6/K48 Ub<sub>3</sub> as a model, our NMR experiments suggest that UCH37 has at least two Ub-binding sites, each engaging the hydrophobic patch of a distal Ub unit in a branched chain. One of these sites, presumably the S1 site, is occupied in the complex with monoUb described in previous crystal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vander Linden et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sahtoe et al., 2015</xref>). These structures showed that the UCH37 UCH domain binds the S1-site Ub through extensive contacts with the classical Ub L8–I44–V70 hydrophobic patch as well as the extended C-terminal tail. These interactions are also observed for the K48-linked distal Ub of the K6/K48 Ub<sub>3</sub> in our NMR analysis. Unexpectedly, we observed additional perturbations of surface residues in the Ub α-helix, most notably K29, D32, and E34, which may represent new interactions with the S1 site that are promoted upon binding the branched chain. Although we have not identified where the second Ub-binding site is on UCH37, both our NMR analysis and mutagenesis data support that L8 and I44 of the non-K48-linked distal Ub are required for debranching. Additionally, UCH37 might also have contacts with the C-terminal tail of the K6-linked distal Ub. In contrast, debranching did not depend on the hydrophobic patch of the proximal Ub. We also observed significantly smaller perturbations of NMR signals in the proximal Ub upon binding of K6/K48 Ub<sub>3</sub> to UCH37–RPN13<sup>C</sup>, suggesting that the proximal Ub serves primarily to position the distal Ub units rather than interact directly with the enzyme. It is also possible that the proximal Ub is responsible for displacing the ASCL in concert with positioning of the distal Ub units.</p><p>The affinities between the several branched Ub<sub>3</sub> chains we tested and UCH37–RPN13<sup>C</sup> are generally weak; these were either measured directly as <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>s or inferred from <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> values. Thus, efficient debranching in vivo likely requires additional interactions that bring or retain polyUb–protein substrates onto the 26S proteasome. Full-length RPN13 contains an N-terminal PRU domain that can bind Ub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schreiner et al., 2008</xref>). Although we did not observe differences in activities between UCH37–RPN13<sup>C</sup> and UCH37–RPN13<sup>FL</sup> with a Ub<sub>3</sub> substrate, it is possible that longer polyUb chains engage the PRU domain.</p><p>Recently, it was reported that 10–20% of polyUb chains in cells may contain branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Swatek et al., 2019</xref>). With a few exceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yau et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Meyer and Rape, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaiho-Soma et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ohtake et al., 2018</xref>), very little is known about the distributions of Ub–Ub linkages in branched polyUb chains, or the identities of the proteins modified by branched forms of polyUb. Upon osmotic or oxidative stresses, we observed cellular inclusions that contain proteasomes and are stained by a K11/K48-bispecific antibody, suggesting that at least a subset of proteins in those inclusions are modified with branched polyUb chains. Unfortunately, linkage-specific reagents to detect polyUb are very limited, and we were unsuccessful in our attempts to use a K6-linkage-specific anti-Ub affimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Michel et al., 2017</xref>) to stain cells; thus, we have no evidence as to whether K6/K48-branched polyUb or K6-linked Ub accumulates in the stress-induced proteasome foci.</p><p>In cells lacking UCH37, the number of proteasome-containing intracellular inclusions are significantly increased, both in the absence and presence of proteolytic stress. This is accompanied by accumulation of K48 and K11/K48-linked polyUb species in the UCH37 KO cells. Overexpression of UCH37 WT not only rescues the KO phenotypes, but further reduces sucrose-induced foci in comparison with the parental cells. In contrast, overexpression of catalytically inactive UCH37, C88A or EWI, increases proteasome foci. We conclude that debranching by UCH37 promotes the dissolution of proteasome degradation centers. Interestingly, when we examined UCH37-containing proteasomes, we found that C88A, but not WT or EWI-containing proteasomes, accumulate polyUb species that include both free and conjugated Ub. Additionally, in comparison with WT or EWI, C88A proteasomes exhibit much slower association/dissociation kinetics in sucrose-induced foci. These observations suggest that, in the absence of debranching activity, UCH37 interactions with the polyUb species lead to their retention at the proteasome, which in turn abnormally retains other dynamic PIPs such as RAD23B and USP14.</p><p>Altogether, these results suggest that UCH37 functions to clear polyUb chains, most likely those that contain branches, from the proteasome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). It has been shown that branched polyUb can promote substrate degradation by enhancing targeting to either p97/VCP or proteasomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yau et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Meyer and Rape, 2014</xref>), although the underlying mechanism is unclear. With Ub<sub>3</sub> chains, we did not observe a binding preference for branched over linear chains by RAD23B as long as a K48 linkage is present, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Varadan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boughton et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nakasone et al., 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, it is possible that endogenous forms of branched polyUb bind proteasomes more tightly by simultaneously engaging multiple Ub receptor sites. Proteasome-associated UCH37 could efficiently disassemble these Ub chains by severing the K48 linkage at branch points, thereby shortening the chains and also promoting chain release because most proteasomal Ub receptors prefer chains with K48 linkages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tsuchiya et al., 2017</xref>). This model of UCH37 function requires that debranching is slow enough to not compete with substrate targeting, engagement, and the initiation of degradation. For the in vitro degradation of a small model substrate such as titin-I27, substrate processing is complete in less than 1 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bard et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, with a <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> of 3.2 min<sup>−1</sup> or less, deubiquitination by UCH37 is unlikely to cause premature release of polyUb–protein substrates from the 26S proteasome. This is in contrast to USP14, another proteasome-associated DUB, which exhibits much faster kinetics and can remove the Ub signal prior to substrate commitment. In another scenario, it is also possible that binding to multiple Ub receptor sites on the proteasome slows or stalls substrate translocation; debranching by UCH37 could help to alleviate that problem. These possibilities for UCH37 function are not mutually exclusive.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A model for how UCH37 promotes substrate processing and recycling of the proteasome through debranching of polyUb chains.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic of singly capped 26S proteasome in s1 state (PDB code: 4CR2) with locations indicated for intrinsic Ub receptors (RPN1, RPN10, and RPN13) and associated DUBs (RPN11 and UCH37); for clarity, USP14 is not shown.

The <italic>I</italic>/<italic>I</italic><sub>0</sub> ratio was further corrected by the volume dilution factor.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Reviewing editor, eLife</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Project administration, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Writing – review and editing, Conceptualization, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Funding acquisition</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Writing – review and editing, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Writing – review and editing, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Conceptualization, Methodology, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Writing – review and editing, Investigation, Conceptualization, Methodology, Project administration, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Writing – review and editing, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Conceptualization, Methodology, Project administration, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Sequence alignment for UCH37 proteins used in this work.</title><p>The active site C88 is highlighted in yellow and EWI residues are indicated in orange.</p></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-72798-supp1-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-72798-transrepform1-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data contributed to the results in this manuscript are included in the manuscript and supporting files.</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Melanine Furgason and Andrew Roddam for the initial development of the Mimic2 Ub conjugation strategy, to Joseph P Thelen for creating the UCH37 knockout cell line, and to Yun-Seok Choi for materials and advice for the real-time deubiquitination assay with tUI.

clearance of branched polyubiquitylated substrates. Using a wide-range of chemical biological, biophysical and cell biological techniques, the authors convincingly demonstrate recognition of branched ubiquitin trimers and further demonstrate that mutations of the deubiquitylating enzyme lead to the formation of proteasomal foci in cells that are rich in polyubiquitinated species, presumably due to the loss of debranching activity. Overall, this excellent study adds to our understanding of UCH37 function, especially with regard to the newly observed phenomenon of reversible proteasome aggregation in cells.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72798.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Andreotti</surname><given-names>Amy</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>Iowa State University</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.08.17.456719">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.17.456719v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below. We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Branched ubiquitin chain binding and deubiquitination by UCH37 facilitate proteasome clearance of stress-induced inclusions&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Philip Cole as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Recommendations for the authors:</p><p>The major conclusions of the manuscript are supported by the data but with some technical concerns/questions, as raised below.</p><p>1) Figure 1: there seems to be a bit of variability in terms of how Ub3 presents on the gels. A smear with lower bands in A, a smear with upper bands in B and a more prominent single band in D. It'd be good to include molecular weight markers for all these gels if possible. Is there any rationale for why the Ub3 is so variable? Also it's not clear why the activity against 48/63 chains is not higher given the Mol Cell manuscript by Deol et al.</p><p>2) In Figure 1D, why is RPN13-C not apparent for the left panel with Ub2-6,48Ub? RPN13-C includes the DEUBAD domain but which amino acids exactly does it span? It's also at low abundance compared to UCH37 in the right panel and in addition the level of UCH37 is much greater in the Ub-48Ub-48Ub experiment compared to 6,48. Also why does UCH37 seem to migrate a little higher for the amino acid substituted forms and is there some proteolysis for the DD mutant, as there is a lower band above the Ub3? Ub1 seems like it might not be as reliable to quantify as Ub2 for 1D; is it possible to include in 1E the plot for Ub2? One reason for raising this possibility is that there seems to be an increase in Ub2 for UCH37 alone with the DD mutant for Ub2-6,48Ub when examining Figure 1D. Are the data in Figure 1E plotted for the same UCH37 protein – ratio for DD plotted compared to DD without RPN13?</p><p>3) Figure 3: The L8A/I44A mutations in proximal Ub leads to loss of spectral effects with UCH37-RPN13C addition. This finding is interesting because it suggests that interaction with proximal Ub is not required for the debranching activity, particularly when combined with the data in Figure 3E, as noted by the authors. The text seems to also imply that the spectral effect is caused by lost intraUb interactions, but these mutations could also impact possible intermolecular interactions. Perhaps the text could be clarified a bit on this point. Also again, in Figure 3E RPN13C is barely observable – perhaps a 1D NMR spectrum can be used to resolve the abundance of RPN13C for these experiments or alternatively mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometry may also reveal why Ub3 varies.</p><p>4) Line 194: The reference to Figure 6 – supplement 1A for EWI mutant having reduced affinity for Ub seems incorrect.</p><p>5) Figure 5A is convincing but a line profile would be further helpful and the distance seems to be missing for the scale bar. These suggestions apply also to Figure 5, S1C/D.</p><p>6) A caveat of the experiments involving the C88A mutant is that it itself is ubiquitinated (Figure 6, supple 1A, right middle panel lane 1 and Figure 5, supple 1B). Does increased ubiquitin at the proteasome with the C88A mutant represent at least in part ubiquitinated UCH37 mutant for example? How would the FRAP experiments be influenced if ubiquitin on UCH37 were interacting with the proteasome (Figure 6E)?</p><p>7) &quot;Proteasomes containing UCH37(C88A), which is catalytically inactive, aberrantly retain polyubiquitinated species as well as the RAD23B substrate shuttle factor, suggesting a defect in recycling of the proteasome.&quot; Please change to &quot;recycling by the proteasome.&quot; I suspect the authors are not referring to the recycling of proteasomes themselves.</p><p>8) &quot;In recent years, significant progress has been made in our understanding of how RPN11 and USP14 are regulated to coordinate with substrate processing on the 26S proteasome, but the role of UCH37 remains poorly understood.&quot;</p><p>And</p><p>&quot;how UCH37 contributes to the functions of the proteasome or INO80 complex remains unknown.&quot;</p><p>We would suggest amending these two statements based on Strieter's Molecular Cell paper in which they showed that global proteolysis is supported by UCH37 debranching activity. It may be useful to focus instead on missing aspects from the previous study such as the mode of UCH37-binding to branched Ub and the overall role of UCH37 in proteasomal function.</p><p>9) &quot;We noticed that the kcat we measured for K6/K48 Ub3 debranching at 30 {degree sign}C is slower than what was reported by others, which varied from 3 to 12‐fold faster at 37 {degree sign}C, whereas the KM values are similar&quot;</p><p>The authors should note that two entirely different techniques (MS vs probe binding) and temperatures were employed in the kinetics assays, which may underlie differences in observed kinetics. One question for the authors is that given the fact that UCH37 must operate at 37 degrees in humans, where questions of its kinetics competing with proteasomal degradation may reasonably be raised, why did they choose to measure kinetics at 30 degrees? How does this relate to the argument in the discussion that relatively &quot;slow&quot; debranching would not compete with substrate engagement by the proteasome? Would the authors expect this to also be accurate at 37 degrees where UCH37 may be faster as per Strieter et al.?</p><p>10) While the biophysical measurements were crystal clear, aspects of the manuscript dealing with proteasomal foci formation and especially RAD23B accumulation were unclear as to what precise conclusion was arrived at by the authors. RAD23B did not appear to show any binding preference in their assays for example and they did not speculate further. These experiments almost felt like an attempt to distinguish the current manuscript from previous literature that had already demonstrated impaired proteasomal function due to UCH37 knockouts. The authors should clarify in the text whether they envision that foci are formed because of the accumulation of polyubiquitylated substrates, or, if foci formation occurs first, which then leads to the accumulation of polyubiquitylated substrates. If it is the former, isn't foci formation simply one of the many physiological outcomes from a blocked proteasome that is still recruiting polyubiquitylated species which in turn recruit more proteasomes? If there is something unique about the clustering of proteasomes in this manner, the authors should definitely highlight this unique aspect of UCH-37 function.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72798.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Recommendations for the authors:</p><p>The major conclusions of the manuscript are supported by the data but with some technical concerns/questions, as raised below.</p><p>1) Figure 1: there seems to be a bit of variability in terms of how Ub3 presents on the gels.

We found that the cause is incomplete denaturation of Ub3 by the SDS sample buffer. We prefer to avoid heating these samples prior to SDS-PAGE because heat causes aggregation of polyUb chains, a well-known phenomenon in the field. As a result, Ub3 is incompletely denatured, and its appearance on the gel depends on how long the sample had been in SDS-sample buffer. However, we have made sure that the appearance does not affect quantitation of the bands after Coomassie staining. Molecular weight markers are presented in Source Data 1.</p><p>For 48/63 branched Ub3, we have not observed robust debranching activity from UCH37-RPN13. We have used linkage-specific DUBs (Otub1 and AMSH) to confirm that the chains we synthesized have correct linkages. We have also tested different batches of 48/63 branched Ub3 made in different labs and obtained consistent results.</p><p>In the Mol Cell paper by Deol et al., the only experiment shown with 48/63 branched trimer is in Figure 1B. However, that experiment was done with TEC chains that contain non-native Ub-Ub linkages. It is also not possible to compare initial velocities using the results presented in that gel. The rest of the Deol et al., results that employed 48/63 branched chains used complex HMW (high molecular weight) chain mixtures. Due to the heterogeneity of those substrates, it is difficult to derive kinetic parameters (i.e., initial velocity, Km or Kcat values) for meaningful comparison with our results. Overall, however, it appears that debranching of the HMW 48/63 chains is slower than 6/48 or 11/48 chains (see Figures 2 and S5 in Deol et al.,), a trend that agrees with our results using homogeneous Ub3 substrates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 1D, why is RPN13-C not apparent for the left panel with Ub2-6,48Ub? RPN13-C includes the DEUBAD domain but which amino acids exactly does it span?

This is the same construct as was used in Vanderlinden et al., (Mol Cell, 57:901); it encompasses aa 285-407. We have added that info in the revised manuscript, line 75.</p><p>Possibly because of its small size, RPN13C stains poorly with Coomassie. In Figure 1D, the enzyme (UCH37-Rpn13C) was used at both 0.5 μm (left panel) and 10 μm (right panel). This is because it has much higher activity against branched chains. Given the 20-fold difference in the enzyme amount, you cannot see RPN13C in the left panel. Purified RPN13C is quantified by absorbance at 280 nm. We think the quantification is reliable. In Figure 2-supplement 1C, we compared RPN13C added in trans (Lane 1) or co-purified with UCH37 (Lane 2). Because of the co-purification protocol, RPN13C that’s co-purified with UCH37 should be at 1:1 molar ratio. Comparing Lanes 1 and 2, the RPN13C bands gave rise to similar staining intensities despite that they were purified and quantified by different procedures.</p><p>The UCH37 AA and DD mutants do migrate slightly slower than the WT enzyme. This is likely due to loss of hydrophobicity provided by M148,F149 residues (and, as a result, less SDS is complexed). The DD mutant does appear to have a slight contamination by a proteolytic fragment. However, we see the same results with AA and DD mutants. The comparison in Figure 1E is made for the same enzyme with and without RPN13C. We have quantified Ub2 as the reviewer requested. The results are the same as with the Ub1 quantitation. In order to avoid overcrowding of the original figure, we put the Ub2 quantitation results in Figure 1-supplement 1D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 3: The L8A/I44A mutations in proximal Ub leads to loss of spectral effects with UCH37-RPN13C addition.

This is why the activity assay in Figure 3E is important. We have now clarified this point in Line 155. The added reference 32 also has extensive discussion on the complications in interpretation of NMR data in a similar case. We thank the reviewer for the suggestion.</p><p>As we described above (point #2), RPN13C is stained poorly. We have adjusted the contrast for Figure 3E. to make the faint bands more visible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Line 194: The reference to Figure 6 – supplement 1A for EWI mutant having reduced affinity for Ub seems incorrect.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the reference to Sahtoe et al., (Mol Cell 57:887)(Line 206, revised). This paper has a detailed discussion on the important contribution of Ile216 to Ub binding by UCH37. We did not purify and characterize the UCH37-EWI mutant protein. The EWI triple mutation is expected to severely reduce Ub binding, thereby making Ub-AMC assays and Km determinations impractical. We instead prioritized characterization of the EWI mutation in mammalian cells. Figure 6-supplement 1A shows that both the EWI and EWI/C88A mutants pull down much less polyUb than with WT and C88A UCH37. These results support the prediction of weakened Ub binding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 5A is convincing but a line profile would be further helpful and the distance seems to be missing for the scale bar. These suggestions apply also to Figure 5, S1C/D.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We have added line profiles in Figure 5A, S1C/D, and we have specified the size of the scale bar in the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) A caveat of the experiments involving the C88A mutant is that it itself is ubiquitinated (Figure 6, supple 1A, right middle panel lane 1 and Figure 5, supple 1B). Does increased ubiquitin at the proteasome with the C88A mutant represent at least in part ubiquitinated UCH37 mutant for example? How would the FRAP experiments be influenced if ubiquitin on UCH37 were interacting with the proteasome (Figure 6E)?</p></disp-quote><p>We don’t think that ubiquitination of UCH37-C88A itself contributes significantly to the total ubiquitin species associated with the proteasome. In Figure 6-Supplement 1A, Lane 7, ubiquitinated UCH37-C88A runs between 50 kDa and 75 kDa. From the anti-Ub blot, it is clear that those bands are minor in comparison with the high molecular weight Ub conjugates. In addition, we present new data (Figure 6-Supplement 1B) to show that increased polyUb species are still observed in C88A-containing proteasomes even when most of the ubiquitination on C88A is blocked. We had previously mapped the ubiquitination sites on UCH37-C88A and, by mutating the major lysine ubiquitination sites to arginines (4KR), we could eliminate most UCH37 ubiquitination. Comparing immunoprecipitates from HEK293 cells expressing WT-4KR or C88A-4KR shows that similar patterns of Ub conjugates are obtained regardless of the 4KR mutation. These new results are described in Line 252. Currently, we don’t have a GFP-tagged UCH37(4KR) or the stable cell lines necessary for FRAP experiments. Nevertheless, based on the co-immunoprecipitation experiment results, we predict that the behavior would be similar to what we report in Figure 6E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) “Proteasomes containing UCH37(C88A), which is catalytically inactive, aberrantly retain polyubiquitinated species as well as the RAD23B substrate shuttle factor, suggesting a defect in recycling of the proteasome.” Please change to “recycling by the proteasome.” I suspect the authors are not referring to the recycling of proteasomes themselves.</p></disp-quote><p>We mean “recycling” in the sense of allowing an enzyme to engage in multiple rounds of catalysis. In this case, either substrates or products (probably both based on our results) cannot be efficiently released from the proteasome, thus preventing “recycling of the proteasome”. Although we believe that “recycling” is appropriate here, we are open to suggestions for a better word.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) “In recent years, significant progress has been made in our understanding of how RPN11 and USP14 are regulated to coordinate with substrate processing on the 26S proteasome, but the role of UCH37 remains poorly understood.”</p><p>And</p><p>“how UCH37 contributes to the functions of the proteasome or INO80 complex remains unknown.”</p><p>We would suggest amending these two statements based on Strieter’s Molecular Cell paper in which they showed that global proteolysis is supported by UCH37 debranching activity.

However, many mechanistic questions regarding how UCH37 activity is coordinated with substrate processing remain unanswered. Nevertheless, we have changed the aforementioned sentence to “In recent years, significant progress has been made in our understanding of how RPN11 and USP14 are regulated to coordinate with substrate processing on the 26S proteasome, a role of UCH37 was discovered only recently (ref to Deol et al.).” (Line 16)</p><p>Regarding the 2<sup>nd</sup> part of this comment, what we meant was that the current structures of UCH37 do little to inform us about the function of UCH37 in either complex. Therefore, we have changed the sentence to “Despite that these structures provided clear understanding of how UCH37 activity is controlled in different contexts, they did not reveal how UCH37 contributes to the functions of the proteasome or INO80 complex.” (Line 43).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) “We noticed that the kcat we measured for K6/K48 Ub3 debranching at 30 {degree sign}C is slower than what was reported by others, which varied from 3 to 12‐fold faster at 37 {degree sign}C, whereas the KM values are similar”</p><p>The authors should note that two entirely different techniques (MS vs probe binding) and temperatures were employed in the kinetics assays, which may underlie differences in observed kinetics.

Would the authors expect this to also be accurate at 37 degrees where UCH37 may be faster as per Strieter et al.?</p></disp-quote><p>In Deol et al., steady-state kinetics of K6/K48 Ub3 debranching was measured by SDS-PAGE, not Mass Spec. The rates of debranching of high molecular weight chains, as measured by Mass Spec in Deol et al., were presented as <italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub> and are not directly comparable to the steady-state kinetic measurements; thus, we do not make comparisons to those results.</p><p>We routinely perform fluorescence-based assays at 30 °C because (a) fluorescence is temperature sensitive and it is easier to maintain small volumes at a steady temperature at 30 °C than 37 °C; (b) because the reactions were continuously monitored, we needed to minimize evaporation (again, of small volumes) during the time course. We have also performed many gel-based assays that were done at 37 °C (examples shown in Figure 1) and those results were consistent with results obtained with tUI sensor-based assays at 30 °C.</p><p>The k<sub>cat</sub> value we measured is indeed slower than Deol et al., yet the K<sub>M</sub> values are very similar. We want to point out that this is not uncommon in enzyme characterizations — differences among enzyme preparations or the amounts of active enzyme are more likely to be reflected as Vmax differences. For this reason, we produced four different enzyme preps (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B) and characterized each by Ub-AMC hydrolysis. We tried two different procedures (co-purified NS-UCH37-RPN13C and co-purified NS-UCH37-RPN13FL) to produce identical proteins as described by Deol et al.</p><p>Previously, when we and independently Sahtoe et al., had reported the kinetic parameters of Ub-AMC hydrolysis by UCH37-RPN13, we obtained very similar values. Using this criterion of specific activity of Ub-AMC hydrolysis, we are confident that the enzyme activity and quantitation we report are reliable. The k<sub>cat</sub> values for K6/K48 Ub3 hydrolysis reported by Deol et al. ,varied over a 5-fold range (i.e., 16 min-1 (Figure 3F), 9 min-1 (Figure S3C) and 3 min-1 (Figure S4D)). Without careful analyses using a common substrate (e.g., Ub-AMC), direct comparison of the two studies probably is problematic. In Figure 1D of Deol et al., in which 1 μm UCH37 was used with 10 μm Ub3, the relative intensities of the two Coomassie-stained protein bands are quite close. In comparison, Figure 1A in our paper shows a gel with 1 μm UCH37 and 5 μm Ub3 stained by Coomassie as well; the relative intensities of those protein bands are very different. Currently we are unable to account for these discrepancies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) While the biophysical measurements were crystal clear, aspects of the manuscript dealing with proteasomal foci formation and especially RAD23B accumulation were unclear as to what precise conclusion was arrived at by the authors. RAD23B did not appear to show any binding preference in their assays for example and they did not speculate further. These experiments almost felt like an attempt to distinguish the current manuscript from previous literature that had already demonstrated impaired proteasomal function due to UCH37 knockouts. The authors should clarify in the text whether they envision that foci are formed because of the accumulation of polyubiquitylated substrates, or, if foci formation occurs first, which then leads to the accumulation of polyubiquitylated substrates. If it is the former, isn't foci formation simply one of the many physiological outcomes from a blocked proteasome that is still recruiting polyubiquitylated species which in turn recruit more proteasomes? If there is something unique about the clustering of proteasomes in this manner, the authors should definitely highlight this unique aspect of UCH-37 function.</p></disp-quote><p>In the absence of an applied stress, proteasome foci are rare, although less rare in the UCH37KO cells (Figure 5D). Upon sucrose or arsenite stress, foci and the consequence of perturbing UCH37 (i.e., UCH37KO, C88A and EWI) become much more obvious. We agree with the reviewer that this most likely reflects impaired proteasome function. However, we cannot differentiate whether foci formation was promoted because of substrates that accumulated prior to the stress or if substrates accumulated after the stress due to poor degradation. In either case, while the importance of UCH37 in stress response might have been predictable, it nevertheless had not been addressed.</p><p>For many years, we have known that RAD23B was highly enriched in UCH37-C88A proteasomes. With the report from Deol et al., logically we hypothesized that RAD23B might prefer branched chains. Although it was disappointing to find that RAD23B did not exhibit such a preference with Ub3-size chains, we feel that the result nonetheless will contribute to efforts to better understand the signals and dynamics of stress-induced Ub-rich inclusions. How branched poly Ub promotes substrate degradation by the proteasome, whether branched chains are produced under those stress conditions, and whether they are required for proteasome foci to form all remain open questions. These are especially relevant since the report in 2020 by Yasuda et al., that sucrose-induced proteasome foci depend on RAD23B. Given our finding that RAD23B does not have a branched chain preference, we think it is unlikely that branched chains are required.</p></body></sub-article></article>
