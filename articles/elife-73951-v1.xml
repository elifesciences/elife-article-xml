An increasingly popular approach to predict disease risk in a population is to derive weighted scores by summing the number of risk increasing variants that participants harbour. These are typically referred to as ‘polygenic scores’ (PGS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Torkamani et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lewis and Vassos, 2020</xref>). In the last decade, PGS have emerged as powerful tools for predicting lifelong risk of disease, which is predominantly due to the dramatic increase in sample sizes of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and their continued success in uncovering trait-associated genetic variants across the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Visscher et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, PGS have utility in a causal inference setting to establish causal effects between risk factors and disease outcomes, as well as to help elucidate putative diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for disease incidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Richardson et al., 2019b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Holmes and Davey Smith, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ritchie et al., 2021a</xref>).</p><p>The human metabolome consists of over 100,000 small molecules and is a rich source of potential risk factors and biomarkers, as well as therapeutic targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Holmes et al., 2021</xref>), for complex traits and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gallois et al., 2019</xref>). Many circulating metabolic traits studied to date have a large heritable component as demonstrated by GWAS endeavours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Suhre et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">MacTel Consortium et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting that they have a polygenic architecture. In-depth molecular profiling has recently been undertaken in the UK Biobank (UKB) study using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to capture measures of 249 circulating metabolites in approximately 120,000 participants who also have genotype data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Julkunen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sudlow et al., 2015</xref>). The 249 metabolite measurements include the particle concentration, size, and composition of 14 lipoprotein subclasses, as well as the levels of phospholipids, fatty acids, amino acids, ketone bodies, and other biomarkers as discussed in a recent review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ala-Korpela et al., 2022</xref>). This resource therefore provides an unprecedented opportunity to characterize metabolic profiles for disease risk by leveraging genome-wide variation captured by PGS. There are multiple advantages to this approach over conventional observational associations between metabolites and complex traits or endpoints. For example, as UKB is a prospective cohort study many diseases have low prevalence, such as Alzheimer’s disease which typically has a late onset. In contrast, evaluations using PGS will likely yield higher statistical power given that a continuous genetic score will be analysed for all participants in UKB based on their liability to disease.</p><p>In this study, we sought to construct an atlas of associations between 125 PGS and the 249 circulating metabolic traits in the UKB study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We demonstrate the usefulness of this atlas in terms of highlighting putative risk factors and biomarkers for disease risk and advocate the use of an approach known as Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate whether a causal relationship may underlie findings (Supplementary Note 2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davey Smith and Ebrahim, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davey Smith and Hemani, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sanderson et al., 2022</xref>). As an exemplar, we apply MR systematically to investigate all PGS associations highlighted from a hypothesis-free scan of the inflammatory marker glycoprotein acetyls (GlycA). Furthermore, all PGS analyses were initially conducted in the full UKB sample, as well as in sex-stratified samples and age tertiles as proposed previously to evaluate the influence of medication use on findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bell et al., 2022</xref>). As the age of individuals in UKB is unlikely to induce sources of biases into analyses (e.g. collider bias), age-dependent stratification allows comparisons between the youngest and oldest tertiles in UKB where the level of medication use is likely to vary between groups. Stratification on medication use, by contrast, would introduce collider bias. Together our findings provide valuable insights into the effects of PGS on metabolic markers which may influence hypothesis generation and facilitate similar analyses to those presented in this paper.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A schematic diagram depicting the data composition and analytical approach undertaken in this study.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-73951-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Constructing an atlas of polygenic score associations across the human metabolome</title><p>We obtained genome-wide summary statistics for 125 different complex traits and diseases from large-scale GWAS and constructed PGS for each of these in the UKB study. The majority of these summary statistics were obtained from the OpenGWAS platform and encompassed traits and disease outcomes from across the human phenome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Elsworth et al., 2020</xref>). GWAS were identified based on those conducted in populations of European descent given that our analysis in UKB was based on the European subset with NMR data. Furthermore, we identified studies which did not include the UKB in their study to avoid overlapping samples between PGS construction and analysis with metabolic traits. Full details for all GWAS can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>. Two versions of each PGS were built using different thresholds for variant-trait associations (P) and linkage disequilibrium (LD; <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>). These were (1) ‘lenient’ thresholds of p &lt; 0.05 and <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> &lt; 0.1 and (2) a ‘stringent’ threshold of p &lt; 5 × 10<sup>−8</sup> and <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> &lt; 0.001. PGS were generated using the software PLINK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2015</xref>) with LD being calculated using a reference panel of 10,000 randomly selected unrelated UKB individuals of European descent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kibinge et al., 2020</xref>). The specific weights for clumped variants used in all PGS can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://tinyurl.com/PRSweights">https://tinyurl.com/PRSweights</ext-link>.</p><p>We investigated the association between each PGS in turn with 249 circulating metabolites measured using targeted high-throughput NMR metabolomics from Nightingale Health Ltd (biomarker quantification version 2020) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Julkunen et al., 2021</xref>). Our final sample size of <italic>n</italic> = 83,004 was determined based on individuals with both genotype and circulating metabolites data after removing participants with withdrawn consent, evidence of genetic relatedness or who were not of ‘white European ancestry’ based on a <italic>K</italic>-means clustering (<italic>K</italic> = 4). All PGS were standardized to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 and similarly all metabolites were subject to inverse rank normalization transformations prior to analysis allowing cross-PGS/metabolite comparisons to be made. Analyses were conducted using linear regression adjusting for age, sex, and the top 10 principal components (PCs).</p><p>To disseminate all findings from this large-scale analysis we have developed a web application (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mrcieu.mrsoftware.org/metabolites_PRS_atlas/">http://mrcieu.mrsoftware.org/metabolites_PRS_atlas/</ext-link>) to query and visualize metabolic signatures for a given PGS. In this paper, we have discussed findings using PGS that were derived using the more lenient criteria (i.e. p &lt; 0.05 and <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> &lt; 0.1), although all findings based on both thresholds can be found in the web atlas. PC analysis suggested that the first 19 PCs captured 95% of the variance in the NMR metabolites data (whereas the first ten PCs captured 90% and the first 41 PCs captured 99% of the variance) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>). We therefore have applied a heuristic of p &lt; 0.05/19 in this manuscript to account for multiple testing of the associations between any single PGS and the NMR metabolic traits for downstream analyses, although users are able to download the full results to apply whatever correction they see fit. For all other analyses (e.g. associations between metabolic traits and all PGS), we apply a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 0.05 calculated from the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure to correct for multiple testing. Based on the FDR threshold of 0.05, there were a total of 5445 associations between PGS derived (derived based on ‘lenient criteria’ with p &lt; 0.05 variants) in the full sample and NMR-assessed circulating metabolic traits. Heatmaps depicting the <italic>Z</italic> scores of all PGS–metabolic trait associations can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>. The PGS with the largest number of associations robust to multiple testing corrections was body mass index (BMI) (<italic>n</italic> = 217) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1d</xref>). Our atlas also includes sex-stratified estimates for PGS weighted by GWAS undertaken in female only (such as breast cancer and age at menarche) and male only (e.g. prostate cancer) populations, as well as sex-stratified estimates in both females and males separately for all other PGS–metabolite associations. We encourage users interested in these sex-stratified estimates to interpret them with caution however, given the widespread sex-differential participation bias in UKB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pirastu et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In this paper, we provide several examples of how results from this atlas can be used to generate hypotheses and pave the way for in-depth and careful evaluations of associations between PGS and circulating traits. Specifically, we believe our findings can facilitate a ‘reverse gear Mendelian randomization’ approach to disentangle whether associations likely reflect metabolic traits acting as a cause or consequence of disease risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Holmes and Davey Smith, 2019</xref>) as illustrated using triglyceride-rich very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles in the next section. Furthermore, in-depth evaluations allow careful consideration of appropriate instrumental variables for circulating metabolites which can be a challenging task as highlighted in our exemplar analysis of GlycA. Finally, we provide examples of how the plethora of sensitivity analyses within our atlas can help users further investigate the robustness of findings.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Orienting the direction of effect between putative causal relationships using Mendelian randomization</title><p>Many top associations across PGS were consistent with the known underlying biology of their corresponding diseases, as well as various proof of concepts that associations between PGS and metabolic traits may reflect both causes of disease and consequences of genetic liability towards disease. For example, we applied MR to further evaluate associations highlighted in our atlas with VLDL particles, where both VLDL particle average diameter size and concentration were associated with the PGS for BMI (Beta = 0.04, 95% CI = 0.033 to 0.046, p = 3.53 × 10<sup>−35</sup> and Beta = 0.012, 95% CI = 0.006 to 0.019, p = 2.7 × 10<sup>–4</sup>, respectively) and also coronary heart disease (CHD) liability (Beta = 0.026, 95% CI = 0.019 to 0.032, p = 2.12 × 10<sup>–15</sup> and Beta = 0.035, 95% CI = 0.028 to 0.042, p = 2.73 × 10<sup>–24</sup>, respectively). Conducting bidirectional MR suggested that the associations with average diameter of VLDL particles are likely attributed to a consequence of BMI and CHD liability as opposed to the size of VLDL particles having a causal influence on these outcomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1e</xref>). In contrast, MR analyses suggested that the concentration of VLDL particles increases risk of CHD (Beta = 1.28 per 1-SD change in VLDL particle concentration, 95% CI = 1.25 to 1.65, p = 2.8 × 10<sup>–7</sup>) which may explain associations between the CHD PGS and this metabolic trait within our atlas. Similar MR analyses to investigate findings from our atlas can be conducted using the full GWAS summary statistics for all 249 circulating metabolic traits available via the GWAS catalog (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/</ext-link>) under accession IDs GCST90092803 to GCST90093051 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Richardson et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Along with comparing metabolic signatures for a given PGS, our atlas facilitates hypothesis-free evaluations to inspect all PGS associations for a given metabolic trait. As an example of this, we have undertaken such an analysis based on the associations between all 125 PGS in our atlas with circulating GlycA. GlycA is a biomarker of chronic inflammation and has been found to predict various endpoints, including types of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and all-cause mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lawler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Connelly et al., 2017</xref>). Although previous studies of genetically predicted GlycA have been conducted for hypotheses regarding single endpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lord et al., 2021</xref>), whether or not circulating GlycA has a causal effect on outcomes from across the disease spectrum has yet to be comprehensively investigated. The role of GlycA is important to establish given the emerging role of inflammation as a pharmacologically modifiable pathway for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease.</p><p>There were 44 PGS associations with GlycA which were robust to an FDR &lt;5%, used as a heuristic to determine which results to investigate in further detail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1g</xref>). We firstly applied the inverse variance weighted (IVW) MR method to systematically assess whether genetic liability to any of these disease endpoints or complex traits provided evidence of an effect on GlycA levels. Of the 44 PGS, 36 contain one or more genetic variants that reached genome-wide significance which can be used as instrumental variables for MR. In total, eight of these exposures provided evidence of a genetically predicted effect from MR analyses based on FDR &lt;5% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1g</xref>), which included anthropometric traits such as BMI (Beta = 0.16 SD increase in GlycA levels per 1 SD increase in BMI, 95% CI = 0.11 to 0.21, FDR = 1.59 × 10<sup>–8</sup>) and genetic liability to cigarettes smoked per day (Beta = 0.27 SD change GlycA levels per 1 SD increase in cigarettes per day, 95% CI = 0.20 to 0.34, FDR = 2.84 × 10<sup>–12</sup>). Estimates based on the IVW method were typically supported by the weighted median approach, although only cigarettes smoked per day were supported by both the weighed median (Beta = 0.24, 95% CI = −0.16 to 0.33, p = 2.08 × 10<sup>–8</sup>) and MR-Egger (Beta = 0.22, 95% CI = 0.07 to 0.37, p = 0.02) methods (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1h</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Forest plots depicting results from a systematic evaluation of 125 polygenic scores and their associations with circulating glycoprotein acetyls (GlycA).</title><p>Associations were assessed by linear regression on up to 83,004 individuals in the UK Biobank.

For example, UKB participants undergoing statin therapy will likely have altered levels of lipoprotein lipid metabolites compared to others. However, adjusting for statin therapy as a covariate or by stratification can induce collider bias, which may be encountered when investigating the relationship between two factors (such as genetic liability towards CHD and a lipoprotein lipid metabolite) when both influence a third factor (e.g. statin therapy) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In particular due to the large sample sizes provided, collider bias in the UKB study has been shown to distort findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Griffith et al., 2020</xref>) and in extreme cases can even result in opposite conclusions being drawn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Richardson et al., 2019a</xref>). Therefore, to investigate the influence of medication use on the results within our atlas, we repeated all analyses stratified by age tertiles as proposed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bell et al., 2022</xref>), given that age is very unlikely to act as a collider between PGS and circulating metabolites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), and medication use is lower in the younger tertiles. Comparisons between the youngest and oldest tertiles in UKB can be systematically investigated and visualized using our web application to evaluate how medications may bias findings.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Directed acyclic graphs illustrating the potential collider bias involved in the causal relationship between the coronary artery disease polygenic score and circulating metabolites.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The likelihood of participants in UK Biobank taking medication such as statins is influenced by having a higher genetic predisposition to coronary artery disease but may also be influenced by certain metabolic traits measured on the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) panel (e.g. having elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels). Either stratifying or adjusting for statin use in regression models may therefore induce collider bias into the association between disease liability and metabolic traits. (<bold>B</bold>) Age is commonly adjusted for in association analyses due to its role as a confounder and cannot be a collider (i.e. exposures and outcomes cannot influence the age of participants). Stratifying samples by age therefore enables the analysis of exposure–outcome associations in a group of participants with relatively consistent confounding effect from age, leading to more robust association estimates in the lower age tertile where the percentage of participants who are regularly taking medication is low. Furthermore, comparisons with participants in the highest age tertile can help highlight associations between polygenic scores and metabolic traits most likely distorted by potential colliders such as statins in the full sample.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-73951-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><p>As an example of this, in the full UKB sample there were 193 circulating metabolites associated with the PGS for CHD (constructed using genetic variants with p &lt; 0.05 and <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> &lt; 0.1) under a p value &lt;0.05/19 for multiple testing correction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1n</xref>). The vast majority of these were lipoprotein lipid traits, which are likely capturing causal risk factors for CHD. Amongst the top associations for this PGS was apolipoprotein B (apo B) (Beta = 0.027, 95% CI = 0.020 to 0.033, p = 7.2 × 10<sup>–15</sup>), which acts as an index of the number of circulating atherogenic lipoprotein particles and has been postulated previously to be the predominating lipoprotein lipid trait indexing CHD risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ference et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sniderman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Richardson et al., 2020b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Richardson et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Evaluating this association between age tertiles allowed us to investigate whether it may be influenced by medications in UKB, such as the impact of statin therapy on lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, which apo B particles carry. In the youngest tertile (mean age = 47.3 years, 5% statin users), the association between the CHD PGS with apo B was markedly stronger than in the total sample (Beta = 0.059, 95% CI = 0.048 to 0.070, p &lt; 1.6 × 10<sup>–26</sup>). In stark contrast, there was weak evidence of an inverse association between apo B and the CHD PGS in the oldest tertile (mean age = 65.3 years, 29% statin users) (Beta = −0.007, 95% CI = −0.019 to 0.004, p = 0.223), which is likely attributed to the higher proportion of participants undergoing statin therapy in this sample. Similarly, concentrations of VLDL, LDL, and IDL provided evidence of a positive association with the CHD PGS in the youngest tertile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), whereas the corresponding associations in the oldest tertile provided weak evidence of association (and in some cases reversed direction entirely) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

To provide insight into this issue, we constructed PGS excluding variants within the regions of the genome which encode the genes for 13 major regulators of NMR lipoprotein lipids signals which captured 75% of the gene–metabolite associations in the Finnish Metabolic Syndrome In Men (METSIM) cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gallois et al., 2019</xref>).

Our results can be used to help prioritize findings worthy of follow-up, using techniques such as MR, as a means of disentangling putative causal and non-causal relationships underlying associations between PGS and circulating biomarkers. Furthermore, conducting all analyses within age tertiles illustrates the potential of medication use within the UKB population to bias relationships within our atlas of results. These results should help highlight disease–metabolic trait relationships where researchers should exercise caution when interpreting findings from their own analyses of the recently generated NMR metabolites data in UKB, which are due to be available in all ~500,000 participants in the forthcoming years.</p><p>Amongst the thousands of PGS associations identified in this study with a p value &lt;0.05/19, we observed an enrichment of scores derived using GWAS of anthropometric traits. This was exemplified by the waist circumference PGS which yielded the largest number of associations in our atlas (<italic>n</italic> = 212). Previous studies in the field have demonstrated the strong influence that adiposity has on circulating traits from across the metabolome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Würtz et al., 2014</xref>), and indeed across the proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Folkersen et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, as shown previously by an MR study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bell et al., 2022</xref>), certain associations with the BMI PGS may be due to the influence of medication use in the UKB sample, for example those related to LDL (e.g. BMI PGS on total lipids in LDL: Beta = −0.020, 95% CI = 0.027 to −0.013, p &lt; 6.17 × 10<sup>–9</sup>). In our atlas, evidence of these associations strongly attenuated in the youngest age tertile, where the influence of such factors in the UKB population may be weakest (e.g. total lipids in LDL from youngest age tertile: Beta = 0.005, 95% CI = −0.006 to 0.016, p = 0.35). In addition to the striking difference highlighted in our study between the CHD PGS and apolipoprotein B across age tertiles, findings such as this further emphasize the importance of evaluating results from the full sample analysis together with those derived in age-stratified subsamples. Moreover, we suggest that users interested in the sex-stratified estimates within our atlas should interpret them in conjunction with estimates derived across age tertiles as in this example, given that the proportions of males and females in UKB taking certain medications may differ (e.g. statins).</p><p>As an exemplar, we conducted a hypothesis-free evaluation of one of the metabolic traits on the UKB NMR panel, GlycA, as a means of demonstrating how findings from our atlas may help generate hypotheses and follow-up analyses. Whilst our MR results indicated that modifiable risk factors such as BMI and cigarette smoking may increase levels of this circulating inflammatory biomarker, they suggest that targeting GlycA itself is unlikely to yield a beneficial therapeutic effect on the complex traits and disease endpoints evaluated in this study. This highlights the value of findings from our atlas, complemented by approaches such as MR, to help both prioritize and deprioritize circulating metabolic traits for further evaluation. Similar hypothesis-free evaluations on the other 248 metabolic traits can be routinely undertaken using our web tool, in addition to evaluations using the more stringent PGS construction criteria of p &lt; 5 × 10<sup>–8</sup> and <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> &lt; 0.001. We reiterate the importance of using approaches such as MR (including sensitivity analyses, which are at least partially robust to various forms of pleiotropy) to formally assess putative causal relationships which may underlie findings in our atlas however, as well as to help orient their directionality. This is particularly important given that PGS may be more prone to recapitulating sources of bias commonly encountered in observational studies in comparison to formal MR analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Richardson et al., 2019b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ritchie et al., 2021a</xref>). We likewise conducted bidirectional MR to demonstrate that associations between the CHD PGS and VLDL particle size likely reflect an effect of CHD liability on this metabolic trait. In contrast, the association between the CHD PGS and VLDL concentrations are likely attributed to the causal influence of this metabolic trait on CHD risk, suggesting that it is the concentration of these triglyceride-rich particles that are important in terms of the aetiology of CHD risk as opposed to their actual size. We believe that findings from our atlas, as well as other ongoing efforts which leverage the large-scale NMR data within UKB, should facilitate further granular insight into lipoprotein lipid biology.</p><p>In terms of study limitations, we note that the NMR panel is predominantly focussed on lipoprotein lipids and as such our atlas does not facilitate analyses across the entire metabolome. Availability of metabolomics quantified by other platforms (e.g. mass spectroscopy) in large numbers with GWAS genotyping will aid in this effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">MacTel Consortium et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, whilst these data provide an unparalleled sample size compared to predecessors, findings are based on traits derived from whole blood and may therefore not be reflective of molecular signatures identified in other tissue types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Richardson et al., 2020a</xref>). In terms of interpretation, we emphasize that PGS can capture an estimate of an individual’s lifelong disease risk, and as such results based on the UKB NMR metabolites dataset, measured at a midlife timepoint in the lifecourse in predominantly healthy participants, may differ substantially to metabolomic profiles of patients with a disease. Conversely, findings may hold the potential to highlight biomarkers useful for disease prediction before clinical manifestation, therefore indicating a potential window of opportunity for early detection and/or intervention. Lastly, in this study we leveraged data from the European subset of the UKB study, which may therefore not be representative of individuals from other ancestries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duncan et al., 2019</xref>). Larger sample sizes of non-European individuals with metabolomics data will facilitate analyses in other ancestries once available, in addition to findings from future large-scale GWAS which have been principally confined to individuals of European descent to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sirugo et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>We envisage that findings from our atlas will motivate future study hypotheses and help prioritize (and deprioritize) circulating metabolic traits for further in-depth research. Although we highlight several key findings in this manuscript, all our findings can be queried using our web application which provides a platform to inform researchers in the field planning similar analyses. Similar evaluations to those conducted in this manuscript should help develop a deeper understanding into how circulating metabolic traits contribute towards complex trait variation and assess their putative mediatory roles along the causal pathways between modifiable lifestyle risk factors and disease endpoints.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Data sources</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>The UKB study</title><p>Metabolic profiling was undertaken on a random subset of individuals from the UKB study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sudlow et al., 2015</xref>) (range between 116,353 and 121,695).

Instrumental variables for alpha1-acid glycoprotein were identified usinge eQTLs (p &lt; 5 × 10<sup>–8</sup>, <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> &lt; 0.001) for <italic>ORM1</italic> from the eQTLGen Consortium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Võsa et al., 2021</xref>) due to a lack of available protein data. Genetic instruments for haptoglobin, alpha1-antitrypsin, alpha1-antichymotrypsin, and transferrin were identified using pQTLs (p &lt; 5 × 10<sup>–8</sup>, <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> &lt; 0.001) for these proteins identified from 35,559 Icelanders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ferkingstad et al., 2021</xref>). To identify cis-acting instruments for these five proteins, we restricted e/pQTL associations to variants located within 1 Mb around their encoding genes: <italic>ORM1</italic> (encoding alpha1-acid glycoprotein; Ensembl ID: ENSG00000229314), <italic>HP</italic> (encoding haptoglobin; Ensembl ID: ENSG00000257017), <italic>SERPINA1</italic> (encoding alpha1-antitrypsin; Ensembl ID: ENSG00000197249), <italic>SERPINA3</italic> (encoding alpha1-antichymotrypsin; Ensembl ID: ENSG00000196136), or <italic>TF</italic> (encoding transferrin; Ensembl ID: ENSG00000196136). Independent instruments were identified using the same protocol as above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kibinge et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-4"><title>MR analyses</title><p>MR analyses were undertaken using the ‘TwoSampleMR’ package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hemani et al., 2018</xref>) to estimate the bidirectional effects between PGS traits/disease endpoints and metabolic traits, including GlycA and VLDL particle size. This was firstly estimated using the IVW method, which takes the SNP-outcome estimates and regresses them on those for the SNP-exposure associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burgess et al., 2013</xref>), followed by the weighted median and MR-Egger methods which are considered to be more robust to horizontal pleiotropy than the IVW approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bowden et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bowden et al., 2016</xref>). If only one SNP is available as genetic instrument, Wald ratio estimates were calculated by dividing the SNP-outcome estimates by the SNP-exposure estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burgess et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>F</italic>-Statistics were calculated to assess weak instrument bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burgess and Thompson, 2013</xref>). Benjamini–Hochberg FDR threshold of less than 5% was applied as a heuristic to account for multiple testing in the results.</p><p>Forest and circos plots in this study were generated using the R package ‘ggplot’ v3.3.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ginestet, 2011</xref>). Heatmaps were generated using the R package ‘pheatmap’ v1.0.12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kolde, 2015</xref>). The web application was developed using the R package ‘shiny’ v1.0.4.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2020</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Carlos Isales as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Scott Ritchie (Reviewer #2); Maik Pietzner (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) While this work provides a potentially important resource for the community, the examples provided tend to be illustrative, and do not really do justice to the resource. We strongly encourage the authors to revisit the data analysis for more-compelling examples of the types of impactful work that can be achieved using this resource. How and why should users want to use this Atlas?</p><p>2) One key question is whether these analyses bring us closer to causality compared to 'classical' observational associations, given LD confounding and strong metabolite variants included in PRS driving the associations. For example, how robust are PRS associations to the exclusion of individual regions?

We have recently published a paper doing so for cardiometabolic PRS and protein levels (Ritchie et al., 2021a) and this has been available as a preprint in various forms since 2019. This should be noted and cited appropriately at the relevant points in the introduction and discussion.</p><p>The associations in the atlas for the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) are invalid. As the authors note in the methods, PRSs for these two traits are constructed from GWAS that include UK Biobank samples. PRSs are invalid when used in samples that contributed to their underlying GWAS (Lambert et al., 2021; Wand et al., 2021; Wray et al., 2013) as this causes them to have dramatically inflated associations. Associations for these two PRS should be removed from the atlas and study, or if the authors think these two traits are of critical interest, an alternate source of GWAS that do not include UK Biobank participants should be used to construct these two PRSs.</p><p>We have found significant sources of technical variation exist in the NMR metabolomics data for UK Biobank (Ritchie et al., 2021b), which may confound some of the PRS associations here. Of particular concern in the context of this study are the presence of outlier shipping plates, on which samples have systematically high (or low) concentrations of non-biological origin (see Figure 5 in Ritchie et al. 2021b). This affects up to 5% of samples depending on the biomarker, but will have an outsized effect on associations as they result in samples being spuriously located at the extremities of biomarker distributions. I.e. this may result in associations being weaker or not significant, or less likely, false positives may be introduced if outlier plates happen to correlate with PRS. There are also a small number of biomarkers significantly impacted by other sources of technical variation, e.g. drift over time within spectrometer, or sample degradation due to extended time between sample preparation and sample measurement. We have made available an R package: ukbnmr (https://github.com/sritchie73/ukbnmr), for correcting for this technical variation, and removing samples on these outlier plates. Although this preprint is still under review, we would suggest using this package to remove the described technical variation, or at least checking whether doing so significantly changes associations in the atlas.</p><p>There are also major biological determinants of NMR biomarker concentrations that have not been accounted for, and thus may confound, PRS to biomarker associations. In addition to age, sex, and 10 genetic principal components that the authors already adjust for, NMR biomarker concentrations are also strongly correlated with body mass index (BMI), fasting time, and lipid lowering medication (statin) usage (see Figure 8 in Ritchie et al., 2021b). The atlas would be greatly improved by either appropriately accounting for these in the basic models, or including additional results using models that do so.</p><p>Regarding statin usage in particular, we appreciate that the authors have conducted a separate age-stratified analysis to evaluate the impact of medication usage on PRS to biomarker associations. However, the fact remains that statin usage will be confounding the PRS to biomarker associations in the main results (e.g. by artificially lowering LDL cholesterol in people at high CHD PRS). This confounding is typically removed in one of two ways: either (1) fitting associations excluding participants taking statins, or (2) applying biomarker-specific correction factors to concentrations prior to association analysis, such as those estimated by (Kofink et al., 2017; Sliz et al., 2018). The latter is probably the better approach as the former is likely to introduce further bias towards young and healthy participants.</p><p>The atlas would also be potentially strengthened by including additional results for sex-stratified models. We have observed significant differences in NMR biomarker concentrations between males and females, so it would be interesting to see if these result in any differences in PRS associations which may arise despite PRSs largely being constructed from autosomal GWAS.</p><p>Regarding the bi-directional Mendelian randomization analysis of GlycA, we would suggest using an alternative biomarker as exemplar in the study, as GlycA is heterogeneous and needs to be more carefully instrumented than has been done in the study currently. GlycA is an NMR signal that quantifies the total concentrations of five proteins in circulation (Otvos et al., 2015): α-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), α-1-antitrypsin (AAT), α-1-antichymotrypsin (AACT), haptoglobin (HP), and transferrin (TF). These are acute-phase reactants whose concentrations each change in response to acute inflammation or in chronic inflammation (Connelly et al., 2017). Moreover these changes are differential with respect to each other, and over time (Ebersole and Cappelli, 2000; Gabay and Kushner, 1999). Further, a single GlycA measurement cannot be simply decomposed as two people with the same GlycA concentration can have different concentrations of the underlying proteins (Ritchie et al., 2019). This heterogeneity means that using genome-wide significant QTLs for GlycA is unlikely to be appropriate as these QTLs may include (1) protein-QTLs for one or more of the five proteins GlycA captures, and (2) signals involved in initiation of acute-phase response (e.g. interleukin-6 signalling pathways). To use GlycA as an exposure in Mendelian randomization analysis, the QTLs selected as instruments should be restricted to cis-pQTLs for the five proteins. These signals may need to be treated separately, as in the scenario GlycA is truly causal, it is unlikely that all five proteins are causal, or that they have similar causal effect sizes.</p><p>Data availability: the PRS should also be made publicly available, e.g. downloadable via the atlas. These should include at minimum: the set of variants in each PRS, variant identifier information (e.g. chromosome and position), genome build, effect allele, and weight (β or log odds from the underlying GWAS).</p><p>References</p><p>Bretherick AD, Canela-Xandri O, Joshi PK, Clark DW, Rawlik K, Boutin TS, Zeng Y, Amador C, Navarro P, Rudan I, Wright AF, Campbell H, Vitart V, Hayward C, Wilson JF, Tenesa A, Ponting CP, Baillie JK, Haley C. 2020.

The NMR platform used by the authors measures only a small number of small molecules and the vast majority of the derived measures refer to characteristics of lipoprotein particles, which are not 'classical' metabolites. The paper would benefit from a paper distinction between both measures. Therefore, it is questionable how many of the 100,000 metabolites mentioned by the authors are captured by the technology used and further it is even of interest how many approximately independent features are indeed captured by the technology. A principal component analysis or similar dimension reduction techniques would provide an important correction/estimate of/to the metabolic space captured. Given the high correlation among the NMR traits, it would be important to state how many likely independent associations have been found, for instance by clumping highly correlated metabolites in clusters, similar as the authors do for SNPs.</p><p>2. I find the section about collider bias in the introduction a bit as surprise and it is unclear to me, how this relates to the overall aim of the study. The high amount of self-citation in this section and in general throughout the paper makes me wonder, how much of an issue this really is compared to more substantial questions about the suitability of PRS to identify disease biomarkers or causal metabolites.</p><p>3. Investigating different types of genetic scores is a clear strength of this work. However, the study currently stops early leaving important questions unanswered. For instance, how many more 'helpful' associations between PRS and NMR measures are really gained by going genome-wide, that is, how many of the added associations are mainly due to unspecific pleiotropy? The authors have outstanding methodological skills in MR and related causal inference techniques, and I find it somewhat wasted here to go simply for more associations instead of digging into the relevant part, which in turn defines the usefulness of the whole atlas and hence this study. It currently reads mostly like a computational exercise.</p><p>4. In my opinion, the key question is, what do all those associations deliver, do they bring us any closer to causality compared to 'classical' observational associations, given LD confounding and strong metabolite variants included in PRS driving the associations. For example, how robust are PRS associations to the exclusion of single regions, Ritchie et al., 2021 Nat Metab provide a neat framework to address such questions. The APOE example goes in that direction and other locus-specific effects are likely underlying other disease PRS – NMR measure associations.</p><p>5. One might argue that the CKD example is somewhat self-fulling, given that the selection of cases is mainly done based on serum creatinine (or the eGFR derived from creatinine), but is a good example how strong and specific examples might point to disease biomarkers. Are there more examples for a given NMR trait being strongly and possibly specifically associated with a trait or a cluster of highly related traits? I would also tone the creatinine example done, since it is obvious that this marker is used for clinical decision making.</p><p>6. I am not quite sure about the bidirectional MR approach. By only testing diseases for which the PRS showed an association with the metabolite of interest, isn't it quite likely that an effect of the metabolite on the disease would be missed, as one would assume that a true causal association between a metabolite and a disease might well be lost in the large set of SNPs associated with the endpoint of interest.</p><p>7. I disagree with the statement on page 12 that all lipid traits associated with the CHD PRS are causal risk factors, most of them are likely not and the true underlying risk factor or biological mechanism is likely hidden among all those associations. The general inability to distinguish about the causal relevance of all those highly related measures is a massive challenge working with NMR data, in particular given that many are not real measurements but are only derived as proportion from other measures, including apolipoprotein B.</p><p>8. The authors need to do better in distinguishing between all the different lipid measures that are derived from the NMR platform, this is also seen in the discussion of Apo B. Apo B is the main structural protein for many lipoprotein particles of different densities and not just for atherogenic ones.</p><p>9. Instead of stratified analysis, why not correcting for statin intake to estimate lipid levels of participants without the use of statins? What about the effect of many other medications widely prescribed, with strong effects on NMR measures as described in van Duijn et al., Nat Med 2020?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73951.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) While this work provides a potentially important resource for the community, the examples provided tend to be illustrative, and do not really do justice to the resource.

How and why should users want to use this Atlas?</p></disp-quote><p>Many thanks for your comments to help us refine this resource and manuscript. We have now revisited the examples in this manuscript to showcase the value of the PGS atlas with the help of the reviewer comments:</p><p>1. We have undertaken a new application of bi-directional Mendelian randomization (MR) to demonstrate how readers may use this approach to disentangle whether associations in our atlas likely reflect either causes or consequences of PGS traits/diseases. This example is described on page 9 and discussed in the discussion on page 21:</p><p>‘We likewise conducted bi-directional MR to demonstrate that associations between the CHD PGS and VLDL particle size likely reflect an effect of CHD liability on this metabolic trait. In contrast, the association between the CHD PGS and VLDL concentrations are likely attributed to the causal influence of this metabolic trait on CHD risk, suggesting that it is the concentration of these triglyceride-rich particles that are important in terms of the aetiology of CHD risk as opposed to their actual size. We envisage that findings from our atlas, as well as other ongoing efforts which leverage the large-scale NMR data within UKB, should facilitate further granular insight into lipoprotein lipid biology.’</p><p>2. Based on reviewer #2’s comments regarding our previous example using results for GlycA, we have performed further sensitivity analyses to support the conclusions from this example.</p><p>3. Based on reviewer #3’s comments we have included further explanation regarding collider bias as well as a Figure (page 14) to emphasize the importance of age-stratified analyses in our atlas for users to evaluate the robustness of findings.</p><p>4. Finally, we have also recalculated all PGS-metabolite associations in the atlas after removing established lipid loci across the genome based on the publication by Gallois et al., (2019 Nature Communications https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12703-7). As an example of why this sensitivity analysis may be helpful to the user, we compared metabolomic profiles for the anthropometric and the Alzheimer’s disease PGS before and after removing these loci (page 19):</p><p>‘For PGS with these lipid loci excluded, anthropometric traits such as waist-to-hip ratio (N=209), waist circumference (N=206) and body mass index (N=205) still provided strong evidence of association with the majority of metabolic measurements on the NMR panel based on multiple testing corrections. Elsewhere however, the Alzheimer’s disease PGS, which was associated with 60 metabolic traits robust to P&lt;0.05/19 in the initial analysis including these lipid loci (Supplementary Table 17), provided no convincing evidence of association with the 249 circulating metabolites after excluding the lipid loci based on the same multiple testing threshold (Supplementary Table 18). Further inspection suggested that the likely explanation for this were variants located at the <italic>APOE</italic> locus which are recognised to exert their influence on phenotypic traits via horizontally pleiotropic pathways (Ferguson et al., 2020).’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) One key question is whether these analyses bring us closer to causality compared to 'classical' observational associations, given LD confounding and strong metabolite variants included in PRS driving the associations. For example, how robust are PRS associations to the exclusion of individual regions?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. As recommended by reviewer #2 we have looked into the analysis conducted in the Ritchie et al., 2021 Nat Metab paper. The authors examined the association between 5 different genome-wide polygenic scores (PGSs) and systematically removed 1,703 approximately independent LD blocks with replacement in their association analyses.</p><p>We agree that it is very important to consider the contribution of individual gene regions when examining genetic associations. Whilst this was feasible for 5 different PGS in the study by Ritchie et al., this becomes a lot more computational intensive for our study whereby we construct 125 different PGS using 2 different selection criteria. Therefore, we have added a new analysis to evaluate the contribution of 14 previously discovered lipid-associated genes (LIPC, <italic>APOA5</italic>, <italic>CETP</italic>, <italic>PCSK9</italic>, <italic>LDLR</italic>, <italic>GCKR</italic>, <italic>APOC1</italic>, <italic>LPL</italic>, <italic>GALNT2</italic>, <italic>CELSR2</italic>, <italic>TRIB1</italic>, <italic>DOCK7</italic>, <italic>FADS2</italic> and <italic>APOE</italic>) in the PGS-metabolites associations as reported on page 19:</p><p>‘The polygenic nature of complex traits means that the inclusion of highly weighted pleiotropic genetic variants in PGS may introduce bias into genetic associations within our atlas. To provide insight into this issue, we constructed PGS excluding variants within the regions of the genome which encode the genes for 14 major regulators of NMR lipoprotein lipids signals which captured 75% of the gene-metabolite associations in the Finnish Metabolic Syndrome In Men (METSIM) cohort (Gallois et al., 2019). For details of these genes (see Supplementary Table 5).’</p><p>Followed by the example described above to help demonstrate to users to importance of these results for further evaluate the robustness of findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, can we determine whether the associations are causally upstream, or downstream of the identified phenotypes?

This was highlighted by reviewer #2 who notes that challenges of appropriately instrumenting the metabolic trait GlycA which we have also address below in response to their comment. This overall point has been discussed on page 8 of the manuscript:</p><p>‘In this paper, we provide several examples of how results from this atlas can be used to generate hypotheses and pave the way for in-depth and careful evaluations of associations between PGS and circulating traits. Specifically, we believe our findings can facilitate a ‘reverse gear Mendelian randomization’ approach to disentangle whether associations likely reflect metabolic traits acting as a cause or consequence of disease risk (Holmes and Davey Smith, 2019) as illustrated using triglyceride-rich very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles in the next section. Furthermore, in-depth evaluations allow careful consideration of appropriate instrumental variables for circulating metabolites which can be a challenging task as highlighted in our exemplar analysis of glycoprotein acetyls. Finally, we provide examples of how the plethora of sensitivity analyses within our atlas can help users further investigate the robustness of findings.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The atlas would also be potentially strengthened by including additional results for sex-stratified models. Previous work has shown significant differences in NMR biomarker concentrations between males and females, so it would be valuable to see if these result in any differences in PRS associations which may arise despite PRSs largely being constructed from autosomal GWAS.</p></disp-quote><p>Many thanks for this suggestion. We have undertaken extensive analyses to generate all PGS-metabolite association stratified by sex and added these to the web platform. This has been discussed on page 8:</p><p>‘Our atlas also includes sex-stratified estimates for PGS weighted by GWAS undertaken in female only (such as breast cancer and age at menarche) and male only (e.g., prostate cancer) populations, as well as sex-stratified estimates in both females and males separately for all other PGS-metabolite associations. We encourage users interested in these sex-stratified estimates to interpret them with caution however, given the widespread sex-differential participation bias in UKB (Pirastu et al., (2021)).’</p><p>And page 20:</p><p>‘Moreover, we suggest that users interested in the sex-stratified estimates within our atlas should interpret them in conjunction with estimates derived across age tertiles as in this example, given that different proportions of males and females in UKB may be taking certain medications (e.g. statins).’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, the reviewers provide numerous additional specific and insightful comments; we strongly encourage the authors to consider these points seriously in their revisions.</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>Some of the text on figures is very small and it may be worth revisiting figure design.</p></disp-quote><p>Many thanks for this suggestion.

We have observed significant differences in NMR biomarker concentrations between males and females, so it would be interesting to see if these result in any differences in PRS associations which may arise despite PRSs largely being constructed from autosomal GWAS.</p></disp-quote><p>We have undertaken extensive analyses to additionally evaluate sex-stratified associations (page 8):</p><p>‘Our atlas also includes sex-stratified estimates for PGS weighted by GWAS undertaken in female only (such as breast cancer and age at menarche) and male only (e.g., prostate cancer) populations, as well as sex-stratified estimates in both females and males separately for all other PGS-metabolite associations.

GlycA is an NMR signal that quantifies the total concentrations of five proteins in circulation (Otvos et al., 2015): α-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), α-1-antitrypsin (AAT), α-1-antichymotrypsin (AACT), haptoglobin (HP), and transferrin (TF). These are acute-phase reactants whose concentrations each change in response to acute inflammation or in chronic inflammation (Connelly et al., 2017). Moreover these changes are differential with respect to each other, and over time (Ebersole and Cappelli, 2000; Gabay and Kushner, 1999). Further, a single GlycA measurement cannot be simply decomposed as two people with the same GlycA concentration can have different concentrations of the underlying proteins (Ritchie et al., 2019). This heterogeneity means that using genome-wide significant QTLs for GlycA is unlikely to be appropriate as these QTLs may include (1) protein-QTLs for one or more of the five proteins GlycA captures, and (2) signals involved in initiation of acute-phase response (e.g. interleukin-6 signalling pathways). To use GlycA as an exposure in Mendelian randomization analysis, the QTLs selected as instruments should be restricted to cis-pQTLs for the five proteins. These signals may need to be treated separately, as in the scenario GlycA is truly causal, it is unlikely that all five proteins are causal, or that they have similar causal effect sizes.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We have repeated the GlycA Mendelian randomization analysis using the pQTLs (for AAT, AACT, HP and TF) and eQTL (for AGP) of these proteins. Detailed methods are presented on page 26 of the manuscript:</p><p>‘The NMR signal of serum GlycA is contributed by five acute-phase proteins (alpha1-acid glycoprotein, haptoglobin, alpha1-antitrypsin, alpha1-antichymotrypsin, and transferrin) (Otvos <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015). Thus, another set of genetic instruments for GlycA were selected among SNPs strongly associated with these five proteins for further evaluation of the genetically predicted effect of GlycA. Instrumental variables for alpha1-acid glycoprotein are identified from the gene expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) (P&lt;5x10<sup>-8</sup>, r<sup>2</sup>&lt;0.001) of ORM1 from the eQTLGen Consortium (Võsa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021). Genetic instruments for haptoglobin, alpha1-antitrypsin, alpha1-antichymotrypsin, and transferrin are their protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) (P&lt;5x10<sup>-8</sup>, r<sup>2</sup>&lt;0.001) identified from 35,559 Icelanders (Ferkingstad <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021). To identify cis-acting genetic variants, genetic variants of the five proteins are limited to those located within 1Mb around their encoding genes: ORM1 (encoding alpha1-acid glycoprotein; Ensembl ID: ENSG00000229314), HP (encoding haptoglobin; Ensembl ID: ENSG00000257017), SERPINA1 (encoding alpha1-antitrypsin; Ensembl ID: ENSG00000197249), SERPINA3 (encoding alpha1-antichymotrypsin; Ensembl ID: ENSG00000196136) or TF (encoding transferrin; Ensembl ID: ENSG00000196136). GWAS summary statistics of the protein data were performed using an in-house reference panel consisting of 10,000 randomly selected European participants of the UK Biobank (Kibinge <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020) in PLINK v1.90. The eQTL data from the eQTLGene Consortium was extracted from the OpenGWAS portal.’</p><p>Findings can be found on page 11 of the manuscript:</p><p>‘We also conducted further sensitivity analyses given that the NMR signal of GlycA is a composite signal contributed by the glycan <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine residues on five acute-phase proteins, including alpha1-acid glycoprotein, haptoglobin, alpha1-antitrypsin, alpha1-antichymotrypsin, and transferrin (Otvos <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015). Using cis-acting plasma protein (where possible) and expression quantitative trait loci (pQTLs and eQTLs) as instrumental variables for these proteins (Supplementary Table 12) did not provide convincing evidence that they play a role in disease risk for associations between PGS and GlycA (Supplementary Table 13). The only effect estimate robust to multiple testing was found for higher genetically predicted alpha1-antitrypsin levels on γ glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels (Β=0.05 SD change in GGT per 1 SD increase in protein levels, 95% CI=0.03 to 0.07, FDR=3.6x10<sup>-3</sup>), although this was not replicated when using estimates of genetic associations with GGT levels from a larger GWAS conducted in the UK Biobank data (Β=1.6x10<sup>-3</sup>, 95% CI=-6.9 x10<sup>-3</sup> to 0.01, P = 0.71).

These should include at minimum: the set of variants in each PRS, variant identifier information (e.g. chromosome and position), genome build, effect allele, and weight (β or log odds from the underlying GWAS).</p></disp-quote><p>All weights used to generate the PGS in our atlas are now available at https://tinyurl.com/PGSweights as mentioned on page 7:</p><p>‘The specific weights for clumped variants used in all PGS can be found at https://tinyurl.com/PGSweights.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Apart from the general comments made above, I have the following more specific comments that could possibly improve the study by Fang et al.:</p><p>1. The NMR platform used by the authors measures only a small number of small molecules and the vast majority of the derived measures refer to characteristics of lipoprotein particles, which are not 'classical' metabolites. The paper would benefit from a paper distinction between both measures. Therefore, it is questionable how many of the 100,000 metabolites mentioned by the authors are captured by the technology used and further it is even of interest how many approximately independent features are indeed captured by the technology. A principal component analysis or similar dimension reduction techniques would provide an important correction/estimate of/to the metabolic space captured. Given the high correlation among the NMR traits, it would be important to state how many likely independent associations have been found, for instance by clumping highly correlated metabolites in clusters, similar as the authors do for SNPs.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested we have conducted a PCA analysis to investigate the amount of metabolic space captured. Findings are reported on page 8:</p><p>‘Principal component analysis suggested that the first 19 principal components (PCs) captured 95% of the variance in the NMR metabolites data (whereas the first ten PCs captured 90% and the first 41 PCs captured 99% of the variance) (Supplementary Table 3).’</p><p>The full results from PCA analysis are presented in Supplementary Table 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. I find the section about collider bias in the introduction a bit as surprise and it is unclear to me, how this relates to the overall aim of the study. The high amount of self-citation in this section and in general throughout the paper makes me wonder, how much of an issue this really is compared to more substantial questions about the suitability of PRS to identify disease biomarkers or causal metabolites.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added a more detailed section (including a new figure in the main document) discussing the challenges of addressing potential collider in a biobank-scale dataset which is discussed on page 14:</p><p>‘Directed acyclic graphs illustrating the potential collider bias involved in the causal relationship between the coronary artery disease polygenic score and circulating metabolites. (A) The likelihood of participants in UK Biobank taking medication such as statins is influenced by having a higher genetic predisposition to coronary artery disease but may also be influenced by certain metabolic traits measured on the NMR panel (e.g. having elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels). Either stratifying or adjusting for statin use in regression models may therefore induce collider bias into the association between disease liability and metabolic traits. (B) Age is commonly adjusted for in association analyses due to its role as a confounder and cannot be a collider (i.e. exposures and outcomes cannot influence the age of participants). Stratifying samples by age therefore enables the analysis of exposure-outcome associations in a group of participants with relatively consistent confounding effect from age, leading to more robust association estimates in the lower age tertile where the percentage of participants who are regularly taking medication is low. Furthermore, comparisons with participants in the highest age tertile can help highlight associations between polygenic scores and metabolic traits most likely distorted by potential colliders such as statins in the full sample.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Investigating different types of genetic scores is a clear strength of this work. However, the study currently stops early leaving important questions unanswered. For instance, how many more 'helpful' associations between PRS and NMR measures are really gained by going genome-wide, that is, how many of the added associations are mainly due to unspecific pleiotropy? The authors have outstanding methodological skills in MR and related causal inference techniques, and I find it somewhat wasted here to go simply for more associations instead of digging into the relevant part, which in turn defines the usefulness of the whole atlas and hence this study. It currently reads mostly like a computational exercise.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your complement re. methodological skills. We have emphasized in our introduction (page 8) that the main purpose of this resource is to generate hypotheses and therefore facilitate in-depth, carefully designed follow-up analyses (such as those applying the principles of MR). We advocate in this section that causal inference is challenging to robustly undertake which is why we suggest readers conduct bespoke analyses for this task motivated by findings in this atlas of results:</p><p>‘In this paper, we provide several examples of how results from this atlas can be used to generate hypotheses and pave the way for in-depth and careful evaluations of associations between PGS and circulating traits. Specifically, we believe our findings can facilitate a ‘reverse gear Mendelian randomization’ approach to disentangle whether associations likely reflect metabolic traits acting as a cause or consequence of disease risk (Holmes and Davey Smith, 2019) as illustrated using triglyceride-rich very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles in the next section. Furthermore, in-depth evaluations allow careful consideration of appropriate instrumental variables for circulating metabolites which can be a challenging task as highlighted in our exemplar analysis of glycoprotein acetyls. Finally, we provide examples of how the plethora of sensitivity analyses within our atlas can help users further investigate the robustness of findings.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In my opinion, the key question is, what do all those associations deliver, do they bring us any closer to causality compared to 'classical' observational associations, given LD confounding and strong metabolite variants included in PRS driving the associations. For example, how robust are PRS associations to the exclusion of single regions, Ritchie et al., 2021 Nat Metab provide a neat framework to address such questions. The APOE example goes in that direction and other locus-specific effects are likely underlying other disease PRS – NMR measure associations.</p></disp-quote><p>We have undertaken extensive sensitivity analyses to compute all PGS association in this atlas after removing established lipid gene loci to evaluate the sensitivity of results driven by variants at these regions of the genome. This has been added to page 19 of the manuscript:</p><p>‘The polygenic nature of complex traits means that the inclusion of highly weighted pleiotropic genetic variants in PGS may introduce bias into genetic associations within our atlas. To provide insight into this issue, we constructed PGS excluding variants within the regions of the genome which encode the genes for 14 major regulators of NMR lipoprotein lipids signals which captured 75% of the gene-metabolite associations in the Finnish Metabolic Syndrome In Men (METSIM) cohort (Gallois <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019). For details of these genes (see Supplementary Table 5).</p><p>For PGS with these lipid loci excluded, anthropometric traits such as waist-to-hip ratio (N=209), waist circumference (N=206) and body mass index (N=205) still provided strong evidence of association with the majority of metabolic measurements on the NMR panel based on multiple testing corrections. Elsewhere however, the Alzheimer’s disease PGS, which was associated with 60 metabolic traits robust to P&lt;0.05/19 in the initial analysis including these lipid loci (Supplementary Table 17), provided no convincing evidence of association with the 249 circulating metabolites after excluding the lipid loci based on the same multiple testing threshold (Supplementary Table 18). Further inspection suggested that the likely explanation for this attenuation of evidence were due to variants located within the <italic>APOE</italic> locus which are recognised to exert their influence on phenotypic traits via horizontally pleiotropic pathways (Ferguson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020).’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. One might argue that the CKD example is somewhat self-fulling, given that the selection of cases is mainly done based on serum creatinine (or the eGFR derived from creatinine), but is a good example how strong and specific examples might point to disease biomarkers. Are there more examples for a given NMR trait being strongly and possibly specifically associated with a trait or a cluster of highly related traits? I would also tone the creatinine example done, since it is obvious that this marker is used for clinical decision making.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now removed the creatinine example and instead included a bi-directional MR analysis of VLDL metabolic traits (page 9).</p><p>‘For example, we applied Mendelian randomization (MR) to further evaluate associations highlighted in our atlas with triglyceride-rich very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles. For instance, both VLDL particle average diameter size and concentration were associated with the PGS for body mass index (BMI) (Β=0.04, 95% CI=0.033 to 0.046, P=3.53x10<sup>-35</sup> &amp; Β=0.012, 95% CI=0.006 to 0.019, P=2.7x10<sup>-4</sup> respectively) and coronary heart disease (CHD) (Β=0.026, 95% CI=0.019 to 0.032, P&lt; 2.12x10<sup>-15</sup> &amp; Β=0.035, 95% CI=0.028 to 0.042, P&lt; 2.73x10<sup>-24</sup> respectively). Conducting bi-directional MR suggested that the associations with average diameter of VLDL particles are likely attributed to a consequence of BMI and CHD liability as opposed to the size of VLDL particles having a causal influence on these outcomes (Supplementary Table 6). In contrast, MR analyses suggested that the concentration of VLDL particles increases risk of CHD (Β=1.28 per 1-SD change in VLDL particle concentration, 95% CI=1.25 to 1.65, P=2.8x10<sup>-7</sup>) which may explain associations between the CHD PGS and this metabolic trait within our atlas. Similar MR analyses to investigate findings from our atlas can be conducted using the full GWAS summary statistics for all 249 circulating metabolic traits available via the GWAS catalog (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/) under accession IDs GCST90092803 to GCST90093051.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. I am not quite sure about the bidirectional MR approach. By only testing diseases for which the PRS showed an association with the metabolite of interest, isn't it quite likely that an effect of the metabolite on the disease would be missed, as one would assume that a true causal association between a metabolite and a disease might well be lost in the large set of SNPs associated with the endpoint of interest.</p></disp-quote><p>The value of using PGS with a lenient threshold is that associations may highlight either causes or consequences of disease risk. This has been previously referred to as ‘reverse gear MR’ as proposed in the study by Holmes and Davey Smith (https://academic.oup.com/clinchem/article-lookup/doi/10.1373/clinchem.2018.296806). This was one of the primary motivations for choosing the VLDL example mentioned above as well as providing insight into lipoprotein lipid biology (page 21):</p><p>‘We likewise conducted bi-directional MR to demonstrate that associations between the CHD PGS and VLDL particle size likely reflect an effect of CHD liability on this metabolic trait. In contrast, the association between the CHD PGS and VLDL concentrations are likely attributed to the causal influence of this metabolic trait on CHD risk, suggesting that it is the concentration of these triglyceride-rich particles that are important in terms of the aetiology of CHD risk as opposed to their actual size. We envisage that findings from our atlas, as well as other ongoing efforts which leverage the large-scale NMR data within UKB, should facilitate further granular insight into lipoprotein lipid biology.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. I disagree with the statement on page 12 that all lipid traits associated with the CHD PRS are causal risk factors, most of them are likely not and the true underlying risk factor or biological mechanism is likely hidden among all those associations. The general inability to distinguish about the causal relevance of all those highly related measures is a massive challenge working with NMR data, in particular given that many are not real measurements but are only derived as proportion from other measures, including apolipoprotein B.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now rephrased this sentence (now on page 15) to address this comment:</p><p>‘The vast majority of these were lipoprotein lipid traits, which are likely capturing causal risk factors for CHD.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The authors need to do better in distinguishing between all the different lipid measures that are derived from the NMR platform, this is also seen in the discussion of Apo B. Apo B is the main structural protein for many lipoprotein particles of different densities and not just for atherogenic ones.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is important to distinguish between the various metabolic traits measured by the NMR platform. Given that this work is a resource paper, we have pointed readers to a review of this platform to help them navigate findings within our atlas (page 4):</p><p>‘The 249 metabolite measurements include the particle concentration, size, and composition of 14 lipoprotein subclasses, as well as the levels of phospholipids, fatty acids, amino acids, ketone bodies and others biomarkers as discussed in a recent review (Ala-Korpela <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022).’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Instead of stratified analysis, why not correcting for statin intake to estimate lipid levels of participants without the use of statins? What about the effect of many other medications widely prescribed, with strong effects on NMR measures as described in van Duijn et al., Nat Med 2020?</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed above, we have added a section to page 14 to clarify our justification of age-stratified analyses to evaluate the robustness of findings to potential colliders such as statin therapy. Conditioning on colliders (including the use of statins) has become a lot more problematic with the advent of biobank scale cohort studies such as UKB. As such, previously modest sources of bias induced by conditioning on colliders, which may have not led to spurious findings in smaller cohort studies such as the one referenced here by the reviewer, are now large enough such that precautions (e.g. those taken in our study by stratifying on age) are necessary to investigate the robustness of findings.</p></body></sub-article></article>
