As a host receptor of SARS-CoV-2, the expression level of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been found to influence both the risk and severity of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hoffmann et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wrapp et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhou et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, a growing body of evidence from epidemiological investigations has demonstrated a substantial disparity in the susceptibility to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mehra et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Patanavanich and Glantz, 2020</xref>). For example, a multi-center study involving 8910 COVID-19 cases from 169 hospitals in Europe and North America identified an increased risk of in-hospital death among current smokers (odds ratio [OR]=1.79; 95% CI: 1.29–2.47) compared with ever-smokers or non-smokers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mehra et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with findings from large-scale population-based observational studies, a laboratory-based study involving 131 RNA-sequenced human lung cancer tissues (54 samples of European ancestry individuals and 77 samples of Asian ancestry individuals) found that smokers expressed a significantly higher level of ACE2 compared to non-smokers in both populations, leading to a potentially heightened susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai, 2020</xref>). Furthermore, incorporating two additional DNA microarray datasets of lung cancer, the significant smoking-ACE2 association observed in a total of 224 samples did not alter after adjusting for age, sex, race, and platforms. Nevertheless, these samples are derived from lung cancer patients, restricting its generalizability to normal lung tissues and to the general population. In a related work, Rao et al. conducted a phenome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) study examining an extensive amount of diseases, traits, and blood proteins and identified several ‘exposures’ including diabetes, breast cancer, lung cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and smoking to increase ACE2 expression in normal lung tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rao et al., 2020</xref>). This analysis, despite its substantially augmented number of exposures (N=3948), has several limitations. First of all, disease status such as diabetes and cancers are difficult to modify, at the population level it is more important to discover and intervene with modifiable risk factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption. However, regarding smoking, only three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were used as instrumental variables (IVs) by Rao et al., which explained negligible phenotypic variation and did not accurately predict smoking status. The hitherto largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) of tobacco use was conducted in a total of 1.2 million individuals and discovered over 400 genetic variants associated with smoking initiation and intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). Last but not least, Rao et al. focused on lung tissue instead of systemically examining all human tissues. Despite lungs being the most relevant and vulnerable organ to a respiratory syndrome COVID-19, recent studies have identified the involvement of other human tissues (e.g. gastrointestinal tract) in SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zou et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Motivated by these findings, we aim to explore whether genetic predisposition to common human modifiable behaviours including smoking and alcohol consumption could lead to an increased ACE2 expression, which subsequently yields to an increased susceptibility and severity of COVID-19. Here, we conduct a phenome-wide MR analysis by incorporating ACE2 expressions from a broad spectrum of tissues/organs available in the GTEx database. As one of the hitherto largest databases with concomitant information on DNA genotype and RNA expression, GTEx collects a large variety of tissues (N=44) from healthy population (deceased donors) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gamazon et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, data on COVID-19 susceptibility and severity were obtained from COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative, a global project aims to understand the role of host genome in COVID-19 outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative, 2020</xref>). Hundreds of genetic variants identified by a large-scale GWAS of tobacco use and alcohol consumption were used as IVs – incorporating additional loci greatly enhances the strength of genetic instruments as well as both accuracy and precision of MR estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Data on IV-exposure</title><p>IV-exposure associations were extracted from the hitherto largest GWAS conducted by the GCSCAN consortium (GWAS and Sequencing Consortium of Alcohol and Nicotine use) for tobacco use and alcohol consumption, totalling 1.2 million individuals of European ancestry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). This GWAS firstly meta-analysed summary-level data from each participating cohort and identified independent SNPs passing genome-wide significance (p&lt;5×10<sup>−8</sup>) based on linkage disequilibrium. After that, additional independent and genome-wide significant SNPs were selected using a conditional analysis within each significant locus defined as a 1 MB region surrounding the sentinel variant (the variant in the locus with the lowest p-value). We used all conditionally independent biallelic SNPs as IVs.</p><p>In our analysis, we included two smoking phenotypes and one drinking phenotype, smoking initiation as reflected by never vs. ever smoking (IV=378, N=1,232,091), smoking intensity as reflected by cigarettes per day (IV=55, N=337,334), and common (opposing to excessive or harmful) alcohol drinking behaviour defined as drinks per week (IV=99, N=941,280). The proportion of phenotypic variance explained by IVs accounted for 2.3% for smoking initiation, 1.1% for cigarettes per day, and 0.2% for drinks per week. Detailed information regarding IVs for each exposure were shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a-1c</xref>.</p><p>Strong instrumental variable is the basic requirement to ensure a valid MR result.

The F-statistics for smoking initiation, smoking intensity (cigarettes per day), and alcohol consumption (drinks per week) were 77.2, 67.4, and 17.8, respectively, indicating strong IVs (F-statistics &gt; 10) for each of our exposure of interest.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Data on IV-outcome</title><p>Associations of genetic variants with ACE2 expression were extracted from the GTEx database release version 8 available at the GTEx Portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gtexportal.org">http://www.gtexportal.org</ext-link>). It is one of the largest databases with concomitant information on genotype and expression data for a large variety of non-diseased tissues collected from &gt;1000 human donors. Out of the total 54 tissues/organs, we focused on ACE2 expression in 44 tissues/organs with a decent sample size involving at least 100 individuals to ensure statistical power (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1d</xref>). Specifically, the associations of genotype with ACE2 expression in adipose tissue, artery, brain, colon, oesophagus, heart, liver, lung, minor salivary gland, muscle, nerve, ovary, pancreas, pituitary, prostate, skin, small intestine, stomach, testis, thyroid, uterus, and vagina were included.</p><p>Unlike most existing MR studies that consider disease status as outcomes, this MR study treats gene expression levels as outcomes. GTEx identifies expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) by associating genetic variations called from GWAS with gene expression levels obtained from RNA-sequencing. Expression values for each gene were inverse quantile normalized to a standard normal distribution across samples as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gamazon et al., 2018</xref>). Please note, here we studied ACE2 RNA expression instead of its actual protein expression. Since ACE2 RNA and protein quantities have been found to be well correlated in tissues such as lung and kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wang et al., 2020</xref>), ACE2 RNA expression acts as a good proxy for ACE2 protein expression.</p><p>In addition to ACE2 expression, associations of genetic variants with COVID-19 susceptibility and severity were extracted from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.covid19hg.org">https://www.covid19hg.org</ext-link>). It is a global genetics collaboration aiming to explore the genetic determinants of COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. We used the summary statistics from the data freeze 5 of GWAS meta-analysis, which was released publicly on January 18, 2021. Three COVID-19 outcomes, including susceptibility to COVID-19, hospitalized COVID-19, and very severe respiratory confirmed COVID-19, were used in our analysis.</p><p>Briefly, susceptibility to COVID-19 cases was defined as individuals with laboratory-confirmed positive for SARS-Cov-2 infection (via nucleic acid amplification test or serological test), clinician diagnosis, health record evidence by ICD coding, or self-reported (N<sub>case</sub>=38,984 vs. N<sub>control</sub>=1,644,784). Hospitalized COVID-19 cases were defined as individuals hospitalized due to COVID-19 related symptoms with laboratory-confirmed positive for SARS-Cov-2 infection (N<sub>case</sub>=9986 vs. N<sub>control</sub>=1,877,672). Very severe respiratory confirmed COVID-19 cases were defined as hospitalized individuals with laboratory-confirmed positive for SARS-Cov-2 infection, who needed respiratory support except for simple oxygen supplementary or died due to COVID-19 (N<sub>case</sub>=5101 vs. N<sub>control</sub>=1,383,241).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>MR uses SNPs as proxies for exposure(s) assuming that SNPs are randomly allotted at conception mirroring a randomized procedure and that SNPs always precede disease onset to eliminate reverse causality. Three essential model assumptions need to be fulfilled to guarantee valid IVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>), that is, IVs are associated with the exposure (relevance assumption); there is no association between IVs and any confounders of the exposure-outcome relationship (independence assumption); and IVs are associated with the outcome only through the studied exposure (exclusion restriction assumption). If all three model assumptions are satisfied, a causal relationship can be made based on the observed IV-exposure and IV-outcome associations.</p><p>We conducted a two-sample MR, where IV-exposure and IV-outcome associations were estimated in two non-overlapping samples. The inverse-variance weighted (IVW) approach was applied as the primary method to estimate the causal link between exposures (smoking and alcohol consumption) and outcomes (ACE2 expression and COVID-19 related adverse outcomes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burgess et al., 2015</xref>). The causal estimate is calculated as a ratio of which the IV-outcome association was divided by the IV-exposure association for each IV and combined across multiple IVs weighted by the reciprocal of an approximate expression for their asymptotic variance. To evaluate potential heterogeneity among causal effects of different genetic variants, Cochran’s Q test was performed and p&lt;0.05 was considered as the existence of heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Greco M et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>One major concern of MR is horizontal pleiotropy, meaning genetic variants influence the outcome other than through the exposure. A series of sensitivity analyses were conducted to detect and correct for such a scenario. First, MR-Egger regression was adopted to examine the presence of potential pleiotropy, as well as to complement results from main analysis (IVW) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bowden et al., 2015</xref>). When the instrument strength independent of direct effect assumption holds, intercept of MR-Egger regression that differs from zero indicates the presence of horizontal pleiotropy. In addition to the IVW approach and the MR-Egger regression, the weighted median method and the MR-pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) test were also used to detect potential horizontal pleiotropy. The beta estimate of weighted median is calculated as the median of the weighted empirical distribution function of the ratio IV estimates evaluated using each genetic variant individually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bowden et al., 2016</xref>). The p-value of MR-PRESSO global test less than 1.0×10<sup>−6</sup> indicates the presence of horizontal pleiotropy. MR-PRESSO not only identifies horizontal pleiotropy by comparing the observed residual sum of squares to the expected residual sum of squares, but also corrects for horizontal pleiotropy through removing outliers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Verbanck et al., 2018</xref>). Second, we excluded palindromic SNPs with ambiguous strand identification and performed the IVW method on the remaining SNPs. Subsequently, we removed SNPs associated with potential confounding traits as confirmed by the GWAS Catalog (basically any other trait than our exposure of interest). Moreover, leave-one-out analysis was performed where we excluded one SNP at a time and conducted IVW on the rest SNPs to identify the potential influence of outlying variants on the overall estimates. Results were considered significant only if they passed statistical significance (p&lt;0.05) in the IVW approach or the MR-Egger regression and remained directional consistent in the weighted median and MR-PRESSO methods across both primary and sensitivity analyses. We additionally set a corrected p threshold as dividing 0.05 by the number of outcomes 0.05/(44+3)=1.0×10<sup>−3</sup> (including 44 tissues/organs and 3 COVID-19 outcomes).</p><p>Finally, the power of current study was estimated according to a method suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brion et al., 2013</xref>. To guarantee statistical power, we only included tissues/organs with at least 100 samples in the GTEx database. Under the current sample size, given 1–2% of the phenotypic variance of smoking and alcohol consumption explained by IVs, our study had sufficient power (&gt;80%) to detect a causal effect of 0.74–2.66 in ACE2 expression, and to detect an OR ranging from 1.11 to 1.39 for COVID-19 related outcomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1e</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We extracted a total of 532 independent SNPs that achieved genome-wide significance for smoking initiation (N=378), cigarettes per day (N=55), and drinks per week (N=99) from the GSCAN consortium and used as IVs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a-c</xref>). We were able to map 80–95% of those IVs to the GTEx database and to the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative database – a virtually complete coverage.

Results remained directional consistent in the MR-Egger regression although a slightly increased statistical uncertainty was observed (β=1.667, p=0.334 in brain putamen basal ganglia; β=0.963, p=0.545 in brain hypothalamus; β=0.663, p=0.205 in subcutaneous adipose tissue). Additionally, increased ACE2 expression in two colon tissues was observed only through the MR-Egger regression (transverse colon [β=1.129, p=0.017] and sigmoid colon [β=1.925, p=0.042]) and the direction of estimates remained consistent in the IVW approach.

We capitalized on the summary statistics of the largest tissue-specific eQTL conducted for ACE2 expression levels and the most up-to-date GWAS data of COVID-19 related adverse outcomes. We found a putative causal relationship between smoking-related phenotypes and an increased ACE2 expression in multiple tissues, as well as an increased susceptibility and severity of COVID-19.</p><p>Our findings are supported by previous epidemiological studies which have demonstrated a significant association between smoking and COVID-19 disease progression or death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mehra et al., 2020</xref>). For example, a study involving 214 patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 from Wenzhou China found that compared to non-severe cases, patients with severe disease were more likely to be smokers (26.3% vs. 6.4%, p = 0.038) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zheng et al., 2020</xref>). Another study recruiting 78 patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan also found a higher proportion of ever-smokers in COVID-19 progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group (OR=14.28, 95% CI:1.58–25.00, p=0.018) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). Consistent with these findings, a meta-analysis on a total of 11,590 COVID-19 cases demonstrated a higher proportion of smokers among 2133 patients experienced disease progression, suggesting that smoking aggravated COVID-19 progression (OR=1.91, 95% CI: 1.42–2.59) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Patanavanich and Glantz, 2020</xref>). On the contrary, a few small-scale studies with sample sizes ranging from 44 to 191 conducted in Wuhan China did not report remarkable association of smoking with COVID-19 severity or progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhou et al., 2020b</xref>).

A meta-analysis including five studies (four in Wuhan and one across 30 provinces in Mainland China) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>) involving 1399 individuals with COVID-19 revealed no significant association between smoking and disease severity (OR=1.69, 95% CI: 0.41–6.92) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lippi and Henry, 2020</xref>). Opposite to the findings from Asian population, evidence from the Veterans Affairs Birth Cohort in a US population found that current smoking was associated with a lower risk of COVID-19 susceptibility (OR=0.45, 95% CI: 0.35–0.57) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rentsch et al., 2020</xref>). The contradictory results in those small-scale studies might be due to insufficient power, low proportion of smokers, and a limited representativeness of the study population. For example, compared with the high proportion of smokers in China (an average 26.6% prevalence in the general population), only 1.4% patients were current smokers in the study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhang et al., 2020</xref> and 12.6% in the study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guan et al., 2020</xref>. Given these discrepancies, additional studies are warranted to confirm the role of smoking in both the onset and progression of COVID-19.</p><p>In addition to clinical observational studies, laboratory examination has demonstrated the importance of tissues specificity. For example, Cai et al. identified that smoking was associated with an elevated expression of ACE2 in the lung, providing biological evidence of smoking with an increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection or severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai, 2020</xref>). Moreover, Rao et al. conducted a phenome-wide MR study incorporating 3948 traits, diseases, and blood proteins and identified a nominal significant association between tobacco use and ACE2 expression in the lung (IVW: β=0.918, p=0.016) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rao et al., 2020</xref>). However, this association did not pass multiple comparisons (p-value for FDR was 0.51), which was consistent with our MR results using a greatly augmented number of IVs (for smoking status IV=378).</p><p>The biological mechanisms underlying smoking and tissue-specific ACE2 expression remain to be disclosed. ACE2 has been considered as the target receptor of SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cells and an increased expression of ACE2 appears to raise both the susceptibility and severity of COVID-19. As a type I transmembrane metallocarboxypeptidase homologous to ACE, ACE2 is known to be expressed in a variety of tissues, including respiratory tract, cardio-renal tissues, and gastrointestinal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harmer et al., 2002</xref>). Our study found that smoking increased ACE2 expression in multiple tissues including the brain and colon tissues. While SARS-CoV-2 mainly spreads via respiratory tract, enrichment of SARS-CoV-2 in gastrointestinal tract has been confirmed by testing viral RNA in stool from 71 patients with COVID-19, suggesting the importance of gastrointestinal involvement in the infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Xiao et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, nearly one-fifth COVID-19 patients remained SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positive in their stool, despite negative results in their respiratory samples. Of those 71 patients, ACE2 was abundantly expressed in the gastrointestinal epithelia, but rarely expressed in the esophageal epithelia. In addition, findings from public databases (GEO, GTEx, and HPA) have demonstrated a higher expression level of ACE2 in the gastrointestinal tract (colon, rectal, and small intestine) and liver than in the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burgueño et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pirola and Sookoian, 2020</xref>). Taking these pieces of evidence together, we could reasonably assume that the biological mechanisms underlying the link between ACE2 expression and COVID-19 susceptibility are complicated, involving multiple organs other than the lung. Consistent with our findings on a link between smoking and increased ACE2 expression in both transverse colon and sigmoid colon, these results collectively suggest that smoking mediates ACE2 expression in gastrointestinal tract, subsequently influence the susceptibility and severity of COVID-19.</p><p>We also found that smoking influenced ACE2 expression in the brain tissue, especially in putamen basal ganglia and hypothalamus. Smoking may promote cellular uptake of SARS-CoV-2 through nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Russo et al., 2020</xref>). It is worth noting that nAChR and ACE2 are known to be co-expressed on many sites such as cortex, striatum, and hypothalamus within human brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dani and Bertrand, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jones et al., 2009</xref>). Nicotine stimulation of the nAChR increased ACE2 expression within neural cells, indicating a likelihood that smokers are more vulnerable to COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Olds and Kabbani, 2020</xref>).</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, we performed a large-scale phenome-wide MR study to understand a causal role of smoking and alcohol consumption in ACE2 expression, as well as in COVID-19 related outcomes, totalling 532 genetic associations from 1.2 million individuals of European ancestry and covering almost all tissues/organs of human body (N=44). In addition, we rigorously selected proxy SNPs and performed a series of sensitivity analyses to satisfy MR model assumptions, for example, we satisfied the ‘relevance’ assumption by using GWAS-identified significant SNPs as IVs; we ensured the ‘independent’ assumption and the ‘exclusion restriction’ assumption by performing several important sensitivity analyses. However, limitations need to be acknowledged. Although hundreds of SNPs were used as proxies for cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption, these GWAS-identified SNPs explained only a small fraction (1–2%) of phenotypic variance. In addition, the minimum sample size of 114 in brain substantia nigra tissue further limited the statistical power of MR analysis, albeit GTEx database is so far the largest available database with both genotype and expression data. Moreover, data on the genotypes, tissue expression, and COVID-19 related outcomes of our analyses were all based on European ancestry populations, restricting its generalizability to other ethnicities. On the other hand, our data, with exposure and outcome GWAS(s) (or eQTLs) conducted using individuals of the same underlying populations (all European ancestry), greatly reduces the population stratification as well as satisfies the MR model assumption – for a two-sample MR to be valid, the two samples have to be preferably from the same ethnicity. Finally, we have to acknowledge that few of our significant associations passed the stringent Bonferroni corrections. Our results provide a comprehensive picture for the causal relationship of smoking with ACE2 expression in various tissues and with COVID-19 susceptibility and severity, yet we stress caution for interpretation and extra analyses are needed to replicate these findings.</p><p>In conclusion, genetically instrumented smoking phenotypes reflected by both smoking initiation and smoking intensity are significantly associated with a high expression level of ACE2 in multiple tissues/organs, subsequently increasing the susceptibility and severity of COVID-19. Our results provide important clinical implications on that smokers might be more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection or severe disease. At the population level, smoking cessation is also an important actionable prevention strategy to COVID-19. Further studies are needed to confirm or refute our findings.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank the GSCAN consortium, the GTEx Program, and the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative for the release of their data.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Supplementary results of the causality of smoking and alcohol consumption on angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) related outcomes.</title><p>(a) Information of genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with smoking initiation. (b) Information of genome-wide significant SNPs associated with cigarettes per day.

The MR approach allows to explore a causal role of these modifiable lifestyle factors in ACE2 expression in 44 tissues/organs using data from the GCSCAN consortium and GTEx. The MR analysis finds interesting associations with smoking status and intensity and increased levels of ACE2 expression in organs that may go on to modify susceptibility to COVID-19. However, no evidence for an effect of alcohol was seen.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Mendelian randomization analysis provides causality of smoking on the expression of ACE2, a putative SARS-CoV-2 receptor&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Houfeng Zheng (Reviewer #1); Derrick Bennett (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our policy on revisions we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in eLife but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data. Our expectation is that, where possible, the authors will eventually carry out the additional work and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in eLife, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper presents a two-sample Mendelian Randomization analysis of smoking and alcohol consumption with ACE2 expression in multiple organs using tissue samples made available through the GTEx dataset. The MR analysis found promising associations with smoking status and intensity and increased levels of ACE2 expression in organs that may go on to modify susceptibility to COVID-19. While the research is novel, the methods have been applied to only one data resource and some of the conclusions are not warranted by the data and analysis. In particular the causal inferences relating to COVID-19 susceptibility require additional data. Many conclusions are too strong based on the analyses performed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The authors must include a detailed flowchart of how SNPs were selected/excluded for each IV. The information must be reported in sufficient detail so that the IVs could be recreated and the whole MR analysis could be replicated. If this requires substantial programming the annotated code could be made available through GitHub for example.</p><p>2. The authors report &quot;Our results provide important clinical implications on that smokers might be more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection or severe disease.&quot; They have not directly assessed the relationship of their IV for smoking to SARS-CoV-2 infection so their conclusions need to be toned down. Did the authors consider obtaining SARS-COV-2 outcome data from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41431-020-0636-6)? This would greatly strengthen the report.</p><p>3. The MR studies have been conducted in a European population so are these results generalizable to other populations? While the resource used is impressive can this analysis be replicated in an independent data set? Even if some of the signals could be replicated this would add enormous value to the results.</p><p>4. Can you offer an explanation why ACE2 was highly expressed on brain, colon, liver et al., but not on respiratory tract and lung tissue? Is higher expression of ACE2 really susceptible factor for Covid19? What is the evidence?</p><p>5. The Discussion section seems to focus on evidence from China but the results from China may be affected by the sex-differences in smoking and alcohol prevalence. The patterns of smoking and alcohol in East Asian populations is very different from Western populations. Typically very few women smoke or drink in East Asia. The authors should comment on this.</p><p>6. Did the authors consider performing analyses separately for men and women in this study?</p><p>7. Table 2 shows the detectable difference with a fixed power of 80% and a significance level of 0.05. Should the significance level be modified to deal with multiple testing with sample from different organs? If not why not? The sample size calculation requires further clarification. It is preferable to mention the a priori power calculations in the methods section of the report not the results. Are the effect sizes detectable clinically relevant? How was this ascertained?</p><p>8. The authors need to report the associated F-statistics for their instrumental variables.</p><p>9. The authors mention that &quot;Expression values for each gene were inverse quantile normalized to a standard normal distribution across samples&quot;. So this suggests that the results are based on a per standard deviation change but this is not clear from the results.</p><p>10. Only MR-Egger was used to assess horizontal pleiotropy. There are several other approaches that make different assumptions to MR-Egger that should be considered in order to triangulate the findings.</p><p>11. In the MR results, the significance from IVW approach were not replicated in MR-Egger regression, and vice versa. Can we believe these are real casual associations? Could you explain?</p><p>12. The abstract should communicate the size of the dataset (ie the number of samples) and report an effect size, 95% confidence interval and p-value for each signal reported in the abstract. Stating 'significant' or 'non-significant' is not appropriate for an abstract.</p><p>13. In Figures 1, 2 and 3 the x-axis needs clearer labelling. Isn't this a plot of β values per 1 SD change in ACE2 expression?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64188.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper presents a two-sample Mendelian Randomization analysis of smoking and alcohol consumption with ACE2 expression in multiple organs using tissue samples made available through the GTEx dataset.

Incorporating those data will greatly enhance the validity of our current results. Following with the reviewer’s suggestions, we have estimated the putative causal effect of smoking and alcohol consumption on COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. Consistent with our ACE2 expression results, both smoking initiation and intensity were associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 related outcomes while alcohol consumption did not seem to influence the risk.</p><p>We have formulated those results into extra tables (Table 3 and Supplementary File 1o-1r) and added to our manuscript, the relevant texts read:</p><p>“Finally, complementing to findings of ACE2 expression, we tested a putative causal link between smoking status, smoking intensity, alcohol consumption and the risk of COVID-19 related adverse outcomes. We found that smoking initiation significantly increased the risk of COVID-19 onset (IVW: OR=1.15, 95%CI: 1.07-1.23, <italic>p</italic>=8.7×10<sup>-5</sup>) even after taking into account multiple comparisons (Table 3). Results remained significant in the weighted median and MR-PRESSO methods, however, showed larger statistical uncertainties in the MR-Egger regression. In addition, smoking initiation increased the risk of very severe respiratory confirmed COVID-19 and hospitalized COVID-19 using the IVW approach, but the results were not supported by the MR-Egger regression. Smoking intensity (cigarettes per day) only increased the risk of very severe respiratory confirmed COVID-19 as shown in the MR-Egger regression (OR=5.99, 95%CI: 1.57-22.84, <italic>p</italic>=0.012) (Supplementary File 1o). On the contrary, we did not find a causal link between alcohol consumption (drinks per week) and the risk of COVID-19 adverse outcomes (Supplementary File 1p). Findings did not alter in the sensitivity analyses (Supplementary File 1q-1r and Appendix 1-Figure 4)”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

On the other hand, our data, with exposure and outcome GWAS(s) (or eQTLs) conducted using individuals of the same underlying populations (all European ancestry) greatly reduces the population stratification as well as satisfies the MR model assumption – for a two-sample MR to be valid, the two samples have to be preferably from the same ethnicity.”</p><p>Regarding the replication of results, we unfortunately couldn’t find proper GWAS conducted for our exposures of interest (smoking, alcohol consumption) or outcomes (ACE2 expression, COVID-19 adverse outcomes) in populations other than in the European ancestry populations. Following with the reviewer’s suggestion, we have incorporated COVID-19 outcome-related GWAS which serve as an additional source of data and corroborate with our ACE2 expression findings to add values to our original results. Please read our response to question #2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Can you offer an explanation why ACE2 was highly expressed on brain, colon, liver et al., but not on respiratory tract and lung tissue? Is higher expression of ACE2 really susceptible factor for Covid19? What is the evidence?</p></disp-quote><p>We shared the same concerns as the reviewer regarding the interpretation of our results. We tried to offer explanation from three aspects as shown below. The reviewer is very welcome to provide further comments and/or suggestions based on our explanations.</p><p>First of all, our results were consistent with the study conducted by Rao et al. which examined the effect of an extensive amount of diseases, traits and blood proteins (N=3948) on ACE2 expression in the lung<sup>1</sup>. For smoking, 3 SNPs associated with tobacco use were extracted from the UK Biobank (ukb-b-5115) and used as IVs; Data on ACE2 expression of the lung tissue were extracted from the GTEx database and used as the outcome. Despite a nominal significant association of tobacco use and ACE2 expression in the lung (IVW: β=0.92, SE=0.38, <italic>p</italic>=0.016), this result did not pass multiple comparisons (<italic>p</italic> value for FDR was 0.51). Our results, with 100 times augmented numbers of IVs and largely increased statistical power, did not find a causal relationship between genetically predicted smoking and ACE2 expression in the lung.</p><p>Secondly, as we mentioned on Page 9-10 in our Discussion section:</p><p>“While SARS-CoV-2 mainly spreads via respiratory tract, enrichment of SARS-CoV-2 in gastrointestinal tract has been confirmed by testing viral RNA in stool from 71 patients with COVID-19, suggesting the importance of gastrointestinal involvement in the infection<sup>2</sup>. Furthermore, nearly one fifth of COVID-19 patients remained SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive in their stool, despite their negative results in their respiratory samples. Of those 71 patients, ACE2 was abundantly expressed in the gastrointestinal epithelia, but rarely expressed in the esophageal epithelium. In addition, findings from public databases (GEO, GTEx and HPA) have demonstrated a higher expression level of ACE2 in the gastrointestinal tract (colon, rectal, and small intestine) and liver than in the lung<sup>3-5</sup>. Taking these pieces of evidence together, we could reasonably assume that the biological mechanisms underlying the link between ACE2 expression and COVID-19 susceptibility is complicated, involving multiple organs other than the lung.”</p><p>Last but not the least, as the reviewer mentioned in his original question – “Is higher expression of ACE2 really a susceptible factor for COVID-19? what is the evidence?” – We have to admit that there is a lack of strong evidence supporting an absolute causal role of ACE2 in the susceptibility of COVID-19. This infection, as all other complex traits or diseases, occurs under a multifactorial etiology with the involvement of multiple factors, such as a non-trivial role of environmental exposures (here, virus load for example) and various immunological / physiological molecular events other than the expression of ACE2 receptor. Our study, which focused on ACE2 expression with reasonable hypothesis (a most relevant receptor for the virus) and availability of data, contributes as a preliminary first step to understand the etiology of COVID-19. Downstream experimental data and future large-scale analysis are needed to dispute or support our findings, as well as to explore molecules other than ACE2 receptor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The Discussion section seems to focus on evidence from China but the results from China may be affected by the sex-differences in smoking and alcohol prevalence. The patterns of smoking and alcohol in East Asian populations is very different from Western populations. Typically very few women smoke or drink in East Asia. The authors should comment on this.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer, indeed, the patterns of smoking and alcohol consumption in East Asian populations differ from that of Western populations, particularly among women. Since the prevalence of smoking among COVID-19 patients are in general low (range from 1.4% to 21.9%), and the patient population consists mainly males (range from 50% to 73%), the sex difference may impose a minimal effect on the outcome. Nevertheless, following with the reviewer’s suggestion, we have cited results from Western populations in our Discussion section, it reads:</p><p>“Opposite to the findings from Asian population, evidence from the Veterans Affairs Birth Cohort in a United States population found that current smoking was associated with a lower risk of COVID-19 susceptibility (OR=0.45, 95%CI: 0.35-0.57)<sup>6</sup>.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Did the authors consider performing analyses separately for men and women in this study?</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, we were unable to perform such an analysis. Although most current GWAS(s) were carried out including both men and women, stratified analysis was still performed only to a small extent. None of our exposure or outcome GWAS data (both ACE2 expression and COVID-19 adverse outcomes) were stratified by sex. This analysis could be an important future direction to be focused on when data becomes available.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Table 2 shows the detectable difference with a fixed power of 80% and a significance level of 0.05. Should the significance level be modified to deal with multiple testing with sample from different organs? If not why not? The sample size calculation requires further clarification. It is preferable to mention the a priori power calculations in the methods section of the report not the results. Are the effect sizes detectable clinically relevant? How was this ascertained?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for covering this aspect. Indeed, Bonferroni correction should be used to take into consideration multiple comparisons. We set our corrected <italic>p</italic> threshold as dividing 0.05 by the number of outcomes <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mtext>0.05</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mtext>44+3</mml:mtext><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>=</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>1.0×10<sup>-3</sup> (including 44 tissues / organs and three COVID-19 related adverse outcomes).</p><p>However, as 1) the main aim of this work was to evaluate the evidence of a putative causal role of smoking and alcohol consumption on ACE2 expression levels across a range of human tissues / organs (N=44) rather than to identify a specific tissue; and 2) tissues and organs are not totally independent of each other; we therefore applied a marginal significant level of <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 in our study. For all our results, we reported clearly the <italic>p</italic> to ensure an accurate interpretation. We added explanatory sentences on the reasons of using a marginal significant p value as well as highlighted all the results that passed Bonferroni correction. For example, we found that smoking initiation significantly augmented the risk of COVID-19 susceptibility (IVW: OR=1.15, 95%CI: 1.07-1.23, p=8.7×10<sup>-5</sup>) even after taking into account multiple comparisons, indicating that smokers had a higher risk of developing COVID-19 compared with non-smokers.</p><p>Following with the reviewer’s suggestion, we have moved the sample size calculation to the Method section and added additional explanatory sentences, it reads:</p><p>“To guarantee statistical power, we only included tissues/organs with at least 100 samples in the GTEx database. Under the current sample size, given 1– 2% of the phenotypic variance of smoking and alcohol consumption explained by IVs, our study had sufficient power (&gt;80%) to detect a causal effect of 0.74 to 2.66 in ACE2 expression, and to detect an OR ranging from 1.11 to 1.39 for COVID-19 related outcomes (Supplementary File 1e).”</p><p>Lastly, as the reviewer mentioned in his original question – “Are the effect sizes detectable clinically relevant? How was this ascertained?” – We need to admit that effect size in itself cannot give a clear interpretation of the clinical relevance. Specifically, Dr. Burgess underscores that for a binary exposure (e.g. smoking initiation), MR is most suitable for testing a causal link (if there is a causal relationship) rather than for calculating a causal estimation (how strong is the magnitude of causal relationship and how much risk of outcome can be reduced if this exposure is “blocked”)<sup>7</sup>. Because the causal estimation of a binary exposure assumes that the casual effect is a stepwise function at the point of dichotomization, however, MR estimations perform parametric assumptions. Caution is needed when inferring the causal estimation to clinical relevance using a binary exposure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The authors need to report the associated F-statistics for their instrumental variables.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for covering this aspect. Strong instrumental variable is the basic requirement to ensure a valid MR result. Following with the reviewer’s suggestion, the strength of instrumental variable was verified by calculating F-statistics using the formula <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mo form="prefix" stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo form="postfix" stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo form="prefix" stretchy="true">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mo form="postfix" stretchy="true">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, where R<sup>2</sup> is the proportion of variance explained by the instrumental variable, k refers to the number of IVs, and n indicates the sample size<sup>8</sup>. The F-statistics for smoking initiation, smoking intensity (cigarettes per day) and alcohol consumption (drinks per week) were 77.2, 67.4, and 17.8, respectively, indicating strong IVs (F-statistics &gt; 10) for each of our exposure of interest.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. The authors mention that &quot;Expression values for each gene were inverse quantile normalized to a standard normal distribution across samples&quot;. So this suggests that the results are based on a per standard deviation change but this is not clear from the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the opportunity for being able to make further clarifications. When saying “Expression values for each gene were inverse quantile normalized to a standard normal distribution across samples”, it referred to the ACE2 expression level (here our outcome). For our exposure, three phenotypes were included in the analyses, that is, smoking initiation (ever vs. never), smoking intensity (cigarettes per day) and alcohol consumption (drinks per week). For the latter two exposures, we indeed calculated results based on a per-SD change of exposure, while for smoking initiation which was a binary exposure, we calculated results based on per-unit change in the exposure on the log odds scale.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Only MR-Egger was used to assess horizontal pleiotropy. There are several other approaches that make different assumptions to MR-Egger that should be considered in order to triangulate the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>Following with the reviewer’s suggestion, we have tested horizontal pleiotropy using the MR-PRESSO approach, results of which have been added to Tables 1-3, to Supplementary File 1f-1h, and to Supplementary File 1o-1p. There was no evidence for the existence of horizontal pleiotropy according to the global test (all p&gt;1.0×10<sup>-6</sup>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. In the MR results, the significance from IVW approach were not replicated in MR-Egger regression, and vice versa. Can we believe these are real casual associations? Could you explain?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciated this opportunity for making further clarifications.</p><p>First of all, it is not surprising that the significance from IVW were not replicated in the MR-Egger regression as this method provides twice as large standard errors as IVW and therefore a wider 95% confidence intervals.</p><p>Secondly, as we mentioned in our Methods section, “Results were considered significant only if they passed statistical significance (p&lt;0.05) in the IVW approach or the MR-Egger regression and remained directional consistent in the weighted median and MR-PRESSO methods across both primary and sensitivity analyses.”. The IVW approach is the most conventional method which was applied as the primary method to estimate a causal link between exposures (smoking and alcohol consumption) and outcomes (ACE2 expression and COVID-19 related outcome), while MR-Egger regression and several other approaches were used mainly to identify potential horizontal pleiotropy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. The abstract should communicate the size of the dataset (ie the number of samples) and report an effect size, 95% confidence interval and p-value for each signal reported in the abstract. Stating 'significant' or 'non-significant' is not appropriate for an abstract.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this constructive suggestion from reviewers and have comprehensively revised our abstract, it reads:</p><p>“Background: To understand a causal role of modifiable lifestyle factors in ACE2 expression (a putative SARS-CoV-2 receptor) across 44 human tissues/organs, and in COVID-19 susceptibility and severity, we conducted a phenome-wide two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study.</p><p>Methods: More than 500 genetic variants were used as instrumental variables to predict smoking and alcohol consumption. Inverse-variance weighted approach was adopted as the primary method to estimate a causal association, while MR-Egger regression, weighted median and MR-PRESSO were performed to identify potential horizontal pleiotropy.</p><p>Results: We found that genetically predicted smoking intensity significantly increased ACE2 expression in thyroid (β=1.468, p=1.8×10<sup>-8</sup>); and increased ACE2 expression in adipose, brain, colon and liver with nominal significance. Additionally, genetically predicted smoking initiation significantly increased the risk of COVID-19 onset (odds ratio=1.14, p=8.7×10<sup>-5</sup>). No statistically significant result was observed for alcohol consumption.</p><p>Conclusions: Our work demonstrates an important role of smoking, measured by both status and intensity, in the susceptibility to COVID-19.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. In Figures 1, 2 and 3 the x-axis needs clearer labelling. Isn't this a plot of β values per 1 SD change in ACE2 expression?</p></disp-quote><p>Following with the reviewer’s suggestion, we have revised the footnotes of each figure accordingly.</p><p>Taking Appendix 1-Figure 1 as an example, the footnote was stated as “Each boxplot represents the centralized tendency of effect sizes (β coefficients) of smoking initiation on tissue-specific ACE2 expression based on the results of leave-one-out analysis where we excluded one SNP at a time and performed IVW using the remaining SNPs”.</p><p>These boxplots (or the leave-one-out analysis) aim to identify outlying SNPs which could potentially bias our causal estimates. For example, if the result was driven by one or a few SNPs with larger effects, then we would expect a drastic change in the estimate when that particular outlying SNP was removed. In our case, all estimates centred around the expected value (from the main analysis using all IVs) indicating an absence of outlying SNPs.</p><p>References:</p><p>1. Rao S, Lau A, So HC.
