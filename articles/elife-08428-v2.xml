Transition to cold temperatures requires changes in the partitioning of energy substrates, re-routing fatty acids to BAT to fuel non-shivering thermogenesis. However, the mechanisms behind the redistribution of energy substrates to BAT remain largely unknown. Angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4), a protein that inhibits lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity, is highly expressed in BAT. Here, we demonstrate that ANGPTL4 is part of a shuttling mechanism that directs fatty acids derived from circulating triglyceride-rich lipoproteins to BAT during cold. Specifically, we show that cold markedly down-regulates ANGPTL4 in BAT, likely via activation of AMPK, enhancing LPL activity and uptake of plasma triglyceride-derived fatty acids. In contrast, cold up-regulates ANGPTL4 in WAT, abolishing a cold-induced increase in LPL activity. Together, our data indicate that ANGPTL4 is an important regulator of plasma lipid partitioning during sustained cold.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08428.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08428.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08428.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The body stores energy in the form of fat molecules. Most of these molecules are stored in white fat cells. Other fat cells, the so-called brown fat cells, consume fats and produce heat to maintain body temperature in cold conditions. The capacity of brown fat cells to consume fats has led researchers to investigate whether brown fat cells might be a key to combat obesity.</p><p>When an organism is cold, fat is shuttled to the brown fat cells. An enzyme called lipoprotein lipase is involved in a process that allows these fat molecules to be taken up by brown fat cells. However, it was not clear exactly how this process works.</p><p>A protein called Angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) inhibits the activity of lipoprotein lipase in white fat cells and is also found at high levels in brown fat cells. Here, Dijk et al. used genetic and biochemical approaches to study the role of ANGPTL4 in the fat cells of mice. The experiments show that when mice are exposed to cold, the levels of ANGPTL4 decrease in the brown fat cells. This allows the activity of lipoprotein lipase to increase so that these cells are able to take up more fat molecules.</p><p>However, the opposite happens in white fat cells during cold exposure. The levels of ANGPTL4 increase, which decreases the activity of lipoprotein lipase in white fat cells to allow fat molecules to be shuttled specifically to the brown fat cells. Further experiments suggest that the opposite regulation of ANGPTL4 in brown and white fat cells could be due to a protein called AMPK. This protein is found at higher levels in brown fat cells than in white fat cells and is produced by brown fat cells during cold exposure.</p><p>Taken together, Dijk et al. show that organs and cells work together to ensure that fat molecules are appropriately distributed to cells in need of energy, such as to brown fat cells during cold. How these findings could be used to stimulate fat consumption by brown fat cells in humans remains open for further investigation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08428.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08428.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>energy metabolism</kwd><kwd>triglyceride-rich lipoproteins</kwd><kwd>brown adipose tissue</kwd><kwd>white adipose tissue</kwd><kwd>lipoprotein lipase</kwd><kwd>angiopoietin-like 4</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001674</institution-id><institution>Fondation Leducq</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>12CVD04</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dijk</surname><given-names>Wieneke</given-names></name><name><surname>Heine</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name><name><surname>Vergnes</surname><given-names>Laurent</given-names></name><name><surname>Reue</surname><given-names>Karen</given-names></name><name><surname>Heeren</surname><given-names>Joerg</given-names></name><name><surname>Kersten</surname><given-names>Sander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006636</institution-id><institution>Forskningsrådet om Hälsa, Arbetsliv och Välfärd</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>12203</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Olivecrona</surname><given-names>Gunilla</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hartstichting</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2009T038</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rensen</surname><given-names>Patrick CN</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>During sustained cold exposure, lipid fuel is specifically directed towards brown adipose tissue, but not white adipose tissue, via cold-induced regulation of Angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4).</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adipose tissue can be classified into white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT). Whereas WAT represents the main energy storage organ in the body, BAT is dedicated to the generation of heat via the burning of lipids. BAT is activated during cold exposure, when additional heat production is needed to maintain core body temperature. Heat production by BAT is stimulated via release of norepinephrine by the sympathetic nervous system, causing activation of β-adrenergic signalling and subsequent uncoupling of ATP production from mitochondrial respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cannon and Nedergaard, 2004</xref>). Uncoupling in BAT is mediated by the uncoupling protein UCP1, which is highly abundant specifically in BAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cannon and Nedergaard, 2004</xref>). Studies in the last decade have shown the presence of BAT in humans and have provided preliminary evidence for an inverse relationship between BAT activity and parameters of obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">van Marken Lichtenbelt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Virtanen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). As a consequence, interest in BAT function and the possible targeting of BAT for treatment or prevention of metabolic diseases has surged.</p><p>Upon cold exposure, oxidation of fuels by BAT is dramatically increased. In addition to circulating glucose and free fatty acids, fatty acids derived from circulating triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) represent a major fuel source for BAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cannon and Nedergaard, 2004</xref>). The liberation of fatty acids from TRLs is catalyzed by the enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which is highly abundant in BAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartelt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kersten, 2014</xref>). Cold exposure markedly stimulates LPL activity in BAT, causing a concomitant increase in TRL-derived fatty acid uptake and even uptake of whole lipoprotein particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartelt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khedoe et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klingenspor et al., 1996</xref>). The increase in fatty acid uptake upon cold exposure, which can be mimicked by pharmacological ß3-adrenergic receptor activation, is highly specific for BAT, suggesting that the body may specifically re-direct lipid fuels to BAT during cold exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartelt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berbée et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khedoe et al., 2014</xref>). Both transcriptional and (post-)translational regulation has been implicated in the increased LPL activity in BAT upon cold exposure. However, the specific underlying mechanisms have remained elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carneheim et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Giralt et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mitchell et al., 1992</xref>).</p><p>Angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) has previously been identified as an inhibitor of LPL activity in muscle and WAT. Alterations of <italic>Angptl4</italic> expression in these tissues mediate the changes in LPL activity observed during exercise and fasting, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Catoire et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kroupa et al., 2012</xref>). In the initial paper describing the cloning of <italic>Angptl4</italic>, we had seen high expression of <italic>Angptl4</italic> mRNA in BAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kersten et al., 2000</xref>). Since the exact mechanisms behind regulation of LPL activity in BAT upon cold exposure are currently unclear, we hypothesized that ANGPTL4 may act as an important regulator of LPL-mediated fatty acid uptake into BAT. Accordingly, in the present paper we studied the role of ANGPTL4 in lipid metabolism during cold exposure, taking advantage of <italic>Angptl4</italic>-deficient (<italic>Angptl4</italic>-/-) mice and <italic>Angptl4</italic>-overexpressing (<italic>Angptl4</italic>-Tg) mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ANGPTL4 expression in BAT is down-regulated upon sustained cold exposure</title><p>ANGPTL4 and LPL protein are co-expressed in BAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), suggesting a possible role for ANGPTL4 in regulating LPL in BAT. The specificity of the antibody used in the immunoblotting for ANGPTL4 was demonstrated by the lack of observable signal in BAT of <italic>Angptl4</italic>-/- mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> - left panel). Interestingly, we detected bands for ANGPTL4 at a molecular weight of ∼52 kDa and ∼45 kDa. The expected molecular weight of ANGPTL4 protein is 45 kDa, with a predicted glycosylation site at amino acid Asparagine-177 (in humans) or Asparagine 181 (in mice) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ge et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yoon et al., 2000</xref>). Consistent with the notion that these bands represent glycosylated (∼52 kDa) and non-glycosylated forms (∼45 kDa) of ANGPTL4, the 52 kDa band disappeared following treatment of BAT lysates with the endoglycosidase PGNase, while the 45 kDa band became more intense (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> – right panel). These data indicate that ANGPTL4 protein is present in BAT in glycosylated and non-glycosylated forms. Immunofluorescent staining on sections from human BAT obtained during surgery (as qualified based on UCP1 staining) showed that ANGPTL4 is also expressed in human BAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In agreement with high ANGPTL4 expression levels in BAT, <italic>Angptl4</italic> mRNA increased markedly upon differentiation of a mouse brown adipocyte cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08428.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>ANGPTL4 expression in BAT is down-regulated upon sustained cold exposure.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunoblot for mouse ANGPTL4 and mouse LPL in lysates of kidney, spleen, heart, muscle, gonodal WAT, inguinal WAT and BAT of a C57BL/6J wild-type mouse.

Two major fuel sources for BAT are plasma glucose and free fatty acids, both of which were unaltered by cold and <italic>Angptl4</italic> genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,I</xref>). Also, plasma glycerol, which is perhaps a better indicator of adipose tissue lipolysis than free fatty acids, was not different between the three genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). Additionally, <italic>ex vivo</italic> treatment of differentiated primary white adipocytes with the non-selective β-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol indicated a lack of effect of <italic>Angptl4</italic> genotype on adipose tissue lipolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). Besides glucose and free fatty acids, circulating TG represent a major fuel for BAT during cold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cannon and Nedergaard, 2004</xref>). Based on the marked decrease in <italic>Angptl4</italic> mRNA levels in BAT upon prolonged cold exposure, we hypothesized that ANGPTL4 might play a role in the metabolism of circulating TG in BAT during cold. In line with this notion, the reduction in plasma TG visible in wild-type and <italic>Angptl4</italic>-/- mice in response to cold was greatly attenuated in <italic>Angptl4</italic>-Tg mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). Lipoprotein profiling by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) supported markedly augmented plasma TRL levels in cold-exposed <italic>Angptl4</italic>-Tg mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref>).</p><p>It is well-established that cold-induced reductions in plasma TG levels are mediated by increased LPL activity in BAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartelt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kersten, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klingenspor et al., 1996</xref>). Accordingly, we tested whether ANGPTL4 levels influence changes in BAT LPL activity upon prolonged cold exposure. Whereas wild-type mice respond to cold with a reduction in BAT ANGPTL4 mRNA and protein levels, <italic>Angptl4</italic>-Tg mice maintain higher ANGPTL4 mRNA and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). Mirroring the levels of ANGPTL4, the cold-induced changes in LPL activity in BAT exhibited a gradient across the three <italic>Angptl4</italic> genotypes, with highest LPL activity observed in <italic>Angptl4</italic>-/- mice and lowest LPL activity in <italic>Angptl4</italic>-Tg mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Furthermore, the marked increase in LPL activity during cold observed in the wild-type mice was significantly blunted in <italic>Angptl4</italic>-Tg mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Interestingly, the two-fold increase in LPL activity by cold in <italic>Angptl4</italic>-/- mice indicates that part of the induction of LPL activity in BAT is independent of ANGPTL4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), possibly via an increase in <italic>Lpl</italic> mRNA, which was observed in all three genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartelt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klingenspor et al., 1996</xref>).

To examine the consequences of AMPK activation in BAT, we treated differentiated T37i brown adipocytes with multiple AMPK activators, including AICAR, A769662, metformin, and phenformin hydrochloride. Without exception, AMPK activation markedly down-regulated <italic>Angptl4</italic> mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).

AICAR treatment of differentiated T37i adipocytes, BA adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Uldry et al., 2006</xref>) or murine primary brown adipocytes resulted in a marked decrease in ANGPTL4 mRNA and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B,C</xref>).

Consistent with the notion that the negative regulation of ANGPTL4 by AMPK is specific for BAT, AICAR treatment markedly reduced ANGPTL4 mRNA and protein levels in BAT explants, but not WAT explants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G,H</xref>). Based on these data, we propose that the different amount and activation of AMPK between BAT and WAT may be the critical factor in the differential regulation of ANGPTL4 between the two tissues during sustained cold.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08428.013</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Activation of AMPK down-regulates ANGPTL4 expression specifically in brown adipocytes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Angptl4</italic> mRNA in differentiated T37i adipocytes treated for 6 hr with 1 mM AICAR, 100 μM A769662, 1 mM metformin or 250 μM phenformin hydrochloride.

We found that PPARγ agonists and to a lesser extent agonists for PPARα and PPARδ highly induce ANGPTL4 mRNA and protein in BA and T37i brown adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B,C</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have shown that AMPK may inhibit PPARα and PPARγ transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leff, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sozio et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, we observed that AMPK activation almost completely blocked the induction of <italic>Angptl4</italic> mRNA following treatment with the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). Accordingly, we hypothesized that activation of AMPK following prolonged cold exposure may inhibit PPARγ-mediated transcription of the <italic>Angptl4</italic> gene. To examine this possibility, a luciferase construct was prepared containing the three conserved PPAR response elements (PPREs) of intron 3 of the murine <italic>Angptl4</italic> gene. These three PPREs have previously been shown to be responsible for PPAR-mediated up-regulation of <italic>Angptl4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaddatz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mandard et al., 2004</xref>).

By contrast, co-treatment with AICAR blunted the increase in luciferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). Interestingly, whereas co-transfection of the PPARγ co-activator <italic>P300</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gelman et al., 1999</xref>) further stimulated luciferase activity in the absence of AICAR, it failed to do so in the presence of AICAR, suggesting that regulation of P300 may be part of the mechanism of inhibition of ANGPTL4 by AMPK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). In support of this possibility, treatment of brown adipocytes with AICAR resulted in phosphorylation of P300 at serine residue 89, which is known to reduce the capacity of P300 to co-activate nuclear transcription factors, whereas no change in total P300 protein levels was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that the negative regulation of ANGPTL4 in BAT upon cold exposure may be mediated by the inhibition of PPARγ transcriptional activity by AMPK.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The energy requirements of BAT increase manifold during cold exposure. The increased energy demands coincide with a marked increase in LPL activity, stimulating uptake of TRL-derived fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartelt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bertin et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khedoe et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klingenspor et al., 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">1996</xref>). Increased LPL activity has been shown to be essential for the lipid-lowering effect of cold exposure, as injection of heparin or tetrahydrolipstatin compromises LPL-dependent uptake of TRLs and TRL-derived fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartelt et al., 2011</xref>). Since <italic>Lpl</italic> mRNA in BAT is only moderately increased upon prolonged cold exposure, it has been suggested that the pronounced increase in LPL activity in BAT occurs at the post-translational level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Giralt et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klingenspor et al., 1996</xref>). Our data demonstrate that a substantial part of the increase in LPL activity in BAT during prolonged cold exposure is mediated by down-regulation of ANGPTL4.</p><p>Overall, our findings reveal a major role for ANGPTL4 in the regulation of lipid partitioning during sustained cold. Specifically, the data implicate ANGPTL4 as an important mediator of preferential shuttling of TRL-derived fatty acids to BAT during cold exposure. Via direct effects on local LPL activity and subsequent fatty acid uptake, the reciprocal regulation of ANGPTL4 in BAT and WAT assures an adequate fuel delivery to BAT during cold exposure. The differential regulation of ANGPTL4 and LPL between BAT and WAT leads to corresponding changes in fatty acid uptake from TRLs, with our data showing a clear dose-dependent and causal relationship between ANGPTL4 expression and TRL-derived fatty acid uptake into both tissues. The importance of ANGPTL4 in the regulation of LPL activity during cold complements the already established role of ANGPTL4 in regulation of LPL during fasting and exercise in WAT and skeletal muscle, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Catoire et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kroupa et al., 2012</xref>). ANGPTL4 can thus be viewed as the master regulator of tissue LPL activity and fatty acid uptake during physiological conditions such as fasting, exercise and cold exposure.</p><p>Our data suggest that the opposite regulation of ANGPTL4 expression during prolonged cold between BAT and WAT may be explained by the differential expression and activation of AMPK between the two tissues. Heterotrimeric AMPK has one catalytic (α), and two regulatory (β and γ) subunits, each having distinctive isoforms with a tissue-specific distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Viollet et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">2010</xref>). Tissue-specific combinations of different subunit isoforms may confer tissue-specific properties to AMPK by determining subcellular localization and substrate targeting, thereby controlling cellular and systemic responses to metabolic stressors, including sustained cold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Viollet et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">2010</xref>). Indeed, with prolonged cold exposure, AMPK becomes progressively activated in BAT and only to a minor extent in WAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bauwens et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mulligan et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Systemic activation of AMPK has been previously shown to increase the activity of LPL in both heart and muscle and to lower plasma TG levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">An et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bergeron et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buhl et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Catoire et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Geerling et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ohira et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, AMPK activation was found to cause a pronounced reduction in ANGPTL4 expression in muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Catoire et al., 2014</xref>). Similar to muscle and heart, we found the AMPKα2 catalytic subunit to be abundantly present in BAT, but not WAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Viollet et al., 2009</xref>). Together, the increased AMPK activation and different AMPK subunit expression in BAT as compared to WAT may explain why the repressive effect of cold-induced AMPK activation on ANGPTL4 expression is much more pronounced in BAT than in WAT. We suggest that regulation of ANGPTL4 in WAT during cold may be dominated by activation of β-adrenergic signalling, which may explain the increase in ANGPTL4 expression observed in WAT during sustained cold exposure.</p><p>We provide evidence that regulation of ANGPTL4 by AMPK occurs at the transcriptional level, affecting PPARγ-mediated transcription of the <italic>Angptl4</italic> gene. ANGPTL4 has been repeatedly shown to be a highly sensitive target of all PPAR transcription factors in a variety of tissues and cells and following a variety of physiological stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dijk and Kersten, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Georgiadi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kersten et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mandard et al., 2004</xref>). Previously, PPARγ-mediated transcription has been shown to be inhibited by activation of AMPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cheang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Namgaladze et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sozio et al., 2011</xref>). A potential link between PPARγ and AMPK may be the modulation of co-activator recruitment to PPARγ by AMPK. A well-established co-activator of PPARγ that has been shown to be regulated by AMPK is P300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gelman et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leff, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2001</xref>). P300 is a key regulator of the assembly and mobilization of the transcriptional machinery by connecting transcription factors to the transcriptional machinery and enhancing DNA accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vo and Goodman, 2001</xref>). AMPK activation enhances P300 degradation and causes phosphorylation of P300 at serine residue 89, thereby blocking the interaction of P300 with PPARγ and reducing PPARγ transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leff, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2001</xref>). Although our <italic>in vitro</italic> data suggest an involvement of P300 and PPARγ in the suppression of ANGPTL4 by AMPK activation, whether P300 is also involved in <italic>in vivo</italic> regulation of ANGPTL4 during cold exposure remains to be determined.</p><p>Despite the unmistakable dependency of BAT LPL activity on ANGPTL4 expression, a modest cold-induced increase in LPL activity and TRL-derived fatty acid uptake is observed in BAT of <italic>Angptl4</italic> -/- mice, which may be (partially) explained by the moderate increase in <italic>Lpl</italic> mRNA in BAT in the cold. Alternatively, there may be a role for another, yet to be identified, cold-induced post-translational modulator of LPL. It may be hypothesized that this post-translational modulator is also involved in the rapid increase in LPL activity during acute cold exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klingenspor et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>No overt abnormalities in cold-tolerance were observed in the <italic>Angptl4</italic>-/- or <italic>Angptl4</italic>-Tg mice as compared to wild-type mice. This observation, however, does not refute the importance of ANGPTL4 in fuel delivery to BAT during cold exposure. BAT is a well-conserved organ that is postulated to have conferred to mammals the evolutionary advantage to survive cold stressors such as birth or low environmental temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cannon and Nedergaard, 2004</xref>). It is likely that differential uptake of TG in other organs and altered uptake of other available fuels (free fatty acids, glucose) compensate for the reduced uptake of TRL-derived fatty acids by BAT in <italic>Angptl4</italic>-Tg mice. Strikingly, adipose tissue-specific deletion of LPL in mice does not result in an overt phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartelt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garcia-Arcos et al., 2013</xref>). While plasma TG levels are elevated in these mice, no other parameters were altered, indicating that even in mice completely lacking LPL in adipose tissue, alternative mechanisms exist to fuel BAT and WAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartelt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garcia-Arcos et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our data show that regulation of ANGPTL4 is an important factor in directing lipid fuels towards BAT and away from WAT during prolonged cold exposure.

Your full submission has been evaluated by Mark McCarthy (Senior Editor) and two peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers. Based on our discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reason for the negative decision is that very substantial additional experiments would be necessary to solidify the direct involvement of AMPK in the mechanism of ANGPTL4 regulation. As it stands, this connection is weak and not substantiated with sufficient evidence. The literature on AMPK reveals the difficulty in relying on AICAR to document direct involvement on AMPK in biological pathways. There are other problematical issues such as the apparent inconsistencies in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> that contradict the title of that section of the paper. Although the manuscript presents an interesting story, the mechanistic information remains limited at this stage of the study. As you know, <italic>eLife</italic>'s policy is not to make offers of resubmission that would be contingent on the generation of extensive additional data: rather it makes a judgement on the paper &quot;as is&quot;, allowing relatively rapid resubmission elsewhere if the paper is not taken forward.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Djik et al. present compelling evidence that ANGPTL4 mediates trafficking of lipids to brown adipose during cold exposure. The experiments outlined, and the models chosen to analyze convincingly demonstrate that alterations in the local levels of ANGPTL4 modulate LPL activity differentially between white and brown adipose depots. This work is performed well, is concise, and marks an interesting and unique finding explaining a previously undescribed physiological phenomenon. A few points that deserve further attention:</p><p>1) The presumed physiological rationale for increased lipid delivery to BAT during cold exposure is for increased thermogenesis. However, the <italic>Angptl4</italic> transgenic mice have no alteration in core body temperature following cold exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

This is in stark contrast to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> and the message of the paper which indicates increased ANGPTL4 causes decreased lipid uptake. Finally, nowhere in this figure are the protein levels of ANGPTL4 demonstrated to be altered in WAT following cold exposure.</p><p>While this does not alter the entire findings of the paper, and the following statement remains true – &quot;<italic>Angptl4</italic> expression caused a clear dose-dependent reduction in uptake of TRL-derived fatty acids&quot; –, the authors must reconcile these findings, potentially by performing these experiments after a shorter cold exposure time before significant browning has taken place in the Inguinal WAT depot.</p><p>3) The authors argue that &quot;the opposite regulation of ANGPTL4 expression in BAT and WAT may be mediated by differential activation of AMPK&quot;). However <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref> shows that cold exposure increases P-AMPK in both iWAT and BAT despite that these tissues display differential regulation of ANGPL4.

The main stumbling block appeared to be the insufficient evidence for a direct involvement of AMPK in the mechanism of ANGPTL4 and LPL regulation during cold in white and brown adipose tissue. This issue was raised by both reviewers but no specific suggestions for experiments were raised, as both reviewers must have recognized the near impossibility of addressing that question via in vivo experiments, short of investing at least 2-3 years of intense work. Consequently, we further elaborated on the connection between AMPK and ANGPTL4 via in vitro experiments. We feel that in the revised manuscript, containing more extensive in vitro data confirming the involvement of AMPK in ANGPTL4 regulation, the issues raised by the reviewers have been largely resolved. The following major additions and changes were made to the paper:</p><p>1) We added data on WAT and BAT weights as well as bodyweight gain during cold exposure;</p><p>2) We have added immunoblots of various AMPK subunits in white and brown adipose tissue. The marked difference in abundance of various AMPK subunits between brown and white adipose tissue provides further insight into differences in AMPK activation and expression between the two tissues;</p><p>3) We show that a down-regulation of <italic>Angptl4</italic> mRNA expression in brown adipocytes is not exclusive to AICAR, but is also elicited by activation of AMPK by metformin, A-769662 and phenformin hydrochloride;</p><p>4) We confirm the role of AMPK in the negative regulation of <italic>Angptl4</italic> by treatment of brown adipocytes with siRNA against AMPKα1 and AMPKα2. The down-regulation of <italic>Angptl4</italic> upon treatment with A-769662 and AICAR was greatly attenuated in siAMPK-treated adipocytes;</p><p>5) We have added data showing that AMPK activation of BAT explants but not WAT explants causes down-regulation of <italic>Angptl4</italic>, highlighting the different responses of the two tissues upon AMPK activation;</p><p>6) We mostly removed the data on inguinal white adipose tissue from the manuscript. Judging from the reviewers’ comments, the addition of inguinal white adipose tissue, a tissue with properties in between gonadal white adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue, was confusing rather than complementary and supportive for our mechanism;</p><p>7) We leave open the possibility of adding new data showing an increase in plasma ANGPTL4 in obese individuals subjected to two days of mild cold (see response to last comment of reviewer 1);</p><p>8) Finally, as requested, we have further expanded the protocol of the LPL activity measurements. Reviewer #1:<italic>Djik et al. present compelling evidence that ANGPTL4 mediates trafficking of lipids to brown adipose during cold exposure. The experiments outlined, and the models chosen to analyze convincingly demonstrate that alterations in the local levels of ANGPTL4 modulate LPL activity differentially between white and brown adipose depots. This work is performed well, is concise, and marks an interesting and unique finding explaining a previously undescribed physiological phenomenon.

And further, does decreased LPL activity in BAT and WAT during cold exposure in the</italic> Angptl4<italic>-Tg alter weight balance upon cold exposure?</italic> </p><p>Given the importance of cold-induced thermogenesis in mice, there is substantial redundancy in fuel supply to BAT. It is likely that <italic>Angptl4</italic>-Tg mice compensate for the lower lipid uptake by increased uptake of another fuel, e.g. glucose. It should be emphasized that very few mutant mice show a reproducible defect in cold-tolerance, including PPARa knock-out mice and adipose tissue-specific LPL knock-out mice. Compensatory mechanisms may also explain why after cold exposure we do not observe a difference in weight in <italic>Angptl4</italic>-Tg mice as compared to <italic>Angptl4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>Angptl4 <sup>/</sup> </italic> mice.</p><p>Consistent with what would be expected, under thermoneutral conditions weight of WAT and BAT were highest in the <italic>Angptl4</italic>-Ko mice and lowest in the <italic>Angptl4</italic>-Tg mice. In all genotypes it was observed that weight of WAT was lower in cold-exposed mice as compared to mice kept at thermoneutral temperatures. In contrast, in all genotypes weight of BAT was higher in cold-exposed mice as compared to mice kept at thermoneutral temperatures. For reasons that are unclear, the relative difference in weight of WAT between cold-exposed and thermoneutral mice was lowest in the <italic>Angptl4</italic>-Tg group. The data have been added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Finally, in agreement with the lack of difference in food intake between the three genotypes, bodyweight gain during the 10 day cold exposure did not differ between the three genotypes. The data have been added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) While <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5 B</xref> nicely demonstrates that</italic> Angptl4 <italic>expression may limit increases in LPL activity in WAT following cold exposure, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref> directly contradicts the title to this section (</italic>Angptl4 <italic>expression and LPL activity are oppositely regulated in WAT and BAT upon sustained cold exposure) as 5I and J clearly indicate increased LPL activity in IWAT following cold exposure.

As a result, the response of iWAT to cold contains features of both BAT and regular WAT, consistent with the mixed cell population within iWAT following cold. We had felt that inclusion of iWAT in the paper would strengthen our mechanism, showing a continuum between different tissues with different amounts of ‘brown-like’ cells. However, we recognize that it may also create confusion by not presenting a uniform phenotype of WAT, as suggested by the section title and the Abstract. Based on this consideration, we decided to remove the data on iWAT to present a more black and white story comparing BAT with regular (gonadal) WAT. Protein levels of ANGPTL4 in BAT and WAT upon cold exposure can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, showing a clear decrease in ANGPTL4 protein in BAT and a clear decrease in ANGPTL4 protein in WAT by cold.</p><p><italic>3) The authors argue that &quot;the opposite regulation of ANGPTL4 expression in BAT and WAT may be mediated by differential activation of AMPK&quot;. However <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref> shows that cold exposure increases P-AMPK in both iWAT and BAT despite that these tissues display differential regulation of ANGPL4. Although the other experiments here support their claim as AiCAR treatment decreases ANGTPL4 expression, the purported mechanism of differential regulation via AMPK seems unlikely and further work is needed to elaborate this claim</italic>.</p><p>We agree that further elaboration on the mechanism would strengthen the manuscript. Consequently, in the revised manuscript several additions were made to specifically elaborate on the opposite regulation of ANGPTL4 in BAT and regular (gonadal) WAT is regulated via AMPK: 1) We have added immunoblots of various AMPK subunits in white and brown adipose tissue. The marked difference in abundance of various AMPK subunits between brown and white adipose tissue provides further insight into differences in AMPK activation and expression between the two tissues; 2) We show that a down-regulation of <italic>Angptl4</italic> mRNA expression in brown adipocytes is not exclusive to AICAR, but is also elicited by activation of AMPK by metformin, A-769662 and phenformin hydrochloride; 3) We confirm the role of AMPK in the negative regulation of <italic>Angptl4</italic> by treatment of brown adipocytes with siRNA against AMPKα1 and AMPKα2.

Accordingly, we believe that the increase of p-AMPK in iWAT is due to browning. As discussed above, iWAT exhibits a phenotype intermediate between gWAT and BAT. As suggested in our response to the second comment, we decided to remove iWAT from the paper to prevent any misunderstandings.</p><p><italic>4) ANGTPL4protein is processed and can be released into circulation as both a paracrine and an endocrine factor.

How are the levels of this protein altered during cold exposure, and do these alterations follow the authors' reported findings?</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful comment. We have tested all commercial ELISAs for mouse ANGPTL4 but unfortunately none allows detection of ANGPTL4 protein in mouse plasma. With respect to humans, we have measured plasma ANGPTL4 in human subjects exposed to 16ºC for 48 hours (Wijers et al., Obesity (Silver Spring) 2010). Interestingly, we found that mild cold caused a statistically significant increase in plasma ANGPTL4 in obese subjects but not in lean subjects. One possibility for the increase in plasma ANGPTL4 in obese but not in lean individuals is that obese individuals have more WAT and that the change in ANGPTL4 production in WAT dominates the amount of ANGPTL4 in plasma.</p><p>However, since ANGPTL4 is expressed in many tissues and the origin of circulating ANGPTL4 is unclear, we are a bit uncomfortable using these data in our manuscript. For this reason, we did not add a figure to the manuscript, but we are willing to add it to our paper if the reviewers and editors would consider it worthwhile.</p><p><italic>5) Expand on LPL activity assay.

One confounding factor is that the effects of AMPK on fuel use during cold are likely also mediated by factors other than ANGPTL4. Another confounding factor is that modulating AMPK in vivo is expected to alter plasma levels of FFA, which are very potent activators of ANGPTL4 production.
