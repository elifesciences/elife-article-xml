Responses of individual neurons tuned to specific features of the sensory stimuli are essential building blocks of this population representation of the physical world. Feature-selective responses arise through a combination of precise patterns of neuronal connectivity and intrinsic cellular properties. A cortical neuron is an input-output device that receives thousands of cortical and sub-cortical synaptic inputs and in turn generates a spiking output, whose selectivity often differs dramatically from the selectivities of its sub-cortical inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hubel and Wiesel, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Priebe and Ferster, 2012</xref>). The cell-intrinsic properties gate this input-output transformation by controlling how the neuron summates inputs and then maps it on to a spiking output. While the patterns of synaptic inputs underlying some receptive field properties of cortical neurons have been uncovered in the mature cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jagadeesh et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Reid and Alonso, 1995</xref>), it remains unclear how the input patterns and the cell-intrinsic properties evolve during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhang and Linden, 2003</xref>), and yet these features are a key component of understanding how cortical circuits compute in general.</p><p>In the mammalian primary visual cortex (V1), neuronal responses are particularly characterized by selectivity for two features of the visual stimuli: orientation (orientation selectivity) and direction of motion (direction selectivity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hubel and Wiesel, 1959</xref>). At the time of eye opening in carnivores and primates, while neurons already exhibit orientation selectivity, they respond about equally to motion in the two opposite directions orthogonal to the preferred axis of orientation. Selectivity to direction of motion develops rapidly in the days and weeks following the onset of visual experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hatta et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clemens et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Smith et al., 2015</xref>), and can be accelerated in the lab through exposure to moving stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Van Hooser et al., 2012</xref>). In cats and primates, it has been demonstrated that a set of inputs activating the cell at varying spatial positions and temporal latencies following a specific spatiotemporal order underlies direction selectivity in the visually mature state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DeAngelis et al., 1993b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jagadeesh et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McLean et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Livingstone, 1998</xref>). But the mechanisms underlying the development of this precise pattern of spatiotemporal activation, and consequently of direction selectivity, are poorly understood. Additionally, the contributions of cell-intrinsic properties to the development of direction-selectivity also remain largely unexplored.</p><p>Therefore, to clarify the contributions of synaptic and cell-intrinsic properties to the development of direction selectivity, we carried out in vivo intracellular recordings in V1 from two groups of ferrets at different stages of visual development: visually naive (post-natal day P30-34) and visually experienced (P40-60). Using reverse correlation of membrane potential (Vm) responses to sparse noise stimuli, we constructed the spatiotemporal receptive fields (STRF) of neurons in the two groups and compared them. We found significant differences in the spatiotemporal organization of receptive fields between the visually naive and experienced groups. Surprisingly, the enhancement in Vm responses brought about by these receptive field rearrangements did not successfully predict the developmental enhancement in spiking responses. We tested whether a concomitant developmental alteration in intrinsic excitability, which gates the input-output transformation of neurons, could underlie this discrepancy. Consistent with this idea, we found that V1 neurons in visually experienced animals had stronger gains in Vm-to-spike transformation, and that this gain enhancement was accompanied by a lowering of spike threshold. Changes in subthreshold responses and voltage-to-firing rate gain enhancement both had to be considered to explain the total increases in firing rates that are observed over this period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clemens et al., 2012</xref>), signifying that a combination of synaptic and intrinsic plasticity mechanisms underlie development of direction selectivity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>At the time of eye opening, around 30–33 days of postnatal age (P30-P33), neurons in ferret visual cortex exhibit robust selectivity for stimulus orientation but only very weak selectivity for stimulus direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2008</xref>). Selectivity for stimulus direction emerges over the weeks following eye opening through a process that requires visual experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2006</xref>). In cortical simple cells in the visually experienced state, direction selectivity is thought to arise from spatiotemporally selective inputs activating the cell at varying spatial positions and temporal latencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DeAngelis et al., 1993b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jagadeesh et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McLean et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Livingstone, 1998</xref>). According to this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Reichardt and Poggio, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reichardt, 1987</xref>), a direction-selective neuron is maximally activated when its inputs selective for specific spatial locations within the receptive field are activated by a moving stimulus in a specific temporal order – with the inputs with the longest latencies activated first and inputs with progressively shorter latencies sequentially activated thereafter. This spatiotemporally sequenced order of activation ensures that the subthreshold inputs activated by the preferred direction of motion arrive at the soma simultaneously and achieve maximal summation, leading to a strong response. In contrast, a stimulus moving in the null direction activates the shortest latencies first followed by progressively longer latencies, thereby leading to suboptimal summation of activity, and consequently lower responses in the postsynaptic neuron. A direction-selective simple cell with its inputs organized in this manner exhibits a stereotypical ‘slant’ in its spatiotemporal receptive field.</p><p>In order to examine the initial state of spatiotemporal receptive fields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and to understand how these fields are altered during the short critical period for the emergence of direction selectivity, we carried out in vivo intracellular recordings in the visual cortex of anesthetized ferrets using sharp microelectrodes. Intracellular recordings were used because naive visual cortical neurons exhibit lower firing rates than experienced animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clemens et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Popović et al., 2018</xref>), and we wanted to be able to examine the receptive field properties of the subthreshold voltage in addition to spiking. Experimental animals were split in to two age groups: visually naive (‘naive’: age P30-34, n = 10 animals, 23 cells) and visually experienced (‘experienced’: age P40-60, n = 11 animals, 29 cells). Drifting sinusoidal grating stimuli were used to measure responses to stimulus orientation and direction. Cells were classified as simple or complex by comparing the fundamental (F1) and the DC components (F0) of the visual responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carandini and Ferster, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mechler and Ringach, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Priebe et al., 2004</xref>). We first converted the Vm and spike responses of each recorded neuron to the frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and then analyzed all response properties for the F0 and F1 components separately as well as combined (F0+F1). We calculated Vm and spike modulation ratios by dividing the amplitude of the F1 component by that of the F0 component of the respective responses. Cells with spike modulation ratio equal to or greater than 1.0 were classified as simple, while the rest were categorized as complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Neurons that did not fire sufficient spikes were classified as simple if their Vm modulation ratio was greater than 0.5. According to this classification, our dataset contained 10 simple and 13 complex cells in the naive group, and 16 simple and 13 complex cells in the experienced group. After a cell’s orientation and direction preferences were identified by the responses to grating stimuli, sparse noise bar stimuli were shown to examine the spatiotemporal receptive fields only for the simple cells, because such analysis of linear summation properties apply only to simple cells.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Hypotheses of initial naive states.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In Possible Juvenile State I, receptive fields might be initially broad and weak in space and time and later sharpened to exhibit a slant. In this state, the lack of direction selectivity comes from the symmetry in the broad initial receptive field. In Possible Juvenile State II, there is a compact initial input that is constrained to grow only at certain positions and latencies, either by addition of new synaptic inputs or by changes in the properties of existing inputs. In this state, the lack of direction selectivity comes from the symmetry of compact strong input, and the weak inputs do not contribute at the naive stage.

Thus, in both groups, the outputs of V1 cells were more sharply tuned for direction than their summed inputs. Also, to test if the developmental enhancement of DSI in V1 cells were restricted to the mean (F0) or the modulated (F1) component or affected both, we calculated DSI separately for the F0 and the F1 response components. F0 and F1 DSI for both sub- and suprathreshold responses in the experienced group were significantly higher than the naive group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; F0: Vm: naive: mean = 0.15 +/- 0.02, n = 23; experienced: mean = 0.27 +/- 0.04, n = 29; p=0.02, WRS test; spike: naive: mean = 0.33 +/- 0.05, n = 14; experienced: mean = 0.62 +/- 0.05, n = 29; p=0.003, WRS test; F1: Vm: naive: mean = 0.32 +/- 0.04, n = 14; experienced: mean = 0.57 +/- 0.04, n = 29; p&lt;0.001, WRS test; spike: naive: mean = 0.31 +/- 0.06, n = 14; experienced: mean = 0.7 +/- 0.04, n = 29; p&lt;0.001, WRS test), demonstrating that both the mean and the modulated component of visual responses became more direction-selective during development.</p><p>An increase in direction selectivity index values could be realized either by an increase in responses to the preferred direction, a decrease in responses to the null direction, or both. To distinguish between these possibilities, we analyzed the Vm and spiking response amplitudes to the preferred and the null direction stimuli for each cell. The total (F0 plus F1) responses to the preferred and null stimuli were compared between the naive and experienced groups, separately for Vm and spiking responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). At the level of Vm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, top), the null responses (left) did not show any significant change over development, whereas the preferred responses (right) showed a modest but significant increase from the naive to the experienced group (Null, naive: mean = 11 ± 1.2, n = 23; experienced: mean = 11.2 ± 0.9, n = 29, p=0.8, WRS test; Preferred, naive: mean = 13.1 ± 1.3, n = 23; experienced: mean = 17.3 ± 0.9, n = 29, p=0.008, WRS test). At the level of spiking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, bottom), both the null and the preferred responses underwent developmental enhancement (null, naive: mean = 4.8 ± 1.2, n = 23; experienced: mean = 9 ± 1.5, n = 29, p=0.01, WRS test; preferred, naive: mean = 6.6 ± 1.6, n = 23; experienced: mean = 24.7 ± 2.6, n = 29, p&lt;0.001, WRS test). Therefore, the increase in direction selectivity following visual experience was driven primarily by a robust increase in responses to the preferred direction of motion and not by a decrease in response to the null direction of motion. Notably, while this increase in response to the preferred direction was modest (32%) at the Vm level, it was dramatic for spiking activity (274%).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Reorganization of simple cell spatiotemporal receptive fields following visual experience</title><p>The increase in Vm responses to the preferred direction raises the question as to what changes in the spatiotemporal receptive field configurations might underlie these increases. To compare spatiotemporal receptive field structures of the Vm responses between simple cells from the naive and experienced groups, we performed reverse correlation of the response of the Vm to sparse, one-dimensional noise visual stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Reid et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Reid et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Reid et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ringach et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Priebe and Ferster, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rust et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">van Kleef et al., 2010</xref>). The noise stimulus consisted of black, white and gray bars, angled at the cell’s preferred orientation, that changed pattern every 100 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Positive cross-correlation values were obtained if a white bar (contrast 1) led to increased Vm or a black bar (contrast −1) led to decreased Vm (ON subunit), and negative cross-correlation values were obtained if a white bar led to decreased Vm or a black bar led to increased Vm (OFF subunit). For every spatial location, the cross-correlation values were plotted at varying lag times, thereby allowing assessment of the latencies at which the high or low cross-correlation values were obtained. Because visually driven spiking activity was weak in naive ferrets, we focused our analysis primarily on the Vm responses, for which a reliable spatiotemporal receptive field could be computed for every simple cell tested.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Developmental reorganization of linear spatiotemporal receptive fields in visual cortical simple cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of sparse noise stimulus, rotated to match each cell’s preferred orientation.

For cell #60, gratings moving from right to left on the monitor would activate the inputs with longer latencies first, progressively moving to shorter latencies as the grating moves across the visual field, thereby leading to maximal response. Stimuli moving from left to right, on the other hand, will activate the shorter latency inputs followed by the longer latency inputs, thereby leading to sub-optimal responses. The spatiotemporal receptive field of Cell #86 was also slanted, albeit in the opposite direction.</p><p>The spatiotemporal receptive fields from the neurons in naive animals were not completely unstructured, and exhibited several properties of neurons from experienced animals such as alternating ON and OFF subunits and a small slant in space-time. However, the subunits from the experienced cells were longer and narrower in profile, and relatively more slanted in space-time.</p><p>To rigorously quantify the degree to which subunit structure differed between naive and experienced animals, we fitted ellipses to the individual ON and OFF subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leong et al., 2016</xref>) and compared several shape parameters of these ellipses (see <bold>Materials and methods</bold>). We chose a set of nine parameters that adequately captured the relevant spatial and temporal characteristics of the receptive fields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) – ‘eccentricity’: eccentricity of the fitted ellipse; ‘major axis’: the length of the major axis of the fitted ellipse; ‘minor axis’: the length of the minor axis of the fitted ellipse; ‘orientation’: the angle the ellipse subtended on the space (x-) axis; ‘area’: the full area covered by the ellipse, in pixels; ‘spatial extent’: projection of the ellipse on the space axis; ‘temporal extent’: projection of the ellipse on the time/latency axis; ‘minimum latency’: the lower bound of the fitted ellipse on the time axis signifying the shortest latency response; and ‘maximum latency’: the upper bound of the fitted ellipse on the time axis signifying the longest latency response. Wilcoxon rank sum test comparisons revealed that six out of these nine parameters were significantly different between the naive and the experienced groups: eccentricity, major axis, minor axis, orientation, temporal extent and minimum latency. The shape parameter that is most relevant to direction selectivity is the eccentricity of the ellipses describing the subunits. If subunits are broad along the minor axis of the ellipse, they will enable some response summation from stimuli moving in either direction, thus leading to weaker direction selectivity. Also, if subunits are short along the major axis of the ellipse, there might not exist sufficient latency differences to facilitate differential input summation. Therefore, to optimally support high direction selectivity, receptive field subunits would have to be narrow on the minor axis and elongated on the major axis, which would result in high eccentricity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Spatiotemporal receptive fields become more extended, slanted in space-time with short-term visual experience.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Quantification of the nine parameters defining the characteristics of the spatiotemporal receptive field subunits.

In these images, there are four quadrants organized around the origin, which represents 0 spatial and temporal frequency. The two diagonally opposite quadrants contain the same data, and each of the two such diagonal pairs correspond to the two opposite directions of motion each. For example, if the quadrant with positive spatial and temporal frequencies represents forward motion, then the quadrant with positive spatial and negative temporal frequencies represents the backward motion. In a cell with low direction selectivity (left), the intensity of pixels in these two quadrants are similar, whereas in a highly direction selective cell (right), the pixel intensities are strikingly higher in one of the two quadrants. The imbalance of intensities along the two diagonals can be used to predict direction selectivity of the linear component for a simple cell. The summed amplitudes from each of the two quadrants represent predicted amplitudes of Vm responses to the two opposite motions, and we used those predicted responses to calculate a predicted Vm DSI for the linear component of the cell’s response.

Also, the subunits from the experienced animals subtended a smaller angle on the space axis (orientation: p&lt;0.005), which would indicate that the cells from experienced animals are tuned to higher motion velocities, consistent with data from actual V1 recordings in cats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DeAngelis et al., 1993a</xref>). The overall area (p&lt;0.6) and the spatial projection (p&lt;0.35) of the subunits did not significantly differ. However, the projection on the latency axis was significantly longer in the experienced group (p&lt;0.04), suggesting that a longer range of response latencies became available in the experienced animals. This extension of the latency range was achieved solely by stretching the receptive field subunits towards the lower latency side: while the maximum latencies of the subunits were not significantly different (p&lt;0.3), the minimum latencies were significantly lower in the experienced group (p&lt;0.05). Consistent with this data, we also found that the Vm response latency distributions were significantly shifted towards shorter latencies in the experienced animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), and these results mirror reduced latencies observed in experienced vs. naive neurons in ferret lateral geniculate nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tavazoie and Reid, 2000</xref>).</p><p>If the changes in Vm spatiotemporal receptive field structure resulted in improved discrimination between the preferred and null directions of motion, then the receptive field structure parameters should correlate with Vm direction index measured in each cell. Therefore, we computed linear correlations between cell-averaged shape parameters and the cells’ Vm direction index values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We found that the Vm direction index of the cells increased with increasing ‘narrowness’ of the subunits (longer ‘major axis’, shorter ‘minor axis’ and higher ‘eccentricity’), ‘orientation’, if the one low outlier is removed, and decreasing minimum latencies accessible (lower ‘min latency’). Other parameters did not show significant correlation. These data further corroborate the idea that narrower spatiotemporal input profiles and availability of shorter latency inputs exert a strong impact on directional summation of inputs in simple cells of experienced animals, thereby leading to higher direction selectivity. Additionally, the Vm DSI predicted from the STRFs, by converting the STRFs into the frequency domain via 2-dimensional FFT, showed a linear correlation with the actually measured Vm DSI of the F1 components of the simple cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), further demonstrating that the STRF structures influenced the direction selectivity index values of the cells.

Thus, every recorded cell in the experienced group fired action potentials, but 9/23 cells in the naive group did not fire any action potentials at all. However, enhancement of Vm responses mediated by reorganization of STRF structure alone could not account for this enhanced spiking. As we saw in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, the responses to the preferred direction underwent modest developmental increase (32%) at the Vm level, but the increase was dramatic for spiking activity (274%). Therefore, we argued that changes in cell-intrinsic properties also must have played a role in amplifying the effects at the Vm level. Visual inspection of spike waveforms revealed a couple of striking differences between the naive and the experienced groups: in the naive group, the spikes were significantly broader and the take-off point of the action potential (spike threshold) was higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5ABC</xref>).

In each simulation, a cell was chosen at random (with replacement) to provide the response Vm waveforms, and another cell was chosen at random (with replacement) to provide the voltage-to-firing rate transform. This rough phenomenological model assumes that voltage responses and gains can be selected independently; in the actual data, these quantities are not completely independent and the random mixture model slightly overestimates actual firing rates from the population. When membrane voltages and voltage-to-firing rate transforms were both selected from naive cells, the simulations yielded relatively low direction selectivity index values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>) and low firing rate responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>), similar to the actual data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2EF</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7CE</xref>).

On the one hand, the mature receptive fields became elongated along the temporal axis, particularly by exhibiting responses with shorter response latencies that did not exist in the naive state. However, the mature receptive fields also became significantly narrow in space-time, providing evidence for a narrowing process. This process is reminiscent of the sharpening (narrowing) of spatial receptive fields over the first weeks and months after the onset of experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DeAngelis et al., 1993a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tavazoie and Reid, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kiorpes, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kiorpes, 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Increased intrinsic excitability</title><p>As neurons mature, they must regulate their ion channels and synaptic connections in order to bring their spiking response rates into an appropriate physiological range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Turrigiano and Nelson, 2004</xref>). At eye opening, neurons in vivo exhibit weak spiking activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clemens et al., 2012</xref>) (this study) and both rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kasper et al., 1994</xref>) and ferrets (this study) exhibit wide action potentials. Further, as neurons are maturing during this stage just after eye opening, their input resistance also rapidly decreases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kasper et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Desai et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2012</xref>), which means the same input current will produce a smaller resulting voltage. Previous studies in rats have shown that layer 4 neurons add synapses during this time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Desai et al., 2002</xref>) and that spike threshold decreases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kasper et al., 1994</xref>), presumably to bring the visual response rates up to mature values and to overcome the decreasing input resistance. In other feed-forward systems, the weight of feed-forward connections increases substantially: ~50 fold over the first week of vision at the retinogeniculate synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen and Regehr, 2000</xref>) and 2–4 fold from P4 to P15 in the barrel cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2013</xref>), presumably to allow mature selectivity and firing rates. Because subthreshold voltage responses increase over the first week of vision and because input resistance is going down, feed-forward synaptic contributions to visual cortex are also likely to be increasing, although we are not aware of direct measurements that would confirm this hypothesis. Increases in sodium channel density at the axon initial segment may underlie the enhancement in the maximum slope of Vm during an action potential (max dV/dt) and decreased threshold observed here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Colbert and Pan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kole et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grubb and Burrone, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kuba et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>While we observed an increase in input-output gain (in vivo), a reduced spike threshold (ex vivo), and evidence of a more excitable membrane (increased maximum dV/dt), we did not observe an overall increase in spiking in ex vivo current-firing rate (F-I) curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L</xref>). An F-I curve plots the cellular firing rate as a function of the amplitude of somatically injected current. The current-to-spiking transformation takes place in two distinct steps: in the first step the injected current elicits a change in Vm, a process gated by the cell’s input resistance. Due to developmental decreases in input resistance we observed, the same current amplitude would elicit a smaller Vm change in the cells from experienced as compared to the naive animals. In the second step, a given level of Vm elicits the firing of a certain number of spikes, a process gated by the mechanisms of spike generation such as threshold voltage. Our in vivo data show that this Vm-to-spike transformation is steeper in the experienced animal, possibly mediated by lowered spike threshold. During the measuring of F-I curves, these two factors possibly cancel each other, resulting in F-I curves indistinguishable across the two developmental stages. In addition, stronger visually evoked synchronous synaptic currents in the experienced state might help overcome the effect of lower input resistance, resulting in higher Vm responses after all. For these reasons, the lack of enhancement in F-I curves obtained from slices does not contradict the strong enhancement in intrinsic excitability, as evidenced by the steeper Vm-to-spike curves and lower thresholds.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Developmental changes in input-output gain</title><p>The spike threshold non-linearity contributes substantially to cortical direction selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Reid et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jagadeesh et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Priebe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Priebe and Ferster, 2005</xref>). Before these experiments, it was possible to imagine that much of the developmental increase in cortical direction selectivity in ferret might be due not to changes in subthreshold inputs, but rather purely through changes in effective threshold or the voltage-to-firing rate transform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Van Hooser et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Christie et al., 2017</xref>).

A variety of mechanisms seem plausible given the data.</p><p>First, the receptive field expansion that we observed might be due to recruitment of additional synapses between LGN neurons and cortical neurons, such that newly connected neurons are providing inputs at the latencies and positions that are newly present in the spatiotemporal receptive fields of mature neurons. These results fit nicely with prior anatomical observations that the number of excitatory synapses being formed in ferret and human visual cortex during this time are greatly increasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huttenlocher, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Durack and Katz, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ruthazer and Stryker, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">White et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Erisir and Harris, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">White and Fitzpatrick, 2007</xref>), and are consistent with the idea that precise growth may be an important principle of the development of some neural circuits.</p><p>A second hypothesis is that the maturation of receptive field properties of already-connected LGN neurons or cortical neurons might cause the spatiotemporal receptive field to expand, and confer direction selectivity even without such selectivity in the antecedent inputs. For example, LGN neuron latency drops during the first weeks of visual experience <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tavazoie and Reid, 2000</xref>; therefore, it is possible that changes in receptive field properties of already-connected LGN cells that exhibit purely center surround receptive fields could fill out the earlier latency regions of the experienced spatiotemporal receptive fields. Experiments that measure thalmocortical inputs to cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alonso and Reid, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Swadlow et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lien and Scanziani, 2018</xref>), performed in developing animals, could support or reject this hypothesis. Regardless of whether LGN inputs are altered or constant, there is clear evidence linking the spatiotemporal structure of LGN inputs to direction selectivity in V1 in mice and carnivores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kremkow et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lien and Scanziani, 2018</xref>).</p><p>A third hypothesis is that a change in the relative contributions of excitation and inhibition within the cortex underlie the maturation we observed. Although the data here force us to reject the hypothesis that the change in direction selectivity is purely due to postsynaptic changes in excitability, it remains possible that there might be no changes in LGN inputs and that amplified firing from recurrent connections underlie the increases in Vm selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Douglas et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Suarez et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Christie et al., 2017</xref>). Under this view, contributions could increase from the excitatory side such that the enhanced gain in cortical neurons would recurrently drive changes in the synaptic inputs, leading to additional direction selectivity.

The baseline was defined as the 20th percentile of the data points in this time interval, to discount any spontaneous activity that was more prevalent especially in the older animals; manual inspection showed that this value was very close to what the experimenter would have selected on a case-by-case basis. For spike analyses, spikes were detected using a manually set threshold on the Vm trace for each recording epoch. For each cell, we examined both the mean response to drifting grating stimulation (F0) as well as the modulation at the stimulus frequency (F1). If a cell’s F1 response was greater than the mean response (F0), then the cell was declared to be a ‘simple’ cell.

Your article has been evaluated by three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor.</p><p>This manuscript has been read by three reviewers. All three agree that this is an excellent study with high quality data addressing he important questions regarding the mechanisms underlying the maturation of receptive fields in ferret visual cortex. However, there were significant concerns of the context in which these data were presented. These concerns can be addressed with significant revisions to text and some additional analysis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This study represents a careful dissection of the maturation of receptive fields in ferret primary visual cortex. It has been well-established that direction selective responses in ferret cortex emerge in an activity dependent manner after eye opening. The authors use in vivo sharp electrode recordings to gain insights into the changes in receptive field properties that underlie the maturation of directional tuning. Specifically, they first show that both subthreshold changes in membrane potential as well as spiking output increase their direction selectivity tuning. Second, they use random visual stimuli to characterize the space-time receptive fields (STRFs) and compare properties for both immature and mature simple cells. From these data they see there is both an expansion of compact receptive fields and an enhanced tilt in space-time. Third, they use in vivo and in vitro recordings to show that there is an increase in the excitability of cells by assessing action potential waveforms. Fourth they compute voltage-&gt; firing rate transformation (i.e. input-output gain, a term first introduced by classic papers by Priebe and Ferster). Finally, they use a simple model to show that need both changes in receptive fields and input-output gain functions to explain the change in tuning.</p><p>The paper is clearly written (though the Abstract is a bit obtuse – see below) and the data clearly presented. The data is gorgeous and based on very difficult experiments. The authors are to be commended.</p><p>1) The Abstract can really only be understood by people within the field – particularly the sentences about the STRFs (e.g. &quot;expansion of space-time receptive fields along the temporal dimensions&quot; and &quot;marked loss of inputs with certain space-time selectivities&quot;).</p><p>2) In Figure 5J-L, the authors argue that the change in spike waveform seems to balance out the decrease in input resistance and increase capacitance associated with development due to the enlargement of cells. So, it is not clear whether there is a change in excitability contributed to the enhanced input-output gain.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this paper, the authors studied mechanisms underlying the development of direction selectivity in ferret visual cortex. They performed intracellular recording to reveal both synaptic and intrinsic membrane properties that are correlated with direction selectivity development. Overall, the paper addressed an important question; the data were of high quality; and presentation was largely clear. However, the authors fell short in connecting the synaptic changes (spatial temporal receptive fields) with changes in direction selectivity, which can be potentially corrected by additional analysis.</p><p>1) The main finding of the paper is changes in the spatial temporal receptive fields (STRF; Figure 4), which was interpreted as changes in synaptic connections (Figure 1). Specially, the authors concluded that there was both pruning of existing connections (because of the narrowing of minor axis) and forming of new connections (increase in major axis and decrease of latency). However, as the authors mentioned, dLGN cells' receptive fields become smaller and faster, which could account for much of the changes in cortical receptive fields. Can the authors perform additional analysis using existing LGN data to determine how much of the observed changes can be explained by changes in the dLGN or more upstream, without a change in synaptic connection?</p><p>2) The most dramatic change to me is actually the STRF orientation (Figure 4C, D), the extent of which does not appear to be reflected by the quantification in Figure 4A. Please double check the analysis. More importantly, the authors did not provide any evidence connecting STRF structure with direction selectivity, despite how they framed the study (Figure 1). Did the STRF predict the preferred direction and DSI in adult animals? In young animals, this does not seem to be the case for DSI (Figure 4B), perhaps because most of them did not have any tilt.</p><p>3) Assuming STRF structure indeed determines direction selectivity (to be shown by the authors), what changes could mediate the appearance of the adult tilt? Synaptic reorganization, changes in dLGN response temporal profile, or conduction delay? Some discussion are needed given its importance.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This is an excellent and important piece of work that investigates the development of direction selectivity in visual cortex. The mechanism underlying cortical direction selectivity has been a topic of great interest for several decades and attracted the attention of many different laboratories across the world. One of the most powerful approaches to study input-output neuronal transformations in the brain is to perform in vivo intracellular recordings. However, this approach is technically very difficult and, to my knowledge, it has only been used to study cortical direction selectivity in adult animals. Remarkably, the authors succeeded at performing these experiments in immature developing brains and the data that they collected is simply beautiful. Just because the data is unique and obtained with such a powerful approach, the study is of great value to the scientific community. In addition, the high quality of the data and the unexpected findings increase even further the scientific impact.</p><p>My comments should be seen more as suggestions to improve an already strong paper rather than criticisms. Most of my comments relate with the interpretation of the results and are relatively minor.</p><p>1) Abstract. The Abstract motivates the work by offering two alternative mechanisms of wiring development, elimination of redundant connections or formation of new connections. However, the general reader may think that this motivation is misleading since the development of neuronal connections frequently involves a combination of both. For example, each immature LGN neuron receives multiple retinal inputs that are eliminated as the brain matures. In addition, the remaining connections become stronger by making new connections (i.e. new synapses).</p><p>2) Abstract. The parallel that the Abstract makes between elimination/formation of connections and input/intrinsic changes does not work well. The mixed mechanism involving changes in input connectivity and intrinsic excitability is different from a mixed mechanism involving elimination and formation of connections. The authors may want to consider changing the motivation of the work (e.g. nobody knew the intracellular changes underlying the development of direction selectivity until the authors performed these experiments).</p><p>3) Abstract. It is unclear whether the authors can interpret the changes that they observe in the spatiotemporal receptive field as formation of new connections, as they claim in the Abstract. Changes in the temporal dimension of the spatiotemporal receptive field could be caused by combined changes in the receptive field size, time course and synaptic strength of already-connected inputs. A paragraph of the discussion states this wonderfully (quoted below) but the rest of the paper (including the Abstract) gives the impression that the results provide a direct demonstration of changes in the number of inputs during development. This could be misleading particularly for the non-specialized reader. Quote of paragraph: &quot;Alternatively, maturation of receptive field properties of already-connected LGN neurons or cortical neurons might cause the spatiotemporal receptive field to expand, and confer direction selectivity even without such selectivity in the antecedent inputs. […] Or, perhaps connections from LGN cells with reduced latencies do not form until after the onset of experience&quot;.</p><p>4) Introduction and Results. Several sections of the paper appear to imply that the results provide direct evidence for formation and elimination of synaptic inputs. However, as the authors acknowledge in the Discussion, this is one of several possible interpretations. Therefore, it is probably a good idea to make it clear early in the paper that the elimination/formation of inputs is not a direct conclusion from the results but a possible interpretation. For example, the authors state: &quot;…became more elongated along the temporal axis, corroborating the idea of recruitment of new synaptic inputs. However, the subunits also became significantly narrower along their preferred space-time axis, consistent with pruning of synaptic inputs with certain spatiotemporal properties&quot;. The term &quot;consistent with&quot; is probably more appropriate than &quot;corroborating&quot;. &quot;Corroborating&quot; may lead the non-specialized reader to believe that the authors are providing a direct demonstration of input recruitment.</p><p>5) Changes in the relative strength of intracortical inhibition could be proposed as another possible interpretation of the results and should probably be discussed. Several studies have demonstrated that intracortical inhibition plays an important role in cortical direction selectivity including those from Sacha Nelson (the PhD advisor of the corresponding author) and, more recently, David Fitzpatrick (the postdoctoral advisor). An alternative interpretation of the results is that the receptive field maturation that they observe originates from changes in the relative strength of excitation and inhibition. For example, the much larger increase in spiking than Vm response during development could reflect a release from shunting inhibition as cortical neurons mature. This mechanism could also explain why the spiking response in the null direction is weaker in naive than mature ferrets. The developmental increase in response to the null direction may indicate that stimulus-driven excitation becomes stronger than stimulus-driven inhibition during development. Inhibition could also be relatively stronger in immature brains because cortical neurons spike less but each spike from inhibitory neurons has a relatively bigger impact in the cortical response because excitation is weak.</p><p>6) It may be a good idea to report the signal to noise ratio of the receptive field measurements. This is important to fully disregard the possibility that the reported differences are not partly due to differences in signal to noise between naïve and experienced animals. The signal to noise should be lower in naïve animals because stimuli drive weaker fluctuations in Vm and spike rate than in experienced animals. This is not a concern in the interpretation of the results because the authors did not find differences in area, spatial extent and temporal extent of the receptive fields between naïve and experienced animals. However, reporting signal to noise measurements somewhere in the Materials and methods section is important to fully eliminate this concern. If there is a difference in signal to noise, the authors can control for a possible contribution of this difference in their comparison by subsampling spikes in experienced animals at the same rate as in naïve animals and show that the most important results (e.g. changes in eccentricity) hold.</p><p>7) Results. The following statement is another example of a possible misleading conclusion: &quot;…In sum, following visual experience, the Vm receptive fields exhibited marked reorganization… and recruitment of lower latency inputs&quot;. &quot;recruitment of lower latency inputs&quot; seems to imply that the results directly show this. However, recruitment of lower latency inputs is one of several possible interpretations. One interpretation is that already-connected LGN inputs become stronger and faster in response latency. It would be very interesting to see the relation between response strength and latency across the entire dataset. One possibility is that response strength and latency are negatively correlated and both change together during development.</p><p>8) It is very impressive to see all the pronounced and clear changes that the authors report in just 14 days of development.

So, it is not clear whether there is a change in excitability contributed to the enhanced input-output gain.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now removed the interpretive sentences from the Results section pertaining to this figure, because it was causing some confusion. Instead we have now added a more detailed elaboration on this point in the Discussion section, under the subsection “Increased intrinsic excitability”. We quote the relevant paragraph here:</p><p>“While we observed an increase in input-output gain (in vivo), a reduced spike threshold (ex vivo), and evidence of a more excitable membrane (increased maximum dV/dt), we did not observe an overall increase in spiking in ex vivo current-firing rate (F-I) curves (Figure 5L). […] For these reasons, the lack of enhancement in F-I curves obtained from slices does not contradict the strong enhancement in intrinsic excitability, as evidenced by the steeper Vm-to-spike curves and lower thresholds.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…]</p><p>1) The main finding of the paper is changes in the spatial temporal receptive fields (STRF; Figure 4), which was interpreted as changes in synaptic connections (Figure 1). Specially, the authors concluded that there was both pruning of existing connections (because of the narrowing of minor axis) and forming of new connections (increase in major axis and decrease of latency). However, as the authors mentioned, dLGN cells' receptive fields become smaller and faster, which could account for much of the changes in cortical receptive fields. Can the authors perform additional analysis using existing LGN data to determine how much of the observed changes can be explained by changes in the dLGN or more upstream, without a change in synaptic connection?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is a critical next question, and this is the subject of an ongoing study in the lab that is recording from populations of LGN cells while ferret cortex acquires direction selectivity. We hope this study will be ready for publication in 6-12 months but it is a separate and complex effort (LGN cells in the same animal are studied before and after visual experience). We agree that this is a really interesting question to tackle but it is a separate study that is similar in size to the present work, and following a population over time in the same animal adds a degree of challenge that takes time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The most dramatic change to me is actually the STRF orientation (Figure 4C, D), the extent of which does not appear to be reflected by the quantification in Figure 4A. Please double check the analysis. More importantly, the authors did not provide any evidence connecting STRF structure with direction selectivity, despite how they framed the study (Figure 1). Did the STRF predict the preferred direction and DSI in adult animals? In young animals, this does not seem to be the case for DSI (Figure 4B), perhaps because most of them did not have any tilt.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is important to connect the STRF parameters and direction selectivity. First, in our initial submission, we attempted to address this in Figure 4B and in the subsection “Reorganization of simple cell spatiotemporal receptive fields following visual experience”. These show and describe correlations between all of the STRF parameters and direction selectivity measurements in naïve and experienced cells. Our analysis indeed finds that STRF subunit shape parameters such as eccentricity and latency correlate with the cells’ actually measured DSI values in ways that corroborate our idea that higher eccentricity and faster responses correspond with stronger direction selectivity. Second, to make this relationship even clearer, we have now added another analysis as a new Figure 4—figure supplement 1. In this analysis, we take advantage of Fast Fourier Transform to convert the STRFs into the frequency domain, and generate predictions of DSI from the resulting images (following the Methods in Priebe and Ferster, 2005). This analysis also shows that the Vm DSI values predicted from the STRFs are linearly correlated to the actually measured Vm DSI values (for the linear F1 component), with an R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.32. This suggests that about one third of the variance in direction selectivity of simple cells can be explained by variance in linear spatiotemporal summation properties as captured in the STRFs. Taken together, we believe these analyses provide incontrovertible evidence that the STRF structure has a strong influence on the cells’ direction selectivity.</p><p>The reviewer has also mentioned that the orientation/tilt of the STRF subunits should be the most dramatic effect. We have checked our analysis and the results reported in Figure 4A are accurate. However, there is an outlier that causes the “orientation-DSI” relationship in Figure 4B to be not significant. We give the results with and without the outlier (without the outlier, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.26 and p≤0.03).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Assuming STRF structure indeed determines direction selectivity (to be shown by the authors), what changes could mediate the appearance of the adult tilt? Synaptic reorganization, changes in dLGN response temporal profile, or conduction delay? Some discussion are needed given its importance.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to comment 2 above. Furthermore, we have now added substantial new texts to the Discussion that address the suggested mechanistic speculations, under the subsection “Possible synaptic bases of spatiotemporal receptive field reorganization”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] My comments should be seen more as suggestions to improve an already strong paper rather than criticisms. Most of my comments relate with the interpretation of the results and are relatively minor.</p><p>1) Abstract. The Abstract motivates the work by offering two alternative mechanisms of wiring development, elimination of redundant connections or formation of new connections. However, the general reader may think that this motivation is misleading since the development of neuronal connections frequently involves a combination of both. For example, each immature LGN neuron receives multiple retinal inputs that are eliminated as the brain matures. In addition, the remaining connections become stronger by making new connections (i.e. new synapses).</p><p>2) Abstract. The parallel that the Abstract makes between elimination/formation of connections and input/intrinsic changes does not work well. The mixed mechanism involving changes in input connectivity and intrinsic excitability is different from a mixed mechanism involving elimination and formation of connections. The authors may want to consider changing the motivation of the work (e.g. nobody knew the intracellular changes underlying the development of direction selectivity until the authors performed these experiments).</p><p>3) Abstract. It is unclear whether the authors can interpret the changes that they observe in the spatiotemporal receptive field as formation of new connections, as they claim in the Abstract. Changes in the temporal dimension of the spatiotemporal receptive field could be caused by combined changes in the receptive field size, time course and synaptic strength of already-connected inputs. A paragraph of the Discussion states this wonderfully (quoted below) but the rest of the paper (including the Abstract) gives the impression that the results provide a direct demonstration of changes in the number of inputs during development. This could be misleading particularly for the non-specialized reader. Quote of paragraph: &quot;Alternatively, maturation of receptive field properties of already-connected LGN neurons or cortical neurons might cause the spatiotemporal receptive field to expand, and confer direction selectivity even without such selectivity in the antecedent inputs. […] Or, perhaps connections from LGN cells with reduced latencies do not form until after the onset of experience&quot;.</p><p>4) Introduction and results. Several sections of the paper appear to imply that the results provide direct evidence for formation and elimination of synaptic inputs. However, as the authors acknowledge in the Discussion, this is one of several possible interpretations. Therefore, it is probably a good idea to make it clear early in the paper that the elimination/formation of inputs is not a direct conclusion from the results but a possible interpretation. For example, the authors state: &quot;…became more elongated along the temporal axis, corroborating the idea of recruitment of new synaptic inputs. However, the subunits also became significantly narrower along their preferred space-time axis, consistent with pruning of synaptic inputs with certain spatiotemporal properties&quot;. The term &quot;consistent with&quot; is probably more appropriate than &quot;corroborating&quot;. &quot;Corroborating&quot; may lead the non-specialized reader to believe that the authors are providing a direct demonstration of input recruitment.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this concern, and, after consideration, we have changed the Introduction and Abstract substantially to be more agnostic as to the mechanisms that underlie the changes in receptive fields. We take the point that we do not have any direct evidence of synaptic changes and that the better thing to do is to focus on the receptive field changes we observed and describe the possible circuit mechanisms in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Changes in the relative strength of intracortical inhibition could be proposed as another possible interpretation of the results and should probably be discussed. Several studies have demonstrated that intracortical inhibition plays an important role in cortical direction selectivity including those from Sacha Nelson (the PhD advisor of the corresponding author) and, more recently, David Fitzpatrick (the postdoctoral advisor). An alternative interpretation of the results is that the receptive field maturation that they observe originates from changes in the relative strength of excitation and inhibition. For example, the much larger increase in spiking than Vm response during development could reflect a release from shunting inhibition as cortical neurons mature. This mechanism could also explain why the spiking response in the null direction is weaker in naive than mature ferrets. The developmental increase in response to the null direction may indicate that stimulus-driven excitation becomes stronger than stimulus-driven inhibition during development. Inhibition could also be relatively stronger in immature brains because cortical neurons spike less but each spike from inhibitory neurons has a relatively bigger impact in the cortical response because excitation is weak.</p></disp-quote><p>We have reorganized the Discussion to place the statements about the descriptive changes in spatiotemporal receptive structure (some expansion and some constriction) in one section, and speculation about the possible synaptic bases that might underlie these changes in another section. We appreciate the suggestion to separate these portions and expand the ideas of the synaptic bases to include inhibition. In the new section that speculates on synaptic bases, we consider 3 main themes: there could be recruitment of additional LGN cells; there could be no change in the LGN cell connections but the receptive field properties of the connected LGN cells change; there could be changes in the excitatory or inhibitory connections within cortex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) It may be a good idea to report the signal to noise ratio of the receptive field measurements. This is important to fully disregard the possibility that the reported differences are not partly due to differences in signal to noise between naïve and experienced animals. The signal to noise should be lower in naïve animals because stimuli drive weaker fluctuations in Vm and spike rate than in experienced animals. This is not a concern in the interpretation of the results because the authors did not find differences in area, spatial extent and temporal extent of the receptive fields between naïve and experienced animals. However, reporting signal to noise measurements somewhere in the Materials and methods section is important to fully eliminate this concern. If there is a difference in signal to noise, the authors can control for a possible contribution of this difference in their comparison by subsampling spikes in experienced animals at the same rate as in naïve animals and show that the most important results (e.g. changes in eccentricity) hold.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer points out, since not all STRF shape parameters show differences, we think it is unlikely that SNR is an underlying confound here. Nevertheless, we took another look at the data to address this point. There is some uncertainty as to what would be the best estimate of SNR in this scenario, but one idea is that the actual correlation values that build the STRFs might contain some clues. The concern as stated by the reviewer is that the Vm responses are weaker in the naïve animals, and therefore might lead to unreliable STRF structures, which might lead to spurious differences in shape parameters. If this were the case, both the ON and OFF subunits in the naïve state would be less clearly separated from the correlation floor (noise or background). However, as can be seen from the example STRFs in Figure 3 (notice the color bars), there doesn’t appear to be a strong difference between the 2 groups in how well the STRFs are separated from the floor. To quantify, we ran a one-way ANOVA between the <italic>absolute</italic> peak correlation values of the ON and OFF subunits between the 2 groups, and found no significant differences. This demonstrates that the STRF subunit peaks and troughs are no differently separated from the floor in the 2 groups, and therefore this factor is unlikely to contribute to the observed shape differences (Author response image 1). A paragraph on this analysis has been added to the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Results.

In accordance with our complete revamping of the text to remove all allusion to the idea that the data unambiguously demonstrate a cortical origin of the STRF changes, we have removed two mentions of the “recruitment” idea from the Results section. Instead, all these ideas are elaborated as possible mechanisms in the Discussion section under the subsection “Possible synaptic bases of spatiotemporal receptive field reorganization”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) It is very impressive to see all the pronounced and clear changes that the authors report in just 14 days of development.
