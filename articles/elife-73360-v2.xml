responsiveness, blood pressure, heart rate, and energy balance. As neurons primarily utilize glucose as their primary metabolic energy source, we generated mice with increased glycolysis in cholinergic neurons by specific deletion of the fructose-2,6-phosphatase protein TIGAR. Steady-state and stable isotope flux analyses demonstrated increased rates of glycolysis, acetyl-CoA production, acetylcholine levels, and density of neuromuscular synaptic junction clusters with enhanced acetylcholine release. The increase in cholinergic signaling reduced blood pressure and heart rate with a remarkable resistance to cold-induced hypothermia. These data directly demonstrate that increased cholinergic signaling through the modulation of glycolysis has several metabolic benefits particularly to increase energy expenditure and heat production upon cold exposure.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>TIGAR</kwd><kwd>cholinergic neurons</kwd><kwd>acetylcholine</kwd><kwd>neuromuscular junction</kwd><kwd>skeletal muscle thermogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK033823</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pessin</surname><given-names>Jeffrey</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK020541</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pessin</surname><given-names>Jeffrey</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>S10 SIG Award for the Sciex 6500+QTRAP</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1S10OD021798</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kurland</surname><given-names>Irwin J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>TIGAR deficiency in cholinergic neuron enhanced intracellular acetyl-CoA levels and pyruvate dehydrogenase flux into the TCA cycle that drives increased cholinergic tone with reduced heart rate and blood pressure and raised resistance against the paralytic curare and cold-induced hypothermia.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>TIGAR (Tp53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator) was originally identified as a p53-inducible protein that functions as a fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (F2,6P) but subsequently shown to have phosphatase activities for a variety of phosphorylated metabolic intermediates and allosteric regulators including 2,3-bisphospholgycerate (2,3BPG), 2-phosphoglycerate, phosphoglycolate, and phosphoenolpyruvate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bensaad et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rigden, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">BolaÃ±os, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tang et al., 2021</xref>). Due to its F2,6P dephosphorylation activity, TIGAR is generally considered a suppressor of glycolysis as F2,6P is a potent allosteric activator for 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK1), the rate-limiting step in glycolysis. However, the dephosphorylation of 2,3BPG to generate 3-phosphoglycerate would also be expected to increase glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">BolaÃ±os, 2014</xref>). In addition, the role of TIGAR in regulating carbohydrate metabolism is also complicated by the presence of the related phosphofructokinase bis-phosphatase (PFKBP) family that has both F6P 2-kinase and F2,6P bisphosphatase activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mor et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, the biological readout of TIGAR function is likely to be highly cell context dependent. In this regard, TIGAR has been reported to differentially modulate multiple different pathophysiological outcomes. For example, in the brain TIGAR expression was reported to protect against ischemic/reperfusion injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2021</xref>), whereas in the heart TIGAR deficiency protected myocardial infarction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoshino et al., 2012</xref>) and in pressure-overloaded hearts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Okawa et al., 2019</xref>). In cancer models, TIGAR plays a complex role in the formation and progression of different types of cancer via suppressing aerobic glycolysis and controlling reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tang et al., 2021</xref>). Recently, it has been reported that TIGAR can both enhance the development of premalignances and suppress the metastasis of cancer invasion by the way of inhibition of ROS production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheung et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>As carbohydrate metabolism and glycolysis are essential normal physiological processes in all cells and tissues, we have examined the metabolic phenotype of whole-body and tissue-specific TIGAR knockout mice. Surprisingly, we have observed that TIGAR deficiency in cholinergic neurons of mice results in a marked protection against hypothermia following an acute cold challenge. At a molecular level, this results from enhanced acetylcholine levels and increased cholinergic signaling at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) driving skeletal muscle shivering-induced thermogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Previously we reported that the TIGAR can modulate NF-kB signaling through a direct binding interaction and inhibition of the E3 ligase activity of the linear ubiquitin-binding assembly complex, LUBAC, in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tang et al., 2018</xref>). To examine the role of TIGAR in vivo, we initially generated whole-body <italic>Tigar</italic> knockout (TKO) mice. Surprisingly, however, during our phenotypic characterization we observed that the TKO male and female mice both display a remarkable resistance to cold induced-hypothermia. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, both male (panel A) and female (panel B) control mice when shifted from room temperature to a 4Â°C environment display the typical 4â5Â°C decline in core body temperature during the 1 hr acute exposure period. In contrast, the TKO male and female mice only display less than a 1Â°C decline in core body temperature under identical conditions. The level of <italic>Ucp1</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>) and protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>) was not significantly different in interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT) at room temperature. <italic>Ucp1</italic> mRNA did increase approximately 1.5-fold following 1 hr cold exposure, but this was not significantly different between the control and TKO mice. Although a very small amount of <italic>Ucp1</italic> mRNA was detected in inguinal adipose tissue (iWAT) of control mice at room temperature, it was lower in the TKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Moreover, following 4Â°C exposure for 2 hr there was an increase in <italic>Ucp1</italic> mRNA indicative of beige adipocyte induction. However, the induction of <italic>Ucp1</italic> mRNA was significantly reduced in the TKO mice compared to the control mice, probably due to decreased sensitivity of cold-induced sympathetic activation (see Figure 7).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>TIGAR</italic> deficiency mice are resistant to hypothermia induced by an acute cold challenge.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Male mice (wild type [WT] n = 10, whole-body <italic>Tigar</italic> knockout [TKO] n = 6) and (<bold>B</bold>) female mice (WT n = 6, TKO n = 7) core body temperatures were measured every 15 min starting at ambient laboratory temperature (0 min) and following placement at 4Â°C.

To address this, we next treated mice with the highly specific skeletal muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor competitive antagonist tubocurare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bowman, 2006</xref>). Control male mice treated with 0.4 mg/kg tubocurare became relatively inactive with essentially no detectable locomotor activity at room temperature 10 min post injection that lasted for another 20â30 min (see <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2âvideo 1</xref>). Over this time period, there was a concomitant decline in core body temperature that began to recover as the effects of tubocurare began to wear off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Tubocurare treatment of the TKO male mice at room temperature also displayed a similar decline and recovery of body temperature but that remained somewhat higher than the control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). However, shifting the male mice to 4Â°C following tubocurare injection resulted in a rapid decline in body temperature such that by 30 min the control miceâs body temperature was reduced to less than 25Â°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In contrast, the tubocurare-injected TKO male mice only display a reduction in body temperature to approximately 34Â°C under identical conditions. Moreover, while the tubocurare-treated control mice placed at 4Â°C remained completely immobile, the TKO mice display apparent normal locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2âvideo 1</xref>). Female mice are more sensitive to tubocurare than male mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maurya et al., 2013</xref>). The body temperature in WT female mice kept declining in 1 hr period after a lower dose (0.15 mg/kg) tubocurare injection at ambient temperature. Nevertheless, the decline of body temperature in the TKO female mice was resistant to the effects of tubocurare (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p>The tubocurare dose-response for male mice is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, with the control WT mice having an LD<sub>50</sub> of 0.44 mg/kg whereas the TKO mice having an LD<sub>50</sub> of 0.55 mg/kg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Injection of a lethal tubocurare dose (0.60 mg/kg) initially resulted in 50% if the control mice display a loss of voluntary locomotor activity by 150 s, but this required 240 s in the TKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). At 10 min, 100% of the control mice were dead, whereas it took nearly 25 min for 100% of the TKO mice to die (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). The tubocurare resistance of the TKO mice was not due to the changes in expression of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits with no significant differences in the skeletal muscle expression of the Î±1 (<italic>Chrna1</italic>), Î²1 (<italic>Chrnb1</italic>), or Î³ (<italic>Chrng</italic>) subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1AâC</xref>) and with a small reduction in the d (<italic>Chrnd</italic>) and Îµ (<italic>Chrne</italic>) subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1D and E</xref>) in the TKO mice.

In agreement with the TKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), the resistance to cold-induced hypothermia by acute 4Â°C challenge was very dramatic in the chTKO mice compared to the control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Similarly, the chTKO mice were highly resistant to the paralytic actions of tubocurare (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4âvideo 1</xref>). Moreover, immunoblotting of the SCG for the neuron activation marker c-Fos further demonstrated that the control mice displayed a small increase in c-Fos protein levels when cold challenged that was further increased in the chTKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). As controls, there were no significant differences in the protein levels of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) or the plasma membrane choline transporter (ChT) proteins.

This is because the m2 acetyl group formed via PDH generates <sup>13</sup>C atoms at positions 4 and 5 of glutamate, whereas the m2 <sup>13</sup>C glutamate (<italic>m/z</italic> 130) at positions 2 and 3 is derived from pyruvate carboxylase (PC)-generated oxaloacetate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Madhu et al., 2020</xref>) schematically shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A</xref>. Analyses of the <italic>m/z</italic> 128â130 C2-C4 glutamate fragment distinguish these isotopomers with the enrichment of m1 glutamate (129 fragment) approximately five times more abundant than the m2 glutamate (130 fragment) in the TKO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>If the changes in glucose flux occurred through increased flux through PDH, then we should also observe a concomitant increase in the levels of acetyl-CoA that is directly generated by PDH from pyruvate. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1C</xref>, acetyl-CoA levels were increased approximately 1.5-fold and acetyl-carnitine levels approximately 2.5-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). Since acetyl-CoA is converted to acetyl-carnitine in the mitochondria, these demonstrate that <italic>Tigar</italic> deficiency not only increases glycolysis but also results in increased mitochondria uptake of acetyl-CoA (via PDH). The increase in mitochondria PDH flux would in turn drive an increase in oxygen consumption. Seahorse flux analyses of oxygen consumption rate (OCR) clearly demonstrated that the TKO SH-SY5Y cells had higher rates of OCR compared to the control SH-SY5Y cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1E</xref>). Together, these data demonstrate that <italic>Tigar</italic> deficiency in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells results from an increase in intracellular acetyl-CoA levels consistent with increased glycolysis and direct conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA by PDH, as opposed to PC. It is the increase in PDH flux into the tricarboxylic acid cycle that drives increased mitochondria oxidation.</p><p>A generalized increased cholinergic tone would be expected to reduce blood pressure and heart rate but with increased skeletal muscle shivering. To assess these physiological parameters, we used implanted telemetry probes to simultaneously determine body temperature, mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (beats per minute [BPM]), and skeletal muscle electromyography (EMG) in the cold-exposed <italic>Chat<sup>Cre</sup></italic> and chTKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Consistent with the rectal temperature measurements previously observed, the telemetry probe also demonstrated that the chTKO mice are more resistant to cold-induced hypothermia than <italic>Chat<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). At room temperature, there was no significant difference in blood pressure, but following cold exposure the blood pressure of the control mice increased, whereas the blood pressure of the chTKO mice decreased such that by 60 min the chTKO mice had a blood pressure of 25 mmHg less than the control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Similarly, the heart rate was not statistically different at room temperature but increased substantially more in the control mice than in the chTKO mice following cold exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). As these data strongly suggest increased cholinergic signaling to enhance skeletal muscle contraction, we utilized EMG to directly determine skeletal muscle activity. A representative image of EMG tracers and root mean square (RMS) derivation is shown for the <italic>Chat<sup>Cre</sup></italic> and chTKO mice when shifted to 4Â°C for 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Quantification of these types of data as the integral of RMS during the time course of cold exposure demonstrated that at room temperature and following 10 min of cold exposure there is no significant difference in skeletal muscle contraction activity between the <italic>Chat<sup>Cre</sup></italic> and chTKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). However, the contraction activity of the control <italic>Chat<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice plateau at this level, whereas the chTKO mice shivering activity further increases to nearly twice the level of the control mice.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>The cholinergic neuron-specific <italic>Tigar</italic> knockout (chTKO) mice display enhanced cold-stimulated skeletal muscle shivering activity and increased cholinergic tone.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Male mice core body temperatures (<italic>Chat<sup>Cre</sup></italic> n = 7, TKO n = 10), (<bold>B</bold>) blood pressure (mmHg) (<italic>Chat<sup>Cre</sup></italic> n = 7, chTKO n = 10), (<bold>C</bold>) heart rate (beats per minute, BPM) (<italic>Chat<sup>Cre</sup></italic> n = 7, chTKO n = 6), (<bold>D</bold>) representative electromyography (EMG) traces and root mean squares (RMS) for <italic>Chat<sup>Cre</sup></italic> and chTKO male mice when shifted to 4Â°C for 30 min, and (<bold>E</bold>) neck EMG (<italic>Chat<sup>Cre</sup></italic> n = 5, chTKO n = 6) were measured continuously starting at ambient laboratory temperature (0 min) and for 60 min following placement at 4Â°C.

A fraction of adult humans can respond to cold stress by inducing the expression of thermogenic adipose tissue under relatively long-term cold acclimation in adult humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McNeill et al., 2021</xref>). However, it remains somewhat controversial if this inducible thermogenic human brown adipose tissue is the rodent equivalent of beige or brown adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cannon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Samuelson and Vidal-Puig, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Virtanen and Nuutila, 2021</xref>). In addition, whether the mass of the human-inducible thermogenic adipocytes is sufficient to significantly contribute to cold-responsive thermogenesis for core temperature maintenance or weight loss has also been questioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blondin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Virtanen and Nuutila, 2021</xref>). In contrast, skeletal muscle accounts for approximately 40% of healthy body mass and is the dominant factor for basal metabolic rate and the major driver of energy expenditure during physical exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blondin et al., 2014</xref>). In rodents, non-shivering thermogenesis (NST) is driven by UCP1-dependent mitochondrial uncoupling in both brown and beige adipocytes by the creatine phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle in beige adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cohen and Spiegelman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kazak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jung et al., 2019</xref>). There are also reports of a skeletal muscle-based NST via a sarcolipin-dependent futile cycle of SERCA-dependent calcium transport in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maurya et al., 2015</xref>). In humans, maximal NST can increase energy production equivalent to about two times above the resting metabolic rate (RMR), while moderate ST is 2.5â3.5 times RMR and maximal shivering has been measured at about five times RMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blondin et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, exercise at ~50% VO<sub>2</sub> max generates approximately 15 times RMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Weber and Haman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blondin et al., 2014</xref>). While a substantial effort has focused on NST, shivering and physical activity are the dominant forms of involuntary and voluntary heat production during acute cold exposure. Thus, it is essential to develop a deeper understanding of the physiological integrated role of skeletal muscle with thermogenic adipose tissue to have a complete and detailed molecular understanding of energy balance and its implications for potential interventions to promote and maintain weight loss.</p><p>The data presented in this article demonstrate that cholinergic neuron deficiency of <italic>Tigar</italic> results in an enhancement of cold-induced skeletal muscle contraction/shivering that is responsible for an increase in heat generation and protection of acute cold-induced hypothermia. This response is likely mediated by an increase acetylcholine signaling at the NMJ, consistent with the parallel induction of tubocurare resistance and increased cholinergic neuron activation. Interestingly, despite the increase in synaptic density and acetylcholine levels of mice at room temperature that are mildly cold stress (thermoneutrality for mice is approximately 29â31Â°C; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ganeshan and Chawla, 2017</xref>), <italic>Tigar</italic> deficiency does not appear to significantly affect body temperature, skeletal muscle contraction activity, or the overall skeletal muscle metabolite profile at room temperature. However, following acute cold challenge there are marked changes in these parameters between WT and cholinergic TKO mice including a metabolic profile indicative of increased ATP turnover. These findings suggest that there is an increase in cholinergic signaling reserve that only becomes apparent when cholinergic signaling demand is high.</p><p>In addition to the well-established role of sympathetic activation to increase brown and beige adipocytes thermogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>), both cholinergic and sympathetic activation can affect vascular blood flow and behavorial activities that also contribute to body temperature regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nakamura et al., 2022</xref>). Although we cannot rule out the contribution of vasoconstriction to the conservation of core body temperature under cold exposure, heat loss from the mouse tail only accounts for 5â8% of whole-body heat loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Skop et al., 2020</xref>) and is therefore unlikely to play a significant role in the thermoregulation observed by cholinergic <italic>Tigar</italic> deficiency.</p><p>In addition to TIGAR as a small carbohydrate phosphatase, previous studies have shown that TIGAR can directly interact with hexokinase 2 and the HOIP subunit of the linear ubiquitin assembly complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheung et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tang et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, although it is formally possible that TIGAR increases cholinergic signaling due to alterations in protein-protein interactions, we believe that it is more likely a result of increased glycolysis due to its phosphatase function that is occurring in the cholinergic neurons as this would result in an increase in acetyl-CoA levels. The steady-state acetyl-CoA concentrations in neuronal mitochondrial and cytosol are several folds lower than the acetyl-CoA Km values for choline acetyltransferase. More specifically, following cholinergic differentiation there is a further decrease in acetyl-CoA levels that results in a further substrate dependence of acetylcholine biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ronowska et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, several studies have also shown that choline uptake via the choline transporter is rate limiting for acetylcholine synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lockman and Allen, 2002</xref>). Although we have not measured choline uptake activity, <italic>Tigar</italic> deficiency had no significant effect on the amount of choline transporter protein. However, metabolic analyses clearly demonstrated an increased glucose-derived acetyl moiety into acetylcholine and increased steady-state acetylcholine levels with increased acetyl-CoA and acetyl-carnitine levels.</p><p>Thus, the simplest and most direct mechanism for the increase in acetylcholine levels induced by <italic>Tigar</italic> deficiency is the increased formation of acetyl-CoA through enhanced glycolysis, which in turn leads to increased production of acetylcholine in cholinergic neurons. At present, it is not possible to distinguish the amount of synaptic acetyl-CoA from skeletal muscle acetyl-CoA at the NMJ, but future studies using spatial mass spectroscopy (MALDI) may be able to resolve this issue.</p><p>Finally, it is also important to recognize that myasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular disease caused by autoantibodies against components of the NMJ and in particular the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gilhus et al., 2019</xref>). Current therapeutic strategies are focused on the use of steroids or immune suppressants to block the immune system and drugs to increase the transmission of acetylcholine signaling such as acetylcholine esterase inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gilhus et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, central cholinergic neurons undergo severe neurodegeneration in Alzheimerâs disease and agents that enhance cholinergic signaling, particularly cholinesterase inhibitor therapies, providing significant symptomatic improvement in patients with Alzheimerâs disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ferreira-Vieira et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, recent reports show that the NMJs are stable in human age-related sarcopenia and in patients with cancer cachexia, which are different from the rodent models in that the sarcopenia is linked with the endplate fragmentation in NMJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jones et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boehm et al., 2020</xref>). As such, inhibition of TIGAR function may also provide a novel approach to improve skeletal muscle function, memory, and dementia through increased cholinergic signaling while limiting the deleterious metabolic consequences secondary to currently available therapies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mix &amp; Go Competent Cells-Strain HB10</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Zymo Research</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">T3013</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Tigar<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (TKO) <break/>(C57BL/6J)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PMCID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc5961042/">PMC5961042</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MMRRC, Cat# <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mmrrc.org/catalog/cellLineSDS.php?mmrrc_id=63577">063577-UCD</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C57BL/6N-Tigar<sup>tm1b(EUCOMM)Wtsi</sup>/Wtsi</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Welcome Trust Sanger Institute (Hinxton Cambridge, UK)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IMSR Cat# EM:09836;RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_">IMSR_</ext-link> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.infrafrontier.eu/search?keyword=EM:09836">EM:09836</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Myl1<sup>Cre</sup>:</italic>Myl1<sup>tm1(cre)Sjb</sup>/J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_">IMSR_</ext-link><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jax.org/strain/024713">JAX:024713</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Chat<sup>Cre</sup>:</italic> B6J.129S6-<italic>Chat<sup>tm2(cre)Lowl</sup></italic>/MwarJ</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_">IMSR_</ext-link> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jax.org/strain/028861">JAX:028861</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Tigar<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>(C57BL/6J)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Described in âMice modelsâ</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Tigar<sup>fl/fl</sup>Adipoq<sup>Cre</sup></italic> (C57BL/6J)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Described in âMice modelsâ</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Tigar<sup>fl/fl</sup>Myl1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> (C57BL/6J)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Described in âMice modelsâ</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Tigar<sup>fl/fl</sup>/Chat<sup>Cre</sup></italic> (C57BL/6J)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Described in âMice modelsâ</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Ucp1<sup>-/-</sup> (UKO</italic>)(C57BL/6J)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Laboratory of Victor L.

The OCR was automatically recorded and calculated using the Seahorse XF24 software, and the data were exported into Prism 8.1 software for graph production and statistical analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Soleus and EDL muscles crossed section HE staining</title><p>Fresh soleus and EDL skeletal muscles from 4-month-old male WT and TKO mice were isolated and fixed in 10% formalin for 48 hr at 4Â°C. The muscle samples were then switched to 70% alcohol and subjected to H&amp;E staining at the Histology and Comparative Pathology Core at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Briefly, fixed muscle samples were embedded in cassettes perpendicularly with paraffin. The block was sectioned 10 Âµm thick, and the sections were mounted on slides, H&amp;E stained, and covered with clips. The H&amp;E-stained images were captured with a digital microscope camera.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Quantification and statistical analyses</title><p>Prism (8.1) GraphPad Software was used for data processing, analyses, and graph productions in the experiments. To analyze the differences of body temperature at different time points among two to four groups of the mice, the tabs of Grouped Analyses/two-way ANOVA (or mixed model)/multiple comparison were selected. The subtab âCompare each cell mean with the other cell mean in that rowâ was chosen to show the âSidakâs multiple comparison test,â which summarized the statistical test results. The number of independent experimental replications and the average with standard deviation are provided in the figure legends. Unpaired two-tailed p-value <italic>t</italic>-tests were used for the statistical tests between the two groups. The statistical analyses were made at significance levels as follows: ns, not statistically significant; *p&lt;0.5; **p&lt;0.1; ***p&lt;0.001, and ****p&lt;0.0001.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Software, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Software, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing â original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Software, Validation, Visualization, Writing â original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Software, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing â original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Software, Validation, Writing â original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Software, Validation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Software, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Software, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Software, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Software, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Software, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing â original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Software, Supervision, Validation, Writing â original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Software, Supervision, Validation, Writing â original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All studies were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Einstein Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Ma-Li Wong as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Alan Saltiel (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Report body weights and body composition to exclude contributions from increased muscle mass. Metabolic cage data would eliminate alterations in physical activity, food consumption and basal energy expenditure as factors that protect from cold exposure.</p><p>2) Either provide data to support increased metabolic rates in the cell model (i.e. VO2, kinetic enrichment data, etc.) or reword the few discussion points that imply increased acetyl-CoA rates of production from glycolysis drive the cholinergic effect.

Did the authors assess these physical parameters?</p></disp-quote><p>We have accessed grip strength and exercise capacity, but these parameters were unchanged at room temperature. Since there is no increase in cholinergic signaling at room temperature but only when the mice are subjected to cold stress likely accounts for the absence of any difference at room temperature. In addition, shivering activity and normal muscle contraction in terms of strength and running are markedly different. The former results in symmetric uniformed contractions between fibers whereas shivering results from asymmetric contractions with no net directional force. As far as we are aware, the exact neuronal firing mechanisms responsible for these differences remains unknown.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Was there a difference in muscle weights, fiber type or myotube diameter in the TIGER knockout mouse models?</p></disp-quote><p>Muscle mass was unchanged, and we now include H and E staining of the soleus (red) and EDL (white) skeletal muscle that demonstrate no change in muscle fiber size or morphology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Was media lactate enrichment examined?</p></disp-quote><p>We have not directly measured media lactate. We did perform Seahorse analyses and although the TKO cells displayed increased oxygen consumption rate (OCR) there was no difference in extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). This could be argued against there being an increase in glycolysis, but lactate formation is a measure of anaerobic glycolysis, necessary for regeneration of NAD<sup>+</sup> for glycolysis maintenance therein, or spillover of pyruvate flux that outweighs PDH activity under normal conditions. In our case, we see increased (mitochondrial) PDH flux, and the increased glucose flux entering the pyruvate pool winds up being metabolized in the TCA cycle rather than converting to lactate. This is particularly true for neurons that uptake lactate and then convert it to pyruvate for energy production in the mitochondria.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Provide a more complete description of the H218O study. Was the enrichment data normalized to body water enrichment? If not, please point that out and provide justification (e.g. were the mice body weight and composition matched?). Why was water administered by gavage and IP? The IP water injection is quite a large volume. Was it administered as a saline solution? If not, please justify (i.e. can a pain response be excluded?). How was the timing of the tissue collection chosen? Is this timing indicative steady state ATP turnover, or is it closer to an initial rate?</p></disp-quote><p>A more detailed description of the <sup>18</sup>O water labeling and normalization to body water enrichment is now included in the Method details section.</p><p>Mice body weights and composition were the same as now shown in new Figure 1âfigure supplement 1.</p><p>The IP was for a bolus injection to immediately raise the <sup>18</sup>O water enrichment.
