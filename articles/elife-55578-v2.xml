mechanisms to tolerate severe hypoxia or ischemia, including the hibernation-capable Arctic ground squirrel (AGS). Although hypoxic or ischemia tolerance in AGS involves physiological adaptations, little is known about the critical cellular mechanisms underlying intrinsic AGS cell resilience to metabolic stress. Through cell survival-based cDNA expression screens in neural progenitor cells, we identify a genetic variant of AGS <italic>Atp5g1</italic> that confers cell resilience to metabolic stress. <italic>Atp5g1</italic> encodes a subunit of the mitochondrial ATP synthase. Ectopic expression in mouse cells and CRISPR/Cas9 base editing of endogenous AGS loci revealed causal roles of one AGS-specific amino acid substitution in mediating cytoprotection by AGS ATP5G1. AGS ATP5G1 promotes metabolic stress resilience by modulating mitochondrial morphological change and metabolic functions. Our results identify a naturally occurring variant of ATP5G1 from a mammalian hibernator that critically contributes to intrinsic cytoprotection against metabolic stress.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>When animals hibernate, they lower their body temperature and metabolism to conserve the energy they need to withstand cold harsh winters. One such animal is the Arctic ground squirrel, an extreme hibernator that can drop its body temperatures to below 0°C. This hibernation ability means the cells of Arctic ground squirrels can survive severe shortages of blood and oxygen. But, it is unclear how their cells are able to endure this metabolic stress.</p><p>To answer this question, Singhal, Bai et al. studied the cells of Arctic ground squirrels for unique features that might make them more durable to stress. Examining the genetic code of these resilient cells revealed that Arctic ground squirrels may have a variant form of a protein called ATP5G1. This protein is found in a cellular compartment called the mitochondria, which is responsible for supplying energy to the rest of the cell and therefore plays an important role in metabolic processes.</p><p>Singhal, Bai et al. found that when this variant form of ATP5G1 was introduced into the cells of mice, their mitochondria was better at coping with stress conditions, such as low oxygen, low temperature and poisoning. Using a gene editing tool to selectively substitute some of the building blocks, also known as amino acids, that make up the ATP5G1 protein revealed that improvements to the mitochondria were caused by switching specific amino acids. However, swapping these amino acids, which presumably affects the role of ATP5G1, did not completely remove the cells’ resilience to stress. This suggests that variants of other genes and proteins may also be involved in providing protection.</p><p>These findings provide the first evidence of a protein variant that is responsible for protecting cells during the metabolic stress conditions caused by hibernation. The approach taken by Singhal, Bai et al. could be used to identify and study other proteins that increase resilience to metabolic stress. These findings could help develop new treatments for diseases caused by a limited blood supply to human organs, such as a stroke or heart attack.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Arctic ground squirrel</kwd><kwd>ischemic tolerance</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM117461</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Dengke K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000875</institution-id><institution>Pew Charitable Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Pew Scholar Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Dengke K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000008</institution-id><institution>David and Lucile Packard Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Dengke K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Innovative Genomics Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Curci Scholar Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Dengke K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18CDA34030443</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Singhal</surname><given-names>Neel S</given-names></name><name><surname>Bai</surname><given-names>Meirong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19POST34381071</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Singhal</surname><given-names>Neel S</given-names></name><name><surname>Bai</surname><given-names>Meirong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A genetic basis underlying cell resilience against metabolic stress in cells of a hibernator, Arctic ground squirrels, has been discovered.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Arctic ground squirrels (AGS, <italic>Urocitellus parryii</italic>) survive harsh winter environmental conditions through hibernation. By virtue of their profound ability to suppress metabolism and core temperature, with body temperatures dropping below 0°C, AGS are known as ‘extreme’ hibernators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barnes, 1989</xref>). Hibernation in AGS can last 7 months and is characterized by drastic (&gt;90%) reductions in basal metabolic rate, heart rate, and cerebral blood flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Buck and Barnes, 2000</xref>). Curiously, hibernation is interrupted periodically by interbout arousal (IBA) episodes in which temperature and cerebral blood flow normalize rapidly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Drew et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Karpovich et al., 2009</xref>). Nonetheless, AGS suffer no ischemic injury during hibernation or reperfusion injury during an IBA. Hibernating ground squirrels are resistant to ischemic and reperfusion injuries in numerous models, including brain and heart tissues after cardiac arrest in vivo and hippocampal slice models derived from animals during an IBA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dave et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Quinones et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bhowmick et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bogren et al., 2014</xref>). This resilience to reperfusion injury does not depend on temperature of the animal or season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bhowmick et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, AGS neural progenitor cells (NPCs) demonstrate resistance to oxygen and glucose deprivation ex vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Drew et al., 2016</xref>). Together, these studies suggest that in addition to physiological adaptations, AGS possess cell autonomous genetic mechanisms that contribute to intrinsic tolerance to metabolic stress or injury.</p><p>Proteomic and transcriptomic investigations have comprehensively catalogued the impact of season, torpor, and hibernation on cellular and metabolic pathways in several different tissues of hibernating ground squirrels, including the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Quinones et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ballinger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gehrke et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hampton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Luan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrews, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hindle et al., 2014</xref>). Although the mechanisms underlying hibernating ground squirrel ischemia and hypothermia tolerance in the brain are not fully elucidated, studies suggest that post-translational modifications, regulation of cytoskeletal proteins, and upregulation of antioxidants play a prominent role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bhowmick and Drew, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tessier et al., 2019</xref>). Gene expression profiling and bioinformatic analyses also indicate the cytoprotective contributions of mitochondrial and lysosomal pathways in adapting to hypothermia and hypoxia in ground squirrel and marmot species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ou et al., 2018</xref>). In neurons differentiated from 13-lined ground squirrel (13LGS) induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), Ou and colleagues found that hibernating ground squirrel microtubules retained stability upon exposure to hypothermia. The authors identified mitochondrial suppression of cold-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and preservation of lysosomal structure are key features of ground squirrel cytoprotection, and that pharmacological inhibition of ROS production or lysosomal proteases recapitulates the hypothermia-tolerant phenotype in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ou et al., 2018</xref>). Taken together, these studies provide important insights into pathways mediating AGS tolerance to metabolic stress. However, these studies have not focused on specific genes and proteins with cytoprotective effects uniquely evolved in hibernating ground squirrels. As such, we know very little about mechanistic details underlying genetic contribution to intrinsic stress resilience in ground squirrels.</p><p>Using a cDNA library expression-based genetic screen combined with phenotypic analyses of cell survival and mitochondrial responses to stress as compared in mouse versus AGS NPCs, we identified AGS transcripts imparting ex vivo cytoprotection against various metabolic stressors. We further use CRISPR/Cas9 DNA base editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Koblan et al., 2018</xref>) to determine functional importance of amino acid substitutions uniquely evolved in AGS, and identified AGS ATP5G1<sup>L32</sup> as a causal contributor to stress resilience in AGS, suggesting potential for targeting this component of ATP synthase for neuroprotective treatments.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>AGS neural cells exhibit marked resistance to metabolic stressors associated with improvements in mitochondrial function and morphology</title><p>When growing under identical cell culture conditions, AGS and mouse NPCs exhibit similar morphology, growth rates and expression of Nestin and Ki67, markers for proliferating NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-E</xref>). Although superficially indistinguishable, mouse and AGS NPCs demonstrate markedly different responses to metabolic stressors. When exposed to hypoxia (1% O<sub>2</sub>), hypothermia (31°C), or rotenone (30 µM), AGS NPCs exhibit profound resistance to cell death compared with mouse NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), recapitulating resilient AGS phenotypes found in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dave et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bhowmick et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bogren et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Drew et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, measurement of in vitro oxygen consumption of AGS NPCs after sequential exposure to mitochondrial toxins demonstrates strikingly higher ‘spare respiratory capacity’ in response to FCCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F, G</xref>), indicating a greater metabolic reserve for stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nicholls and Budd, 2000</xref>). Mitochondrial citrate synthase and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) enzymatic activities were similar between the two species, with the exception of complex IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Interestingly, functional improvements in mitochondrial function were also mirrored by changes in mitochondrial dynamic organization following exposure to FCCP at doses that lead to mitochondrial depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). At baseline, mouse and AGS cells had similar mitochondrial organization as evidenced by similar mean branch length and number of cells with fragmented mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Following FCCP treatment, mouse cells demonstrated marked increases in mitochondrial fission with concurrent decreases in mean branch length. By contrast, AGS cells appeared largely resistant to mitochondrial fission induced by FCCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).

However, we still know little about the mechanistic details of how AGS protein-coding genetic variants contribute to intrinsic cytoprotective functions. We show that ex vivo cultured AGS NPCs can recapitulate remarkable intrinsic resilience to hypoxia, hypothermia, and other metabolic stressors. Additionally, using an unbiased cDNA expression screening and bioinformatic strategy, we identified numerous AGS transcripts and uniquely evolved AGS amino acid substitutions potentially contributing to cytoprotection. We focused on discerning the protective effect of AGS ATP5G1, a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein, given that it was one of only three genes identified in all three metabolic stress paradigms and the prominent mitochondrial resilience phenotype of AGS NPCs. We hypothesize that analogous to amino acid substitutions in several human proteins providing adaptive benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Simonson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Song et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xiang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yates and Sternberg, 2013</xref>), substitutions in AGS ATP5G1 may underlie AGS adaptive mechanisms contributing to its robust cytoprotective phenotype. Using the dCas9 ABE technology, we validated a unique AGS ATP5G1<italic><sup>L32</sup></italic> amino acid substitution in the N-terminal region of ATP5G1 that leads to improvements in mitochondrial physiologic parameters. Thus, our study used CRISPR base editing in non-model organism hibernator cells, for the first time to our knowledge, to identify a naturally occurring cytoprotective protein variant from AGS. CRISPR edited ATP5G1<sup>L32P</sup> did not fully abolish the metabolic resilience phenotype in AGS NPCs, indicating that other gene variants may also be involved. The robust ex vivo paradigm of AGS phenotypes established from our study makes it tractable to investigate additional gene and protein variants that contribute to the metabolic resilience phenotype in AGS.

We expanded this body of knowledge, by identifying altered mitochondrial dynamics and enhanced spare respiratory capacity in cells of AGS as potentially adaptive cellular mechanisms in hibernating animals. This mitochondrial phenotype is likely responsible for the broad resilience of AGS cells against a wide range of metabolic stressors.</p><p>Spare respiratory capacity, as measured by FCCP-stimulated oxygen consumption, represents a marker for cellular metabolic reserves, correlates with metabolic resilience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nicholls and Budd, 2000</xref>) and is thought to be determined by the oxidative phosphorylation machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pfleger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yadava and Nicholls, 2007</xref>). Notably, human and mouse NPCs and neural cells have been reported to have diminished spare respiratory capacity as they may respire maximally at baseline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Khacho et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lorenz et al., 2017</xref>). However, AGS demonstrate marked elevations in spare respiratory capacity compared to mouse cells, which likely explains marked AGS NPC survival even under complex I inhibition by rotenone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yadava and Nicholls, 2007</xref>). While the elevated spare respiratory capacity is likely the result of AGS adaptations in numerous metabolically active proteins, the importance of the ATP5G1 variant is highlighted by our experimental evidence demonstrating improvement in spare respiratory capacity in mouse NPCs over-expressing AGS ATP5G1 variants and decreased spare respiratory capacity in AGS NPCs with ATP5G1 L32P knock-in. A critical role for ATP5G1 in cellular energetics is also supported by recent work uncovering ATP5G1 as one of the major effectors of the transcription factor, BCL6, in regulating adipose tissue energetics as well as maintaining thermogenesis in response to hypothermia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kutyavin and Chawla, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Senagolage et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Mitochondrial fission and fusion are regulated by cellular metabolic state and a host of regulatory proteins, many of which have been implicated in cell survival response to stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Labbé et al., 2014</xref>).

The increase in fusion and improvement in cell survival in mouse NPCs over-expressing AGS ATP5G1 and loss of resilient metabolic phenotypes in AGS cells carrying ATP5G1<italic><sup>L32P</sup></italic> underscore the importance of this pathway in altering mitochondrial morphologic response to metabolic stresses and increasing the metabolic oxidative capacity of cells.</p><p>In mammals, many of the approximately 1000 nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins contain a unique mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) providing a high degree of specificity in regulating mitochondrial import and sorting. These mitochondrial targeting and processing functions are regulated by the highly conserved mitochondrial membrane translocating protein complexes (TOM and TIM) and MTS cleaving proteins, mitochondrial processing peptide (MPP) and mitochondrial intermediate peptide (MIP). Processing of ATP5G1 and its incorporation of the mature peptide into oligomeric c-rings and Complex V-Fo appear to involve cleavage by MPP and stabilization by TMEM70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kovalčíková et al., 2019</xref>). We did not find evidence that the ATP5G1 MTS sequence variations from AGS and human/mouse affected the mitochondrial localization or cleavage of the immature protein. This is likely due to evolutionarily conserved mitochondrial import sequence motifs and the putative ATP5G1 MPP/MIP cleavage site (xRx↓(F/L/I)xx(S/T/G)xxxx↓; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gakh et al., 2002</xref>). Interestingly, under native gel electrophoresis conditions in ABE KI NPC mitochondria, we observed a reduction in ATP synthase dimers relative to total ATP synthase. Additional supporting evidence is required to understand the mechanistic basis of this effect. We speculate that the AGS variant alters ATP5G1 processing which subsequently affects downstream dimerization of ATP synthases. Suprastructual alterations in ATP synthase organization are known to be critical to mitochondrial morphology and formation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nesci and Pagliarani, 2019</xref>). Though the exact nature of the relationship between ATP5G1 and the MPTP is controversial, many studies demonstrate improved bioenergetic responses and cell survival with ATP synthase dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bonora et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Daum et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">García-Aguilar and Cuezva, 2018</xref>).

The use of CRISPR gene editing technologies coupled with phenotypic analysis in AGS NPCs is a new and powerful approach to evaluate causal roles of genetic variants in conferring phenotypic traits of AGS traditionally intractable to study.

On subsequent consecutive days, cells were detached with Accutase (STEMCELL) and counted by automated cytometry (Nanoentek, Waltham, MA, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>DNA constructs and lentiviral transfection</title><p>The pHAGE-ATP5G plasmids were generated by direct PCR and PCR fusions; and the point mutation plasmids generated using Q5 site-directed mutagenesis (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA, USA). For lentiviral transfection, the plasmids with packaging plasmids were co-transfected into HEK293FT (with a ratio of 2:1.5:1.5) using Turbofect reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Lentivirus-containing medium was filtered from the post-transfection supernatant and used for transduction of HEK293T cells or mouse NPCs. All lentivirus-infected cells were cultured in the medium containing Polybrene (4 μg/ml; Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 8 hr before changing media. Forty-eight hours after transduction, the cells were selected with 10 µg/ml Blastidicin S (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Generation of CRISPR base-edited AGS cells</title><p>ATP5G1<sup>L32P</sup> NPCs were generated using the dCas9 base editor, ABEmax (gift from David Liu, Addgene #112095), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Koblan et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, a synthetic sgRNA (<named-content content-type="sequence">TCCTCTAGTCTATTCAGGAA</named-content>) was selected by manual inspection of the AGS <italic>Atp5g1</italic> sequence for a PAM (NGG) site near the desired edit on the (-) strand of the gene. AGS NPCs were nucleofected (Amaxa 4D, program DS113) in P3 solution (Lonza, Alpharetta, GA, USA) containing pCMV ABEmax (500 ng/200,000 cells). Following a 48 hr recovery period, the same cells were nucleofected with the synthetic sgRNA sequence above (100 pmol, Synthego, Menlo Park, CA, USA). Cells were expanded and then clonally plated. Clones were screened by PCR as the desired base edit also introduced a new BfaI restriction enzyme cutting site. Sanger sequencing was used to confirm the two WT and three KI clone sequences utilized. Potential off-target effects of CRISPR/Cas9 cleavage were analyzed by Sanger sequencing of the top 5 predicted off-target genomic locations [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mit.crispr.edu">https://mit.crispr.edu</ext-link>], which demonstrated a lack of indels for all clones used in subsequent analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Cell death assay</title><p>Mouse and AGS cells were plated in 24 or 96-well plates and grown to 70% confluence. Cells were exposed to metabolic stress paradigms as above, and detached and floating cells collected by centrifugation and washed with 1 ml PBS. The collected cells were resuspended with 200 μl PBS with addition of 0.2 μl Sytox blue (1 µM; Thermo Fisher Scientific) or propidium iodide (2 μg/ml) for an additional 5 min. The fluorescence intensity was measured for individual cells using automated cytometry (Nanoentek) or flow cytometry (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) within 20 min of staining, and the percentage of cell death quantified using the FlowJo software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>cDNA Library generation, screening, and identification of AGS amino acid substitutions</title><p>RNA was isolated from AGS NPC cells grown under standard conditions. A normalized cDNA library was generated by a commercial research partner (Bio S and T, Montreal, QC, Canada) from RNA extracted from AGS NPCs. Library quality and normalization is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>. For library screening, plates containing 1 × 10<sup>7</sup> mouse NPCs cells were grown in triplicate and nucleofected with 200,000 clones each. Plates were exposed to one of three metabolic stress conditions (hypoxia, hypothermia, or rotenone treatment) for 48–96 hr. Following this treatment, plasmid DNA was purified from surviving cells and PCR-amplified AGS cDNA inserts subjected to next-generation sequencing. Resulting fastq files were trimmed (Trim Galore!) and mapped to the Ictidomys Tridecemlineatus genome (SpeTri2.0) using HISAT2. Mapped reads were subjected a custom pipeline for analyzing amino acid substitutions (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/evanmlee/MaLab_spec_subs">https://github.com/evanmlee/MaLab_spec_subs</ext-link>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/MaLab_spec_subs">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/MaLab_spec_subs</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Singhal, 2020</xref>). Briefly, protein sequences of mapped genes were queried by gene symbol and downloaded from OrthoDBv10 for 10 species (13LGS, <italic>Mus musculus</italic>, <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>, <italic>Sorex araneus</italic>, <italic>Pongo abelii</italic>, <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, <italic>Equus caballus</italic>, <italic>Bos taurus</italic>, <italic>Oryctolagus cuniculus</italic>, <italic>Sus scrofa</italic>). OrthoDB data was filtered by matching records against accepted GeneCards aliases for each gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kriventseva et al., 2019</xref>). Multiple records per species were resolved using maximum percent identity against the accepted human, mouse, and 13LGS sequences, such that only one record per species was used for alignment. AGS protein sequences were downloaded from the Entrez Protein database. Multiple AGS isoforms were resolved by best identity match to the OrthoDB sequence data. The final protein sequence set was aligned with KAlign 2.04 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lassmann and Sonnhammer, 2005</xref>). From aligned sequences, GS-specific residue substitutions were defined as amino acid variants present in 13LGS and AGS sequences and present in no other included species. For each GS-specific residue, sequence weights, JSD, and average GS-versus-outgroup BLOSUM62 scores were calculated as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Capra and Singh, 2007</xref>). BLOSUM62 scores were used instead of point-accepted mutation scores in order to prioritize protein sequence changes with higher probability of potential chemical and functional difference. JSD was used to capture sequence conservation and difference from the background amino acid distribution. BLOSUM62 scores were calculated for GS residues against all other mammalian species sequences and averaged to give GS vs Outgroup BLOSUM62. For the entire screened cytoprotective protein dataset, JSD and BLOSUM62 score were plotted for individual genes of interest against the remaining dataset.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Analysis of in vitro mitochondrial respiration</title><p>Analysis of mitochondrial respiratory potential was performed using a flux analyzer (Seahorse XF<sup>e</sup>96 Extracellular Flux Analyzer; Seahorse Bioscience, North Billerica, MA, USA) with a Seahorse XF Cell Mito Stress Test Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Basal respiration and ATP production were calculated to evaluate mitochondrial respiratory function according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After the measurement, cells were harvested to count the cell number, and each plotted value was normalized relative to the number of cells used. Briefly, NPCs were seeded (25,000 cells/well) into each well of XF<sup>e</sup>96 cell culture plates and were maintained in standard culture media. After 2–3 days in culture, cells were equilibrated in unbuffered XF<sup>e</sup>assay medium (Seahorse Bioscience) supplemented with glucose (4.5 g/L), sodium pyruvate (25 mg/L) and transferred to a non-CO<sub>2</sub> incubator for 1 hr before measurement. Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was measured with sequential injections of oligomycin, FCCP, and rotenone/antimycin A.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Analysis of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex activity and mitochondrial potential</title><p>Analysis of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I, II, and IV activity was measured in mitochondrial extracts using complex enzyme activity colorimetric or absorbance-based assays (ab109721, ab10908, ab109911; Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Complex V activity was measured with Complex V Mitocheck kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and citrate synthase activity with a Citrate Synthase Enzyme Assay (Detroit R and D, Detroit, MI). Mitochondrial extracts (50 μg) were obtained as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Clayton and Shadel, 2014</xref>) and used to measure time-dependent absorbance alterations on a multi-well plate reader (SprectraMax, Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA). Mitochondrial membrane potential was evaluated by loading 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells in triplicate with the lipophilic positively charged dye tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE, 50 nM). For depolarization control wells, 1 µM FCCP was added. Excitation and emission wavelengths (530 and 580 nm, respectively) were measured on a multi-well plate reader.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Mitochondrial ATP5G1 targeting and dynamic morphology assessment</title><p>Mitochondrial localization of ATP5G1 constructs as well as morphology and fission/fusion is assessed in mouse and AGS NPCs nucleofected with mCherry or mEmerald-mito7 (Gift from Michael Davidson, Addgene #55102, 54160) as a mitochondrial marker and grown on glass coverslips in standard media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Olenych et al., 2007</xref>). Cells are allowed to recover for 48 hr and then fixed with paraformaldehyde (4%) one hour following treatment with FCCP (1 μM) or DMSO. High magnification images of cells are captured by confocal microscopy (DM6, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) and mitochondrial morphological characteristics were assessed with the Mitochondrial Network Analysis (MiNA) toolset in J-image as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Valente et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Martín-Maestro et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, the plugin converts confocal images to binary pixel features and analyzes the spatial relationship between pixels. The parameters analyzed are: (i) individual mitochondrial structures; (ii) networked mitochondrial; and (iii) the average of length of rods/branches. Twenty randomly chosen fields containing 30–50 cells were used to quantify the morphological pattern and network branch lengths of mitochondria. We classify the mitochondrial morphology as fragmented when the appearance is completely dotted with branch lengths &lt; 1.8 μm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis</title><p>For SDS-PAGE, Laemmli loading buffer (Bio-Rad Lab, Hercules, CA, USA) plus 5% β-mercaptoethanol was added to protein extracts from cell pellets reconstituted in cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) before heating at 95°C for 5 min. Around 30 μg of whole cell protein lysate samples were separated on 4–15% mini-PROTEIN GTX precast gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-rad). For native electrophoresis, 20 μg of mitochondrial protein extracts were resuspended in buffer containing 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM 6‐aminohexanoic acid, 50 mM imidazole, 1 mM EDTA (pH 7), solubilized with digitonin (2 g/g protein) for 20 min on ice, and centrifuged for 20 min at 30,000 <italic>g</italic> to remove cell debris.

interesting phenomenon that underlies intrinsic tolerance of squirrels to metabolic stressors during hibernation, such as severe hypoxia and low temperature. Through cell survival-based cDNA expression screens and comparative genomics, a variant of ATP5G1 gene, coding for the mitochondrial F-ATP synthase subunit c, is found to have a broad protective effect on the cellular level. Specifically, a single amino acid substitution in mitochondrial targeting sequence of ATP5G1, contributes to the cellular stress resilience by modulating mitochondrial metabolism.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Cytoprotection by a naturally occurring variant of ATP5G1 in Arctic ground squirrels&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Diethard Tautz as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Kelly Drew (Reviewer #1); Jean-Paul di Rago (Reviewer #2); Michela Carraro (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is 'in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>'. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>The manuscript reports on an extreme hypoxia resilience observed in the Arctic ground squirrels (AGS). These animals can tolerate hypoxic insults to survive during hibernation, and this phenomenon is maintained by the cultured cells. The work identifies variant ATP5G1 as a protein responsible for cytoprotection against hypoxia. The findings are overall very interesting and important. The work on non-model animals is a strength of this paper. At the same time, the referees realize limitations in experimental technology.</p><p>The points included in the specific comments of the reviewers should be addressed to strengthen the data in general and provide more precise explanations. The reviewers were overall not fully satisfied about the level of mechanistic understanding. Thus, the revisions should aim to provide some clarifications and/or discussions on the molecular and mechanistic basis of the ATP5G1 involvement in this resilience phenomenon.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Some weaknesses are noted.

Could the authors evoke a possible explanation for this? It would be interesting to known what is responsible for the large difference in uncoupled respiration between AGS and mouse NPCs. Is it because of differences in the levels of respiratory chain complexes? If this difference in respiratory capacity has a cytoprotective effect, how can we explain that after blocking the respiratory chain by rotenone during two days, AGS NPCs still have an enhanced rate of survival than mouse NPCs. This seems to this reviewer contradictory. This point should be clarified.</p><p>It is shown that the Pro to Leu variant in the MTS of ATP5G1 in AGS does not compromise import, accumulation and assembly of its protein product and activity of ATP synthase. Thus, this variant does apparently have no consequence on ATP synthase. It is puzzling how this variant could modulate the energy-transduction activity of mitochondria. The suggestion that the MTS with the Pro to Leu variant would remain associate after cleavage with ATP synthase, like the MTS of the Rieske protein in mammals, seems very unlikely in the light of recently published high resolution structures of ATP synthases from various origins. It would be interesting to test the cytoprotective properties of the ATP5G1's MTS, alone or fused to another protein unrelated to ATP synthase.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors state that growth rate of AGS and mouse NPCs is not changed although this aspect is not appreciable from a single immunofluorescence image (Figure 1A). The authors also state to have measured cell death upon FCCP stimulation, even though data are not reported (Figure 1B). The Seahorse experiment in Figure 1C poses a serious concern. In general, I think it is hard to make comparisons among cell cultures deriving from different species (here AGS versus murine NPCs) and this would require a number of control experiments that have not been provided in this study. To my knowledge, the fact that mouse NPCs display no respiratory spare capacity is unusual. FCCP is used to push the respiratory chain to its maximal activity, however the amount of this compound should be carefully titrated in order to avoid secondary toxic effects that compromise mitochondrial function. The increased spare capacity visible in AGS NPCs is obtained with 2 μM FCCP, which appears to be ineffective and even detrimental for mouse NPCs. Did the authors test different concentrations of FCCP? Another concern regards the amount of mitochondria that could differ among species. From confocal analysis it emerges indeed that AGS NPCs contain probably fewer mitochondria than their murine counterparts. Another lacking information is the evaluation of the OXPHOS protein level which would help the interpretation of data. Then, the authors evaluated changes in mitochondrial morphology by using FCCP, although they never tested the mitochondrial depolarization upon FCCP stimulation and this is a crucial piece of information that should have been assessed. Anyway, in general I believe that the electron microscopy is a more reliable technique to evaluate mitochondrial morphology in the various species and conditions.</p><p>In Figure 2—figure supplement 1E, the authors show the level of ATP5G protein without reporting any other subunits of the F-ATP synthase. Since the generation of a single F-ATP synthase monomer is a multiple-step process which requires a fine-tuned incorporation of different subcomplexes, the alteration (over-expression or down-regulation) of any F-ATP synthase subunit could deeply alter the whole assembly. I believe that this aspect should have been carefully evaluated in the presented models. Moreover, for an accurate measurement of the mitochondrial ATPase hydrolytic activity, the addition of its selective inhibitor oligomycin is mandatory, and its effect should have been used as internal control. The overexpression of AGS and human variants and their mitochondrial localization should have been checked, since alterations in the mitochondrial targeting sequence might affect a correct targeting to the organelle. Figure 2—figure supplement 1F is not cited.</p><p>Figure 3—figure supplement 1(panels E and F are not present but are cited in the text) does not correspond to what the authors state (subsection “A cDNA library expression screen identifies AGS ATP5G1 as a cytoprotective factor”). The authors mention that AGS ATP5G1 substitution did not alter mitochondrial localization although this has never been tested. There is instead a single image showing the signal of wild-type ATP5G1 and Cox8 without calculating any colocalization index. The Seahorse experiment in Figure 3A is also puzzling. From the traces, it appears that the overexpression of human ATP5G1 can improve the spare capacity of murine NPCs per se and that the substitution of human ATP5G1 L32P did not further increase the FCCP-stimulated respiration but rather caused a slight decrease. This effect on mitochondrial respiration does not correlate with the resistance observed against cell death shown in Figure 2E-G. This means that the cytoprotection does not rely on improvement of mitochondrial function, thus the molecular explanation remains to be addressed. It is also not clear whether the decreased FCCP-stimulated respiration in AGS ATP5G1 L32P is statistically significant, since no details of number of experiments and statistics have been provided. The confocal experiments then lack the control images of untreated cells to appreciate changes upon FCCP stimulation (and again the mitochondrial membrane depolarization should have been checked).</p><p>Concerning the last part on ABE KI cells, I found differences of mean branch length marginal and of a questionable biological meaning. Again, electron microscopy images of mitochondrial morphology would have improved the analysis and the comparison between the two genotypes. Moreover, the correct targeting of the variant ATP5G1 needed to be addressed, since the only western blot showing ATP5G level has been carried out with cell lysates and appears over saturated.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for re-submitting your article &quot;Cytoprotection by a naturally occurring variant of ATP5G1 in Arctic ground squirrel neural progenitor cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The assembly of the F-ATP synthase has been evaluated by a clear-native PAGE and the quantification analysis shows that the D/M ratio is decreased in the ABE KI. The authors state that this is due to a decreased content of monomers, although this is not at all clear in Figure 4J (I found instead a higher level of monomers in ABE KI by looking at ATP5A signal) and it is anyway pretty in contradiction with a decreased D/M ratio. The difference among the two genotypes, which show a comparable amount of monomers, might be instead in the fraction of dimers which appears slightly decreased in the ABE KI (looking at ATP5G1 signal). I believe that a more informative analysis could be perhaps normalizing the fraction of monomers and dimers to the total amount of the F-ATP synthase, e.g. D/(M+D). The authors should revise Results section and Discussion section of this part.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55578.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Some weaknesses are noted.

Is it because of differences in the levels of respiratory chain complexes?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important question in the field as the specific OXPHOS proteins and associated factors contributing to cellular reserve respiratory capacity are not completely unknown. The specific mechanism for AGS cells will require additional research, but we have added data that begins to address this and is also related to reviewer #3 concerns (Figure 1—figure supplement 1H). The literature has suggested that complex II OXPHOS proteins are crucial to this response (Pfleger et al., 2015), however, as shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1H, there is no appreciable difference in complex II activity between AGS/mouse NPCs. Citrate synthase (a marker of mitochondrial content) or complex I activity are also similar between AGS and mouse NPC mitochondria. We did find a decrease in the activity of Complex IV. The contributions of CIV and its supramolecular organization as a mediator of differences between species warrants follow-up and is part of another collaborative manuscript currently in revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If this difference in respiratory capacity has a cytoprotective effect, how can we explain that after blocking the respiratory chain by rotenone during two days, AGS NPCs still have an enhanced rate of survival than mouse NPCs. This seems to this reviewer contradictory. This point should be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>This is also an important point. Rotenone results in cell death via oxidative stress and ATP deficiency (Yadava and Nicholls, 2007). AGS likely possess numerous adaptations in these pathways conferring a survival advantage. Our over-expression screen and follow-up ATP5G1 studies suggest that ATP5G1 is one component contributing to this metabolic resilience, but it is likely only one adaptation among many. Other AGS OXPHOS adaptations may also confer survival advantages which help cells effectively bypass complex I and cope with rotenone-induced energy failure. Previous work on hibernating species has also implicated robust anti-oxidant adaptations (Bhowmick and Drew, 2017) in conferring cytoprotection, which is likely also contributing to the AGS phenotype. We have elaborated these points (Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is shown that the Pro to Leu variant in the MTS of ATP5G1 in AGS does not compromise import, accumulation and assembly of its protein product and activity of ATP synthase.

We further probed the activity of ATP synthase and along with suggestions from reviewer 3 have added new data demonstrating that ABE KI NPCs have reduced abundance of the monomeric form of ATP synthase under native gel conditions (Figure 4J-K). This indicates that the P32L variant in the MTS actually does compromise the normal assembly of ATP synthase complex. As noted by Vives-Bauza et al., 20170 the ATP5G1 MTS is protective independently of fusion to the mature ATP5G1 peptide, and the possibility that this contributes to the observed phenotypes remains (elaborated on in the Discussion section). Finally, we have preliminarily found binding partners of the N-terminal sequence using mass spectrometry and co-immunoprecipitation. These direct protein interactions likely regulate ATP5G1 stability and processing, but will require further functional validation that we plan to include in follow-up work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The authors state that growth rate of AGS and mouse NPCs is not changed although this aspect is not appreciable from a single immunofluorescence image (Figure 1A).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for suggesting this.

In general, I think it is hard to make comparisons among cell cultures deriving from different species (here AGS versus murine NPCs) and this would require a number of control experiments that have not been provided in this study. To my knowledge, the fact that mouse NPCs display no respiratory spare capacity is unusual. FCCP is used to push the respiratory chain to its maximal activity, however the amount of this compound should be carefully titrated in order to avoid secondary toxic effects that compromise mitochondrial function. The increased spare capacity visible in AGS NPCs is obtained with 2 μM FCCP, which appears to be ineffective and even detrimental for mouse NPCs. Did the authors test different concentrations of FCCP?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that comparisons between cell type and species types require careful control and interpretation. We previously performed a FCCP dose titration which is now included in Figure 1—figure supplement 1F-G. Also note, we have added the following sentence and references to the Discussion section to further clarify the limited mouse NPC spare respiratory capacity, “…human and mouse NPCs and neural cells have diminished spare respiratory capacity as they may respire maximally at baseline.” We refer to prior reports corroborating this in human and mouse cells: Lorenz et al., 2017, Figure 2C, E; Khacho et al., 2016, Figure 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another concern regards the amount of mitochondria that could differ among species. From confocal analysis it emerges indeed that AGS NPCs contain probably fewer mitochondria than their murine counterparts. Another lacking information is the evaluation of the OXPHOS protein level which would help the interpretation of data.</p></disp-quote><p>We also agree that interspecies comparisons are difficult to standardize. The amount of mitochondria and specific make-up of subunits are important to OXPHOS enzymatic activities, and as such we provide additional information regarding mitochondrial and OXPHOS enzymatic function with citrate synthase and individual OXPHOS complex enzymatic activity (Figure 1—figure supplement 1H).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Then, the authors evaluated changes in mitochondrial morphology by using FCCP, although they never tested the mitochondrial depolarization upon FCCP stimulation and this is a crucial piece of information that should have been assessed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for suggesting including this important control. We now show previously obtained control data on the effect of FCCP on mitochondrial potential as measured by TMRE (Figure 1E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Anyway, in general I believe that the electron microscopy is a more reliable technique to evaluate mitochondrial morphology in the various species and conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>This will indeed be an extremely valuable contribution. We have embarked on a collaboration to obtain EM data, however, we hope this will be part of a follow-up manuscript related to additional mechanistic details of ATP5G1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 2—figure supplement 1E, the authors show the level of ATP5G protein without reporting any other subunits of the F-ATP synthase. Since the generation of a single F-ATP synthase monomer is a multiple-step process which requires a fine-tuned incorporation of different subcomplexes, the alteration (over-expression or down-regulation) of any F-ATP synthase subunit could deeply alter the whole assembly. I believe that this aspect should have been carefully evaluated in the presented models. Moreover, for an accurate measurement of the mitochondrial ATPase hydrolytic activity, the addition of its selective inhibitor oligomycin is mandatory, and its effect should have been used as internal control. The overexpression of AGS and human variants and their mitochondrial localization should have been checked, since alterations in the mitochondrial targeting sequence might affect a correct targeting to the organelle. Figure 2—figure supplement 1F is not cited.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this very helpful suggestion. Interestingly, although we found AGS ATP synthase activity to have a similar degree of sensitivity to oligomycin compared to mouse and ABE KI cells, we followed up this finding with clear native electrophoresis and immunoblots demonstrating that ABE WT have decreased abundance of ATP Synthase monomers (Figure 4J-K). Given the extreme complexity of ATP synthase biogenesis and assembly, additional work in the future is still needed to understand how the AGS amino acid substitution alters ATP synthase assembly. Recent work by others and our own preliminary data, which needs further validation, suggest that the N-terminal may be regulated by ubiquitination and also bind to the membrane assembly factor, TMEM70.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3—figure supplement 1(panels E and F are not even present but are cited in the text) does not correspond to what the authors state (subsection “A cDNA library expression screen identifies AGS ATP5G1 as a cytoprotective factor”). The authors mention that AGS ATP5G1 substitution did not alter mitochondrial localization although this has never been tested. There is instead a single image showing the signal of wild-type ATP5G1 and Cox8 without calculating any colocalization index.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 3—figure supplement 1, we now provide confocal images of mouse and AGS NPCs expressing all versions of ATP5G constructs. The images demonstrate proper targeting of the AGS and human ATP5G1 constructs to the mouse and AGS NPC mitochondria.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Seahorse experiment in Figure 3A is also puzzling. From the traces, it appears that the overexpression of human ATP5G1 can improve the spare capacity of murine NPCs per se and that the substitution of human ATP5G1 L32P did not further increase the FCCP-stimulated respiration but rather caused a slight decrease. This effect on mitochondrial respiration does not correlate with the resistance observed against cell death shown in Figure 2E-G. This means that the cytoprotection does not rely on improvement of mitochondrial function, thus the molecular explanation remains to be addressed. It is also not clear whether the decreased FCCP-stimulated respiration in AGS ATP5G1 L32P is statistically significant, since no details of number of experiments and statistics have been provided. The confocal experiments then lack the control images of untreated cells to appreciate changes upon FCCP stimulation (and again the mitochondrial membrane depolarization should have been checked).</p></disp-quote><p>We clarified the statistical details in the text and figure caption. Statistically there was no difference between the spare respiratory capacity in mouse NPCs expressing human ATP5G1, agsATP5G1-L32P or the human ATP5G1-P32L. Thus, it does appear that the survival to metabolic stressors does not correlate perfectly with the spare respiratory capacity. Cell survival from metabolic stresses likely engages additional cellular mechanisms as it is different from the acute changes measured in the Seahorse assay. We now discuss that additional mechanisms beyond spare respiratory capacity could be involved on subsection “A cDNA library expression screen identifies AGS ATP5G1 as a cytoprotective factor”. In addition, with the added experiments in response to reviewer 2 comments, we provide a discussion of additional mechanisms contributing to the survival phenotype in the Discussion section. We have added representative control confocal images to the top panels of Figure 3D-G and left panels of Figure 4E,F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Concerning the last part on ABE KI cells, I found differences of mean branch length marginal and of a questionable biological meaning. Again, electron microscopy images of mitochondrial morphology would have improved the analysis and the comparison between the two genotypes.</p></disp-quote><p>The mean mitochondrial network branch length calculated using automated software from confocal images has been used to assess mitochondrial dynamics on populations of cells in response to treatments and helps corroborate other aspects of mitochondrial morphology (fragmented vs elongated mitochondria). Mutations in master regulators of fission and fusion cause larger changes in mitochondrial length in cells at baseline (up to 0.5-1 mm in some reports), however, we feel that the population-based morphological changes in response to FCCP as well as the mean branch length changes present in our experiments (&lt;0.5 mm) are still an important reflection of the mitochondrial phenotype as related to cell genotype and treatment. Nonetheless, we have moved some of the mean branch length data to the supplemental figures in favor or new figures above. As above we whole-heartedly agree with the utility of EM data and plan to obtain this for follow-up reports.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, the correct targeting of the variant ATP5G1 needed to be addressed, since the only western blot showing ATP5G level has been carried out with cell lysates and appears over saturated.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide additional mitochondrial localization data in Figure 3—figure supplement 1 showing correct targeting of various ATP5G1 constructs to the mouse NPC mitochondria in AGS NPCs expressing co-localized ATP5G1 variants and the Cox8 mitochondrial marker.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer comments</p><p>Among the newly provided data, there is one aspect that should be carefully revised. The assembly of the F-ATP synthase has been evaluated by a clear native PAGE and the quantification analysis shows that the D/M ratio is decreased in the ABE KI. The authors state that this is due to a decreased content of monomers, although this is not at all clear in Figure 4J (I found instead a higher level of monomers in ABE KI by looking at ATP5A signal) and it is anyway pretty in contradiction with a decreased D/M ratio. The difference among the two genotypes, which show a comparable amount of monomers, might be instead in the fraction of dimers which appears slightly decreased in the ABE KI (looking at ATP5G1 signal). I believe that a more informative analysis could be perhaps normalizing the fraction of monomers and dimers to the total amount of the F-ATP synthase, e.g. D/(M+D). The authors should revise Results section and Discussion section of this part.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for drawing our attention to this important oversight. We also agree that our text was incongruent with the data presented and have modified both as suggested. The clear native PAGE data demonstrates a reduction in the dimerization in the ABE KI cell line which we clarify in subsection “Knock-in of AGS ATP5G1L32P alters the resilient phenotype of AGS cells” and the Discussion section. We have also altered the quantification chart (Figure 4K) to reflect Dimer/Total ATP Synthase (Monomer + Dimer), which also supports the conclusion that dimerization is reduced in the ABE KI cell line.</p><p>We have also explicitly stated that conclusions relevant to the mechanistic details of AGS ATP5G1 cytoprotection require additional supporting data (subsection “Knock-in of AGS ATP5G1L32P alters the resilient phenotype of AGS cells”; Discussion section).</p></body></sub-article></article>
