cell wall of pathogenic mycobacteria. Phthiocerol dimycocerosate (PDIM), one of the most abundant outer membrane lipids, plays important roles in both defending against host antimicrobial programs and in evading these programs altogether. Immediately following infection, mycobacteria rely on PDIM to evade Myd88-dependent recruitment of microbicidal monocytes which can clear infection. To circumvent the limitations in using genetics to understand virulence lipids, we developed a chemical approach to track PDIM during <italic>Mycobacterium marinum</italic> infection of zebrafish. We found that PDIM's methyl-branched lipid tails enabled it to spread into host epithelial membranes to prevent immune activation. Additionally, PDIM’s affinity for cholesterol promoted this phenotype; treatment of zebrafish with statins, cholesterol synthesis inhibitors, decreased spreading and provided protection from infection. This work establishes that interactions between host and pathogen lipids influence mycobacterial infectivity and suggests the use of statins as tuberculosis preventive therapy by inhibiting PDIM spread.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Mycobacteria</kwd><kwd>bioorthogonal chemistry</kwd><kwd>PDIM</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI51622</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bertozzi</surname><given-names>Carolyn R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cambier</surname><given-names>CJ</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Banik</surname><given-names>Steven M</given-names></name><name><surname>Buonomo</surname><given-names>Joseph A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Applying bioorthogonal chemistry to the zebrafish/<italic>Mycobacterium marinum</italic> model of tuberculosis reveals that the virulence lipid PDIM must spread into epithelial cells in order for mycobacteria to establish infection.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, the causative pathogen of the pulmonary disease tuberculosis (TB), is estimated to have evolved within the confines of the human lung for millennia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Comas et al., 2013</xref>). A result of this co-evolution is a choreographed response of innate and adaptive immune cells culminating in the formation of granulomas, specialized structures that permit bacterial replication and ultimately promote transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ramakrishnan, 2012</xref>). A key strategy used by mycobacteria throughout infection is to avoid and manipulate host immune pathways so as to afford the pathogen safe harbor in otherwise bactericidal myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cambier et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Urdahl, 2014</xref>).</p><p>To better understand these host–pathogen interactions, we have taken advantage of the optically transparent zebrafish larva, a natural host of the pathogen <italic>M. marinum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ramakrishnan, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Takaki et al., 2013</xref>). Infection of the hindbrain ventricle (HBV), an epithelium-lined cavity, allows for the visualization and characterization of the cellular immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davis and Ramakrishnan, 2009</xref>), a response that is comparable to that seen in the mouse lung following infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Srivastava et al., 2014</xref>). In both models, mycobacteria are initially phagocytosed by tissue-resident macrophages and are eventually transferred to monocytes which go on to form granulomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cambier et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cohen et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In order to reach growth-permissive cells, mycobacteria must first evade prototypical anti-bacterial monocytes. In response to mucosal commensal pathogens, bactericidal monocytes are recruited downstream of toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Medzhitov, 2007</xref>). Screening of <italic>M. marinum</italic> genetic mutants found that the cell-surface lipid phthiocerol dimycocerosate (PDIM) is required to evade this antibacterial response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cambier et al., 2014b</xref>). PDIM also promotes pathogenesis in other ways, such as being required for the relative impermeability of the mycobacterial cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Camacho et al., 2001</xref>) and in promoting escape from phagolysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Augenstreich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barczak et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lerner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Quigley et al., 2017</xref>). However, the molecular details underlying PDIM’s myriad pathogenic functions remain unknown.</p><p>To accomplish mechanistic studies of virulence lipids, we and others developed metabolic labeling strategies where unnatural metabolic precursors are fed to growing bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Siegrist et al., 2015</xref>). The unnatural metabolite contains a bioorthogonal functional group that facilitates visualization of macromolecules in living bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sletten and Bertozzi, 2009</xref>). An example is the labeling of trehalose containing lipids with azide-functionalized trehalose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Swarts et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Here, we have developed comparable chemical tools to monitor PDIM’s distribution during infection. We found that the first step in PDIM-mediated pathogenesis is to spread into epithelial cells in order to prevent the recruitment of microbicidal monocytes. Structure function analysis revealed that PDIM’s methyl-branched fatty acids increased lipid mobility and promoted spread. Spreading was also dependent on the lipid content of host membranes. Administration of the cholesterol lowering drug, atorvastatin (Lipitor), led to a decrease in PDIM spreading, and subsequent resistance to mycobacterial infection. Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the association of statin use with a decrease in TB incidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lai et al., 2016</xref>) and support their use as a TB preventative therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Lipid removal and recoating of <italic>M. marinum</italic></title><p>PDIM lacks unique biosynthetic precursors to facilitate metabolic labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Onwueme et al., 2005</xref>). However, PDIM is removed following petroleum ether extraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moliva et al., 2019</xref>), a technique used to remove and add back mycomembrane lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Silva et al., 1985</xref>). Using this approach, we hypothesized that we could chemically install a biorthogonal handle onto extracted PDIM and use this modified lipid to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms underlying PDIM’s contribution to virulence. Similar to reports on <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>M. bovis,</italic> we validated that petroleum ether extraction did not affect the growth of <italic>M. marinum</italic> in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and extracted lipids did not repopulate the mycomembrane following the first few days in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Indrigo et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, this approach is well suited for loss of function studies of outer mycomembrane lipids in zebrafish.

Myd88 signaling leads to the recruitment of activated monocytes that can clear bacteria in an inducible nitric oxide synthase-dependent fashion. PDIM-sufficient wildtype bacteria do not elicit this response and instead recruit a comparable number of permissive monocytes downstream of the chemokine CCL2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cambier et al., 2014b</xref>). However, since ∆<italic>mas</italic> and ∆<italic>mmpL7 M. marinum</italic> lack proteins required for PDIM’s synthesis or export, the associated phenotypes could be attributed to the missing proteins rather than to a lack of PDIM. While both of these mutants also lack the closely related phenolic glycolipid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Onwueme et al., 2005</xref>), results evaluating strains lacking only phenolic glycolipid ruled out this lipids role in mediating evasion of TLRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cambier et al., 2014b</xref>).</p><p>To test if the lipid content on the bacterial surface is responsible for these phenotypes, we performed a lipid-swap experiment. Wildtype and ∆<italic>mmpL7 M. marinum</italic> were either untreated (control) or extracted and recoated with their native lipids or the lipids from the other strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Petroleum ether extraction of wildtype bacteria removed both dimycocerosic acid (DIM) containing lipids, PDIM, and its metabolic precursor phthiodiolone dimycocerosate (PNDIM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>) both of which were absent in ∆<italic>mmpL7</italic> extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Following infection, wildtype control and wildtype bacteria recoated with wildtype lipids grew normally whereas wildtype bacteria recoated with ∆<italic>mmpL7</italic> lipids were attenuated for growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Conversely, ∆<italic>mmpL7</italic> bacteria were attenuated for growth, as expected, unless they were recoated with wildtype lipids, in which case they grew at wildtype bacterial rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Using an antisense morpholino to knockdown Myd88 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bates et al., 2007</xref>), we also found that the dependence on Myd88 to recruit monocytes to ∆<italic>mmpL7</italic> bacteria was abolished with wildtype lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Taken together these experiments highlight the strengths of this chemical approach. Not only does it recapitulate known phenotypes of PDIM genetic mutants, but it directly links the mutant phenotypes to the mycomembrane composition. Furthermore, our data suggest that the PDIM present on the surface of the bacterium from the onset of infection is required and sufficient to promote virulence, as mutants unable to replenish PDIM on their surfaces become infectious when they are recoated with wildtype lipids.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Synthesis of a clickable, biologically active PDIM</title><p>Given the pathogenic importance of the pre-infection mycomembrane lipid content, we hypothesized that labeling this pool of PDIM would shed light on its virulence mechanisms. Both PDIM and its biosynthetic precursor PNDIM are present in the mycomembrane. The only difference between these lipids is their diol backbones; PDIM has a methyl ether, while PNDIM has a ketone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Siméone et al., 2007</xref>). Either lipid can promote infection in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Siméone et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting chemical flexibility at this site with regards to virulence. Therefore, we converted the methyl ether of PDIM to an alkyl halide with trimethylsilyl iodide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jung and Lyster, 1977</xref>). Subsequent addition of sodium azide provided azido-DIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Recoating of delipidated bacteria with lipids containing azido-DIM, followed by a copper-free click reaction with the cyclooctyne fluorophore DIBO-488 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) resulted in a ~100-fold increase in fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Confocal microscopy revealed the fluorescence to be membrane-associated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>), suggesting incorporation into the mycomembrane. Importantly, we found that adding back native DIMs or azido-DIM to DIM-depleted lipids prior to recoating and labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) rescued DIM-depleted bacteria’s growth attenuation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

DIM-488 spread away from bacteria into infected macrophage membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Real-time imaging revealed that the spreading was dynamic in nature, with DIM-488 moving relative to host cells (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).

As early as 3 hr post-infection (hpi), DIM-488 had spread into infected macrophage membranes, directly adjacent to infecting bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, arrows) and at more distal membrane sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, arrow heads). These data suggest that lateral diffusion as well as propagation into discrete membrane compartments by PDIM is taking place. Spreading increased across macrophage membranes by 3 days post-infection (dpi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Similar spreading was seen when azido-DIM was conjugated to DIBO-647 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>), suggesting that the lipid, not the fluorescent probe, was responsible for this phenotype. To quantify the extent of PDIM spreading, we imaged the entire HBV infection site and calculated the proportion of fluorophore labeled azido-DIM that no longer localized with bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Using this number as a proxy for lipid spread, we saw an increase in spreading as infection progressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Spreading also occurred following infection of THP-1 macrophages in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Finally, PDIM spreading was not a result of homeostatic lipid turnover. DIM-488 labeled bacteria were fluorescent following 3 days in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), and signal remained localized to the cell wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

Nevertheless, we wanted to rule out spreading as an artifact of our recoating method.

Thus, recoating does not appreciably influence the spreading dynamics of mycomembrane lipids. These data demonstrate that the introduction of a chemically functionalized PDIM into the mycomembrane provides relevant information regarding PDIM’s host distribution during infection.</p><p>We next wanted to understand how PDIM spreading might be promoting virulence. PDIM has been suggested to interact with the protein substrates of the type VII secretion system ESX-1, including EsxA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barczak et al., 2017</xref>). PDIM and EsxA are both required for cytosolic escape from phagolysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Osman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Quigley et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">van der Wel et al., 2007</xref>), where PDIM is suggested to enhance the pore-forming activity of EsxA through its ability to infiltrate macrophage membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Augenstreich et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that PDIM’s localization may be dependent on EsxA’s pore forming ability. Region of difference-1 <italic>M. marinum</italic> mutants (∆RD1) which lack EsxA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Volkman et al., 2010</xref>), were recoated with DIM-488 prior to zebrafish infection. There was no difference in DIM-488 spreading kinetics between wildtype and ∆RD1 <italic>M. marinum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), suggesting that EsxA does not influence PDIM spreading. Besides playing a role in cytosolic escape, PDIM has also been shown to promote phagocytosis of extracellular bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Astarie-Dequeker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Augenstreich et al., 2019</xref>). To determine the phagocytosis rate of wildtype or ∆<italic>mmpL7 M. marinum</italic> in vivo, we measured the number of discrete bacterial objects over time.

One clue to the timing of PDIM’s role in virulence was the kinetics of the myeloid response. Wildtype bacteria needed to reside within resident macrophages in order to recruit permissive monocytes. In contrast, PDIM-deficient bacteria recruited microbicidal monocytes independent of and concurrent to resident macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cambier et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, we wondered if PDIM plays a critical role in evading immune detection prior to any of its documented roles in modulating macrophages. Upon closer examination, we observed DIM-488 deposits on zebrafish epithelium at 24 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Imaging at 3 hpi we captured extracellular bacteria having spread DIM-488 in the vicinity of an infected macrophage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Lipid structure is known to modulate lipid mobility and membrane fluidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Los and Murata, 2004</xref>). Saturated lipids form closely packed assemblies giving rise to more rigid bilayers, while unsaturated lipids do not pack as tightly and produce more fluid bilayers.

We then esterified phthiocerol with the saturated fatty acid lignoceric acid that resulted in straight chain lipids of comparable length to mycocerosic acid.

Cholesterol has been reported to modulate macrophage interactions with mycobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gatfield and Pieters, 2000</xref>). However, three lines of evidence suggest a macrophage-independent relationship between mycobacteria and cholesterol: (1) 36% of the lipid extracted from <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> harvested from necrotic mouse lung (where macrophages are sparse) was found to be host cholesterol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kondo and Kanai, 1976</xref>; (2) mycobacterial-associated cholesterol was isolated as a mixture with PDIM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kondo and Kanai, 1976</xref>; (3) <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> grown in culture can sequester cholesterol to its outer mycomembrane, a process dependent on mycomembrane lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brzostek et al., 2009</xref>).

We depleted cholesterol from A549 epithelial cells with methyl β−cyclodextrin (MßCD) which resulted in an eight-fold decrease in cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1E</xref>). This was associated with decreased DIM-488 spreading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Importantly, in MßCD treated cells we could restore cholesterol to untreated levels with water-soluble cholesterol, and this restored DIM-488 spreading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>). To test if host cholesterol facilitates PDIM spreading in vivo, we treated zebrafish with statins, drugs that inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting step of cholesterol biosynthesis. Specifically, we used atorvastatin which was shown to lower cholesterol in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maerz et al., 2019</xref>). Following 24 hr of treatment, atorvastatin decreased cholesterol levels in the larvae by 25%, and co-treatment with water-soluble cholesterol restored cholesterol levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Atorvastatin treatment also decreased DIM-488 spreading onto epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E and F</xref>), suggesting that PDIM’s interaction with cholesterol promotes spreading into epithelial membranes in vivo.</p><p>Hypercholesteremia has been shown to exacerbate mycobacterial infection in mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Martens et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Soh et al., 2016</xref>), and studies suggest the utility of statins both in TB treatment and prevention. When used in mice, statins decreased the duration of TB therapy by one month (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dutta et al., 2016</xref>), and studies of health care databases found that statin use is associated with decreased incidence of TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lai et al., 2016</xref>). Accordingly, we sought to evaluate the role of statins in the reduction of bacterial burdens and in preventing infection. First, we showed that statin treatment reduced bacterial burdens in the zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>). Next, to evaluate if statins prevented infection, we infected zebrafish with 1–3 bacteria, similar to the infectious dose in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bates et al., 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wells et al., 1948</xref>), and evaluated their ability to establish infection. This infectivity assay previously found that PDIM-deficient <italic>M. marinum</italic> established infection at a reduced frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cambier et al., 2017</xref>). We treated zebrafish with atorvastatin for 24 hr prior to infection with 1–3 bacteria and continued daily atorvastatin treatment for the 3 day assay period. At 3 dpi, atorvastatin treatment decreased <italic>M. marinum</italic>’s infectivity by 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>). Moreover, restoring cholesterol levels by co-treating with water-soluble cholesterol restored <italic>M. marinum</italic>’s infectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>). This result confirmed atorvastatin reduces infectivity by lowering cholesterol rather than to off target effects. However, this protective low-cholesterol state could be due to antimicrobial effects independent of PDIM spread. Altered cholesterol flux can have pleiotropic effects on immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tall and Yvan-Charvet, 2015</xref>), and mycobacteria have been shown to use cholesterol as a carbon source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pandey and Sassetti, 2008</xref>).</p><p>To test the alternative hypothesis that atorvastatin’s protection is not through disrupting PDIM spread, we evaluated the infectivity of PDIM-deficient ∆<italic>mmpL7 M. marinum</italic>. Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cambier et al., 2017</xref>), ∆<italic>mmpL7 M. marinum</italic> exhibited decreased infectivity compared to wildtype bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>). In agreement with our model that atorvastatin acts through modulating PDIM spread, we found that atorvastatin treatment did not further decrease ∆<italic>mmpL7</italic>’s infectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>). However, PDIM-deficient bacteria exhibit such a severe virulence defect, any further attenuation due to other low-cholesterol-dependent antimicrobial mechanisms may not be possible. To address this concern, we took advantage of the fact that ∆<italic>mmpL7</italic>’s virulence defect is reversed in the absence of host Myd88 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cambier et al., 2014b</xref>). In this condition where PDIM-deficient bacteria are fully virulent, they should become attenuated by any non-PDIM-associated antimicrobial mechanisms caused by atorvastatin. However, atorvastatin still did not decrease ∆<italic>mmpL7</italic>’s infectivity in Myd88-depleted hosts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>). Finally, we showed that atorvastatin decreased the infectivity of wildtype <italic>M. marinum</italic> in a Myd88-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>). These data strongly support the idea that atorvastatin acts to disrupt the PDIM-Myd88 axis. Only in conditions where PDIM is present on bacterial surfaces and when host Myd88 signaling is intact will lowering cholesterol provide a protective effect. Collectively, these data demonstrate that statins reduce mycobacterial infectivity by reducing host cholesterol, and thereby PDIM’s infiltration of epithelial membranes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Molecular Koch’s postulates are a guiding set of principles used to characterize bacterial virulence factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Falkow, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Falkow, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ramakrishnan, 2020</xref>). Genetic analyses are the mainstay of assigning pathogenic functions to specific virulence factors, including those not directly encoded by the genome. Virulence lipids are often assigned their pathogenic roles from studies of bacterial mutants lacking proteins involved in the lipid’s biosynthesis or transport. Thus, these functions can be directly attributed only to the biosynthetic protein, and not the lipid per se. Here, by combining bioorthogonal chemistry with the zebrafish model of TB, we more rigorously satisfy molecular Koch’s postulates to describe PDIM’s role in virulence. PDIM’s mobility and the abundance of cholesterol in epithelial membranes influenced PDIM’s ability to infiltrate the host lipid environment. This occupation of epithelial membranes by PDIM mediated subversion of TLR/Myd88 signaling at the site of infection, thus enabling mycobacteria to gain access to non-activated immune cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model of PDIM spreading to promote virulence in the zebrafish hindbrain ventricle.</title><p>Cholesterol-dependent PDIM spread into epithelial membranes prevents TLR/Myd88 detection at the site of infection. Bacteria then drive resident macrophages to produce CCL2 to recruit CCR2-positive permissive monocytes which go on to form early granulomas. PDIM continues to spread into host membranes throughout this process. In low cholesterol settings (statin treatment) PDIM does not spread as readily into epithelial membranes. TLR/Myd88-dependent recruitment of microbicidal monocytes occurs, which can then clear infecting mycobacteria.

While we do not know if the mycomembrane organization of the recoated bacteria mimics that of untouched bacteria, our data do demonstrate that these bacteria are indistinguishable with regards to their virulence. Additionally, our work is in agreement with results evaluating native PDIM from <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, where PDIM was found to occupy macrophage membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Augenstreich et al., 2019</xref>) and disrupt membrane protein signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Augenstreich et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, we believe the data generated by our approach represents native PDIM biology. In addition to being able to monitor PDIM’s distribution during in vivo infection, our approach allowed us to observe and correlate lipid mobility and membrane fluidity on the bacterial surface to the ability of lipids to spread into host membranes. While both TMM and PDIM spread into macrophage membranes, only PDIM was able to occupy epithelial membranes following infection. PDIM’s increased mobility in comparison to TMM could be promoting an active spread through host membranes or, alternatively, could be promoting membrane mixing between bacteria and host.</p><p>Previous models suggest PDIM facilitates a passive evasion of TLRs by masking underlying TLR ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cambier et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cambier et al., 2017</xref>). This model was based on findings that PDIM-expressing mycobacteria were rendered growth-attenuated if co-infected with TLR-stimulating bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cambier et al., 2014b</xref>). While our current model suggests a more active role for PDIM, we still find that TLR-stimulating bacteria cause attenuation of wildtype bacteria. Specifically, bacteria unable to spread PDIM caused attenuation of bacteria that can spread PDIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>). These findings argue that PDIM’s influence over innate immune signaling is spatially restricted. PDIM appears to only inhibit TLR/Myd88 signaling at membrane sites where it has spread, emphasizing the need for PDIM localization on the bacterial surface prior to spreading into epithelial membranes.</p><p>Cholesterol plays a multifaceted role in mycobacterial pathogenesis. Here we describe its role in promoting mycobacterial infectivity through promoting PDIM spread into epithelial membranes. This mechanism of pathogenesis is particularly interesting as mycobacteria can utilize cholesterol as a carbon source to bolster PDIM production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wilburn et al., 2018</xref>). Systemic cholesterol metabolism in humans influences the abundance of cholesterol in lung epithelial membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fessler, 2017</xref>). Therefore, cholesterol-promoted PDIM spreading may also influence <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> transmission. While a clinical trial is currently underway evaluating the use of statins alongside standard TB therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Karakousis et al., 2019</xref>), our data instead argue for the use of statins as a TB preventative therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Resources table</title><table-wrap

Once homogenized, the lysate was clarified by centrifugation pelleting for 20 min at 21,000 x g at 4°C and filtering through a 0.45 µm Teflon syringe filter. To the clarified lysate (generally about 50 mg/ml protein content as measured with absorbance at 280 nm) was then added 5 ml of pre-washed (lysis buffer) Ni-NTA resin slurry (Qiagen). The suspension was mixed on an orbital shaker for 60–90 min at 4°C and then transferred to a glass column (BIO-RAD EconoColumn). Non-His-Tagged proteins were eluted with lysis buffer until the absorbance at 280 nm matched background levels utilizing 50–100 ml of lysis buffer. His-tagged TreT was eluted with elution buffer (50 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 500 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole, pH 7.4) in multiple 2.5 ml increments, until protein elution was determined complete by absorbance at 280 nm. Buffer exchange to a storage/reaction buffer (50 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) was performed with a desalting column (PD-10, GE Healthcare) and the protein was transferred to a conical tube and diluted to 1 mg/ml as determined by absorbance at 280 nm for long-term storage. Storage of the enzyme at 4°C and at this concentration yields active protein that does not have significant losses in activity even after 12 months of storage under these conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14-2"><title>Synthesis and purification of 6-Azido-6-deoxy-trehalose (6-TreAz)</title><p>To a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube was added 200 µl of a 100 mM solution of 6-azido-6-deoxy-glucose (final concertation 20 mM), 100 µl of a freshly-prepared 400 mM solution of UDP-glucose (final concentration 40 mM), 100 µl of a 200 mM solution of MgCl<sub>2</sub> (final concentration 20 mM), and 300 ml of reaction buffer (50 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, pH 7.4).

Photobleaching was performed with the 405 nm laser for 200 ms on a region of interest (ROI) encompassing ~1 μm from one pole of a single bacteria. A series of images was taken every second over the course of 31 s, one prior to bleaching. Labeled cells were mounted on a slide and coverslip in 0.75% low melting agarose. NIS Elements software (Nikon) was used to analyze the FRAP data to extract the fluorescence recovery kinetics. Briefly, the first image before photobleaching was used to generate an ROI for the entire cell and a second ROI was generated in the photobleached area. Total fluorescence intensities in both the whole cell area and the bleached area were extracted and normalized to correct for photobleaching of the dyes due to acquisition.

The authors reported that PDIM spreads into epithelial cells in order to inhibit TLR signaling and promote infectivity. The study describes an innovative chemical approach to track PDIM in vitro and in vivo, and presents several interesting results supporting their previous work and data from other groups. Major strengths are the authors' unique expertise and resources, especially in chemical modification of bacterial lipids and the zebrafish model of <italic>M. marinum</italic> infection. However, some of the data require additional controls and further experiments to conclusively support the authors' conclusion. In particular, (1) the conclusions regarding the PDIM/TLR axis require further dissection and consideration of alternative interpretations of the data presented, (2) the conclusions related to the spreading of PDIM into epithelial membranes require more controls to be convincing, and (3) the authors should compare their current results more extensively to previous findings to better illustrate the broader context of the topics addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The evidence presented here suggests that TLRs might be inhibited by PDIM spreading in the membrane, however, the evidence provided here do not directly show this. It is possible that the cytokine response to δ mmpL7 mutants are distinct from WT <italic>marinum</italic> and this is the reason for the altered cellular recruitment that the authors observe. The authors suggest PDIM might disrupt TLR rafting into cholesterol rich domains and sensitivity of THP-1 cells to PDIM spreading. Could they combine their fluorescent PDIM tool with traditional TLR pathway analysis tools in THP-1 cells (where these tools presumably work better than intact zebrafish)? It seems likely that TLR dimerization or association with adaptors like MYD88 are likely mechanisms and should be straightforward to test. PDIM + vs – epithelial cells could also be isolated for proteomic or transcriptional analysis to provide some insight into the mechanism of PDIM inhibition of TLR sensitivity. Notably, the authors previous work suggested that PDIM masked TLR-ligands, do they observe the same masking effect with azido-DIM?</p><p>2) The microscopy is difficult to interpret in a convincing manner. While it is clear that there are DIM-488 foci that are not colocalized with the bacteria, it is not clear that this is in the host cell membrane. Colocalization with a host cell membrane dye would be a more convincing demonstration of this finding. Since it is not clear that the PDIM signal are in host membranes from the data provided, it raises the possibility that the spots are cytosolic lipid droplets. Could these foreign inclusions could be disrupting host cell biology? The proposal that PDIM interaction with cholesterol promotes spreading into epithelial membranes could be supported by labeling membrane cholesterol and examining how azido-DIM is distributed relative to cholesterol.</p><p>In addition, the effects of lipid reconstitution on the lipid and proteomic composition of the mycomembrane should be addressed and considered. How did chemical extraction and reconstitution help control the composition of the mycomembrane (subsection “Controlling Mycomembrane Composition by Chemical Extraction and Reconstitution”, Figure 1A-D)? Is the organization of added lipid similar to that of the lipids transported from the cytoplasm? Characterization of the envelope of mycobacteria reconstituted with azido-DIM relative to intact bacteria is important for interpreting the data on the spread of azido-DIM into the epithelial cell. Since some experiments last up to 3 days, what is the stability of the fluorescence signal of azido-DIM during bacterial growth and the time required for <italic>M. marinum</italic> to restore native PDIM in the envelope?</p><p>In Figure 1, the authors perform lipid-swap experiments with wild-type <italic>M. marinum</italic> and mmpL7 mutant, and MmpL7 transports PDIM and PGL in <italic>M. marinum</italic>, differences in PGL could also be contributing to the phenotypes.</p><p>In Figure 4, the authors propose that PDIM accumulated in &quot;mycomembrane domains&quot;, but this term is poorly defined and images of the microdomains are not provided. The authors also state that mycomembrane domains containing PDIM have a uniquely high fluidity that would promote membrane mixing and contribute to PDIM spreading. Another possibility is that the membrane mixing may help PDIM to be transferred to the host membrane, where they could spread according to their diffusion properties. To test this, the authors could take advantage of A549 cells and compare the spread of DIM-499 in cells treated with DIM-499 or put in contact with DIM-499-labeled bacteria. Cell membranes are highly heterogeneous structures with distinct fluidity from one cell type to another. If PDIM can also diffuse in cell membranes, this could explain the difference in the kinetic of azido-DIM spreading between epithelial cells and macrophages.</p><p>For Figure 7, the rationale for the cholesterol study is interesting given that cholesterol is coupled to biosynthesis of methyl-branched lipids such as PDIM (for rev. Wilburn et al., 2018) and the role of DIM in macrophage invasion required cholesterol (Astarie-Dequeker et al., 2009). Figure 7A-D: Can the distinct hydrophobicity between <italic>M. marinum</italic> WT and mmpL7 mutant influence their capacity to sequester cholesterol. The authors could consider testing another hydrophobic lipid to further underscore this point.</p><p>3) Crucial data is also unnecessarily buried in supplementary figures. Supplemental Figure 3 is important to the interpretation of the results and needs to be more visible as part of a main figure. As there is no display item limit, so consider integrating the &quot;validation&quot; data into Figure 3 or splitting up Figure 3. Finally, the authors should compare their current results more extensively to previous findings to better illustrate the broader context of the topics addressed.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Spreading of a mycobacterial cell surface lipid into host epithelial membranes promotes infectivity&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Dominique Soldati-Favre (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The reviewers appreciate the careful attention of the authors to address most of the original comments, which has provided stronger support of their interpretations and conclusion. However, there are a few points that still need attention as detailed here. These comments should be able to be addressed by changes in the text.</p><p>1) Claims of TLR inhibition (starting in the abstract and throughout the manuscript) need to softened or removed as this is not directly addressed in the manuscript. The authors show effects on monocyte recruitment and that MyD88 deletion affects monocyte recruitment, but the experiments do not directly show PDIM is inhibiting TLRs and really just show that MyD88 is required for monocyte recruitment.</p><p>2) The authors should comment on the membrane effects of PDIM in the context of the literature (Augenstreich et al., 2019 and 2020). These recent data obtained with PDIM of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> would provide strong support for their findings.</p><p>3) Introduction: Could the authors clarify what fluidity means for a lipid? Membrane fluidity and lipid mobility may be more appropriate.</p><p>4) Subsection “Chemical Extraction and Reconstitution of the Mycomembrane of <italic>M. marinum</italic>”: The authors clearly showed that by mixing of extracted lipids with bacteria, the lipids coat <italic>M. marinum</italic>, but the authors do not demonstrate that the mycomembrane is reconstituted. For instance, what is the localization and orientation of lipids once coated on the bacteria in comparison to native lipids? This can be addressed by more specifically writing &quot;coating of bacteria with extracted lipid&quot; instead of &quot;reconstitution of the mycomembrane&quot;.</p><p>5) subsection “Pre-infection PDIM Reservoirs are Required for Virulence”: The authors should mention and discuss that deletion of mas or mmpL7 also results in defects in PGL synthesis and localization.</p><p>6) Subsection “PDIM Spreads into 148 Host Macrophage Cell Membranes” and thereafter: The authors should define more clearly the notion of spreading. Did Azido-DIM spread within the same membrane, suggesting a lateral diffusion, and/or propagate to distinct membrane compartments?</p><p>7) subsection “PDIM’s Fluidity Promotes Spread into Epithelial Cell Membranes”: The authors claimed that PDIM's fluidity correlates with the lipid's ability to spread into host membrane. Another possibility could be that PDIM's ability to diffuse into the bacterial membrane increases the membrane fluidity, which facilitates membrane mixing. The consequence would be the transfer of PDIM to the host membrane, in which the lipids inserted and can diffuse laterally, as previously reported (Augenstreich et al., 2019, 2020). The effect of PDIM on bacterial membrane fluidity could therefore be an explanation for the transfer of the lipid rather than for its spreading. In contrast, TMMs are less capable of diffusing and getting transferred. TMM are amphiphilic molecules in comparison to the highly hydrophobic PDIM. This strongly suggests a relationship between lipid structure and capacity to get transferred to host membranes. Please discuss this point in the Discussion section.</p><p>8) The authors should be clear in their conclusions and the Discussion that the data have been obtained with bacteria coated with extracted lipids.</p><p>9) The additional images provided by the authors are encouraging but there is not sufficient detail about the quantification to understand if this is representative or not. Furthermore, while the authors are showing overlapping signals with the plasma membrane, these images do not prove that PDIM is in the membrane. To show that PDIM is in the membrane, a z stack is required but not provided.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60648.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The evidence presented here suggests that TLRs might be inhibited by PDIM spreading in the membrane, however, the evidence provided here do not directly show this.

From prior work (Cambier et al., 2013), we know that wildtype bacteria induce the chemokine CCL2 and that expression of the receptor CCR2 on monocytes is required for their ability to be recruited to the hindbrain ventricle. In this setting, TLR-signaling is not required for monocyte recruitment. Alternatively, when bacteria lack PDIM, we know that CCR2 signaling is no longer required to recruit monocytes but now TLR signaling is required. What we didn’t know at the time was when bacteria lack PDIM, where is detection by TLRs occurring. In this study our data suggests that TLR signaling is happening immediately following infection at epithelial cells at the site of infection. Presumably this then leads to the induction of cytokines/chemokines that are distinct from what occurs during wildtype bacterial infection. Identification of which cytokines are functionally responsible for this phenotype is ongoing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors suggest PDIM might disrupt TLR rafting into cholesterol rich domains and sensitivity of THP-1 cells to PDIM spreading.

Our data in this manuscript demonstrates that PDIM is required to spread into epithelial cells to prevent recruitment of microbicidal monocytes. Because of this, we don’t anticipate data generated in monocyte cell lines to be relevant. Furthermore, previous literature suggests that TLR signaling may not be fully functional in A549 epithelial cells (DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0021827). Nevertheless, we evaluated the ability of A549 epithelial cells to respond to TNFa, LPS (TLR4 agonist), and PAM3CSK4 (TLR2 agonist) using an NFkB luciferase reporter A549 cell line (BPS Bioscience, Cat# 60625). Following an overnight incubation, the cells clearly respond to TNFa stimulation but do not respond to TLR agonists (See data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). In light of these data we are pursuing more relevant in vitro epithelial model systems where TLR signaling is intact to evaluate how PDIM disrupts this response. With regards to masking TLR ligands, our current data cannot rule out this mechanism, however it suggests that PDIM plays a more active role through the occupation of host membranes to silence TLR responses (See Discussion).</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-60648-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The microscopy is difficult to interpret in a convincing manner.

We have included additional experiments that support our claims that PDIM is spreading into non-macrophage cell membranes. First, we took advantage of the transgenic zebrafish line Tg(flk1:mcherry), whose vascular endothelial cells express the fluorescent protein mcherry. Following intravenous infection with DIM-488 labeled mycobacteria we captured bacteria in contact with endothelial cells with spread DIM-488 co-localizing with the endothelial marker (Figure 4B, subsection “PDIM’s Fluidity Promotes Spread into Epithelial Cell Membranes”). Additionally, we used the plasma membrane label Alexa-fluor 594 wheat germ agglutinin to label A549 epithelial cells. We then captured DIM-488 having spread and co-localizing with the plasma membrane label following infection (Figure 4C, subsection “P<sub>dim</sub>’s Fluidity Promotes Spread into Epithelial Cell Membranes”). Finally, we labeled A549 epithelial cells with BODIPY-cholesterol and imaged PDIM spreading onto these cells and found PDIM to strongly co-localize with BODIPY-cholesterol (Figure 8C, Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the effects of lipid reconstitution on the lipid and proteomic composition of the mycomembrane should be addressed and considered.

As such we have renamed this subsection “Chemical Extraction and Reconstitution of the Mycomembrane of <italic>M. marinum</italic>”. To address concerns over the lipid content of the mycomembrane pre and post reconstitution we extracted lipids from untreated or reconstituted bacteria and compared them by TLC. No apparent differences were noticed (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D, subsection “Chemical Extraction and Reconstitution of the Mycomembrane of <italic>M. marinum</italic>”). We additionally ran proton NMRs of the two crude extracts from control or reconstituted bacteria, the spectra were near identical (Materials and method subsection “NMR spectra”). To evaluate how extraction may alter proteins on the mycomembrane we first asked if any proteins were removed during petroleum ether extraction. We resuspended 1 mg of lipid extract in 30µl of DMSO and separated the sample by SDS-PAGE followed by staining overnight with Colloidal Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Similar to previous findings (Moliva et al., 2019) we found no evidence of protein in the petroleum ether extracts (Figure 1—figure supplement 1E, subsection “Chemical Extraction and Reconstitution of the Mycomembrane of <italic>M. marinum</italic>”), thus we do not anticipate any changes to the mycomembrane protein composition arising following reconstitution. Furthermore, the ability of reconstituted bacteria to survive as well as untreated bacteria following infection further supports this idea. Additionally, we evaluated how long it takes for delipidated bacteria to repopulate their mycomembrane lipids. Immediately following extraction, delipidated bacteria were rescued into complete growth medium. Every 24hrs these bacteria were harvested and re-extracted and the amount of lipids removed was measured. Even after 5 days in culture, bacteria did not fully restore their mycomembrane lipids (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B, subsection “Chemical Extraction and Reconstitution of the Mycomembrane of <italic>M. marinum</italic>”). Finally, we grew DIM-488 labeled bacteria for several days following reconstitution and found that the intensity of DIM-488 decreased but was still present on bacteria even after 3 days in culture (Figure 3D and E, subsection “P<sub>dim</sub> Spreads into Host Macrophage Cell Membranes in vivo”), suggesting that PDIM is not appreciably shed during mycobacterial growth in aqueous medium and that PDIM spreading is a result of interactions with the host.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 1, the authors perform lipid-swap experiments with wild-type M. marinum and mmpL7 mutant, and MmpL7 transports PDIM and PGL in M. marinum, differences in PGL could also be contributing to the phenotypes.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct that phenolic glycolipid (PGL) also depends on MmpL7 for its localization to the mycomembrane. Using mutants defective for PGL synthesis, that retain PDIM on their surface, previous studies found that these phenotypes (decreased growth following hindbrain infection with ~100 bacteria and TLR-dependent monocyte recruitment following hindbrain infection with ~100 bacteria) were not influenced by the absence of PGL (Cambier et al., 2013). Therefore, we decided to leave this detail of mycobacterial cell wall biology out of the manuscript so as not to overwhelm the readers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 4, the authors propose that PDIM accumulated in &quot;mycomembrane domains&quot;, but this term is poorly defined and images of the microdomains are not provided.

Cell membranes are highly heterogeneous structures with distinct fluidity from one cell type to another. If PDIM can also diffuse in cell membranes, this could explain the difference in the kinetic of azido-DIM spreading between epithelial cells and macrophages.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that our interpretation that PDIM resides in distinct membrane domains is not accurate. We have changed our description to better reflect our data. We also appreciate your inquiry into the mechanism behind PDIM spreading. Your suggestion that membrane mixing may help PDIM transfer to host epithelial membranes is interesting. We agree that membrane mixing is most likely an important step for PDIM transfer, however, if mixing were the deterministic mechanism driving lipid transfer then we would expect trehalose monomycolate to also be able to spread into epithelial cells, which it does not. Additionally, our data demonstrating that methyl-branched mycocerosic acids promote PDIM fluidity and are required for spreading into epithelial membranes supports the hypothesis that the biophysical properties of PDIM on the bacterial surface promote its ability to spread into host membranes.</p><p>Regarding the different kinetics of spreading between epithelial cells and macrophages, we do not believe our data suggest that the rate of spreading is different between the two. In fact, our data cannot speak to the rate of lipid spread into host membranes. Our data shows that PDIM spreads into epithelial membranes before it spreads into macrophage membranes. We believe this is a result of the physiology of infection. In our infection model, mycobacteria remain in an extracellular space for around 3-5 hours following infection after which they are phagocytosed by macrophages. While in this extracellular space they can make contact with epithelial cells. Thus, PDIM spreads into epithelial membranes prior to macrophage membranes because bacteria make contact with epithelial cells prior to interacting with/being phagocytosed by macrophages. A better explanation of these kinetics are now in subsection “P<sub>dim</sub>’s Fluidity Promotes Spread into Epithelial Cell Membranes”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For Figure 7, the rationale for the cholesterol study is interesting given that cholesterol is coupled to biosynthesis of methyl-branched lipids such as PDIM (for rev.

We agree that the Wilburn review highlights an important link between cholesterol metabolism and PDIM bio-synthesis. We have included this in our Discussion. For the introduction to Figure 7 we were motivated by studies that suggested a physical association between PDIM and cholesterol outside of macrophages, as this suggested to us that cholesterol may be promoting the spreading into epithelial cells that we were observing.</p><p>The work from Astarie-Dequeker et al., does more directly demonstrate an interaction between PDIM and cholesterol. Indeed, insubsection “P<sub>dim</sub> Spreads into Epithelial Membranes” we discuss these results. However, in contrast to Astarie-Dequeker et al., we found no difference in the rate of phagocytosis of wildtype or PDIM-deficient <italic>M. marinum</italic> following infection of zebrafish larvae (Figure 3H). Therefore, we decided not to further describe the mechanism from Astarie-Dequeker et al., where they show cholesterol being required for PDIM-promoted phagocytosis as we felt it may not explain the results in our model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 7A-D: Can the distinct hydrophobicity between M. marinum WT and mmpL7 mutant influence their capacity to sequester cholesterol.

The ability of mycobacteria to sequester cholesterol could be due to their hydrophobic outer cell membrane and not due to interactions with PDIM directly. To test this idea we chose a compound that was just as hydrophobic as cholesterol but structurally very distinct. We tested whether wildtype or ∆mmpL7 <italic>M. marinum</italic> could sequester 16:0 azidocaproyl phosphoethanolamine (azido-PE, Figure 8—figure supplement 1B). We found that either strain were capable of sequestering this hydrophobic compound (Figure 8—figure supplement 1C and D, Discussion), suggesting that there is not dramatic differences in the hydrophobicity of wildtype and ∆mmpL7 <italic>M. marinum</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Crucial data is also unnecessarily buried in supplementary figures.

In contrast, TMMs are less capable of diffusing and getting transferred. TMM are amphiphilic molecules in comparison to the highly hydrophobic PDIM.
