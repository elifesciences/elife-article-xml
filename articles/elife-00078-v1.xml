in DNA compaction, replication and gene expression. Nucleosomes and chromatin have historically been considered to be unique to eukaryotes, yet studies of select archaea have identified homologs of histone proteins that assemble into tetrameric nucleosomes. Here we report the first archaeal genome-wide nucleosome occupancy map, as observed in the halophile <italic>Haloferax volcanii</italic>. Nucleosome occupancy was compared with gene expression by compiling a comprehensive transcriptome of <italic>Hfx. volcanii</italic>. We found that archaeal transcripts possess hallmarks of eukaryotic chromatin structure: nucleosome-depleted regions at transcriptional start sites and conserved −1 and +1 promoter nucleosomes. Our observations demonstrate that histones and chromatin architecture evolved before the divergence of Archaea and Eukarya, suggesting that the fundamental role of chromatin in the regulation of gene expression is ancient.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00078.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00078.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00078.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Single-celled microorganisms called archaea are one of the three domains of cellular life, along with bacteria and eukaryotes. Archaea are similar to bacteria in that they do not have nuclei, but genetically they have more in common with eukaryotes. Archaea are found in a wide range of habitats including the human colon, marshlands, the ocean and extreme environments such as hot springs and salt lakes.</p><p>It has been known since the 1990s that the DNA of archaea is wrapped around histones to form complexes that closely resemble the nucleosomes found in eukaryotes, albeit with four rather than eight histone subunits. Nucleosomes are the fundamental units of chromatin, the highly-ordered and compact structure that all the DNA in a cell is packed into. Now we know exactly how many nucleosomes are present in a given cell for some eukaryotes, notably yeast, and to a good approximation we know the position of each nucleosome during a variety of metabolic states and physiological conditions. We can also quantify the nucleosome occupancy, which is measure of the length of time that the nucleosomes spend in contact with the DNA: this is a critical piece of information because it determines the level of access that other proteins, including those that regulate gene expression, have to the DNA. These advances have been driven in large part by advances in technology, notably high-density microarrays for genome wide-studies of nucleosome occupancy, and massively parallel sequencing for direct nucleosome sequencing.</p><p>Ammar et al. have used these techniques to explore how the DNA of <italic>Haloferax volcanii</italic>, a species of archaea that thrives in the hyper-salty waters of the Dead Sea, is organized on a genome-wide basis. Despite some clear differences between the genomes of archaea and eukaryotes—for example, genomic DNA is typically circular in archaea and linear in eukaryotes—they found that the genome of <italic>Hfx. volcanii</italic> is organized into chromatin in a way that is remarkably similar to that seen in all eukaryotic genomes studied to date. This is surprising given that the chromatin in eukaryotes is confined to the nucleus, whereas there are no such constraints in archaea. In particular, Ammar et al. found that those regions of the DNA near the ends of genes that mark where the transcription of the DNA into RNA should begin and end contain have lower nucleosome occupancy than other regions. Moreover, the overall level of occupancy in <italic>Hfx. volcanii</italic> was twice that of eukaryotes, which is what one would expect given that nucleosomes in archaea contain half as many histone subunits as nucleosomes in eukaryotes. Ammar et al. also confirmed that that the degree of nucleosome occupancy is correlated with gene expression.</p><p>These two findings—the similarities between the chromatin in archaea and eukaryotes, and the correlation between nucleosome occupancy and gene expression in archaea—raise an interesting evolutionary possibility: the initial function of nucleosomes and chromatin formation might have been for the regulation of gene expression rather than the packaging of DNA. This is consistent with two decades of research that has shown that there is an extraordinary and complex relationship between the structure of chromatin and the process of gene expression. It is possible, therefore, that as the early eukaryotes evolved, nucleosomes and chromatin started to package DNA into compact structures that, among other things, helped to prevent DNA damage, and that this subsequently enabled the early eukaryotes to flourish.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00078.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00078.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Haloferax volcanii</kwd><kwd>Nucleosome</kwd><kwd>Chromatin</kwd><kwd>Transcriptome</kwd><kwd>RNA-seq</kwd><kwd>Archaea</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Canadian Institutes for Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP-86705</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nislow</surname><given-names>Corey</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Canadian Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20380</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giaever</surname><given-names>Guri</given-names></name><name><surname>Nislow</surname><given-names>Corey</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ontario Graduate Scholarship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ammar</surname><given-names>Ron</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>1.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Similarities in the way that nucleosomes are organized into chromatin in archaea and eukaryotes suggest that chromatin might have been involved in gene regulation before its role in DNA packaging evolved.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Archaeal nucleosome core particles protect ∼60 bp of DNA, approximately half that of eukaryotic nucleosomes, as demonstrated by the landmark work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pereira et al.

Nucleosome-bound cross-linked genomic regions are protected from MNase digestion, in contrast to the linker DNA between nucleosomes.

Extrema were detected in the smoothed signal, and maxima were defined as nucleosome midpoints. In the smoothed signal, the mean peak-to-peak distance for the main chromosome was 68.5 bp in genic regions and 76.1 bp in non-genic regions. Genic regions were defined as the transcribed region plus 40 bp (the average promoter length based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Palmer and Daniels, 1995</xref>) upstream of the 5′ end. We observed a greater nucleosome density in <italic>Hfx. volcanii</italic> vs all eukaryotes likely due to the shorter length of DNA wrapped around the archaeal histone tetramer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pereira et al., 1997</xref>). Based on our data, the <italic>Hfx. volcanii</italic> genome has 14.2 nucleosomes per kilobase compared to 5.2 nucleosomes per kilobase in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. The resulting map reveals a periodic pattern similar to that seen in all eukaryotes examined to date; with protected regions appearing as peaks and linker regions as troughs. Sequence analysis of the entire nucleosome map showed that nucleosome midpoints were enriched with G/C nucleotides from 61.4% GC at the edge of the protected fragment to 74.6% GC at the midpoint (dyad). We found an increase of G/C nucleotides and a decrease in A/T nucleotides at the midpoint, as described recently for human cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Valouev et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast to previous studies in eukaryotes, we did not observe a periodicity in dinucleotide frequency relative to the nucleosome midpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Satchwell et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bailey et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albert et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>We next investigated the relationship between nucleosome occupancy and gene expression. The existing genome annotation for <italic>Haloferax</italic> is derived almost exclusively from ORF predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hartman et al., 2010</xref>). To augment these predictions, we used deep sequencing to create a high confidence transcriptome of the main chromosome of <italic>Hfx. volcanii</italic>. This map allowed us to define both 5′UTR lengths, transcriptional start sites (TSSs) and transcriptional termination sites (TTSs). Total RNA was extracted from <italic>Hfx. volcanii</italic> cells, repetitive RNA was partially depleted via duplex-specific nuclease (DSN) normalization followed by RNA-seq (see ‘Materials and methods’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhulidov et al., 2004</xref>). Transcript sequences were aligned, assembled and quantified using TopHat and the Genome Analysis Toolkit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Trapnell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">McKenna et al., 2010</xref>) and transcript boundaries were further trimmed based on RNA-seq coverage information, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wurtzel et al., 2010</xref>). The final set of transcripts were manually curated yielding 3059 transcriptional units in <italic>Hfx. volcanii</italic>, a number that is greater than observed previously in the comparable transcriptome of the sulfur-metabolizing archaeon <italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wurtzel et al., 2010</xref>) but fewer than the 4073 predicted <italic>Hfx. volcanii</italic> genes. It is likely that in the rich media conditions used in this study, not all genes are expressed. Specifically 75% of the predicted transcripts were detectably expressed, and this fraction is consistent with observations obtained for yeast gene expression in rich media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">David et al., 2006</xref>). Thirty-two novel transcripts (absent from the predicted sequence annotation) were identified in the RNA-seq data. Most of these 32 transcripts lack significant sequence homologs, and several were classified as transposases with paralogs in <italic>Hfx. volcanii</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Notably, the gene that was most highly expressed in the transcriptome (NTRANS_0004) was not previously annotated and contains a putative N-Acyltransferase (NAT) superfamily domain. Homology searches revealed that this transcript appears to be restricted to the genomes of other halophilic archaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Altschul et al., 1990</xref>). The architecture of this domain is homologous to chain A of the well-characterized histone acetyltransferases Gcn5, Gna1, Hpa2 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, suggesting a possible role for this transcript in regulating transcription via histone acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Marchler-Bauer et al., 2011</xref>). Additional acyltransferases with a similar architecture have been implicated in bacteriophage-encoded DNA modifiers as well as in cold and ethanol tolerance in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Du and Takagi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kaminska and Bujnicki, 2008</xref>). Thus, while histone post-translational modifications have not been observed in archaeal histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Forbes et al., 2004</xref>), our observation suggests that some rudimentary control over chromatin accessibility may occur via the action of ancient NAT family members. Furthermore acetyltransferase and deacetylase orthologs, which appear to have enzymatic activity based on their sensitivity to the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor trichostatin A have been identified in <italic>Hfx. volcanii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altman-Price and Mevarech, 2009</xref>). In our subsequent analysis, we focused on all genes we empirically determined to be expressed.</p><p>In eukaryotes, the TSS of the majority of expressed genes is characterized by a nucleosome-depleted region (NDR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jiang and Pugh, 2009</xref>). This NDR is flanked by the well-positioned −1 and the +1 nucleosomes. These regions direct RNA polymerase II to initiate transcription and influence the binding of promoter regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jiang and Pugh, 2009</xref>). This stereotypical pattern of nucleosome depletion at promoters and well-ordered nucleosomes in gene bodies is found in all eukaryotes, including yeast, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and humans. Using the RNA-seq-derived transcripts for <italic>Hfx. volcanii</italic>, we computed the degree of aggregate nucleosome occupancy for the 2343 transcripts on the main chromosome, and found that the NDR and −1 and +1 nucleosomes are conserved in <italic>Hfx. volcanii</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) suggesting that the interplay between chromatin and transcription is conserved in archaeal promoters. We generated nucleosome occupancy profiles for each transcript and clustered them hierarchically. Differential nucleosome density was observed with profiles encompassing between four to six nucleosomes in a 400-bp DNA segment spanning 200 bp on each side of the TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). NDRs at TTSs are also observed, and similar to those found in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2007</xref>) they are less prominent than promoter NDRs in <italic>Hfx. volcanii</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00078.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Nucleosome occupancy in <italic>Haloferax volcanii</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Degree of normalized nucleosome occupancy in aggregate for the main chromosome.

We further show that the nucleosomal protected fragments and NDRs are shorter in archaea than in eukaryotes. Our findings are particularly noteworthy because <italic>Hfx. volcanii</italic> likely resembles a deeply rooted ancestor that possessed eukaryotic genome architecture hallmarks such as histones, as well as bacterial hallmarks such as the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sartorius-Neef and Pfeifer, 2004</xref>). Archaeal histone tetramers likely resemble an ancestral state of chromatin, as it has been observed that functional (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> tetramers can be formed in vitro from eukaryotic histones, and these tetramers are functional; they facilitate more rapid transcription in vitro compared to native histone octamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Puerta et al., 1993</xref>). The observation that archaea contain (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> tetramers is consistent with the proposal that formation of the canonical eukaryotic nucleosome octamer begins with (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> tetramer assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Talbert and Henikoff, 2010</xref>).<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00078.006</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Chromatin architecture is conserved at the 5′ end of transcripts across eukaryotes and archaea.</title><p>Due to the smaller size of archaeal nucleosome DNA, the occupancy has a shorter periodicity.

This leads us to postulate that higher-order chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sajan and Hawkins, 2012</xref>) is a eukaryotic invention and that archaeal chromatin is necessary but not sufficient for genome compaction.

MNase preferentially cleaves AT-rich DNA and the promoter regions are often AT-rich. A control MNase digestion of deproteinized genomic DNA followed by isolation of 50-60 bp length DNA for genome-wide sequencing analysis should be included. The requirement for this control MNase digestion is well documented in Chung et al.

If the authors were to reconstitute chromatin in vitro using a naked plasmid and recombinant <italic>H. volcanii</italic> histone, how many DNA base pairs would be protected on average? Since this DNA was subject to deep sequencing, what was the actual length distribution of the DNA that was analyzed? This is important since it has not been described for this species.

Accordingly, we prepared <italic>Haloferax volcanii</italic> genomic DNA as described by Chung et al. (2010) and subjected this MNased material to high-throughput sequencing. The result shows no bias in this sample (details below).</p><p>We prepared deproteinized genomic DNA, digested it with MNase and size-selected the region of digested “naked” DNA fragments in the range of 50-60bp by gel excision, as described in Chung et al. (2010). This is exhibited in the gel images below. <fig id="fig6" position="float"><graphic xlink:href="elife-00078-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig>We show a titration of MNase- digesting “naked” DNA fragments with no nucleosomal fragment bands.

The DNA from these excised bands was sequenced as a control.</p><p>The MNase-digested deproteinized DNA was aligned to the <italic>Hfx. volcanii</italic> genome and the profile of sequence coverage was compared to the existing nucleosome sequence coverage profile. We found that these control reads had no correlation with the nucleosome reads (Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) = 0.071), demonstrating that the “naked” DNA control sample was not sufficient to identify nucleosome occupancy, as expected. This also indicates that the nucleosome sequence data was free from significant MNase bias. Below, we have included a screenshot displaying a representative region of genome where the nucleosome occupancy track (blue arrow) exhibits nucleosomal fragments as a trend that is significantly different from the “naked” DNA track (red arrow). <fig id="fig8" position="float"><graphic xlink:href="elife-00078-resp-fig3-v1"/></fig>These “naked” MNase control results are similar to those of Chung et al. (2010).</p><p>We have updated the manuscript to include the detail of the sample preparation and analysis, highlighting the lack of correlation between the “naked” DNA control and the nucleosomal sequence data.</p><p><italic>2) In addition, can the authors show a time course experiment where MNase digestion of H. volcanii genomic DNA results in multiples of 50-60 bp repetitive units? If the authors were to reconstitute chromatin in vitro using a naked plasmid and recombinant H. volcanii histone, how many DNA base pairs would be protected on average?

This titration demonstrates the rapid digestion of high molecular weight DNA into clearly distinguishable mono- and dinucleosomes, with increased concentrations of MNase primarily digesting the material into mononucleosomal DNA. This pattern is quite similar to the digest first published by Reeve and colleagues for recombinant archaeal histone B from <italic>Methanothermus fervidus</italic> [Pereira SL, Grayling RA, Lurz R, &amp; Reeve JN (1997) Archaeal nucleosomes. <italic>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</italic> 94(23):12633-12637].</p><p>In addition, the length distribution of the nucleosomal DNA fragments that were subject to deep sequencing was determined using an Agilent Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity chip and is described in the Methods section.</p><p>The requested time-course experiment of MNase-digested nucleosomal fragments at multiples of 50-60bp is exhibited in new Figure 1a.</p><p>We’ve also included the Bioanalyzer electropherogram below to show that the mean fragment size of the sequenced mononucleosomal DNA fragments is 59bp for <italic>Hfx. Volcanii</italic>.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><graphic xlink:href="elife-00078-resp-fig4-v1"/></fig></p></body></sub-article></article>
