are frequently poorly understood. Previously we showed that fission yeast expressing only the H3.3G34R mutant identified in aggressive pediatric glioma had reduced H3K36 trimethylation and acetylation, increased genomic instability and replicative stress, and defective homology-dependent DNA damage repair. Here we show that surprisingly distinct phenotypes result from G34V (also in glioma) and G34W (giant cell tumors of bone) mutations, differentially affecting H3K36 modifications, subtelomeric silencing, genomic stability; sensitivity to irradiation, alkylating agents, and hydroxyurea; and influencing DNA repair. In cancer, only 1 of 30 alleles encoding H3 is mutated. Whilst co-expression of wild-type H3 rescues most G34 mutant phenotypes, G34R causes dominant hydroxyurea sensitivity, homologous recombination defects, and dominant subtelomeric silencing. Together, these studies demonstrate the complexity associated with different substitutions at even a single residue in H3 and highlight the utility of genetically tractable systems for their analysis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>histone mutation</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The fundamental regulation of DNA within eukaryotes is coordinated through highly conserved histone proteins that package DNA into the nucleus. Proteins that regulate post-translational modifications of histone proteins or of DNA, or that control nucleosome assembly, disassembly, or movement, are frequently targeted in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huether et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Roy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shen and Laird, 2013</xref>). More recently, mutations within the histone genes themselves have been identified in disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behjati et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nacev et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schwartzentruber et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tessadori et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wu et al., 2012</xref>). These histone mutations arise predominantly in one of two genes encoding the histone variant protein H3.3. H3.3 is expressed throughout the cell cycle and, in contrast to the replication-dependent histone H3.1 and H3.2, is deposited into chromatin outside of S-phase (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kallappagoudar et al., 2015</xref>). Oncogenic H3.3 mutations frequently alter residues that are key sites of post-translational modification (K27M or K36M), or mutate G34, which affects the methylation of the neighboring K36 (H3K36me [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lewis et al., 2013</xref>]). The K27M and K36M mutants, found in 84% of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas and 95% chondroblastomas, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behjati et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schwartzentruber et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wu et al., 2012</xref>), exert dominant effects by inhibition of the relevant methyltransferase complexes through binding the mutant histone tails, reducing methylation of total cellular histone H3 pools at K27 or K36, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jain et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lewis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). We know much less, however, about the role of histone mutants that lack obvious dominant effects on post-translational modification of the remaining histone pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bjerke et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lewis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nacev et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tessadori et al., 2017</xref>). For example, although H4 K91 mutants (Q and R) impact acetylation and ubiquitination of the mutant H4 tail, and H3.3 G34R and V decrease K36me3 on the mutant H3.3 tail, no alterations in post-translational modification have been reported on the wild-type H4 or H3 proteins expressed in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lewis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tessadori et al., 2017</xref>). However, pronounced redistribution of the K36me3 mark was seen in a pediatric glioblastoma cell line derived from a H3.3 G34V patient (KNS42), correlating with a switch to transcriptional activation of genes normally expressed in early embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bjerke et al., 2013</xref>). Whether this change is caused by the histone mutation, is a downstream effect of transcriptional change, or the result of another mutation frequently found in H3.3 G34V mutant glioma, for example, mutation of p53 or H3.3 chaperone and remodeler proteins DAXX and ATRX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bjerke et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Korshunov et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schwartzentruber et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wu et al., 2012</xref>), is currently unclear.</p><p>We set out to address the role of mutations in histone H3, one of the most highly conserved proteins in eukaryotes, using the highly tractable fission yeast. This system excels for evaluation of the biological effects of mutations divorced from confounding effects of additional mutations in tumors and can be stripped of the complexity of additional wild-type histone H3 variants within cells. We previously reported that fission yeast manipulated to express only G34R mutant histone H3 (H3-G34R) showed defective H3K36 acetylation (H3K36ac) and reduced levels of H3K36me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yadav et al., 2017</xref>). These chromatin changes correlated with some transcriptional changes, including upregulation of antisense transcripts, enhanced subtelomeric silencing, as well as defects in replication and homologous recombination (HR), which we hypothesized were causal of genomic instability in these cells. However, it remained unclear if particular chromatin changes could be linked to specific defects.</p><p>Here, we investigate other mutants of H3G34. H3-G34V mutation is less frequent than G34R in pediatric high-grade glioma, but the tumors occur in the same cortical location in patients of similar age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schwartzentruber et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wu et al., 2012</xref>). Based on these findings, we expected similar behavior of H3-G34V and H3-G34R mutants. Surprisingly, although H3K36me3 was reduced in both mutants, other phenotypes were quite distinct, with G34V showing no defect in H3K36 acetylation, no chromosome loss, no replicative stress, and no defects in HR, but enhanced sensitivity to γ-irradiation (IR). We queried whether these differences were due to the size or the charge of the substitution. By generating a panel of H3-G34 mutant yeast, we found that G34K, which like G34R incorporates a basic charge, also showed reduced K36me3 and chromosome loss but G34W, a bulky uncharged substitution found in H3.3 in nearly all giant cell tumors of bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behjati et al., 2013</xref>), did not alter H3K36me3 or genome stability and did not sensitize cells to the DNA-damaging agents tested. We further examined which effects were dominant, and found that only some, including the HU sensitivity and HR defects in H3-G34R mutants, and silencing of subtelomeric domains in both H3-G34R and G34K mutants was evident in cells expressing a mixture of wild-type and mutant H3. In contrast, chromosome segregation was corrected and most DNA damage sensitivities were lost when cells additionally express wild-type H3. This study reveals the pivotal role of H3 Gly 34 in orchestrating many cellular responses, some that apparently act on a local level and others that are able to exert dominant effects.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Fission yeast have three genes that code for a single histone H3 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matsumoto and Yanagida, 1985</xref>).

Since H3-G34R mutant fission yeast exhibit a pronounced reduction in H3K36me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yadav et al., 2017</xref>), we asked whether H3K36me was similarly affected by H3-G34V. We first characterized antibodies for recognition of H3K36 methylation in peptides containing a H3G34V mutant tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

In contrast, H3K36me2 appeared unchanged on western analysis of H3-G34V compared with H3-WT strains, but is upregulated in H3-G34V cells since antibody recognition of K36me2 is notably reduced on the G34V mutant H3 tail. A similar effect on K36me2 was seen in G34R cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yadav et al., 2017</xref>). Thus H3K36me3 is reduced and H3K36me2 accumulates in both H3-G34V and H3-G34R cells. Since Set2 is the sole K36 methyltransferase in fission yeast, this result suggests that there may be a defect in Set2-mediated trimethylation of K36me2 G34V/R templates, or that there is heightened activity of a K36me3 demethylase. To probe these possibilities, we performed ChIP analysis of Set2 in G34V/R cells, but saw no change in Set2 association with chromatin at the sites tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Gcn5 has previously been implicated in H3K36ac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pai et al., 2014</xref>) and consistent with this, using antibody that was largely specific to K36ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), we found that <italic>gcn5Δ</italic> cells have low H3K36ac levels, similar to H3-K36A cells which lack H3K36ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). To extend this analysis, since GCN5 has many targets, including H3K14, H3K18, and H3K23, we asked if the specific loss of K36ac on H3-G34R mutant H3 could be recapitulated in vitro. Using recombinant fission yeast Gcn5 with recombinant WT or G34 mutant histone H3s, we used mass spectroscopy to monitor acetylation at individual sites in the H3 tail over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kuo and Andrews, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kuo et al., 2014</xref>). Whereas Gcn5 acetylated most sites on WT, G34R, and G34V mutant H3 templates equivalently, acetylation of K36 on G34R H3 was strongly reduced and was slowed down on G34V H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Together, the in vivo and in vitro data suggest that the G34R mutation specifically reduces acetylation on H3 K36, while acetylation at other sites remains largely unaffected. These data are consistent with structural studies of Gcn5—substrate complexes, which predicted that residues just N-terminal to the reactive lysine would modulate substrate affinity, and that replacement of the small residue (glycine or alanine) at position −2 (in this case H3G34 relative to H3K36 target) with a larger residue would likely impact Gcn5 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Poux and Marmorstein, 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>H3-G34V mutants are not sensitive to replication stress</title><p>Altered H3K36 post-translational modification is associated with defective repair of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jha and Strahl, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pfister et al., 2014</xref>).

To query the role of H3K36ac in replicative stress, we plated fivefold serial dilutions of G34V and G34R cells onto media containing drugs, and assessed cell growth after several days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

We found that of all the H3-G34 mutants, only H3-G34R was sensitive to hydroxyurea. In contrast, both strains that bear the basic substitutions (H3-G34R and H3-G34K) were sensitive to the alkylating agent MMS and to topoisomerase inhibition CPT. We found that MMS sensitivity was not altered in strains bearing the bulky H3-G34W, G34M, or the negatively charged G34Q substitutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

Since all three mutants H3-G34R, H3-G34V, and H3-G34K have reduced K36me3 and enhanced DNA damage sensitivity, K36me3 levels likely serve a critical role in safeguarding the genome, but the sensitivity of the different mutants to specific DNA-damaging insults must be influenced by additional factors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>H3-G34R and G34K exhibit chromosome loss but only H3-G34R appears defective for HR-mediated DNA repair</title><p>Since H3-G34K mutants were sensitive to DNA damage, we tested whether they showed genomic instability in the absence of exogenous DNA damage.

However, whether Sgo2 accumulation at ST correlates with reduced H3K36ac is unclear.

To determine whether the mutations exert dominant effects on expression of particular genes, we looked for overlap between genes that are differentially expressed in the single copy and mixed copy strains. Using the more relaxed criteria of p&lt;0.05, we found that the majority of genes influenced by mutation in the (3xH3) background were also differentially regulated in the sole copy backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>).

Using real-time PCR analysis of <italic>grt1</italic> and <italic>fah1</italic> transcripts, we validated the repression of subtelomeric genes in both H3-G34R and H3-G34K mixed background strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Extending this analysis to ask if subtelomeric domains were preferentially repressed in H3-G34R or H3-G34K mixed copy strains (using FDR 5% and FC of 1.5), we found that a high proportion of genes repressed in G34R and G34K mixed copy strains were resident with ST domains (10/30 and 25/69, respectively) compared with only 1/24 and 7/73 of genes activated in G34R and G34K mixed copy strains (Supplemental Table S4). Thus many of the genes that are repressed by the H3-G34R or G34K mutation are situated in ST domains of chromosomes I and II, and the hyper-repression of gene expression within ST domains is dominant since it is evident in the mixed copy background strains.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this work, we probe the consequence of mutation of Glycine 34 in histone H3 when the mutant provides the only source of H3, and identify phenotypes that dominate when mutants are co-expressed along with wild-type H3. We found a surprising diversity of phenotypes with H3-G34 mutants differentially affecting post-translational modification of nearby K36, DNA damage sensitivity, and transcriptional control.</p><p>Given that a single enzyme, Set2, mediates all H3K36 methylation in fission yeast, it is intriguing that we only saw a reduction in H3K36me3, and only in some H3-G34 mutant backgrounds. Set2 may be unable to catalyze the di-methyl to tri-methyl transition on H3K36 when H3G34 is substituted by V, R, or K, but in the absence of a direct assay of in vitro H3K36 methylation activity of purified or recombinant Set2 on the mutant histones, this remains speculative. However, consistent with a defect in tri-methylation, a very recent report shows that activity of the H3K36 tri-methylase SETD2 is blocked on nucleosomes bearing H3.3 G34 mutations, whereas NSD2-mediated di-methylation is unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jain et al., 2020</xref>), although in that study, G34R, G34V, and G34W similarly affected tri-methylation, whereas we saw no defect in H3K36me3 in the H3-G34W mutant, or H3-G34M, or G34Q strains. This difference may stem from subtle differences in how H3 binds to the active site of SETD2 compared with Set2, resulting in differing outcomes for mutants such as H3-G34W in the two systems. Insight into Set2 and SETD2’s ability to accommodate G34-substituted H3 is limited because the only available structures are of SET2/D2 complexed with its high-affinity ligand K36M H3.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bilokapic and Halic, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>), which may influence the conformation of the active site. Another possibility is that the differences in K36me3 stem from our analysis of fission yeast H3, which differs from H3.3 at several residues including alanines instead of serines at residues 28 and 31 within the H3 tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matsumoto and Yanagida, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yadav et al., 2017</xref>), which may influence K36 methyltransferase behavior on G34 mutant templates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schuhmacher et al., 2020</xref>). However, consistent with previous studies in mammalian cells, we found that co-expression of mutant (H3-G34R, V, or K) with wild-type H3 proteins did not affect H3K36me3, suggesting that if indeed Set2 activity is altered, loss of Set2-mediated trimethylation of K36 is limited to the mutant H3 tail.</p><p>K36 modifications have been linked to DNA damage response. In fission yeast, H3-G34R mutants with reduced K36ac and K36me3 are defective for HR-mediated repair of DNA breaks, whilst H3-G34V mutants, which maintain K36ac but have reduced K36me3, show no defect in HR. Since both mutants (and HR-proficient H3-G34K) have reduced H3K36me3, reduction in K36me3 is not causal of the HR defect. However, like H3-G34R mutants, Gcn5 mutants are reduced for H3K36ac, are HU sensitive, and are also defective for HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pai et al., 2014</xref>); so these phenotypes may be linked. We confirmed that Gcn5 is the major H3K36 acetyltransferase in fission yeast and then showed in vitro that Gcn5 activity was lost specifically at K36 on recombinant G34R H3. This result emphasizes that H3-G34R directly affects Gcn5 function, but meant that we could not bypass the K36 acetylation defect in H3-G34R cells by Gcn5 overexpression to assign specific phenotypes to loss of H3K36ac. We also have not been able to use H3 mutants that mimic acetylated or non-acetylated K36 since they also impact K36 methylation. It therefore remains unclear whether the HR defect and sensitivity to HU seen in G34R cells are caused by loss of H3K36ac. These phenotypes show dominance in mixed copy H3-G34R strains, but there was no global loss of H3K36ac on wild-type H3 purified from mixed copy H3-G34R strains. However, since chromatin is assembled from nucleosomes bearing two copies of H3, one possibility is that even in the presence of excess WT H3, H3K36ac is sufficiently diluted to cause dominant defects in HR and dominant HU sensitivity. In other words, the histone mutants disrupt the local chromatin architecture such that deposition of H3-G34R at <italic>leu1</italic> reduces local levels of K36ac and disrupts HR at that locus. Similar explanations have been suggested for local dominant roles of other histone mutants identified in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nacev et al., 2019</xref>). Unfortunately, we cannot readily determine if mixed copy (3xH3) G34R strains show global HR defects using <italic>rad51Δ</italic> in epistasis analyses since the mixed copy H3-G34R strain is only sensitive to HU at concentrations that kill <italic>rad51Δ</italic> in the chronic exposure plating assays. Additionally, we are unable to specifically track the localization of WT and mutant H3 proteins by ChIP since anti-H3G34R antibodies do not recognize fission yeast H3-G34R.</p><p>Another possibility would be that the unique phenotypes of H3-G34R mutants are due to the generation of a novel site of arginine methylation within the H3 tail. We have used mass spectroscopy to explore this possibility, but found no evidence for methylation of H3-G34R in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lowe et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to H3-G34R cells, which are not sensitive to γ-IR, both H3-G34V and H3-G34K are sensitive to γ-IR and to IR-mimetics but there was no dominant effect since mixed copy strains were not sensitive to IR mimetics. This may mean that local perturbation of chromatin structure from deposition of the mutant histones is insufficient to yield IR sensitivity in the presence of wild-type H3.</p><p>We also found that substitution of G34 with basic residues K or R led to accumulation of Sgo2 at subtelomeric (ST) domains correlating with enhanced silencing of these regions. These mutants also caused chromosome missegregation, but whether these phenotypes are linked is not clear. Cells defective for <italic>gcn5Δ</italic> and <italic>mst2Δ</italic> similarly show repression of ST domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nugent et al., 2010</xref>), and we found that they accumulate Sgo2 at ST domains and, like G34R, accumulate knobs. At ST domains, Sgo2 controls the timing of replication of late replicating origins, and loss of Sgo2 advances replication of some ST origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tashiro et al., 2016</xref>). In mitosis, Sgo2 is located at centromeres where it aids fidelity of chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kawashima et al., 2010</xref>). One possibility is that the elevated levels of Sgo2 at ST domains in H3-G34R, H3-G34K, and H3K36 acetyltransferase mutants further delays the timing of late-replicating ST origins, leading to chromosome mis-segregation, as well as replicative stress sensitivity. Alternately, the aberrant accumulation of Sgo2 at ST domains in mitotic H3-G34R cells could indirectly perturb centromere function. This is not due to depletion of Sgo2 from centromeres (as centromeric Sgo2 accumulation is similar between G34R and wild-type cells), but perhaps from mislocalization and/or depletion of a limiting factor that is normally recruited by Sgo2 to centromeres in mitosis, and that in G34R cells is now retargeted preferentially to ST domains. However, we note that silencing of ST domains is maintained in mixed copy strains, whereas chromosome missegregation is corrected.</p><p>What is clear from many organisms is that recruitment of Shugoshin proteins relies on Bub1 kinase-mediated phosphorylation of histone H2A on S121 (T120 in mammals) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kawashima et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kitajima et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kitajima et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Matsuda et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tashiro et al., 2016</xref>). In fission yeast, both Bub1 kinase dead and H2A-S121A mutants lose localization of Sgo2 from centromeres and subtelomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tashiro et al., 2016</xref>). We previously reported that H3-G34R mutants also alter the kinetics of phosphorylation at residues S128/129 of histone H2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yadav et al., 2017</xref>). Together with our new finding that H3-G34R/K mutants influence the localization of Sgo2, these data suggest the possibility that the G34R and G34K mutant H3s influence signaling through multiple phosphorylation sites clustered on the C-terminus of H2A. This is consistent with structural analyses of nucleosomes showing that the C-terminus of H2A lies close to the site of G34 substitutions on the H3 N-terminal tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Du and Briggs, 2010</xref>).</p><p>We note that an interesting functional link between H3 and Shugoshin has also been made in budding yeast, where the homolog of Sgo2, SGO1 has been shown to bind histone H3. Although not reliant on G34 or K36 residues of H3, SGO1 binds a ‘tension-sensing motif’ at residues 42–45 on H3, which is necessary for Sgo1 recruitment to centromeres and for efficient chromosome segregation during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deng and Kuo, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Luo et al., 2016</xref>). Intriguingly in this system, the histone acetyltransferase Gcn5 is important for ensuring efficient chromosome segregation when the tension sensing motif is damaged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buehl et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Luo et al., 2016</xref>). It is not clear whether Shugoshin proteins in higher organisms show a similar dependence on N-terminal regions of H3 for their localization and whether H3.3-G34R mutation influences their localization.</p><p>Finally we show dominant effects on transcriptional control exerted by the H3-G34R and G34K mutants. In particular, subtelomeric regions of chromosomes I and II are repressed. In keeping with the importance of transcriptional regulation in H3-G34 mutant cells, very recent work from the Lewis lab indicates that H3.3G34 mutants in mammalian cells exert profound transcriptional effects through modulation of Polycomb activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jain et al., 2020</xref>). They found that the decrease in K36me3 on H3.3 G34 mutant histone enhances PRC2 activity to promote elevated H3.3K27me3 in <italic>cis</italic> on the H3.3 tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jain et al., 2020</xref>). They propose that tumorigenesis driven by H3.3G34 mutations derives from enhanced Polycomb-mediated silencing of enhancers of genes that regulate differentiation, whereby cells retain a more stem cell-like fate. Since acetylation at enhancers principally resides on K27 of histone H3.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Martire et al., 2019</xref>), this may explain why the G34 mutations identified in cancer occur solely on H3.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behjati et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schwartzentruber et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>H3.3 only differs from H3.2 by four residues: Ser31 in the tail, and three substitutions within the core of H3 which dictate chaperone selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmad and Henikoff, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Elsässer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). Phosphorylation of Ser31 in H3.3 is important for regulation of cell fate during gastrulation and for enhancer activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Martire et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sitbon et al., 2020</xref>) and Ser31P influences H3.3 K27 trimethylation and acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Martire et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sitbon et al., 2020</xref>), and so phosphoregulation via S31 may provide an additional mechanistic link as to why the Gly 34 mutations are only found in H3.3.</p><p>Although fission yeast provides an exquisite system for analysis of histone mutations, we fully acknowledge the limitation of work in a system that lacks a Polycomb silencing pathway. It is interesting to note however the profound effects of G34R mutation on H3K36ac, the effects of the basic substitutions in the N-terminal tail of H3 on Shugoshin localization and the distinct DNA damage phenotypes of the different H3G34 mutations. It will be interesting to determine the extent to which the phenotypes uncovered in this study are shared in mammalian cancer cells expressing these mutants.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>hht2<sup>+</sup></italic>; H3.2</td><td valign="top">Pombase</td><td valign="top">Pombase: SPBC8D2.04</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td valign="top">BL21(DE3)</td><td valign="top">Sigma—Aldrich</td><td valign="top">CMC0016</td><td valign="top">Electrocompetent cells</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-histone H3 (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Active motif</td><td valign="top">39163</td><td valign="top">WB.

responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>This article uses yeast to examine the phenotypes of Gly 34 mutations in the histone H3 amino terminal tail. These mutations are found in human cancers. Surprisingly mutation of Gly 34 to different amino acids gives rise to different phenotypes. This suggest that these different mutations are likely to have different effects in cancer cells as well.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Surprising Phenotypic Diversity of Cancer-associated mutations of Gly 34 in the Histone H3 tail&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Jerry L Workman as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an exhaustive study of different phenotypes associated with Histone H3-G34 mutations in a fission yeast model. Because mutations at this site occur in certain human cancers, teasing apart their different phenotypes in a model system helps to understand their potential effects in pathology. The phenotypes vary widely, suggesting a key role for this residue in a variety of genome maintenance functions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This is overall a technically very well done paper with a variety of methods to examine different mutations in H3-G34. The strength is the consistent approach applied to numerous mutations. However, as there is no single response, it's rather descriptive overall. We have no major concerns about the data, but feel that the conclusions need to be tempered in two areas where the assays were not direct.</p><p>1) In the absence of NHEJ repair assays it needs to be noted that conclusions about NHEJ proficiency based on drug sensitivity are indirect.</p><p>2) The authors imply that the H3G34 mutants affect the activity of the Set2 H3K36 methyltransferase. In the absence of an in vitro H3K36 methylation assay on the mutant histones with recombinant or affinity purified Set2 the authors need to note that this conclusion is speculative as they have not measured it directly.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65369.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This is overall a technically very well done paper with a variety of methods to examine different mutations in H3-G34.

These modifications have been tracked along with inclusion of a new grant funding Atsushi Matsuda, an addition to the Materials and methods section and inclusion of the key resource table. I hope it is acceptable to keep separate tables for the fission yeast strain list (Supplementary file 1) and list of peptides used (Supplementary file 2).</p></body></sub-article></article>
