use mixed or alternative bioenergetic strategies. We explored the use of extracellular electron transfer for energy conservation in diverse lactic acid bacteria (LAB), microorganisms that mainly rely on fermentative metabolism and are important in food fermentations. The LAB <italic>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</italic> uses extracellular electron transfer to increase its NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio, generate more ATP through substrate-level phosphorylation, and accumulate biomass more rapidly. This novel, hybrid metabolism is dependent on a type-II NADH dehydrogenase (Ndh2) and conditionally requires a flavin-binding extracellular lipoprotein (PplA) under laboratory conditions. It confers increased fermentation product yield, metabolic flux, and environmental acidification in laboratory media and during kale juice fermentation. The discovery of a single pathway that simultaneously blends features of fermentation and respiration in a primarily fermentative microorganism expands our knowledge of energy conservation and provides immediate biotechnology applications.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Bacteria produce the energy they need to live through two processes, respiration and fermentation. While respiration is often more energetically efficient, many bacteria rely on fermentation as their sole means of energy production. Respiration normally depends on the presence of small soluble molecules, such as oxygen, that can diffuse inside the cell, but some bacteria can use metals or other insoluble compounds found outside the cell to perform ‘extracellular electron transfer’.</p><p>Lactic acid bacteria are a large group of bacteria that have several industrial uses and live in many natural environments. These bacteria survive using fermentation, but they also carry a group of genes needed for extracellular electron transfer. It is unclear whether they use these genes for respiration or if they have a different purpose.</p><p>Tejedor-Sanz, Stevens et al. used a lactic acid bacterium called <italic>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</italic> to study whether and how this group of bacteria use extracellular electron transfer. Analysis of <italic>L. plantarum</italic> and its effect on its surroundings showed that these bacteria use a hybrid process to produce energy: the cells use aspects of extracellular respiration to increase the yield and efficiency of fermentation. Combining these two approaches may allow <italic>L. plantarum</italic> to adapt to different environments and grow faster, allowing it to compete against other species.</p><p>Tejedor-Sanz, Stevens et al. provide new information on a widespread group of bacteria that are often used in food production and industry. The next step will be to understand how the hybrid system is controlled and how it varies among species. Understanding this process could result in new biotechnologies and foods that are healthier, produce less waste, or have different tastes and textures.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>extracellular electron transfer</kwd><kwd>lactobacilli</kwd><kwd>fermentation</kwd><kwd>electro-fermentation</kwd><kwd>lactic acid bacteria</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1650042</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stevens</surname><given-names>Eric T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000006</institution-id><institution>Office of Naval Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>0001418IP00037</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ajo-Franklin</surname><given-names>Caroline M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000015</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE-AC02-05CH11231</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tejedor-Sanz</surname><given-names>Sara</given-names></name><name><surname>Stevens</surname><given-names>Eric T</given-names></name><name><surname>Ajo-Franklin</surname><given-names>Caroline M</given-names></name><name><surname>Marco</surname><given-names>Maria L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000199</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Agriculture</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W4122</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marco</surname><given-names>Maria L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004917</institution-id><institution>Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RR190063</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ajo-Franklin</surname><given-names>Caroline M</given-names></name><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Siiliang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Lactic acid bacteria engage a hybrid metabolism which blends features of fermentation and respiration when they perform extracellular electron transfer.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ways in which microorganisms extract energy to maintain cellular functions are directly linked to their environment, including the availability of nutrients and cooperative or antagonistic interactions with other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Haruta and Kanno, 2015</xref>). Microorganisms must also maintain redox homeostasis by responding to oxidative and reductive changes inside and outside the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sporer et al., 2017</xref>). Ultimately, microorganisms that can effectively generate cellular energy while also managing redox requirements will maintain higher growth and survival rates, and therefore exhibit greater ecological fitness.</p><p>All organisms possess mechanisms to conserve energy, that is, to convert light or chemical energy into cellular energy in the form of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Russell and Cook, 1995</xref>). During respiration, microorganisms rely on either oxygen (aerobic respiration) or other exogenous substrates (anaerobic respiration) as terminal electron acceptors. Some microorganisms, most notably <italic>Geobacter</italic> spp., can anaerobically respire using electron acceptors outside the cell, such as iron (III) oxides or an electrode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Renslow et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Richter et al., 2012</xref>). This process is called extracellular electron transfer (EET). Regardless of the identity of the electron acceptor, ATP synthesis during respiration occurs via oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kim and Gadd, 2019</xref>). In oxidative phosphorylation, electrons from electron carriers are transported by an electron transport chain, which creates a proton motive force (PMF) for ATP generation. Under anaerobic conditions, some cells can also conserve energy using fermentation. In fermentation, microorganisms use internally supplied electron acceptors, and ATP is generated mainly through substrate-level phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kim and Gadd, 2019</xref>). In substrate-level phosphorylation, ATP is generated in the cytoplasm by transfer of phosphate from metabolic intermediates to ADP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kim and Gadd, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are a diverse group of aerotolerant, saccharolytic microorganisms in the Firmicutes phylum which mainly use fermentation for energy conservation. LAB are essential for many food fermentations, including fermented milk and meats, fruits and vegetables, and grains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Tamang et al., 2020</xref>). Strains of LAB are also used for industrial chemical production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sauer et al., 2017</xref>) and as probiotics to benefit human and animal health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Vinderola et al., 2019</xref>). LAB are generally grouped by their differences in hexose metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Salvetti et al., 2013</xref>). Some species perform homofermentation, reducing pyruvate to lactate as the sole metabolic end-product from glycolysis. Other LAB perform heterofermentation, producing lactate along with ethanol, acetate, and CO<sub>2</sub> by the phosphoketolase pathway. However, for redox balancing, homofermentative LAB can also shift to a mixed acid fermentation and heterofermentative LAB use alternative electron acceptors, like fructose or citrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hansen, 2018</xref>). Although some LAB can respire in the presence of heme and menaquinone, those bacteria are unable to synthesize heme and many are also auxotrophic for menaquinone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Pedersen et al., 2012</xref>). Even those species capable of respiration still use fermentation metabolism as the primary mechanism to conserve energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Pedersen et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, LAB growth rates and cell yields are constrained by access to electron acceptors used to maintain intracellular redox balance during substrate-level phosphorylation.</p><p>The bioenergetics of anaerobic bacteria have been tightly linked to oxidative phosphorylation for anaerobic respiration and substrate-level phosphorylation for fermentation. However, experimental evidence shows a concurrent use of oxidative phosphorylation and substrate-level phosphorylation. For instance, some yeasts perform respiro-fermentation to enhance ATP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Pfeiffer and Morley, 2014</xref>). Another example is the electron bifurcating mechanism used by some fermentative microorganisms such as <italic>Clostridium</italic> spp. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Herrmann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Li et al., 2008</xref>). Through that energy conservation strategy, cells can generate extra ATP through oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buckel and Thauer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Müller et al., 2018</xref>). Along with other examples that are not fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hunt et al., 2010</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kracke et al., 2018</xref>), these observations suggest metabolisms that combine aspects of fermentation and respiration may exist.</p><p>We recently discovered that <italic>Listeria monocytogenes,</italic> a facultative anaerobic pathogen known to rely on respiratory metabolism, uses EET to reduce Fe<sup>3+</sup> or an anode through a flavin-based extracellular electron transfer pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Light et al., 2018</xref>). Use of this pathway allowed <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> to maintain intracellular redox balance via NADH oxidation. This capacity was associated with the presence of a gene locus, called a flavin-based EET (FLEET) locus, that was identified in many Gram-positive species in the Firmicutes phylum, including LAB. Studies in individual species of LAB such as <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Freguia et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Masuda et al., 2010</xref>), <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hederstedt et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Keogh et al., 2018</xref>), and <italic>Lactiplantibacillus pentosus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Vilas Boas et al., 2015</xref>) show that they can perform EET with an anode endogenously, that is without addition of molecules foreign to their native niches. These observations are quite surprising because endogenous EET has been mainly associated with respiratory organisms, even though some of these organisms also possess fermentative-type metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Glasser et al., 2014</xref>). Those observations also raise the question of whether the FLEET locus is functional in LAB and what, if any, role it plays in energy conservation and metabolism.</p><p>Here, we explored EET across LAB and studied the implications of this trait at a metabolic and energetic level in <italic>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</italic>, a homofermentative LAB capable of mixed acid fermentation and which can respire in the presence of exogenous heme and menaquinone. <italic>L. plantarum</italic> is of particular interest as it is a generalist LAB species found in insect, animal, and human digestive tracts and is essential for the production of many fermented foods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behera et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duar et al., 2017</xref>). These findings have significance for the understanding of energy conservation strategies in primarily fermentative microorganisms and on lactic acid fermentations in food biotechnology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>L. plantarum</italic> reduces extracellular electron acceptors</title><p>To determine whether <italic>L. plantarum</italic> can reduce extracellular electron acceptors, we first measured its ability to reduce insoluble ferrihydrite (iron (III) oxyhydroxide). Incubation of the model strain <italic>L. plantarum</italic> NCIMB8826 in the presence of ferrihydrite showed that this strain reduces Fe<sup>3+</sup> to Fe<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Viable cells are required for iron reduction and this activity is dependent on the presence of exogenous quinone (DHNA, 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-B</xref>). The requirement for DHNA was hypothesized because DHNA is a precursor of demethylmenaquinone (DMK), a membrane electron shuttle utilized by <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> for EET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Light et al., 2018</xref>), and <italic>L. plantarum</italic> lacks a complete DHNA biosynthetic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brooijmans et al., 2009a</xref>).

The addition of riboflavin to the growth medium did not further increase iron reduction by <italic>L. plantarum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>), potentially because riboflavin is already present in high quantities in MRS, a medium containing yeast extract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Tomé, 2021</xref>).

No current was observed in the absence of <italic>L. plantarum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), indicating that current production stems from a biological process. <italic>L. plantarum</italic> produced a maximum current of 129 ± 19 µA/cm<sup>2</sup> in mCDM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and 225 ± 9 µA/cm<sup>2</sup> in mMRS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Under EET conditions in mCDM, the <italic>L. plantarum</italic> biomass was 2.7 mg (dry cell mass). Assuming 50% of the dry cell mass was protein, the specific electron transfer rate was 57 µmol electrons/mg- protein/hr and the current production was 1.5 mA/mg-protein.

It should be noted that these species, unlike <italic>L. plantarum</italic>, can synthesize riboflavin and quinones and do not require the addition of either for EET activity. Similar to our iron reduction experiments, EET to an anode occurred with different electron donors and growth media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B-C</xref>), and current increased after supplementation of riboflavin when it was omitted from the growth medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>).

Taken together, our data indicate that EET is involved in energy conservation, and the intracellular redox balance during EET mimics a respiratory rather than a fermentative process.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>EET increases fermentative metabolism through substrate-level phosphorylation and reduction in extracellular pH</title><p>Metal-reducing bacteria use EET in anaerobic respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Richter et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Shi et al., 2007</xref>). Ndh2 is considered an anaerobic respiratory protein, and <italic>L. plantarum</italic> can perform anaerobic respiration with exogenous menaquinone and heme using an electron transport chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brooijmans et al., 2009b</xref>). This led us to hypothesize that those electron transport proteins could also be involved for EET to conserve energy as part of anaerobic respiration. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether any of the known electron transfer proteins needed for PMF generation in aerobic and anaerobic respiration are required for <italic>L. plantarum</italic> EET. Neither the addition of heme to restore bd-type cytochrome (<italic>cydABCD</italic>) used in aerobic respiration, nor deletion of the respiratory nitrate reductase (Δ<italic>narGHJI</italic>) significantly altered current production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A-B</xref>). Because Ndh2 is a type-II NADH dehydrogenase which does not contribute to a proton gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Nakatani et al., 2020</xref>), these observations show that while EET does involve a respiratory protein, it does not involve any of the known PMF-generating electron transfer proteins in <italic>L. plantarum</italic>.</p><p>Respiration is also associated with the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. <italic>L. plantarum</italic>, like other LAB, does not possess an oxidative branch of the TCA cycle and only contains a reductive branch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Tsuji et al., 2013</xref>). To probe whether the reductive branch was active during EET, we also examined production of succinate, the terminal end-product of the reductive branch. EET did not increase the succinate concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Moreover, we did not detect any intermediates of the reductive branch of the TCA cycle, that is oxalacetate, malate, or fumarate. This indicates that EET did not cause additional metabolic flux through its TCA cycle. Thus, none of the known metabolic pathways or electron transport proteins associated with anaerobic respiration, besides Ndh2, are required for EET. These results suggest increased energy conservation during EET in <italic>L. plantarum</italic> is not through canonical anaerobic respiration.</p><p>An alternative hypothesis is that increased energy conservation under EET conditions is driven by changes in fermentation. <italic>L. plantarum</italic> uses glycolysis to convert mannitol to two molecules of pyruvate which are then converted mainly to lactate or ethanol via NADH-consuming steps, or acetate via an ATP-generating reaction using substrate-level phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dirar and Collins, 1972</xref>). Thus, shifting toward production of acetate from to lactate or ethanol production can increase ATP yield during fermentation. Additionally, NADH can be re-generated by oxidizing pyruvate to yield 2,3-butanediol, using acetoin as an intermediate. Fermentation in <italic>L. plantarum</italic> also decreases the pH of the surrounding media.</p><p>To probe changes in fermentation, we measured the concentrations of mannitol, acetate, lactate, ethanol, acetoin, 2,3-butanediol, formate, and pyruvate and the pH in <italic>L. plantarum</italic> cultures during OC and EET conditions. After four days, we accounted for ~80% and ~ 55% of the total carbon under EET and OC conditions (for all metabolite concentrations see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), giving us a quantitative view of metabolism under EET conditions. Surprisingly, under EET conditions, the distribution of major end-fermentation products (acetate, lactate, and ethanol) did not change, but their yield per cell was 2.6-fold higher compared to OC conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). While we did not detect acetoin or 2,3-butanediol, formate was found at trace levels, and pyruvate was found at similar, low levels under EET and OC conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). After accounting for mannitol consumption, we observed that EET allowed cells to produce ~1.75 x more fermentation products per each mol of mannitol utilized (Y<sub>fermentation</sub>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The culture medium pH was also significantly lower than under OC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), a result which may indicate that EET conferred higher levels of acid stress on <italic>L. plantarum</italic>, and therefore, reductions in cell viability, despite EET leading to higher cell numbers overall (as measured by dry cell weight) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>).

Another major difference in fermentation and anaerobic respiration is the use of the endogenous versus exogenous electron acceptors. To more deeply understand how <italic>L. plantarum</italic> uses organic molecules and the anode as electron acceptors when performing EET, the electron balances under EET and OC conditions were calculated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We estimated the NADH produced using two different methods (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for methodology) and the NADH re-oxidized through the reduction of the anode (measured as current) and via substrate-level phosphorylation. This allowed us to obtain a global balance of the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio. Under OC conditions between 35% and 66% of the NADH produced from the oxidation of mannitol to pyruvate (a range is given using the two methods used) was re-oxidized to NAD<sup>+</sup> (5.5 mM NADH consumed, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), qualitatively agreeing with the low NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratios measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). In contrast, electron balance calculations showed that between 77% and 96% of the NADH produced under EET conditions was re-oxidized (17 mM NADH consumed, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), a result that is consistent with the significantly higher NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratios measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Interestingly, these calculations estimate that 55–69% of the total NADH generated was oxidized through fermentation, while 21–28% of the NADH was oxidized using the electrode as a terminal electron acceptor (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Thus, <italic>L. plantarum</italic> growing under EET conditions achieves a more oxidized intracellular redox balance by more completely fermenting mannitol to lactate and ethanol and by using the electrode as a terminal electron acceptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). These observations reinforce that the energy metabolism of <italic>L. plantarum</italic> under EET conditions utilizes elements of both fermentation and anaerobic respiration.</p><p>In rapidly dividing cells, energy conservation, a catabolic process, is associated with growth, an anabolic process. However, catabolism need not be coupled with anabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Russell and Cook, 1995</xref>). To determine how catabolic and anabolism are connected under EET conditions, the ATP requirements to grow biomass (Y<sub>ATP</sub>) were estimated using the calculated ATP and the measured dry weight. Under OC conditions, the Y<sub>ATP</sub> obtained (8.06 ± 0.8 g dw/mol ATP) for <italic>L. plantarum</italic> was similar to that observed previously (10.9 g-dw/mol ATP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dirar and Collins, 1972</xref>). Hence, without EET, the ATP generated from fermentation was converted into biomass nearly at the expected efficiency. In contrast, a significantly lower Y<sub>ATP</sub> was reached for <italic>L. plantarum</italic> performing EET (3.07 ± 0.35 g dw/mol ATP) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). This observation indicates that under EET conditions, either more ATP is required to produce biomass or more ATP is utilized by other functions such as for PMF-generation and intracellular pH regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Russell and Cook, 1995</xref>). EET conditions also resulted in 79% more ATP per mol of fermented mannitol (Y<sub>mannitol</sub>). Consequently, molar biomass yields (g-dw/mol-mannitol) under EET conditions were significantly lower (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), in agreement with previous observations in respiratory electroactive species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Esteve-Núñez et al., 2005</xref>). These calculations show that when <italic>L. plantarum</italic> performs EET, anabolism and catabolism processes are differently coupled than under OC conditions. ATP is produced more efficiently, but this it is less efficiently utilized to make biomass. Overall, these results show an intriguing pattern of coupling between anabolism and catabolism, indicative of a novel energy metabolism in <italic>L. plantarum</italic> during EET.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>EET is active in vegetable fermentations</title><p>Our results inspired us to explore whether EET could occur in a physiological niche of LAB such as fermented foods.

These differences occurred in the absence of significant changes in viable cell numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>) at the time points measured. As previously observed using laboratory culture media, an approximately 2-fold greater accumulation of total end-fermentation products per cell was obtained when cells interacted with an anode in the presence of DHNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In the kale juice fermentation, EET+ DHNA conditions enhanced both lactate and acetate production per cell without changing the distribution of metabolites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, when DHNA was provided, EET enhanced the overall yield of fermentation end-products and their production rates per cell, mimicking our observations in laboratory medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–D</xref>). EET also led to a significantly higher acidification of the kale juice compared to OC conditions, and the presence of DHNA dramatically enhanced this pH drop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). In general, when no DHNA was supplied but an anode was present as an electron acceptor, the fermentation process was very similar to OC conditions. This means in kale juice, a source of quinones is essential to support <italic>L. plantarum</italic> EET activity.

EET in <italic>L. plantarum</italic> generates a high NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio, increases fermentation yield and flux, shortens lag phase, and increases ATP production. Thus, EET in <italic>L. plantarum</italic> is a hybrid energy metabolism that contains metabolic features of fermentation, redox features of anaerobic respiration, and predominately uses substrate-level phosphorylation to conserve energy. This pathway is active in <italic>L. plantarum</italic> with physiologically relevant DHNA concentrations and in a food fermentation and results in an increased metabolic flux and acidification rate.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The combined EET fermentation hybrid metabolism is distinct from anaerobic respiration, fermentation, and other energy conservation strategies</title><p>When performing EET, the metabolism of <italic>L. plantarum,</italic> a primarily fermentative bacterial species, is fundamentally different from EET-driven, anaerobic respiration of metal-reducing bacteria. Although aspects of EET in <italic>L. plantarum</italic> and metal-reducing <italic>Geobacter</italic> spp. are similar, such as the upregulation of NADH dehydrogenase, the reduction rate of extracellular electron acceptors, and the high NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio, other aspects of energy metabolism during EET in these two organisms are starkly different (see comparison in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). <italic>Geobacter</italic> spp. direct their metabolic flux through the TCA cycle, rely almost exclusively on extracellular electron acceptors to regenerate NADH, and produce ATP exclusively through oxidative phosphorylation. In contrast, <italic>L. plantarum</italic> regenerates a substantial fraction of its NADH by directing metabolic flux through fermentative pathways. Additionally, oxidative phosphorylation is not a major mechanism of energy conservation in <italic>L. plantarum</italic> during EET, as supported by three lines of evidence: the marginal metabolic flux through the reduced branch of TCA cycle, no involvement of known PMF-generating proteins, and that increased ATP levels can be accounted for by increased substrate-level phosphorylation. While additional data are required to eliminate the possibility that oxidative phosphorylation is occurring in <italic>L. plantarum</italic> during EET, we can qualitatively state that substrate-level phosphorylation is the major mechanism for ATP generation.</p><p>Comparing EET and respiratory metabolism in LAB also reveals substantial differences in these metabolisms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). While both metabolisms require quinones, respiration also requires exogenous heme. Our findings and similar findings in <italic>E. faecalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Pankratova et al., 2018</xref>) confirm that heme is not required for EET. Moreover, EET also differs from respiration in LAB because it occurs at the start of or prior to exponential phase growth, does not change the final cell density, and increases fermentation with no effect on the resultant proportions of lactate, acetate, and ethanol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Duwat et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, EET in LAB diverges from respiration in metal-reducing bacteria or LAB in its metabolic pattern and energetic consequences. In addition, while EET provokes a shift in fermentative metabolism in other bacteria upon the addition of artificial mediators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Vassilev et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Emde and Schink, 1990</xref>), <italic>L. plantarum</italic> EET is active upon the presence of a mediator present in a complex food system.</p><p>This EET mechanism is also a novel energy conservation strategy compared to known fermentative metabolisms in LAB (comparison in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). <italic>L. plantarum</italic> and other LAB, reduce alternative intracellular electron acceptors like citrate, fructose, and phenolic acids, resulting in increased intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hansen, 2018</xref>). This metabolic activity is especially important for heterofermentative LAB in order to synthesize additional ATP through acetate kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gänzle, 2015</xref>). Unlike these examples, however, the reduction of extracellular Fe<sup>3+</sup> or an anode by EET requires a respiratory protein (Ndh2) and the shuttling of electrons outside of the cell. In addition, the reduction of the oxygen and organic compounds for cofactor regeneration by LAB leads to a metabolic shift toward acetate production and altered metabolic end-product ratios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gänzle, 2015</xref>), which does not occur during EET. These differences show how the hybrid metabolism under EET conditions is distinct from other pathways that alleviate reduced intracellular conditions in LAB.</p><p>Previous studies have reported a simultaneous use of fermentation and electron transport elements, such as in respiro-fermentation in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blom et al., 2000</xref>). However, respiro-fermentation produces ATP and maintains intracellular redox balance through substrate-level phosphorylation and/or oxidative phosphorylation using separate pathways. Our data strongly suggests a single pathway is responsible for both ATP generation and intracellular redox balance. This hybrid fermentation mode is also different from the electron bifurcating mechanism, in which the extra ATP generation is driven by the creation of a H<sup>+</sup> or Na<sup>+</sup> potential from the oxidation of a ferredoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buckel and Thauer, 2013</xref>). Unlike in this example, EET in LAB does not involve PMF creating elements and EET drives ATP generation through substrate-level phosphorylation. Another poorly understood example of the use of substrate-level phosphorylation and electron transport chains to balance intracellular redox state is found in the non-fermentative bacterium <italic>S. oneidensis</italic>. Although this species is a respiratory bacterium, it relies predominately on substrate-level phosphorylation to grow anaerobically with the exogenous electron acceptor fumarate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hunt et al., 2010</xref>). In this scenario, it is unclear if there are changes in intracellular redox state or metabolism in this species.</p><p>In contrast to and expanding upon these studies, our work elucidates a qualitatively and quantitatively different blending of fermentation and respiration. <italic>L. plantarum</italic> EET-associated metabolism contains features of both fermentation (e.g. substrate-level phosphorylation, high fermentation product yields) and respiratory metabolisms (e.g. NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratios, NADH dehydrogenase required) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Quantitatively, this hybrid metabolism leads to an overall ~1.75x-more efficient and ~1.75x-faster energy conservation (increased Y<sub>mannitol</sub>, mannitol flux), but an overall ~1.5 fold weaker coupling between anabolism and catabolism (lower Y<sub>ATP</sub>). Additionally, the increased NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio arises from using an ~2:1 ratio of endogenous to extracellular electron acceptors. Thus, to our knowledge, the hybrid strategy that <italic>L. plantarum</italic> uses to generate ATP performing EET constitutes a novel mode of energy conservation in a primarily fermentative microorganism.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Different mechanisms of EET appear to be widespread in LAB</title><p>Based on our observations and others, we propose that EET is widespread in LAB and occurs by different mechanisms.

Current generation by <italic>L. lactis</italic> was observed previously, found to be riboflavin dependent, and resulted in a small metabolic shift (yet to be defined) in which the flux through NADH-oxidizing pathways was reduced and ATP generating pathways were increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Freguia et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Masuda et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>L. lactis</italic> can also perform EET by reduction of tetrazolium violet and this activity depends on the presence of both quinones and an NADH dehydrogenase (NoxAB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Tachon et al., 2009</xref>). <italic>E. faecalis</italic> is another LAB that performs EET, and similar to <italic>L. plantarum,</italic> it requires quinones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Pankratova et al., 2018</xref>) and a type-II NADH dehydrogenase (Ndh3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hederstedt et al., 2020</xref>) for Fe<sup>3+</sup> reduction. In contrast to this mechanistic similarity, <italic>E. faecalis</italic> performs EET using matrix-associated iron resulting in both increased final cell biomass and intracellular iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Keogh et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, unlike <italic>L. plantarum</italic> and <italic>L. lactis</italic>, the presence of PplA is not necessary for anode reduction or Fe<sup>3+</sup> reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hederstedt et al., 2020</xref>). The conditional need for PplA in EET may be explained by the different prior growth conditions used and/or related to the existence of different mechanisms and proteins depending on the redox potential of the extracellular electron acceptor. Other flavin-binding, extracellular reductases amongst Gram-positive organisms, such as FrdA (acting on fumarate) have been identified in <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> and UrdA (acting on urocanate) in <italic>Enterococcus rivorum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Light et al., 2019</xref>).

Increased organic acid production and environmental acidification by LAB with this hybrid metabolism would provide an effective mechanism to inhibit competing microorganisms and confer a competitive advantage for growth.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The methods and results of metabolite analyses are not sufficiently described. Further explanation is required if conclusions are to be made about yield, fermentation, and physiology.</p><p>2) Some claims are overstated and need to be revised or, better yet, backed up with more experimental data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The only weakness: The methods and results of metabolite analyses are not sufficiently described. This requires explanation if conclusions are to be made about yield, fermentation, and physiology.</p><p>The paper provides strong evidence that electron diversion to external acceptors is an electron sink. However, while quantitative conclusions are made about fermentation, only ~30% of the mannitol can be accounted for in the EET condition that is the focus of this paper. Put another way, the paper is about where electrons go, but the majority of the electrons are missing.</p><p>Clarify if this strain can excrete products such as sugar polymers, sugars, pyruvate, formate, glycerol, acetoin, or butanediol. State if standards for these were included in the product analysis (an RI detector can pick up nearly all of these). Explain why formate isn't present (was it not measured?), as this would allow determination of flux through PFL vs. a pyruvate excretion, a carbon sink of acetoin, or butanediol. Could missing carbon be due to excretion of a partially oxidized sugar like fructose (which would also show up on an RI detector), or accumulation of storage polysaccharide?</p><p>A) Address these questions in the section around line 299; where fermentation products are mentioned as being present or absent. What was looked for, but not found (lactate yes, succinate no), vs which were not looked for, (pyruvate? Formate? Acetoin, etc). This makes it clear that carbon is not missing, just that the methods were unable to detect it.</p><p>B) Table 1 and all other tables making calculations need significant qualifiers-- since NADH flux is guessed from mannitol disappearance (the assumption of 3 NADH, which would not be true if sugars, glycerol, or pyruvate were made), and NADH fates + ATP yields are based on a small subset of fermentation products detected. Statements like line 347 &quot;EET allowed cells to produce more fermentation products per mol mannitol&quot; can't be made. Nor can one conclusively say what % of electrons went to electrodes, nor what the YATP is. If anything, the fact that the mix of lactate, acetate and ethanol do not shift dramatically to acetate production (which is typically the result of any system with an NADH sink, such as interspecies hydrogen transfer), is surprising and indicates something unexplained is going on.</p><p>Again, the lack of a carbon balance takes nothing away from qualitative conclusion that mannitol electrons are diverted to EET, or the strength of the EET evidence. The electrons at the electrode or in the iron are real and countable, this just limits the quantitative statements that can be made.</p><p>2) L136; Reported Geobacter current densities easily reach 1000 µA/cm2 for flat surfaces, not 100-200.</p><p>3) Figure 3B: Many questions about this experiment. It is the only time it appears, yet is used as a quantitative way to compare mutants.</p><p>a) State if the iron(III) in the medium was reduced by mutants during this assay-for redox potential to drop equally suggests that it was (which contradicts 3A).</p><p>b) Provide the final pH during these experiments-- pH can affect E{degree sign}'.</p><p>c) Lack of DHNA is always used as a reliable negative control in the other experiments, provide any data that shows if the addition of DHNA is essential for the mV drop in this assay, so we know it is also an assay of EET.</p><p>Lacking better evidence/controls, this is one of the weaker bits of data in the main body, especially next to the more robust Fe/current data. Appropriate for supplements, but not conclusive as is.</p><p>4) An idea regarding the ∆pplA phenotype-the two conditions require EET, but iron oxides should be lower potential acceptors than the anode which is poised at a high driving force of &gt;+400 mV. The anode is plenty high to oxidize something like DHNA (E{degree sign}' ~70 mV) or chelated metals. PplA could be more necessary near the low potential of flavins. The supplied data can't be used to compare the effect of specific riboflavin concentrations on iron reduction rates (only extents) vs current production rates, but it might be available.</p><p>5) Line 311, More data would be needed to use succinate production as evidence for or against respiration. A mol of pyruvate could be excreted as succinate due to TCA cycle oxidation (indicating respiration), manifesting as excess electrons relative to the amount of succinate produced (as additional pyruvate would have to be used to make OAA). Conversely, succinate could be due to electron disposal via a reductive pathway (indicating fermentation). Lacking good carbon or electron recovery, neither can be ruled out, though the non-respiratory reductive pathway is most logical.</p><p>6) Table 1/line 403-: The low YATP in cells using EET is a possible 'different energy conversion strategy'. (Side note- an energy spilling/Russell mechanism would be an 'ATP-dissipating', not -accumulating). I'd suggest uncoupling of acid production from growth by low pH seems likely. In most strains, simple glycolytic pathway functions at low external pH, but complex protein synthesis and replication processes become inhibited, ATP from substrate turnover is needed to maintain pmf and internal pH, and high internal organic acids become toxic. Citable yield/pH data can be hard to locate as it comes from the 80's in the age of calling every lactic acid bacterium a Streptococcus, but since the non-EET cultures at neutral pH got close to the Bauchop and Elsden YATP, and EET cultures at pH 4 were a fraction of this, these data look like common behaviour of many lactic acid bacteria. In future comparisons, pH control could help estimate energy yields from EET. The first paper I found in a quick search to illustrate pH effects was: Russell and Dombrowski, DOI: 10.1128/aem.39.3.604-610.1980.</p><p>7) The value for Geobacter ATP/substrate yield in Table S2 seemed very high. Mahadevan says Geobacter produces 0.5 mol ATP/mol acetate when using extracellular acceptors (3x higher when using internal acceptors like fumarate). If I understand the adjustment for 6-carbon compounds, would this make the value for Geobacter using EET to be 1.5 mol ATP/mol 6-C substrate?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Line 21 – acronyms like this make our field more challenging to understand and are unnecessary.

We revised the Materials and methods and Results sections to more comprehensively describe the methods and results of the metabolite analyses. Within the Results, we included new data (Figure 5 and Supplement file 1) showing the levels of formate and pyruvate under extracellular electron transfer and open circuit conditions. We also clarify that we included standards for a number of metabolites, but that our measurements show that these compounds were absent or sufficiently low to not be within the range of detection.</p><p>Second, we also now provide a more complete picture which allows us to make quantitative conclusions about yield, fermentation, and physiology during EET in <italic>L. plantarum</italic>. Our new data on formate and pyruvate levels allowed us to track carbon and electrons at ~80% and ~85%, respectively. With this information, we show that EET increases the yield of ATP and fermentation products per mole of mannitol (Y<sub>mannitol,</sub> Y<sub>fermentation</sub> in Table 1) by ~1.75x. This result indicates that EET enables more efficient energy conservation and greater mannitol fermentation in <italic>L. plantarum.</italic> The better accounting of electrons reveals that <italic>L. plantarum</italic> uses an ~2:1 ratio of endogenous to exogeneous electron acceptors during EET<italic>.</italic> Interestingly, the yield of biomass per ATP and per mannitol (Y<sub>ATP,</sub> Y<sub>mannitol</sub>) decreases by ~1.5x, showing that while EET triggers faster, more efficient energy conservation, these catabolic processes are also less coupled to anabolic processes. Thus, the revised manuscript provides an improved, multifaceted view of this hybrid metabolism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Some claims are overstated and need to be revised or, better yet, backed up with more experimental data.</p></disp-quote><p>We revised claims to more precisely reflect our findings and, for other claims, provided additional experimental data to further support them as follows:</p><p>(1) We provide new data on formate and pyruvate and the implications of those data on yield of ATP and fermentation products (discussed in our response to point 1 above).</p><p>(2) We provide new evidence that <italic>L. plantarum</italic> performs EET with physiologically-relevant (low) concentrations of DHNA (concern raised by Reviewers #2 and #3). DHNA is present at a range of concentrations (0.09-0.5 ug/mL) in foods and other environments inhabited by <italic>L. plantarum</italic>. Our new data (Figure 1—figure supplement 3) shows that <italic>L. plantarum</italic> supplied with 0.010 ug/mL DHNA, which is on the lower end of this range, still produces significant current and iron reduction. Additionally, we now show that this DHNA-dependent EET causes a significant decrease in pH (Figure 1—figure supplement 3), indicating EET affects the physiology of <italic>L. plantarum</italic>.</p><p>Lastly, while these data indicate that physiologically relevant levels of DHNA have physiological effects on <italic>L. plantarum</italic> in laboratory culture media, we also qualify our conclusions to explain that the extent and physiological impact of EET will depend on the environmental and nutritional conditions of the niche <italic>L. plantarum</italic> is inhabiting (lines 153-162).</p><p>(3) More background information is provided on the rationale and need for measuring oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) (concern raised by Reviewers #1 and 2) (lines 213-217). Appropriate statistical tests are also now applied to the ORP data. Lastly, new data are included (Figure 3B and Figure 3—figure supplement 1) showing that DHNA supplementation is required for robust ORP reduction by wild-type <italic>L. plantarum</italic>, further linking EET activity to its ability to modulate extracellular ORP during fermentation.</p><p>(4) Reviewer #3 suggested that the claim that EET proceeds independently of respiration may be overstated. We now explain our current understanding and the limits on that understanding. Our results show EET proceeds via a respiratory protein, but ATP generation during EET is mainly produced by substrate-level phosphorylation, not oxidative phosphorylation. We also acknowledge that EET could involve other as-yet unidentified respiratory components (lines 478-485 and 504-5) and that we cannot exclude ATP generation by oxidative phosphorylation (lines 482-485).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) The only weakness: The methods and results of metabolite analyses are not sufficiently described. This requires explanation if conclusions are to be made about yield, fermentation, and physiology.</p><p>The paper provides strong evidence that electron diversion to external acceptors is an electron sink. However, while quantitative conclusions are made about fermentation, only ~30% of the mannitol can be accounted for in the EET condition that is the focus of this paper.

Explain why formate isn't present (was it not measured?), as this would allow determination of flux through PFL vs. a pyruvate excretion, a carbon sink of acetoin, or butanediol. Could missing carbon be due to excretion of a partially oxidized sugar like fructose (which would also show up on an RI detector), or accumulation of storage polysaccharide?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for the Reviewer’s strong endorsement of our manuscript and clear recommendations for improvements.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we provide additional data showing where ~80% of the carbon goes under EET conditions (Supplement File 1) and where the majority of the carbon goes under open circuit conditions. With this more complete information, our balances account for between 77-96% of the electrons (see Supplement file 1). These new data more completely support our conclusion that EET increases fermentation product yield, metabolic flux, and environmental acidification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A) Address these questions in the section around line 299; where fermentation products are mentioned as being present or absent. What was looked for, but not found (lactate yes, succinate no), vs which were not looked for, (pyruvate? Formate? Acetoin, etc). This makes it clear that carbon is not missing, just that the methods were unable to detect it.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer on this recommendation to provide more clarity on the methods and results of the metabolite analyses. As a result, we have included additional information in the Materials and Methods (lines 712-720) and in the Results (lines 323-325 and 328-335). As described in detail below, we can account for ~80% of the carbon and electrons under EET conditions, which captures a majority of both the carbon and electron flow.</p><p>With our HPLC methods, we were able to detect the following compounds using standards: acetate, formate, pyruvate, malate, lactate, succinate, oxalacetate, fumarate, ethanol, acetoin, butanediol, mannitol, glucose and fructose (now indicated on lines 712-720 in Materials and Methods). Despite being extensively studied, <italic>L. plantarum</italic> have not been reported to make storage polysaccharides, and thus it is very unlikely that storage polysaccharides could account for the remaining missing carbon.</p><p>We detected large and significant changes in the concentration of main fermentation end-products, acetate, lactate and ethanol (Figure 5). We detected significant, but small changes, in pyruvate and formate production (now shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 2). We did not detect fructose, malate, glucose, oxaloacetate, fumarate, acetoin or 2,3-butanediol in the samples. We have included this new information in the revised Results section (lines 333-334). We also now include carbon in biomass as part of the carbon recovery in an updated Table 1 and updated Table S1. (We also revised other portions of Table S1 to correct a prior error.)</p><p>Taken together, these updated measurements increase the carbon recovery observed under both EET and OC conditions. Under EET conditions, ~80% of the carbon is recovered in fermentation products, while under OC conditions, we can account for ~55% of the carbon. We did not measure CO<sub>2</sub> production because our bioelectrochemical reactors are not gas tight. Thus, we suggest the missing carbon is likely due to CO<sub>2</sub> production, but we cannot rule out production of other unidentified metabolites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) Table 1 and all other tables making calculations need significant qualifiers-- since NADH flux is guessed from mannitol disappearance (the assumption of 3 NADH, which would not be true if sugars, glycerol, or pyruvate were made), and NADH fates + ATP yields are based on a small subset of fermentation products detected. Statements like line 347 &quot;EET allowed cells to produce more fermentation products per mol mannitol&quot; can't be made. Nor can one conclusively say what % of electrons went to electrodes, nor what the YATP is. If anything, the fact that the mix of lactate, acetate and ethanol do not shift dramatically to acetate production (which is typically the result of any system with an NADH sink, such as interspecies hydrogen transfer), is surprising and indicates something unexplained is going on.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer that the qualitative observations are quite surprising and that our quantitative calculations need to carefully state what uncertainties remain. We also believe that our calculations need to be considered in the context of the prior, extensive literature on <italic>L. plantarum</italic> fermentation (McFeeters and Chen, 1996 – <italic>Food Microb</italic>; Teusink <italic>et al.,</italic> 2006 – <italic>J Biol Chem):,</italic> (Teusink et al., 2009 – <italic>Plos Comp Biol</italic>).</p><p>Additional context to the changes made in the manuscript: our improved data (Table 1) now aligns with existing literature on <italic>L. plantarum,</italic> allowing us to make quantitative assessments of changes in ATP and NADH. Specifically, our findings now have carbon recoveries (~80%) within 10% of previous studies of <italic>L. plantarum</italic> metabolism (~90-105%, see references below). Additionally, our studies probe the same spectrum of metabolites found in these prior studies. with the sole exception of CO<sub>2</sub> (CO<sub>2</sub> cannot be measured using our existing bioelectrochemical reactors, since they are not gas-tight). Because CO<sub>2</sub> production does not regenerate NADH or produce ATP, the lack of CO<sub>2</sub> accounting will not affect ATP or NADH balances. Thus, the conclusions we draw about quantifying ATP generated by substrate-level phosphorylation aligns with other quantitative conclusions from prior work on <italic>L. plantarum</italic> metabolism (Dirar and Collins, 1972 – <italic>J Gen Microbiol</italic>).</p><p>In response to the Reviewer’s comment, we now use two different sets of assumptions to NADH generation and present the resulting values as a range of NADH regeneration. As described in Supplementary file 1, Method 1 uses the concentration of metabolites to calculate NADH production, essentially assuming that all NADH production stems from production of metabolites. Because it does not include NADH produced from mannitol consumption directed towards biosynthesis or other unidentified fermentation products, Method 1 likely underestimates total NADH produced, leading to higher values of NADH regeneration. Conversely, Method 2 estimates the NADH produced from mannitol consumption, essentially assuming that NADH is produced whenever mannitol is consumed. Since mannitol consumption may lead to biosynthesis or unidentified fermentation products without NADH generation, Method 2 likely overestimates the total NADH produced, leading to lower NADH regeneration values. In light of this uncertainty, we now use both Methods and present a range for NADH regeneration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Again, the lack of a carbon balance takes nothing away from qualitative conclusion that mannitol electrons are diverted to EET, or the strength of the EET evidence. The electrons at the electrode or in the iron are real and countable, this just limits the quantitative statements that can be made.</p></disp-quote><p>We recognize that our measurements do not account for all the carbon, however, in the revised manuscript, these quantitative uncertainties are now limited to ~20% because of the much improved carbon and electron balance. To address the Reviewer’s concern, we have now indicated the limited extent of these uncertainties in the manuscript (lines 363-365).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) L136; Reported Geobacter current densities easily reach 1000 µA/cm2 for flat surfaces, not 100-200.</p></disp-quote><p>Following Reviewer #2’s suggestion, we now compare the current production of different species normalized per g of protein biomass (line 140-145).

Appropriate for supplements, but not conclusive as is.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide background and justification for our use of ORP experiments (lines 213-217). Extracellular redox potential is also referred to as oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), which is the ratio of all oxidative to reductive components in the environment (Killeen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018 – Am. J. Enol. Vitic.). Redox reactions are prevalent in food fermentations (see Hansen, 2018 – Curr. Op. Food. Sci. for a comprehensive list) and ORP directly influences the outcome of fermentations with lactic acid bacteria (Brasca <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007 – J. App. Micro., Olsen and Pérez-Díaz 2009 – J. Food Sci.).</p><p>A) Already after one hour incubation in mMRS there was a significant difference in ORP between the wild-type and <italic>ndh2</italic> deletion mutant. This change was also observable for the <italic>pplA</italic> deletion mutant after three hours incubation. ORP differences between the wild-type and the two mutant strains persisted for the duration of the experiment. Additionally, we note that other factors besides EET will affect ORP. Although our new data show that DHNA, and therefore EET capacity, is a major driver of ORP reduction, <italic>L. plantarum</italic> and related bacteria (e.g. <italic>L. lactis</italic>) possess NADH oxidase and therefore are able to reduce O<sub>2</sub>, thereby also contributing to ORP reduction (Tachon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010 – App. and Env. Micro). Hence, although we expect that iron was reduced by the wild-type <italic>L. plantarum</italic> strain, it was not the only redox active compound. We revised the text (lines 219-228) and Figure 3B to clarify these distinctions.</p><p>B) pH values along with the experimental data collected in response to comment C (below), have been added to a new Figure 3 – supplement figure 1. The culture medium pH was identical between the wild-type and mutant strains. Therefore, it is very unlikely that pH alone accounts for the differences in the observed ORP values.</p><p>C) We appreciate the Reviewer’s suggestion of including a control group lacking DHNA. We performed that experiment and the results are included as Figure 3 – supplement figure 1. As expected, the absence of DHNA during <italic>L. plantarum</italic> growth led to significantly higher ORP values.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) An idea regarding the ∆pplA phenotype-the two conditions require EET, but iron oxides should be lower potential acceptors than the anode which is poised at a high driving force of &gt;+400 mV. The anode is plenty high to oxidize something like DHNA (E{degree sign}' ~70 mV) or chelated metals. PplA could be more necessary near the low potential of flavins. The supplied data can't be used to compare the effect of specific riboflavin concentrations on iron reduction rates (only extents) vs current production rates, but it might be available.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer that <italic>L. plantarum</italic> likely uses different mechanisms and proteins for EET depending on the redox potential of the extracellular electron acceptor. Indeed, PplA uses FMN as its redox co-factor (E<sub>0</sub><italic>’</italic> ~-150 mV and -350 mV), and so it may only reduce electron acceptors with lower potentials (for ferrihydrite E<sub>0</sub><italic>’</italic> ~ -100 mV -+100 mV). We also believe that the mechanisms and proteins for EET depend on the prior growth conditions for <italic>L. plantarum</italic> before addition of the extracellular electron acceptor. In the revised manuscript, we provide these hypotheses and indicate that testing them is the subject of future work in our laboratories (lines 551-553).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Line 311, More data would be needed to use succinate production as evidence for or against respiration. A mol of pyruvate could be excreted as succinate due to TCA cycle oxidation (indicating respiration), manifesting as excess electrons relative to the amount of succinate produced (as additional pyruvate would have to be used to make OAA). Conversely, succinate could be due to electron disposal via a reductive pathway (indicating fermentation). Lacking good carbon or electron recovery, neither can be ruled out, though the non-respiratory reductive pathway is most logical.</p></disp-quote><p>While the Reviewer’s reasoning is sound, <italic>L. plantarum,</italic> like other lactic acid bacteria, only possesses the reductive branch of the TCA cycle; it does not possess an oxidative branch (Tsuji et al., 2013 – <italic>Enzyme Microb Technol</italic>). Thus, we can rule out the possibility of TCA cycle oxidation, leaving the reductive branch as the only way to produce succinate. In agreement with the prior literature, we detected only trace amounts of succinate amongst the many TCA cycle metabolites we looked for: succinate, fumarate, oxaloacetate, citrate, malate. Thus, we are confident that the metabolic flux through the reductive branch of the TCA cycle was marginal, if present. In the revised manuscript, we now explain that <italic>L. plantarum</italic> does not possess an oxidative branch of the TCA cycle and that our measurements were sensitive to, but did not detect, these other TCA cycle intermediates (lines 308-310 and 312-314).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Table 1/line 403-: The low YATP in cells using EET is a possible 'different energy conversion strategy'. (Side note- an energy spilling/Russell mechanism would be an 'ATP-dissipating', not -accumulating). I'd suggest uncoupling of acid production from growth by low pH seems likely. In most strains, simple glycolytic pathway functions at low external pH, but complex protein synthesis and replication processes become inhibited, ATP from substrate turnover is needed to maintain pmf and internal pH, and high internal organic acids become toxic. Citable yield/pH data can be hard to locate as it comes from the 80's in the age of calling every lactic acid bacterium a Streptococcus, but since the non-EET cultures at neutral pH got close to the Bauchop and Elsden YATP, and EET cultures at pH 4 were a fraction of this, these data look like common behaviour of many lactic acid bacteria. In future comparisons, pH control could help estimate energy yields from EET. The first paper I found in a quick search to illustrate pH effects was: Russell and Dombrowski, DOI: 10.1128/aem.39.3.604-610.1980.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for these insights. We removed the energy-spilling reference from the manuscript. Since our data shows that final biomass is not affected by EET whereas energy conservation is, it seems likely that growth is not strongly coupled to energy conservation under EET conditions. We strongly agree with the Reviewer’s suggestion that the low pH under EET conditions may uncouple ATP generation and growth. We also hypothesize that this ATP produced from substrate-level phosphorylation might be used to create proton motive force to maintain intracellular pH and biosynthetic functions. We have included this hypothesis in the main manuscript (lines 406-409).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The value for Geobacter ATP/substrate yield in Table S2 seemed very high. Mahadevan says Geobacter produces 0.5 mol ATP/mol acetate when using extracellular acceptors (3x higher when using internal acceptors like fumarate). If I understand the adjustment for 6-carbon compounds, would this make the value for Geobacter using EET to be 1.5 mol ATP/mol 6-C substrate?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this correction. We incorrectly provided the thermodynamic boundary for the ATP/substrate yield from the referenced study.

Does the work presented actually support 'energy conservation'? Growth seems to occur after EET activity takes place rather than with it as discussed below.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer that a broad scientific audience will find the FLEET acronym confusing and have eliminated it from the manuscript.</p><p>The Reviewer also questions whether our findings indicate that EET supports energy conservation in <italic>L. plantarum</italic>. In biochemistry, energy conservation is defined as the conversion of light or chemical energy into cellular energy in the form of ATP by an organism (Russell and Cook 1995 – <italic>Microbiol Rev</italic>). In rapidly dividing cells, energy conservation, a catabolic process, is associated with growth, an anabolic process. However, catabolism need not be coupled with anabolism, and energy conservation can still occur in cells that are not rapidly dividing, e.g. in resting cell suspensions (Russell and Cook 1995 – <italic>Microbiol Rev</italic>).</p><p>In <italic>L. plantarum</italic>, EET increases the rate at which chemical energy (in mannitol) is converted to cellular energy (in ATP) per cell by ~1.75-fold (Figure 5C), indicating that EET increases the rate of energy conversation per cell. EET increases the amount of cellular energy obtained per chemical energy (Y<sub>mannitol</sub>) (Table 1) by ~1.75-fold, indicating that EET is also a more efficient energy conservation strategy in <italic>L. plantarum</italic>.</p><p>To understand how the anabolic process of energy conservation is coupled to the catabolic process of growth, we can compare changes in ATP to changes in biomass. At the start of EET, increased ATP levels are accompanied by a significant shortening of lag phase (Figures 1C, 4C). Since lag phase is the period microorganisms use to accumulate ATP for exponential growth, this shortened period suggests catabolic and anabolic processes are well coupled at this stage. However, by stationary phase, the biomass yield (Table 1) decreased under EET conditions, suggesting a much poorer coupling of catabolic and anabolic processes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 27 – 'fermentation yield' referring to biomass yield or fermentation product yield?</p></disp-quote><p>The text was revised to clarity that ‘fermentation product yield’ is being discussed here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 29, Line 45, Line 75, Line 86, Line 479 – blending fermentation and respiration has been known for over a decade in Shewanella (see Hunt et al., 2010, JBact).

As a counterpoint to the prior observation that substrate-level phosphorylation is the major energy conservation strategy during anaerobic fumarate reduction in a non-fermentative organism (<italic>S. oneidensis</italic>), our work demonstrates that a blending of fermentation and respiration occurs during reduction of solid electron acceptors in a primarily fermentative organism (<italic>L. plantarum</italic>) (lines 28-30, 525-527). Going beyond prior qualitative observations, we show that this hybrid metabolism leads to ~1.75x-more efficient and ~1.75x-faster energy conservation (Y<sub>mannitol</sub>, mannitol flux), but an overall ~1.5-fold weaker coupling between anabolism and catabolism (lower biomass yield). Additionally, we discover that this hybrid metabolism substantially affects the intracellular redox state and show redox change arises from a ~2:1 use of endogenous to extracellular electron acceptors.

While ICP-MS cannot spatially resolve iron that is intracellular vs. extracellular, we removed surface-associated metals by washing the cells twice in PBS before performing ICP-MS.

In addition, these two metals are not expected to be redox-active metals for EET.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 262 – does this mean a large amount of the cells that grew are now dead?</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer makes an interesting observation. Indeed, the combination of a 4-fold increase in dry weight and only 2-fold increase in viable cells may indicate that a fraction of the biomass was dead or not metabolically active enough to form a colony at the time point sampled. In support of this idea, our measurements of cell density by OD<sub>600</sub> suggest that cells reach stationary phase shortly after reaching maximum current density. Additionally, shortly after maximum current density (after day 2, Figure 3C), the rates of mannitol consumption, lactate production, and ethanol production decrease (Figure 4). Thus, we hypothesize that at the point of maximum current density, when dry weight and CFU measurements were taken, the cells are entering stationary phase and a fraction of them are metabolically inactive or dead. In the revised manuscript, we point out that this discrepancy could be due to the increased acid stress on <italic>L. plantarum</italic> resulting from EET condition (lines 337-340).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4 (and Figure 1) – I don't understand why maximum current output is completely decoupled from when biomass spikes. At 24h (maximum current), basically no growth has occurred. At 2 days and 5 days, when biomass is the greatest (in the WT culture), very little current is produced. This seems like direct evidence that EET is not coupled with metabolism in these bacteria. The ATP measurements were made at 24h, where OD of the mutant is decreasing (thus less ATP would be expected). Same issue with NAD/NADH measurement.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for introducing confusion here, which stemmed from a lack of clarity about which current density and biochemical measurements were from different experiments. We have clarified in the Figure Legends that the same set of experiments yielded the current density plots in Figure 3 and the metabolite and pH measurements shown in Figure 5. We have also clarified that another set of experiments were used to generate the current density shown in Figure 1C and the ATP and NAD/NADH ratios shown in Figure 4.</p><p>Comparison of the data shown in Figure 1C and 4C show maximum current is closely followed by maximum OD. After one day, the current density has reached its maximum, but no significant increase in planktonic biomass was observed. Between day one and day two, lower but significant current is produced, the cell density reaches ~90% of its maximum, and the consumption of mannitol and production of lactate also increases dramatically. Overall, these observations show that current production is followed by increases in growth and metabolic flux. We hypothesize that the delay observed between current production and the boost in growth and metabolites could be the time cells need to accumulate ATP and compounds needed to enter exponential growth (now included on lines 274-278). In future experiments, we seek to more precisely relate current produced and growth by continuously monitoring of <italic>L. plantarum</italic> cell density under EET conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4C – Lines are undefined in the figure legend.

In Figure 4, we probed how EET in <italic>L. plantarum</italic> affected growth, ATP and intracellular redox state. To show this connection, we chose to measure ATP and NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH when EET rate is maximum (maximum current density). These measurements show that energy metabolism is greatly accelerated and changed by EET: cells exhibit higher viability, biomass and ATP accumulation and maintain a higher NAD+/NADH ratio. We agree that performing those measurements at other time points would provide a more dynamic picture of the relationship between EET, energy conservation and redox balancing. Our laboratories will address these questions in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 465 – Description of the experiment setup in 2B does not include addition of flavins for the iron reduction assay, so it is unclear why the authors claim that both flavins and quinones are necessary for EET in diverse LAB species.</p></disp-quote><p>We included both flavins and quinones in this statement because we show that flavins are required for EET in Figure 1—figure supplement 1D and Figure 1—figure supplement 2D. Flavins are required as cofactors for Ndh2 (as FAD – see Heikal et al., 2014 – Mol Micro) and PplA (as FMN – see Light et al., 2018 – Nature). <italic>L. plantarum</italic> and several other LAB which we found to be EET-active are auxotrophic for riboflavin (Burgess et al., 2004 – <italic>Appl Environ Microbio</italic>) so riboflavin was already supplemented in the growth medium as the vitamin itself (in CDM) or within yeast extract (in MRS). In the iron reduction assay, cells are metabolically active, but not growing, and would have sufficient holo-Ndh2 and holo-PplA carried over from their growth medium to perform EET. This is supported by new data in Figure 1figure supplement 1E where additional riboflavin supplementation into mMRS did not increase subsequent iron reduction. As such, we decided to not include riboflavin in the iron reduction assay used for Figure 2B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 473 – Iron and electrode reduction is dependent on addition of DHNA.

It would help if some of the detail about L. plantarum metabolism (such as lines 318-321, 553-555) was moved from the results/discussion to the introduction. If L. plantarum is able to grow via respiration (as suggested in lines 304-308), this should also be mentioned in the introduction. The introduction should also be revised to ensure that terms are used unambiguously and to remove inaccurate generalizations. Some examples are given in the comments below.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the Reviewer’s suggestions regarding the introduction. Regarding the question of providing additional background on <italic>L. plantarum</italic> and LAB metabolism, the Introduction text (lines 55-71 and 97-104) has been revised to incorporate definitions of homofermentation and heterofermentation as well as stating that <italic>L. plantarum</italic> is primarily homofermentative but also a respiratory-capable LAB.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is not totally accurate to say that energy per se is generated or created during metabolism. The authors should revise these statements to say that energy is obtained or conserved or that ATP is generated.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer. We have carefully revised the manuscript to consistently use the term ‘energy conservation.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This paper discusses detailed metabolic pathways and the terms used to describe these pathways should be used carefully and precisely to avoid confusion for the reader. For instance, the authors should precisely define “substrate-level phosphorylation” and “fermentation” and should not use these terms interchangeably. “Substrate-level phosphorylation” refers to a reaction that generates ATP directly, without the use of the proton motive force and the membrane-associated ATP synthase enzyme. “Fermentation” refers to the pathways that restore the NAD+/NADH ratio and allow growth with substrate-level phosphorylation as the sole mechanism of ATP generation.</p></disp-quote><p>Per the Reviewer’s helpful suggestion, the Introduction text has been revised to define substrate-level phosphorylation and fermentation (lines 50-54).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 50-51 and 373-374: Some organic compounds can also be respired (for example fumarate).</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer is correct here. The introduction (lines 41-49) includes a broad definition of anaerobic respiration, which includes using both organic and inorganic compounds. We acknowledge that the original text (lines 373-374) may lead the reader to think that respiration is only associated with the use of inorganic electron acceptors. To avoid this confusion, we now state that another major difference in fermentation and anaerobic respiration is the use of the endogenous versus external organic electron acceptors (lines 377-378).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 51-52 should say “Fermentative bacteria produce ATP solely via substrate-level phosphorylation” because substrate-level phosphorylation also occurs when bacteria are growing by respiration (i.e., in glycolysis).</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised this sentence (lines 50-52). Instead of using the word ‘solely’, we prefer to employ the word ‘mainly’ since ATP can also be generated via respiration in some primarily fermentative bacteria, like lactic acid bacteria, under specific conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 71-73: It is unclear how the property of being “exergonic” or “endergonic” is relevant in the context here.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer that providing these details is not relevant and have removed them.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 85-86: “…EET is associated with non-fermentative respiratory organisms…” Does this refer specifically to endogenous EET (i.e., without an added mediator?). This should be clarified because there is a long history of research on fermentation+EET in the presence of added mediators (see next comment).</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer makes a good point, and we revised the sentence to clarify that we are describing that endogenous EET is mainly associated with respiratory species.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to the above point: In the introduction or discussion, the authors should mention or acknowledge other work examining how growth in the presence of an electrode affects fermentative metabolisms.

Were the conditions the same for these two experiments? If so, an explanation should be added to the text.</p></disp-quote><p>The conditions differed between Figures 1A and 3A. The iron reduction assay results shown in Figure 1A were obtained for <italic>L. plantarum</italic> after growth in mMRS. The results shown in Figure 3A were obtained after <italic>L. plantarum</italic> growth in mMRS supplemented with DHNA and ferric ammonium citrate. The inclusion of DHNA and ferric ammonium citrate in the mMRS growth medium was found to result in increased <italic>L. plantarum</italic> EET activity (data previously in Figure 2—figure supplement 2C). To clarify the rationale for the change in mMRS growth medium, we moved that supporting data to Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and revised the Results section to better describe these results and how they influenced our experimental methods (lines 123-133).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 104-106: Can DHNA itself be used as an electron shuttle? This should be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, DHNA can be used as an electron shuttle (Mevers, 2018 — <italic>eLife</italic>; Glasser NR et al., 2017 – Annu Rev Microbiol). DHNA can also be synthesized into menaquinone or demethylmenaquinone, which can transfer electrons in an electron transfer chain. However, our current data does not allow us to assess which of these roles DHNA is playing. Future work will elucidate the role of DHNA and flavins in EET in <italic>L. plantarum</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 137: Where the authors compare current density capacity for L. plantarum to that of S. oneidensis—are the quoted values for S. oneidensis using (an) endogenously produced shuttle(s), or are they for S. oneidensis + (an) added shuttle(s)? This should be clarified, because L. plantarum has no current density capacity without added DHNA.</p></disp-quote><p>We revised the comparison of EET among species to indicate that, unlike <italic>L. plantarum</italic>, <italic>Shewanella oneidensis</italic> and <italic>Geobacter sulfurreducens</italic> can synthesize riboflavin and quinones and do not require the addition of either for EET activity (lines 146-147).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 139: “current production was not dependent on the carbon source or growth medium, and current increased after supplementation of riboflavin in the growth medium”. Both of these claims are hard to evaluate because the plots in figure 1 and figure1—figure supplement 2 are shown for different lengths of time, different carbon sources (electron donors), and different media. To make it easier for the reader to compare, it would help to have the name of the medium as a title for each current density plot.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the lack of clarity here and have revised the text to more accurately convey our point (lines 148-152). Our intention is to qualitatively, rather than quantitatively, evaluate current production with different media. We have followed the Reviewer’s suggestion and added a title for each plot of Figure 1—figure supplement 2 to make it easier for the reader to understand the medium used.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To judge whether riboflavin truly increases current, we should compare figure 1c to figure 1—figure supplement 2D. In figure 1c, with no riboflavin added, current increases to ~120 uA/cm2 at around 1 day. In the supplemental figure, this increase is not seen until after riboflavin is added. Without a control, it is hard to know whether this increase was dependent on the riboflavin addition.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer on this point. We provide additional data in Figure 1—figure supplement 2D that includes a control in which riboflavin was not added. This control shows that the increase in current is due to the addition of riboflavin.</p><p>Except for Figure 1—figure supplement 2D, all the experiments performed in bioelectrochemical reactors contain riboflavin in the media (as part of the vitamin stock solution in the CDM). This is now explained in the manuscript text (lines 148-152).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 154: Please define homofermentative.</p></disp-quote><p>The Introduction text has been revised to include definitions of both homofermentation and heterofermentation (lines 60-64).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 160: “the percentage of” should be removed</p></disp-quote><p>The legend text of Figure 2 has been revised to incorporate this suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2—figure supplement 2C: I am confused about how this experiment controls for the possibility that reduction of soluble iron (i.e., the ferric ammonium citrate ), which wouldn’t necessarily require EET, contributes to the higher levels of ferrous iron observed when DHNA and ferric ammonium citrate are both added. Maybe a control with no ferrihydrite added would tell us whether ferric ammonium citrate is being reduced.</p></disp-quote><p>Prior to performing the ferrihydrite reduction assay, the cells were washed twice (in PBS), thereby removing any ferric ammonium citrate that was present in the mMRS growth medium (line 744). Moreover, there was very little color change in the ferrihydrite reduction assay when wild-type <italic>L. plantarum</italic> was grown in mMRS containing ferric ammonium citrate but not DHNA (noting that DHNA was still included in the ferrihydrite assay medium) (Figure 2—figure supplement 2C). Therefore, our data show that ferric ammonium citrate is not contributing to the color formation in the ferrihydrite reduction assay. Additionally, we agree that it is notable how <italic>L. plantarum</italic> exposure to DNHA and ferric ammonium citrate during growth results in an improved capacity for that organism to reduce extracellular ferrihydrite and that the expression of <italic>ndh2</italic> and <italic>pplA</italic> is induced under those conditions (lines 199-206).
