An important factor in animal evolution was the increasing ocean oxygen levels in the Precambrian, which are thought to have influenced the emergence of complex multicellular life. As a first step in addressing these conditions, we study here the response of the colony-forming choanoflagellate <italic>Salpingoeca rosetta</italic> to oxygen gradients. Using a microfluidic device that allows spatio-temporal variations in oxygen concentrations, we report the discovery that <italic>S. rosetta</italic> displays positive aerotaxis. Analysis of the spatial population distributions provides evidence for logarithmic sensing of oxygen, which enhances sensing in low oxygen neighborhoods. Analysis of search strategy models on the experimental colony trajectories finds that choanoflagellate aerotaxis is consistent with stochastic navigation, the statistics of which are captured using an effective continuous version based on classical run-and-tumble chemotaxis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18109.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18109.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18109.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most animals are made up of millions of cells, yet all animals evolved from ancestors that spent their whole lives as single cells. Today the closest single-celled relatives of animals are a group of aquatic organisms called choanoflagellates. Certain species of choanoflagellates can also form swimming colonies. This kind of multicellularity might resemble that seen in the earliest of animals. As such, studies into modern-day choanoflagellates can give insights into how the first animals to evolve might have behaved.</p><p>Many organisms can find their way towards favorable areas using different strategies. For instance, bacteria can bias their tumbling to gradually swim towards food, and algae can turn and move directly towards light. While choanoflagellates require oxygen, it was not known if they could also actively navigate towards it, or any other resource.</p><p>Now, Kirkegaard et al. find that the choanoflagellate <italic>Salpingoeca rosetta</italic> can indeed navigate towards oxygen – an ability called aerotaxis. This was true for both individual cells and for colonies made up of many cells. This discovery suggests that the transition from living as a single cell to living as a simple multicellular organism could still have allowed the earliest animals to seek out and move towards resource-rich areas.</p><p>Aerotaxis requires cells to both sense oxygen and react appropriately to changes in its concentration. Kirkegaard et al. watched choanoflagellate colonies swimming under controlled conditions and varied the oxygen concentration in the water over time. These experiments revealed that the colonies navigate based on the logarithm of the oxygen concentration, so that at low oxygen levels the cells were even more sensitive to small changes in oxygen concentration. This type of ‘logarithmic sensing’ is similar to how our ears sense sounds and our eyes sense light. Kirkegaard et al. went on to conclude that the colonies were not actively steering in the correct direction directly. Instead, the colonies appeared to choose directions at random and later decide whether such a turn was correct.</p><p>It remains unclear whether the common ancestor of animals and choanoflagellates could also perform aerotaxis, and if so what mechanisms this involved. Further studies to compare aerotaxis and aerotaxis-related genes in simple animals and other single-celled relatives of animals would be needed to illuminate this. Future studies could also explore the maximum and minimum oxygen concentrations that choanoflagellates can detect, and how well they navigate at these upper and lower limits.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18109.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18109.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>choanoflagellates</kwd><kwd>aerotaxis</kwd><kwd><italic>S. rosetta</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>247333</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bouillant</surname><given-names>Ambre</given-names></name><name><surname>Marron</surname><given-names>Alan O</given-names></name><name><surname>Goldstein</surname><given-names>Raymond E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>097855</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marron</surname><given-names>Alan O</given-names></name><name><surname>Leptos</surname><given-names>Kyriacos C</given-names></name><name><surname>Goldstein</surname><given-names>Raymond E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000266</institution-id><institution>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EP/M017982/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kirkegaard</surname><given-names>Julius B</given-names></name><name><surname>Goldstein</surname><given-names>Raymond E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The colony-forming choanoflagellate <italic>Salpingoeca rosetta</italic> is capable of moving towards oxygen using logarithmic sensing of oxygen concentrations and a navigation strategy that involves random movements.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Taxis</italic>, the physical migration towards preferred or away from undesired conditions, is a feature shared by virtually all motile organisms. Taxis comes in many forms, and in common is an underlying field of attractant (or repellent) and an ability to react and navigate along gradients of this field. Bacteria do <italic>chemotaxis</italic> towards nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adler, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berg, 1993</xref>) and away from toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tso and Adler, 1974</xref>). Algae do <italic>phototaxis</italic> towards light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yoshimura and Kamiya, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Drescher et al., 2010</xref>) and <italic>gyrotaxis</italic> along gravitational potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kessler, 1985</xref>). Chemotaxis provides a mechanism for the recognition and attraction of gametes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vogel et al., 1982</xref>) and for complex behavioural patterns such as in the slime mould <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic>, where cAMP-driven chemotaxis is a critical part of the formation of the multicellular stage of the life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonner, 1947</xref>). Aerotaxis, defined as oxygen-dependent migration, is well-characterized in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Taylor et al., 1999</xref>), but is poorly studied in more complex organisms. This is despite the essentiality of oxygen for all aerobic life, and the important role that Precambrian oxygen levels played in the emergence and evolution of multicellular animal life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nursall, 1959</xref>).</p><p>One group of aquatic heterotrophic protists, the choanoflagellates, are of particular interest for the study of how multicellularity evolved. Choanoflagellates are a class of unicellular microorganisms that are the closest relatives of the animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lang et al., 2002</xref>). This relationship was first proposed by James-Clark in 1866 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">James-Clark, 1866</xref>), on the basis of the resemblance between choanoflagellates and the choanocytes of sponges. The sister relationship between choanoflagellates and animals was further confirmed in the genomic era by molecular evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">King et al., 2008</xref>). All choanoflagellates share the same basic unicell structure: a prolate cell body with a single beating flagellum that is surrounded by a collar of microvilli. The beating of the flagellum creates a current in the surrounding fluid that guides suspended prey such as bacteria through the collar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pettitt and Orme, 2002</xref>) where they can be caught and ultimately phagocytosed. The flagellar current also has the effect of causing the choanoflagellate cell to swim.</p><p>The choanoflagellate <italic>Salpingoeca rosetta</italic> can form colonies through incomplete cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fairclough et al., 2010</xref>). In the presence of certain bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dayel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Levin et al., 2014</xref>), these colonies have an eponymous rosette-like shape as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. The colony morphology is variable, and the constituent flagella beat independently of one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kirkegaard et al., 2016</xref>). The random and independent flagellar motion argues against there being any coordination between cells in a colony, and as yet no evidence of any form of taxis for choanoflagellate colonies has been reported.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18109.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Micrograph of <italic>S. rosetta</italic> colonies (left) with schematic illustration (right, collars in blue).</title><p>Scale bar: 50 µm.

Phototaxis is clearly observable in both unicellular (<italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yoshimura and Kamiya, 2001</xref>) and colonial (<italic>Volvox</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Drescher et al., 2010</xref>) species, in order to maintain optimum light levels for photosynthesis. Volvocalean phototaxis is <italic>deterministic</italic>, requiring precise tuning between the internal biochemical timescales and the rotation period of the organism as a whole. Although <italic>S. rosetta</italic> colonies also rotate around an internal axis, due to the variable colony morphology and the independent beating of the individual flagella, this rotation rate will itself be random (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kirkegaard et al., 2016</xref>), rendering a strategy similar to that of the Volvocales unlikely in <italic>S. rosetta</italic>.</p><p>An alternative strategy is <italic>stochastic</italic> taxis, sometimes referred to as kinesis. The classic example of stochastic taxis is the run-and-tumble chemotaxis of certain peritrichous bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berg, 1993</xref>). By spinning their left-handed helical flagella in different directions, such bacteria can alternate between swimming in straight lines (running) and randomly reorienting themselves (tumbling). Through biasing tumbles to be less frequent when going up the gradient, the bacteria exhibit biased motion towards a chemoattractant without directly steering towards it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berg, 1993</xref>).</p><p>Here, we study <italic>S. rosetta</italic> and show that it exhibits aerotaxis, <italic>i.e.</italic> navigation along gradients of oxygen. We further examine and statistically analyse aerotaxis of <italic>S. rosetta</italic> colonies under spatio-temporal variations of oxygen at the level of total colony populations and at the level of the trajectories of individual colonies. From these experiments we establish two key features of the aerotactic response of choanoflagellates: they employ a stochastic reorientation search strategy and the sensing of oxygen concentration gradients is logarithmic. Finally, we render these results quantitative through the use of mathematical analysis of a modified Keller-Segel model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Keller and Segel, 1971</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experimental set-up</title><p>The study of aerotaxis in bacteria has led to numerous methods for creating spatial oxygen gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shioi et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wong et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhulin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Taylor et al., 1999</xref>), one of which is the exploitation of soft lithography techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rusconi et al., 2014</xref>). Since PDMS, the most commonly used material for microfluidic chambers, is permeable to gases, gas channels can be introduced in the devices to allow gaseous species to diffuse into the fluid. For example, an oxygen gradient can be created using a source channel flowing with normal air and a sink channel flowing with pure nitrogen.</p><p>Our device, shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, is a modified version of that used by Adler, <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adler et al., 2012</xref>). Viewed from above, the sample channel (yellow) consists of a wide observation chamber with thin inlet and outlet channels. The outlet leads to a serpentine channel that hinders bulk fluid flows. On each side of the sample channel are gas channels, the inlets of which are connected to a valve system allowing for the flow of air (20% oxygen) and nitrogen. The flow of air and nitrogen can be conducted in any combination and configuration, <italic>e.g.</italic> oxygen in one channel and nitrogen in the other, and can be easily swapped over. The PDMS chamber is plasma etched to a glass slide, and an extra glass slide is etched on top of the device, preventing air from diffusing in from the surrounding environment.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18109.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Microfluidic device.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Top view of the device.

In the time after a gas channel swap, the slope of the maximum density reveals the ensemble drift velocity <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf7"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">d</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">f</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>. When there is oxygen in both gas channels, we observe that the density reaches an approximately uniform distribution within the time frame of the experiment. For periods in which nitrogen flows in both channels, this is not the case. Under these experimental conditions, the colonies accumulate in the middle of the chamber, where there is still some residual oxygen, as further shown in <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>. The fact that in this nitrogen-only configuration the colonies accumulate mid-chamber shows that accumulation does not depend on the presence of a nearby surface. With only nitrogen flowing, eventually there will be no oxygen gradient. Nonetheless, we observed the colonies to stay in the middle of chamber even after 90 min (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). At that time, the highest oxygen levels are estimated by the diffusion equation to be less than ~0.2%.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-18109-media1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18109.007</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental videos of aerotaxis (top) and oxygen gas simulation (bottom) (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</title><p>Experimental videos are colored by the output of the gas simulation.

In both strategies the swimming organism measures the attractant gradient (for small organisms by some temporal filter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Block et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Celani and Vergassola, 2010</xref>]). A deterministic strategy, then, is one in which the organism directly steers towards the attractant, such as seen in sperm cells that modulate their flagellar beat to adjust directly the curvature and torsion of its swimming path in the gradient direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Friedrich and Jülicher, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jikeli et al., 2015</xref>). Contrasting is a stochastic strategy such as bacterial run-and-tumble locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berg, 1993</xref>), where modulation of the frequency of random reorientations biases the motion in the gradient direction without directly steering towards it.</p><p>One simple method of taxis results from an organism swimming faster when it is moving up the gradient, creating an overall bias towards the attractant.

The cells navigate along relative oxygen gradients and the navigation strategy is stochastic in nature, achieved by modulating not speed but direction of swimming.</p><p>The experimental observation that choanoflagellates are aerotactic raises a number of questions. One concerns the actual sensing mechanism, and how this compares to those of animals, given the close evolutionary relationship between choanoflagellates and metazoans. In animals, oxygen concentrations can be sensed by the highly-conserved hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) transcription factor pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Loenarz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kaelin and Ratcliffe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rytkönen et al., 2011</xref>). At normal oxygen levels, the activity of specific prolyl-hydroxylase (PHD) enzymes labels the HIF protein complexes for degradation. At low oxygen levels, however, PHD activity is inhibited, leading to elevated HIF levels. The transcription factor activity of HIF up-regulates expression of genes involved in hypoxia response (e.g. glycolysis enzymes) for survival in low-oxygen conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Greer et al., 2012</xref>). The genes involved in HIF signalling are widespread in metazoans, with evidence suggesting that some components of this pathway are descended from prokaryotic ancestors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Scotti et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Preliminary experiments involving exposing <italic>S. rosetta</italic> cultures to DMOG (an inhibitor of the prolyl-hydroxylase step in the HIF pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fong and Takeda, 2008</xref>]) had no observable effect on aerotaxis within our experimental system (data not shown). This is perhaps unsurprising, given that choanoflagellates lack some important components of the HIF pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rytkönen et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, the aerotactic response observed here is acute, within a timeframe on the order of seconds to minutes, rather than the being a longer-term response to lowered oxygen levels by modulation of gene expression. In certain aerotactic bacteria, it is known that oxygen concentrations are measured indirectly via energy-sensing, which can then influence the rotation of the bacterial flagella between running and tumbling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Taylor et al., 1999</xref>). An analogous mechanism may be at play in choanoflagellates, possibly via reactive oxygen species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cash et al., 2007</xref>) and oxygen-sensitive ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lahiri et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ward, 2008</xref>) modulating the beating rate of the flagella of each <italic>S. rosetta</italic> cell. Thus the question of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underpinning aerotaxis in choanoflagellates is a promising avenue for further research.</p><p>Oxygen is implicated as having an important influence on animal evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nursall, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lenton et al., 2014</xref>), with some hypotheses that the emergence of complex animal ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sperling et al., 2013</xref>) were only triggered when oxygen levels rose above certain thresholds. Sponges, believed to be the most basal animal group, were recently shown to have very low oxygen requirements, disputing the importance of oxygen in early animal evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mills et al., 2014</xref>). Our results raise the possibility that the common ancestor from which choanoflagellates and animals evolved was aerotactic, and that oxygen sensing and responding have thus been under strong selection throughout the holozoans. If the ancestors of animals and choanoflagellates were strongly aerotactic, this would be indicative of the importance of oxygen as a resource during the Precambrian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lyons et al., 2014</xref>). Equally, it could be the case that choanoflagellates themselves have evolved aerotaxis after the split from the animal stem lineage. To answer this question, the oxygen requirements and aerotactic capabilities of other opisthokont groups, e.g. ichthyosporeans, filasterians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ruiz-Trillo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sebé-Pedrós et al., 2013</xref>), as well as basal animals such as sponges, ctenophores and placozoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dunn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ryan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pisani et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Whelan et al., 2015</xref>), requires investigation. Such an analysis can be further complimented by determining the oxygen sensing and signalling mechanisms across the opisthokont phylogeny.</p><p>If aerotaxis was key to the ancestral unicellular holozoan, it is crucial that the evolution to multicellularity did not hinder this ability. Our experimental results show that both the unicellular and colonial morphotypes of <italic>S. rosetta</italic> can perform efficient aerotaxis and navigation in general, despite lacking coordination between the constituent cells of the colony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kirkegaard et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, an evolutionary transition to a multicellularity resembling the unicellular-to-colonial transition in <italic>S. rosetta</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dayel et al., 2011</xref>) would not require additional cell-cell communication mechanisms to coordinate navigation. Not only would this allow aerotaxis towards oxygen, but also taxis in response to other stimulants, such as bacterial signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Woznica et al., 2016</xref>). This is a particular feature of the stochastic navigation strategy, which works equally well for both single cells and colonies formed from multiple units of the same cells.</p><p>We have described the stochastic strategy of <italic>S. rosetta</italic> in terms of an effective model.

Flagella can be imaged on colonies stuck to the microscope slide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kirkegaard et al., 2016</xref>), but measuring directly the flagella modulation is challenging, since the oxygen changes that can be induced in a microfluidic device are on a time scale of minutes, whereas the flagella beating is on a time scale of tens of milliseconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kirkegaard et al., 2016</xref>). The swimming trajectories suggest that this modulation is a mixture of many types, ranging from slow to vigorous, as also seen in other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jikeli et al., 2015</xref>), but direct imaging is needed to make more quantitative statements.</p><p>We have shown that in spatio-temporal varying environments, considerations of population dynamics can distinguish between linear- and logarithmic-sensing mechanisms, and concluded that choanoflagellates do logarithmic sensing. The fact that conclusions of logarithmic sensing can be made from analysis of the population dynamics alone shows that individual tracks are not needed and thus allows for such analysis in dense experiments. Logarithmic sensing is a key attribute for survival: it allows sensing of and reacting to gradients in very low concentration environments, while still being able to effectively navigate along large gradients. Logarithmic sensing has also been experimentally observed for other species, <italic>e.g.</italic> bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mesibov et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kalinin et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>With logarithmic sensing, cells only navigate along oxygen gradients that are significant compared to the absolute concentration. This is a well-known phenomenon also from human behaviour, where, for instance, dim lights are seen only when it is dark and weak sounds heard only when it is quiet. It is known as Weber’s law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ross, 1996</xref>), which states that the magnitude of just-noticeable differences of a stimuli is proportional to the stimuli magnitude itself. This is closely related to the Weber-Fechner law, stating that stimuli magnitude grows logarithmically with the actual signal, which we have found to be in agreement with the experimental observation of <italic>S. rosetta</italic> aerotaxis.</p><p>For microorganisms, a Weber lower limit can be understood, at least partly, as a physical limitation. Because of thermal fluctuations, the error on any concentration gradient measurement increases with the local absolute concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berg and Purcell, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Endres and Wingreen, 2008</xref>), and thus it immediately follows that the limit of just-noticeable gradients must decrease with absolute concentration. Quantitatively, the noise scales as <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf91"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> in the absolute concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Endres and Wingreen, 2008</xref>). Such a scaling is not observed for bacteria’s just-noticeable limits, where instead Weber’s law hold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mesibov et al., 1973</xref>). Sensor adaptation enables the bacteria to have the linear scaling <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf92"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sourjik and Wingreen, 2012</xref>) leading to logarithmic sensing and high dynamic range, but it is nonetheless the case that for purely physical reasons a lower limit scaling with concentration must be present. The fitting of the Keller-Segel model to the population data were optimal precisely for relative gradient sensing. Sensing functionals such as <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf93"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">∇</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msqrt><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:msqrt></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> or <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf94"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">∇</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> only decreased the fit quality. This implies that Weber’s law and logarithmic sensing, at least to a good approximation, is occurring in chaonoflagellates. This scaling could be further studied by measuring the aerotactic response to an order-of-magnitude range of concentration gradients under a range of absolute concentrations. Precision control of gas mixtures would allow the extraction of any biological deviations from Weber’s law and potentially reveal a transition to the physical limit of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf95"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msqrt><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:msqrt></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> scaling for very low concentrations, <italic>i.e.</italic> at the limit of sensing.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Culturing <italic>S. rosetta</italic></title><p><italic>S. rosetta</italic> were cultured polyxenicly in artificial seawater (36.5 g/L Marin Salts [Tropic Marin, Germany]) with organic enrichment (4 g/L Proteose Peptone [Sigma-Aldrich, USA], 0.8 g/L Yeast Extract [Fluka Biochemika]) at 15 µl/mL<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf96"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">μ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, and grown at 23°C, split weekly.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Naama Barkai as the Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom, Richard M Berry (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript presents experimental evidence and theoretical modelling of the following:</p><p>1) Choanoflagellates, small colonial eukaryotes, show taxis towards oxygen.</p><p>2) Oxygen responses are proportional to relative rather than absolute oxygen gradients (logarithmic).</p><p>3) Taxis is achieved by modulation of swimming direction, not swimming speed.</p><p>4) Modulation of direction is stochastic, not deterministic.</p><p>The data are convincing, the modelling thorough and appropriate, and the conclusions sound.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The paper reads as written from a theoretical perspective, with the experimental data as an accessory. This needs to be reversed, the significance of the paper is in the experimental data. Results 1, 3 and 4 above are directly demonstrated by the data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> and 8B respectively, and this should not be hidden behind the modelling as it currently is. The asymmetry between all-air and all-nitrogen flows is also evident in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, and the inference of logarithmic sensing from this is simple to make without quantitative modelling. The data should be described and the inferences drawn, and the modelling relegated to its proper place as quantitative verification of the inferences that can be made directly from the data.</p><p>Correspondingly, the data and their analysis need to be described much more thoroughly. The algorithms for obtaining tracks need to be better described than the present &quot;Colonies were tracked using custom in-house software&quot;. Also, show some examples of tracks, and give statistics i.e. numbers of tracks used for each result presented, and any selection or other processing of tracks that was done. For example the Discussion states, &quot;The fact that such conclusions can be made from population dynamics alone allows similar analysis to be done in dense populations, where long individual tracking is not possible.&quot; – but nowhere in the manuscript is it possible to know whether current experiments were done under this condition or not!</p><p>2) The statement and discussion of the significance of the results needs to be altered and expanded.</p><p>At present, the entire paper is based on the premise that choanoflagellates are important to study, because, as the closest living unicellular relative of animals, they can provide unique insight into the origin of animal multicellularity. While this might be true, it is a tricky argument to make correctly, and many authors fall into the trap of assuming that choanoflagellates are representative of the actual ancestor of animals. To be clear, choanoflagellates are not representative of the actual ancestor of animals – they diverged from the actual ancestor of animals ~800 million years ago and have been changing (evolving!) all that time. Indeed, these authors make this mistake as well. In last sentence of the Discussion, they say &quot;Our results add to this discussion, in showing that their evolutionary precursors, the choanoflagellates, have evolved to navigate actively towards oxygen.&quot; The problem with this logic is that, of course, choanoflagellates are not the evolutionary precursor to animals- those are long extinct. Without looking at aerotaxis in a phylogenetic context, including many unicellular linages of opisthokonts, we don't know if this particular lineage of choanoflagellates evolved aerotaxis prior to the split with animals, when oxygen levels were a fraction of what they are today, or if they evolved it during the intervening ~800 million years. In fact, a trait like oxygen is a particularly poor candidate for the choanoflagellate-as-protoanimal comparison (in contrast to, say, a mechanism of cellular signaling that is highly conserved), since oxygen levels have changed dramatically during the period of time after which choanoflagellates split from the animal stem lineage, and the ability to respond to oxygen is almost certainly a trait that is under strong selection. Thus, while I completely believe the authors that modern-day <italic>S. rosetta</italic> is positively aerotactic, this work does not tell us anything about whether the ancestor of animals was aerotactic.</p><p>Instead, the multicellularity argument could be moderated and still be interesting. For example, while making it clear that this work does not tell us whether aerotaxis evolved prior to the origin of animals, it shows that it is a possibility. The authors should suggest how, with further experiments in phylogenetically diverse unicellular lineages diverging from the animal stem group, researchers could test this hypothesis using pretty standard phylogenetic tools.</p><p>They should also spend some energy in the Discussion explaining why it matters if the unicellular ancestor of animals is aerotactic. We already know that they were capable of aerobic metabolism – how would it change our view of animal multicellularity to know that they swim towards this key resource? Since they lose the intrinsic importance of a discovery (e.g., that the ancestor of animals was aerotactic), it is important to explain why the general idea is important.</p><p>One possibility might be that the importance lies in showing that a form of apparently disorganized multicellularity, which may or may not model early metazoan life, but models it as well as anything that we are aware of, is capable of any taxis. Although aerotaxis is relatively common, it is still surprising that <italic>S. rosetta</italic> can do it, because it does not coordinate its flagella (cf. the Volvocales, in which there is a lot of high profile work on e.g. phototaxis). This suggests possibilities for how early multicellularity may have worked.</p><p>3) Logarithmic sensing requires some simple explanation for non-mathematical readers. Simply put, response is proportional to relative rather than absolute concentration gradient. This result requires more discussion. Give more examples of logarithmic sensing from literature. Are there any exceptions, where sensing is linear, or is logarithmic sensing universal?</p><p>4) The entire evidence for the logarithmic response is the persistence of a band of choanoflagellates in the center of the device as oxygen is slowly depleted. This one observation is interpreted a quite complicated model, which has some parametric freedom (although the model fitting is well justified and reasonable). Can one design a different control experiment in which logarithmically sensing cells are predicted to behave differently than cells that have the flux-response given in Equation (3)? E.g. some kind of pulse chase in which they follow a declining flux gradient. It is difficult to imagine how this experiment can be performed, but the point is that the fact that one observation is hard to predict with an existing model only suggests possibilities for alternate models.

We have now reversed the structure of the paper and discussed all experimental results before ending with a single section of modelling.

We have also added a supplementary figure showing examples of tracks. The sentence quoted above was meant to underlie that our conclusion of logarithmic sensing was not based on individual tracks. We merely wanted to point out that no matter how concentrated our suspensions had been, we could have drawn our conclusion based on the population dynamics alone. We understand, nevertheless, how in its current form the sentence implies that the suspension was not concentrated and we have thus rephrased the sentence. In any case, the tracking details now added to the Methods section should now fully specify our experiments.

We are grateful for having this pointed out. Our Discussion has now been significantly expanded and now includes a section on the relation between animals, choanoflagellates and their common ancestor.

(3) as a possible taxis functional, the parametric fit of the Keller- Segel model does not guarantee that Eq. (4) is precisely the correct form. Nonetheless, we have now mentioned in the Discussion that other slight variations give only worse fits, suggesting that indeed Eq. (4) is the correct one to good approximation. To extract the exact biological functional and observe the differences to Eq. (3), variations on our experiment can be performed with different gas mixtures e.g.by performing an experiment with a gradient built up using 0 and 1% oxygen gas cylinders and comparing to an experiment with 19 and 20% oxygen. Under a linear functional these experiments would give the same results, but not under logarithmic sensing. We have now suggested such future experiments in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
