Malignant Hyperthermia Susceptibility (MHS) exemplifies muscle conditions that increase [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cytosol</sub>. 42% of MHS patients have hyperglycemia. We show that phosphorylated glycogen phosphorylase (GP<italic>a</italic>), glycogen synthase (GS<italic>a</italic>) – respectively activated and inactivated by phosphorylation – and their Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent kinase (PhK), are elevated in microsomal extracts from MHS patients’ muscle. Glycogen and glucose transporter GLUT4 are decreased. [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cytosol</sub>, increased to MHS levels, promoted GP phosphorylation. Imaging at ~100 nm resolution located GP<italic>a</italic> at sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) junctional cisternae, and <italic>apo</italic>-GP at Z disk. MHS muscle therefore has a wide-ranging alteration in glucose metabolism: high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cytosol</sub> activates PhK, which inhibits GS, activates GP and moves it toward the SR, favoring glycogenolysis. The alterations probably cause these patients’ hyperglycemia. For basic studies, MHS emerges as a variable stressor, which forces glucose pathways from the normal to the diseased range, thereby exposing novel metabolic links.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Animals and humans move by contracting the skeletal muscles attached to their bones. These muscles take up a type of sugar called glucose from food and use it to fuel contractions or store it for later in the form of glycogen. If muscles fail to use glucose it can lead to excessive sugar levels in the blood and a condition called diabetes. Within muscle cells are stores of calcium that signal the muscle to contract. Changes in calcium levels enhance the uptake of glucose that fuel these contractions. However, variations in calcium have also been linked to diabetes, and it remained unclear when and how these ‘signals’ become harmful.</p><p>People with a condition called malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS for short) have genetic mutations that allow calcium to leak out from these stores. This condition may result in excessive contractions causing the muscle to over-heat, become rigid and break down, which can lead to death if left untreated. A clinical study in 2019 found that out of hundreds of patients who had MHS, nearly half had high blood sugar and were likely to develop diabetes. Now, Tammineni et al. – including some of the researchers involved in the 2019 study – have set out to find why calcium leaks lead to elevated blood sugar levels.</p><p>The experiments showed that enzymes that help convert glycogen to glucose are more active in patients with MHS, and found in different locations inside muscle cells. Whereas the enzymes that change glucose into glycogen are less active. This slows down the conversion of glucose into glycogen for storage and speeds up the breakdown of glycogen into glucose. Patients with MHS also had fewer molecules that transport glucose into muscle cells and stored less glycogen. These changes imply that less glucose is being removed from the blood.</p><p>Next, Tammineni et al. used a microscopy technique that is able to distinguish finely separated objects with a precision not reached before in living muscle. This revealed that when the activity of the enzyme that breaks down glycogen increased, it moved next to the calcium store. This effect was also observed in the muscle cells of MHS patients that leaked calcium from their stores. Taken together, these observations may explain why patients with MHS have high levels of sugar in their blood.</p><p>These findings suggest that MHS may start decades before developing diabetes and blood sugar levels in these patients should be regularly monitored. Future studies should investigate whether drugs that block calcium from leaking may help prevent high blood sugar in patients with MHS or other conditions that cause a similar calcium leak.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>muscle fiber</kwd><kwd>malignant hyperthermia</kwd><kwd>ryanodine receptor</kwd><kwd>glycogen phosphorylase</kwd><kwd>diabetes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR071381</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Riazi</surname><given-names>Sheila</given-names></name><name><surname>Rios</surname><given-names>Eduardo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR072602</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rios</surname><given-names>Eduardo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM111254</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rios</surname><given-names>Eduardo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000097</institution-id><institution>National Center for Research Resources</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S1055024707</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rios</surname><given-names>Eduardo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Calcium-driven protein changes, causing glycogenolysis, poor synthesis, and diminished content of glycogen, along with diminished glucose transporters, lead to hyperglycemia in patients prone to calcium leaks from intracellular muscle stores.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Skeletal muscle is the major processing site for dietary glucose, consuming it at a high rate during exercise and storing it as glycogen more than any other tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baron et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mizgier et al., 2014</xref>). Muscle is critical to glucose homeostasis, to the point that its failure to take up glucose heralds the eventual onset of type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">DeFronzo and Tripathy, 2009</xref>). Reciprocally, glucose is required to provide fuel necessary for muscle contraction and thermogenesis. This relationship consists of a two-way mutual control process: postprandial secretion of insulin increases muscle uptake of glucose, and multiple muscle-generated signals increase glucose uptake during exercise or thermogenesis.</p><p>Changes in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub>) play a central —albeit not fully understood— role in these interactions. Insulin induces intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release sufficient for a modest, transient increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Contreras-Ferrat et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lanner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Park et al., 2015</xref>); reciprocally, signaling from contractile activity mediated by increased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> results in increased glucose uptake by insulin-dependent and independent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jessen and Goodyear, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lanner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Holloszy and Narahara, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Holloszy et al., 1986</xref>). Once inside the myofiber, whether glucose is processed for direct energy production or stored as glycogen is tightly dictated by contractile activity and energy demand. Because proper function of muscle requires maintenance of ATP concentrations within a narrow range, the myofiber maintains spatially distributed glycogen deposits, together with the enzymatic machinery needed to rapidly process glycogen towards glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adeva-Andany et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ørtenblad and Nielsen, 2015</xref>). The mechanisms that integrate muscle activity and glucose processing rely on changes in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> during excitation-contraction coupling. The present study addresses the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent control of the balance between glycogen synthesis and glycogenolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ozawa, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The close interactions between glucose metabolism and calcium signaling become relevant in type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Contreras-Ferrat et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Park et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guerrero-Hernandez and Verkhratsky, 2014</xref>). The diabetes-induced failure in mechanisms that regulate cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Levy, 1999</xref>) usually results in an increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub>. Because of many possible mutual interactions between Ca<sup>2+</sup> and glucose transport, it is not clear whether the increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> is a contributor to the origin of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Park et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zarain-Herzberg et al., 2014</xref>), nor whether it is a cause or consequence of hyperglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lanner et al., 2008</xref>). In any case, the alteration in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> will in turn modify the pathogenic processes of diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Contreras-Ferrat et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Malignant Hyperthermia Susceptibility (MHS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Litman et al., 2018</xref>) is a condition usually linked to mutations in <italic>RYR1</italic>, which encodes the Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channel of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), or in other genes that encode proteins of the skeletal muscle couplon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stern et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Franzini-Armstrong et al., 1999</xref>). The primary defect underlying this condition is believed to be a ‘Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak’ from the SR, due to an excessive propensity of the RyR channel to open, which in turn leads to increased cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. Large increases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> have been found in muscle from MHS individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">López Padrino, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lopez et al., 1992</xref>), MH-susceptible pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lopez et al., 1986</xref>) and in myotubes derived from MHS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Figueroa et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>An MHS-like phenotype occurs in multiple muscle diseases; the estimates of its prevalence vary widely depending on methods and assumptions (with results as high as 1/200 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bachand et al., 1997</xref>] and as low as 1/50000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ording, 1985</xref>]). MHS is clinically diagnosed through measurements of the magnitude of contractile forces (F<sub>H</sub> and F<sub>C</sub>) developed by freshly biopsied fiber bundles upon exposure to stimulants halothane and caffeine, standardized as the Caffeine Halothane Contracture Test (CHCT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Larach, 1989</xref>) and the In Vitro Contracture Test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hopkins et al., 2015</xref>). Recently Altamirano et al. observed a high prevalence of hyperglycemia in a large group with positive CHCT in our clinic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Altamirano et al., 2019</xref>), attributing this association to the increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> previously found in MHS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">López Padrino, 1994</xref>).</p><p>These observations are indicators of strong underlying connections between excitation-contraction signaling and glucose metabolism. This study was undertaken to understand these connections and derive consequences for patient management, through the investigation of the quantity, phosphorylation and cellular location of the enzymes that control glycogen storage and utilization, in muscle cells from MHS patients. The findings establish Malignant Hyperthermia Susceptibility and the diseases presenting this condition as prodromes and contributors to the development of hyperglycemia and eventually type 2 diabetes (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Diabetes Canada Clinical Practice Guidelines Expert Committee, 2020</xref>).

Both proteins are found associated with glycogen granules, which share the intermyofibrillar space with the SR and are extracted with the microsomal fraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ørtenblad and Nielsen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fridén et al., 1989</xref>). GDE, the main component of the band at 180 kDa, is visibly increased in the gels of MHS samples. The GDE blot (2C) derived from the gel in 2B confirms the impression, showing a mean content increased by 94% (p = 0.002). Patients that had higher GP had a commensurate elevation in GDE (<italic>r</italic> = 0.94, panel 2H). The procedure to derive Western blots for multiple proteins from the same electrophoresis gel is illustrated with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>.</p><p>The differences in GP and GDE can also be quantified directly on the gels stained nonspecifically, without resorting to Western blots. A comparison of the GP band for 13 MHN and 12 MHS muscles in one gel yields an excess of 73% in MHS (p = 0.005) and a similar difference between the GDE bands (p = 0.002, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In the gel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> the band at 100 kDa has the greatest signal mass in the whole gel; the excess protein in this band of the MHS (73%) is comparable with that of GP measured with protein-specific antibodies. The excellent correlation (<italic>r</italic> = 0.92) between the band signal in Western blots and in the stained gel is demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>. Taken together, the observations identify GP as the main constituent of the band and the most abundant protein in the microsomal fraction.</p><p>The differences in these and other glycogen processing enzymes described later are in contrast with the invariance of two couplon proteins tested (calsequestrin one or Casq1, and FKBP12, lower panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and a third calcium handling SR protein, SERCA1 (p=0.65; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). Remarkably therefore, in these subjects bearing a primary calcium handling defect, the expression levels are altered more for two glycogen breakdown enzymes than any of the major calcium management proteins studied here.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The phosphorylation of GP increases in the whole muscle extract</title><p>GP is phosphorylated by phosphorylase kinase (PhK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Newgard et al., 2000</xref>). PhK, GP, GDE and glycogen synthase (GS), together with GP phosphatase PP1, and initiator and scaffolding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crosson et al., 2003</xref>), associate with glycogen into glycogen granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Prats et al., 2018</xref>). Phosphorylation at Ser14 converts GP from the <italic>apo</italic> or <italic>b</italic> form into GP<italic>a</italic>, which promotes the active conformation of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nagy, 2017</xref>). In human and murine muscle, glycogen granules are largely inter-myofibrillar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ørtenblad and Nielsen, 2015</xref>), close to the SR.</p><p>Given that PhK is activated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brushia and Walsh, 1999</xref>) and assuming that MHS patients’ [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> is elevated (see Introduction), we hypothesize that the excess [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub>, via promotion of PhK, leads to an increase in GP<italic>a</italic>. To justify the observation of excess GP in microsomes, we also hypothesize that GP<italic>a</italic> (rather than GP<italic>b</italic>) migrates with microsomes, presumably incorporating into glycogen granules. The quantities of <italic>all-forms</italic> GP (i.e. GP<italic>a</italic> and GP<italic>b</italic>) and GP<italic>a</italic> were measured in immunoblots from different gels loaded with aliquots of the same extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

In the microsomal fraction GP<italic>a</italic> content was 70% higher in the MHS (p = 0.05); because <italic>all-forms</italic> GP also increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), the ratio of contents GP<italic>a</italic>/GP did not change significantly (p = 0.28, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). If all the GP in microsomes were phosphorylated, an increase in GP<italic>a</italic> would not change the ratio GP<italic>a</italic>/GP.

The present studies sought mechanistic explanations for the high incidence of hyperglycemia found in MHS subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Altamirano et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Starting from changes visible even without specific staining in gels of the microsomal fraction, the main observations will be summarized with references to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">2</xref>. As listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, where significant changes are coded in color, the MHS samples had substantial increases — in microsomes and whole tissue lysates — of GP, its phosphorylated form GP<italic>a</italic>, the phosphorylated fraction GP<italic>a</italic>/GP, phosphorylation of glycogen synthase (GS<italic>a</italic>/GS), and content of the GP- and GS-kinase PhK. As expected from these changes, microsomal glycogen was substantially reduced. Additionally, we found less GLUT4 in microsomes, a change expected in view of the reduced phosphorylation of Akt in response to insulin in MHS mouse myotubes described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Altamirano et al., 2019</xref>.</p><p>Patients who had a marked increase in PhK were found to have substantial changes in the other variables as well. This convergence, quantified by high correlation coefficients between variables (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), indicates that the changes in PhK content cause the increases in phosphorylation of GP and GS and the decrease in glycogen content. The correlations bolster the statistical significance of the changes — if patients who have high GP<italic>a</italic> also have high PhK or low glycogen, it is unlikely that the high values be due to random variability or measurement error. Multivariate analysis documented in Appendix 3, of correlations between more than two variables, strengthen the conclusion that the changes in GP, GP<italic>a</italic> and glycogen content are caused by activation of PhK. These studies also attribute high significance to the changes in content of GDE and GLUT4. Elevated GP<italic>a</italic> in MHS was first reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Willner et al., 1980</xref>, but later questioned due to the large number of MHN patients with high GP<italic>a</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Traynor et al., 1983</xref>). While we also found false positives among our patients, there was a clear association between the MHS condition and a wide-ranging change in glucose processing enzymes, which included the excess GP<italic>a</italic>. (A different validation, based on the estimation of probable error, is presented in the section Materials and methods/Statistics/Replicates and Probable Error).</p><p>In sum, the results demonstrate in MHS individuals an activation of the pathway of glycogen breakdown to glucose, which shares many features with the program activated during exercise, including a dependence on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub>, parallel phosphorylation of GP and GS, and decrease in glycogen (rev. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mul et al., 2015</xref>). However, the changes in MHS muscle differ by including an increase in GDE and a decrease in GLUT4 in microsomes. The changes in GDE and GLUT4 complete a wide-ranging metabolic alteration that promotes glycogen breakdown and may hamper glucose uptake and utilization inside muscle, thus promoting hyperglycemia.</p><p>The observed decrease in GLUT4 in microsomes is not immediately relatable to the steady increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> that we propose as primary mediator of the metabolic changes in MHS patients. On the contrary, the increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> that mediates EC coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Valant and Erlij, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Youn et al., 1991</xref>), plus that caused by Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in response to insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lanner et al., 2009</xref>) are believed to promote GLUT4 expression and its translocation to the plasma and transverse tubular membranes. The physiological increase in GLUT4 activity in response to insulin is preceded by activation of phosphatidyl-inositol 3-kinase, subsequent recruitment of Akt to the plasma membrane and its phosphorylation by 3-PI-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1). Akt phosphorylation follows Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, in muscle and also in cultured neurons, where it is associated with electrical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nicholson-Fish et al., 2016</xref>) and in osteogenic cells, where Ca<sup>2+</sup>entry follows mechanical stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Danciu et al., 2003</xref>). These observations favor a positive effect of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> on GLUT4 activity, by increasing its expression or deployment to the cell boundaries.</p><p>On the other hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Park et al., 2009</xref> demonstrated that GLUT4 expression is inhibited by chronic elevation of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub>, in agreement with negative effects of prolonged exposure of muscle to ionomycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 1995</xref>). These interventions specifically abolished the activation of GLUT4 expression by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an insulin-independent effect mediated by [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ihlemann et al., 1999</xref>). The time course of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> determined the sign of the effect: promotion of GLUT4 required Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, while a sustained increase in the ion concentration had the opposite effect. In conclusion, the chronic increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> that occurs in MHS could justify, via distinct but entangled mechanisms, both the increased phosphorylation of PhK, GP and GS and the reduced content of GLUT4 observed in these patients. In this view, the reduction in glycogen content would be caused by both the imbalance in the pathway to and from glucose, and a reduction in uptake and availability of glucose. The main elements of this interpretation are diagrammed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Glucose pathways and their alterations in MHS muscle.</title><p>Glycogen, resident in the intermyofibrillar space in the form of granules or SR-bound, is synthesized from transported glucose or broken down to glucose-1-phosphate (Glc-1-P).

The lower [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>SR</sub> promotes influx via SOCE or other pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eltit et al., 2013</xref>) resulting in higher [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub>. The change has two effects: (i) PhK activation that increases phosphorylation of GP and GS, to respectively enhance the breakdown and decrease the synthesis of glycogen. The resulting increase in Glc-1-P, Glc-6-P and glucose (Glc) hampers passive entry of glucose. (ii) Decrease of the basal activation by AMPK of the expression and membrane insertion of the glucose transporter GLUT4 (61), which contributes to reducing glucose entry.

This is demonstrated by the relationship between FBS and measures of phosphorylation in the present study. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, a positive correlation exists between FBS and the ratio GP<italic>a</italic>/GP of whole tissue (<italic>r</italic> = 0.58), which implies that the metabolic alteration detected among the MHS has systemic consequences that favor high FBS. A rough quantitative measure of the relevance of the metabolic change as a determinant of hyperglycemia was derived from the slope (<italic>b</italic> = 2.5 mM) of the linear fit in the figure. In the sample studied, the abscissa (GP<italic>a</italic>/GP) increased by 0.15, from a median value of 0.36 in the MHN to 0.51 in the MHS (Table I). An increment of 0.15 in the abscissa corresponds on the regression line to a difference in FBS of 2.5 mM ×0.15, or 0.38 mM higher sugar. The analysis of ‘legacy’ patients (illustrated with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) showed an excess FBS averaging ~0.5 mM in MHS at all ages. Extrapolation of the present study to the ‘legacy’ cohort suggests that a major part of the excess FBS (0.38/0.5 mM) is related to and potentially explained by the measured changes in glycogen processing enzymes. The remainder could be explained by other alterations that increase blood sugar, not defined, manifested in the separate correlations of hyperglycemia with age and BMI demonstrated in the ‘legacy’ cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Jointly with the observations of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Altamirano et al., 2019</xref>, the present results identify MHS as a prodrome and cause of hyperglycemia.

A much greater difference was found between groups defined by metabolic variables, namely the MHS patients that had the highest content of PhK and GP in microsomes and patients with low content of these proteins. While the selection was based on PhK and GP only, the top six also had the highest GP<italic>a</italic> content and GP<italic>a</italic>/GP ratio in whole muscle lysate, the highest GDE and GS<italic>a</italic>/GS, and the lowest GLUT4 in microsomes; we call them <italic>MC</italic>, for metabolically challenged. <italic>MC</italic> had an average FBS of 5.90 mM (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, row 19).

The difference between <italic>MC</italic> and <italic>MN</italic> was highly significant. The weaker association found between FBS and F<sub>H</sub> (the measure on which MHS diagnosis is based) might reflect links between calcium homeostasis and glycogen metabolism that remain unknown and uncorrelated with F<sub>H</sub>, or just the challenging nature of the CHCT.</p><p>As a second outcome, the present work promotes the use of samples from MHS subjects as ‘tools’ to explore normal physiology, specifically harboring a perturbation that stresses otherwise normal pathways. Note first that MHN and MHS patients are classified based on a threshold value of the halothane-induced force F<sub>H</sub>. F<sub>H</sub> has a unimodal distribution among individuals (inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), with probability density varying monotonically near the MHS threshold. This implies that there is no unique way of setting this threshold; the classification is conventional rather than clear-cut.</p><p>Because the MHS-defining variable F<sub>H</sub> is graded, the associated deviations from normalcy in metabolic properties should also be graded. In agreement, none of the variables measured showed any clustering that would define a boundary between normalcy and disease. An absence of clustering was also the case in the cell-level study of calcium signals of the ‘recent’ cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Figueroa et al., 2019</xref>). Within this context of graded variation, the quantitative correlations linking changes in the measured variables suggest that MH susceptibility alters continuously a cellular parameter critical for the processing of glucose towards glycogen. The graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> provides an example: the good correlation between the quantity of GP and GDE in microsomes extends smoothly from MHN to MHS patients, without obvious change –in regression coefficient or other properties—between the two groups. The MHS condition — presumably through its higher [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> — appears to impose changes, such as forcing more of the glycogenolytic enzymes towards the SR, without changing essential properties.</p><p>The stress provided by the MHS condition affords multiple insights into normal pathways: first it reveals a close relationship between abundance of PhK and phosphorylation of GP, which in turn leads to migration of the enzyme to the microsomal fraction. Imaging at unprecedented resolution locates the phosphorylated GP at or near the SR, predominantly at terminal cisternae. An association between GP and the SR has been reported since 1972 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wanson and Drochmans, 1972</xref>) but the effect of GP phosphorylation on this linkage remained obscure. We now find that the content of GP in microsomes is strictly correlated with its degree of phosphorylation in the whole tissue extract, but not with that in microsomes. This is possible if all GP in microsomes is in the GP<italic>a</italic> form. This inference, derived from biochemical data in lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), is consistent with the distribution of GP<italic>a</italic> imaged in muscle biopsies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and of GP<italic>b</italic> derived tentatively by linearly combining GP and GP<italic>a</italic> images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Dc</xref>, E). The present evidence contradicts previous reports that found mostly GP<italic>b</italic> in a rabbit SR fraction, the phosphorylation of which caused its detachment from the SR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cuenda et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cuenda et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>Glycogen granules 10–40 nm in diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Prats et al., 2018</xref>) share the intermyofibrillar space with the SR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ørtenblad and Nielsen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fridén et al., 1989</xref>) and are part of the microsomal fraction. They contain multiple proteins (including GP, GDE, GS, PhK, PP1, PKA and glycogen branching enzyme). While GP detected in the microsomal fraction might in principle reside in its glycogen granules, the irregular distribution of the granules in the inter-myofibrillar space (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ørtenblad and Nielsen, 2015</xref>) is inconsistent with the detailed delineation of terminal cisternae by the specific GP<italic>a</italic> antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref> and its supplements). The present images suggest instead a detailed and extensive binding of GP<italic>a</italic> to the SR, perhaps mediated by glycogen as proposed in early studies of GP that distinguished direct and granule-mediated association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wanson and Drochmans, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hirata et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The changes in MHS include enrichment of GDE in the microsomal fraction. GDE, however, diminishes together with glycogen in microsomes of exercised rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lees et al., 2004</xref>). Again, the observations can be reconciled assuming that GDE has means to associate with the SR other than via glycogen granules.</p><p>While PhK promotes phosphorylation of GP and GS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brushia and Walsh, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Walsh et al., 1979</xref>), the changes in GS observed here differ from those of GP: GS<italic>a</italic>/GS increases in the microsomal fraction while its total content does not (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The observations imply that GS<italic>a</italic> and GS<italic>b</italic> coexist in the membrane system and their relative amounts are regulated in response to changes in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>].</p><p>As already noted, PhK increases in the microsomes but remains constant in the whole tissue extract. The change thus appears to be a migration of the kinase towards the membrane fraction. The functional implications of PhK migration are intriguing, considering that GP<italic>b</italic> — its substrate — remains at the I band, near the Z disk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Maruyama et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chowrashi et al., 2002</xref>), while GP<italic>a</italic> appears near the SR. The strong heterogeneity in distribution of PhK and GP<italic>a</italic> might be related to the standing gradient of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] between triadic space and bulk cytosol proposed to emerge from the operation of SOCE channels preassembled at T-SR junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cully et al., 2018</xref>). This conundrum and other questions about mechanism left unanswered by the present study, are stressed by question marks in the functional diagram of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>.</p><p>The present findings have implications for clinical management. Follow-up of the six patients identified here as metabolically challenged encountered a disease phenotype, quantified by the Clinical Index defined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Figueroa et al., 2019</xref>, greater than average for the MHS class.

The finding of tight links between calcium signaling and glycogen metabolism suggests the use of GP inhibitors not just to prevent hyperglycemia, but also to treat the MHS condition. Conversely, treating the causes of abnormal Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling in MHS should moderate the changes in glycogen metabolism, as already reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Altamirano et al., 2019</xref> in their study of an MHS animal model.</p><p>The present observations prescribe follow-up of all MHS subjects, watchful for the development of diabetes. In animal models, the presence of GP in extracellular circulating vesicles is an early marker of cardiac injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yarana et al., 2018</xref>); in MHS, the increase of GP<italic>a</italic> and other proteins precedes hyperglycemia, therefore the potential of circulating glucose metabolism enzymes as its early markers should be evaluated.</p><p>The present study has limitations: the resting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> in muscle —putative proximate cause of the metabolic alterations — is not known for these individuals.

The analysis was done in two ways, with equivalent results: (i) Direct: one independent variable (‘<italic>x</italic>’, typically the content of kinase PhK) as linearly linked to multiple dependent variables (‘<italic>y</italic>’: including GP, GP<sub>a</sub>, GDE, GLUT4, other proteins and Glycogen). (ii) Inverse: one <italic>y</italic> (typically PhK) assumed to depend linearly on multiple <italic>x</italic> variables. The outputs of the analysis are the multivariate coefficient <italic>r</italic>, with statistical properties defined by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ6 equ7">Equations 6 and 7</xref>, a collective <italic>F</italic> value for <italic>F</italic>-tests of hypotheses, pairwise regression coefficients that quantify the dependence of one variable on the others in the linear hypothesis, and error estimates for these coefficients, which are used to test null hypotheses. Multiple regression was calculated using STATA (Statacorp, College Station, TX, USA), which also performs the <italic>F</italic> tests. Additional rationale, description and results of multivariate regression analysis are in Appendix 3.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-2"><title>Sample size</title><p>It was defined in two stages: First we used samples from 14 or 15 patients (7 CHCT-positive and 7 or 8 negative) for establishing the methods. The sample size in this case was set by availability of biopsies and size of the available electrophoresis chamber (15 lane — 7 positives and 7 or eight negatives was the maximum size of two approximately equal size groups that could be compared in the same gel). Examples of work with 15-lane gels are in Appendices 1 and 3.</p><p>After the methods were optimized and aiming for higher sensitivity, we used 25-lane chambers —which recommended waiting for additional patients until the chambers could be used at full capacity. This led to the use of 12 positive + 13 negative muscles. It was not feasible to optimize sample size for a desired power. (Achieving greater sensitivity and power would have required unacceptable delays, as patients are recruited at the frequency of at most one per week). By an evaluation of probable error, it is argued in the next section that the sample size was generally sufficient to detect differences of 10% or greater in the measured protein contents.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-3"><title>Replicates and probable error</title><p>Samples from different patients are bio-replicates of the MHS condition. Production of bio-replicates in an individual patient would entail multiple gels and blots of each protein, which was precluded in general by the limited material derived from a single biopsy. Therefore, most data reported here emerge from single gels and their derived blots.</p><p>To evaluate the probable error in the single gel determinations, we run a gel with three replicates (lanes) for each of 4 patients chosen because their large biopsies provided sufficient material. The gel is illustrated with Appendix 4. On a Western blot of GP<italic>a</italic> from this gel we performed multiple evaluations (n = 5 ‘technical replicates’) of normalized GP<italic>a</italic> in all lanes. A simple analysis of variance then allowed calculation of expected errors in individual measures. The total variance —mean square deviation computed individually for each patient and averaged over patients — was 0.0303 when expressed as a fraction of the square of the means. The ‘technical variance’, that is the mean square deviation of the technical replications from the means in individual lanes measured repeatedly, was 0.0026. This is the component of the variance that can be reduced by repeated evaluations. The square root of the irreducible component, 0.166, is the SD that quantifies the probable error of the single measurement used in the study. Therefore, differences of less than 33% (2 × SD) between individuals cannot be assigned significance. When averaged over our sample of 12 or 13 (MHS or MHN) individuals, the probable error is reduced to ~9% of the measured value. The differences reported as significant in the study are much greater than 9%.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Study approval</title><p>Following approval by the institutional Research Ethics Board of Toronto General Hospital (TGH), informed consents were obtained from all patients who underwent the CHCT.

By analyzing muscle samples from MHN and MHS patients, the authors propose a pathway driven by elevated cytosolic resting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in MHS, which activates Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent phosphorylase kinase (PhK) to phosphorylate glycogen phosphorylase (GP) and glycogen synthase (GS) to shift the glucose-glycogen balance towards glycogenolysis. Elegant immuolocalization studies indicate that phopsphorylation of GS (GSα) results in translocation of the enzyme from the Z-line to the terminal SR. The increase in gycogenolysis, coupled with a reduction in glucose 4 transporter (Glut4) expression, is proposed to lead to the hyperglycemia observed in these patients.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Most of the data in this study were obtained using a &quot;recent cohort&quot; of 12 MHS and 13 MHN patients. While analysis of a larger cohort of 560 patients (329 MHS and 231 MHN) termed the &quot;legacy cohort&quot; provide clear evidence of increased hyperglycemia in MHS patients, average fasting glycaemia (FBS) MHS patients of the recent cohort was not significantly elevated compared with the MHN patients (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). This complicates interpretation and inferences obtained regarding the relevance for hyperglycemia of changes observed in the more limited recent cohort. The authors did resolve an increase in FBS (Table 1) between a subgroup of the MHS patients that have the most pronounced change in GPα and GPα/GP ratio and a subgroup of the MHN patients with the lowest levels of these enzymes. However, the relevance of this selected subgroup analysis is unclear, especially since a similar sub-cohort analysis was not conducted between MHS patients with low GPα and MHN patients with high GPα. A correlation analysis between FBS and levels of GPα in microsomes using all the patients in the cohort might be informative.</p><p>2) A recent study by this group (Figueroa et al., 2019) reported that MHS in the legacy cohort can be divided into patients that responded to both halothane and caffeine in CHCT test (HS) or those that responded to only halothane (HH). Importantly, this study reported that myotubes derived from patients in the HH group exhibited significantly higher cytosolic resting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] levels compared with both myotubes from patients in the MHN and HS groups. In fact, resting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] levels were not different significantly between MHN and HS. Were the 12 MHS individuals used in the recent cohort from the HS or HH subgroups? Since the authors propose that elevated cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] drives changes in GP phosphorylation, subcellular localization and hyperglycemia, it would be informative to compare FBS (and levels of GPα in microsomes) between MHN, HH, and HS patients.</p><p>3) The elevation of resting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] used in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> challenge experiments described in Figure 7 (300-500nM) are outside of the physiological range. For example, Figueroa et al., 2019 reported only a modest increase in resting cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in myotubes derived from HH patients (from ~100 nM in MHN to ~130nM in HH). As an alternative to consider, Cully et al., 2019 (PMID: 30038012), reported that increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak in muscle fibers from MHS patients results in a significantly larger increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] within the junctional space compared to global cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] levels. Thus, local Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels within the junctional space may be large enough to drive PhK-dependent phosphorylation of GP. In this case, it would be important to determine if PhK localizes to the A-I band junction where it would be exposed to the higher junctional Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels created by increased RYR1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak. In this case, elevated nanodomain junctional Ca<sup>2+</sup> resulting from RYR1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak could act to phosphorylate GP and trap it close to the SR. This possibility should be considered in the Discussion section.</p><p>4) The authors conclude that MHS patients exhibit hyperglycemia as a result of enhanced glycogen breakdown. However, the level of glycogen reported is extremely low even in MHN, compared to previously studies. It is acknowledged that is from microsomes, but still ~20mg/liter is extremely low. The authors obtain muscle biopsies from gracilis, hence glycogen in whole muscle homogenate would give more of an indication if the obtained glycogen levels appear physiological relevant. Please clarify.</p><p>5) The glycogen experiments are, if understood correctly, not performed on flash frozen (or freeze-dried) muscle but instead after the muscles have been floating around in DMEM media overnight, which potentially could affect the glycogen content. Please clarify.</p><p>6) There are no comparisons to healthy individuals, to establish some of the GP, GPα /GLUT4 etc. levels as well as glycogen content in healthy subjects would emphasize if the findings are higher/lower/similar as compared to a healthy cohort. This needs to be addressed and clarified by the authors to understand the impact of the findings.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53999.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Most of the data in this study were obtained using a &quot;recent cohort&quot; of 12 MHS and 13 MHN patients.

However, we have two strong reasons for not including further examination of PhK phosphorylation in the present study.</p><p>1) We have already noted that the present observations pose major conundrums. Specifically about PhK we wrote: “…PhK increases in the microsomes but remains constant in the whole tissue extract. The change thus appears to be a migration of the kinase towards the membrane fraction. The functional implications of PhK migration are intriguing, considering that GP<italic>b</italic> – its substrate – remains at the I band, near the Z disk (Figure 4 and (1,2)), while GP<italic>a</italic> appears near the SR. The spatial aspects of the interactions between the kinase and its substrates remain to be defined”. In short, PhK (re)distribution and interactions are intriguing topics, which won’t be clarified without major work.</p><p>2) The way ahead would seem to be via an imaging study of PhK’s apo and phospho forms, similar to that done for GP. However, this is not possible because there is to our knowledge no suitable pair of antibodies. For the above reasons, we believe that pursuing this line would extend the scope and enlarge the size and difficulties of the study beyond what we consider feasible at this time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors conclude that MHS patients exhibit hyperglycemia as a result of enhanced glycogen breakdown. However, the level of glycogen reported is extremely low even in MHN, compared to previously studies. It is acknowledged that is from microsomes, but still ~20mg/liter is extremely low. The authors obtain muscle biopsies from gracilis, hence glycogen in whole muscle homogenate would give more of an indication if the obtained glycogen levels appear physiological relevant. Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>We chose to quantify glycogen in microsomes based on the evidence that a (large) majority of the glycogen identified in EM images is in the intermyofibrillar spaces, and should migrate with the membranes (microsomal) fraction. We refer readers to Figure 1C and D of Ørtenblad and Nielson (2015), a recent article that reviews quantitative aspects of the distribution of glycogen in human muscle. While a significant difference in glycogen content should be detectable in whole muscle as well, we thought that the potential error would be lower in the more concentrated preparation. Regardless of the scale of the result (more about this below), the difference between identically treated groups is highly significant.</p><p>To decide whether the quantity of glycogen found in the microsomal fraction is low, we realized that expressing the results per liter of preparation is adequate for the comparison but not in the absolute sense (it depends on dilutions intrinsic to the “kit” used). We have recast the results as µg glycogen/µg microsomal protein (g/g). The graphs and statistical calculations have been changed accordingly. In these units the means are 1.16 (MHN) and 0.72 (MHS) and the <italic>p</italic> of no difference (in the non-parametric test) continues to be 0.01. For comparison, Lees et al. (3) report 0.4 g per g of microsomal protein in rested rat muscles, a maximum that is drastically reduced by activity. Entman et al. (4) gives a comparable range of values in dog muscle, while Cuenda’s numbers are much lower (5).</p><p>In sum, our measured glycogen content is somewhat greater than comparable values we could find in the literature. Our choice to quantify glycogen in the microsomal fraction seems reasonable, given its preferential intermyofibrillar location. We have now expanded the justification of the study in Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The glycogen experiments are, if understood correctly, not performed on flash frozen (or freeze-dried) muscle but instead after the muscles have been floating around in DMEM media overnight, which potentially could affect the glycogen content. Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>The concern does not seem critical, as we report values from samples processed identically. To calibrate the difference associated with the time elapsed in solution, three dual samples from each of two individuals (#177 and 178, biopsied in February and March of this year) were analyzed. One part of each sample, “snapfrozen”, was kept at -20 °C and shipped in liquid N and the other “standard” was kept at ~4 °C since the time of excision. 4 grams of muscle from each patient were processed in total. For #711 the averages (SEM) are 1.11 (0.02) and 1.25 (0.05) respectively for snap-frozen and standard conditions. The difference, of ~12%, is not significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.073). For #178 they were 1.84 (0.05) and 1.91 (0.03) respectively. The difference, of ~4%, is again not significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.27). Averages of both sets are also not significantly different; however, the glycogen content was lower in most individual pieces of tissue kept frozen, which might reflect greater dephosphorylation of GP<italic>a</italic> in the samples shipped at 4°C.</p><p>We now include this description in Materials and methods section. A reference to this test is also in Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) There are no comparisons to healthy individuals, to establish some of the GP, GPα/GLUT4 etc. levels as well as glycogen content in healthy subjects would emphasize if the findings are higher/lower/similar as compared to a healthy cohort.
