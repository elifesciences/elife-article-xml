Infections are typically subclinical but can be severe and, in some cases, life threatening. Central to the virulence of <italic>T. gondii</italic> is an unusual form of substrate-dependent motility that enables the parasite to invade cells of its host and to disseminate throughout the body. A hetero-oligomeric complex of proteins that functions in motility has been characterized, but how these proteins work together to drive forward motion of the parasite remains controversial. A key piece of information needed to understand the underlying mechanism(s) is the directionality of the forces that a moving parasite exerts on the external environment. The linear motor model of motility, which has dominated the field for the past two decades, predicts continuous anterior-to-posterior force generation along the length of the parasite. We show here using three-dimensional traction force mapping that the predominant forces exerted by a moving parasite are instead periodic and directed in toward the parasite at a fixed circular location within the extracellular matrix. These highly localized forces, which are generated by the parasite pulling on the matrix, create a visible constriction in the parasite’s plasma membrane. We propose that the ring of inward-directed force corresponds to a circumferential attachment zone between the parasite and the matrix, through which the parasite propels itself to move forward. The combined data suggest a closer connection between the mechanisms underlying parasite motility and host cell invasion than previously recognized. In parasites lacking the major surface adhesin, TgMIC2, neither the inward-directed forces nor the constriction of the parasite membrane are observed. The trajectories of the TgMIC2-deficient parasites are less straight than those of wild-type parasites, suggesting that the annular zone of TgMIC2-mediated attachment to the extracellular matrix normally constrains the directional options available to the parasite as it migrates through its surrounding environment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>toxoplasma</kwd><kwd>apicomplexa</kwd><kwd>traction force mapping</kwd><kwd>cell motility</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI139201</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ward</surname><given-names>Gary E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI137767</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ward</surname><given-names>Gary E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM141743</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Warshaw</surname><given-names>David M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S10OD026884</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Warshaw</surname><given-names>David M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32AI055402</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stadler</surname><given-names>Rachel V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31AI145214</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stadler</surname><given-names>Rachel V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19PRE34370071</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stadler</surname><given-names>Rachel V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Parasites constrict as they propel themselves through the extracellular matrix one body length at a time, in a process highly reminiscent of host cell invasion.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Parasites of the phylum Apicomplexa cause pervasive human disease and are responsible for approximately one million deaths annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">World Health Organization, 2021</xref>;

Like other apicomplexan parasites, the <italic>T. gondii</italic> tachyzoite uses a unique form of substrate-dependent motility to invade into and egress from cells of its host, to migrate across biological barriers, and to disseminate throughout the infected host. Motility is, therefore, central to the pathogenesis of toxoplasmosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barragan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Meissner et al., 2002</xref>). The parasite has no cilia or flagella and can move at speeds of up to 3 µm/s without the leading edge protrusions that drive the substrate-dependent motility of other eukaryotic cells. Within a three-dimensional (3D) extracellular matrix, the parasite moves along a complex helical trajectory characterized by regular oscillations in velocity and changes in trajectory curvature and torsion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Leung et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Motility is driven, at least in part, by a complex of proteins known as the glideosome, which is anchored to the inner membrane complex at the parasite periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In the ‘linear motor’ model of motility, short actin filaments are bound through the bridging protein TgGAC to the cytosolic tails of transmembrane adhesins, such as TgMIC2, and translocated toward the posterior end of the parasite via a class XIV myosin, TgMyoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frénal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heintzelman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jacot et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sibley, 2004</xref>). If the extracellular domains of the transmembrane adhesins are attached to ligands on the substrate, the rearward translocation of actin results in forward movement of the parasite. Other apicomplexan parasites, including those that cause malaria (<italic>Plasmodium spp</italic>.) and cryptosporidiosis (<italic>Cryptosporidium spp</italic>.), express similar glideosome proteins, suggesting that the mechanism of motility is conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kappe et al., 1999</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Parasites moving in 3D deform the surrounding Matrigel and undergo periodic constrictions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In the linear motor model of motility, the TgMyoA motor (TgMyoA and its associated light chains, TgMLC1 and either TgELC1 or TgELC2) is anchored to the parasite’s inner membrane complex (IMC) via TgGAP45 and the transmembrane proteins TgGAP40 and TgGAP50. The lumenal portion of GAP50 is thought to interact with GAPM, a protein that spans the inner IMC membrane and likely connects the entire glideosome to the underlying parasite cytoskeleton. Short actin filaments located between the parasite plasma membrane and the IMC are connected to ligands on the substrate through a linker protein, possibly TgGAC, which binds to the cytosolic tails of surface adhesins such as TgMIC2. The TgMyoA motor displaces the actin filaments rearward; because the motor is connected to the IMC and the actin is connected to the substrate, this causes the parasite to move forward relative to the substrate. The vertical blue and red squiggles on TgGAP45 and TgMLC1 denote lipid anchors that attach the proteins to the IMC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frénal et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rompikuntal et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Foe et al., 2015</xref>).

Because parasite motility is essential for virulence, elucidation of the mechanism(s) underlying motility is of both fundamental cell biological interest and potential clinical relevance. One key piece of missing information needed for a full mechanistic understanding of motility is the directionality of the forces the parasite exerts on the external environment as it moves along its 3D helical trajectory. The linear motor model predicts continuous anterior-to-posterior forces along the entire periphery of the moving parasite. We show here using 3D traction force mapping that the predominant forces exerted by the parasite are instead organized into a highly localized circumferential ring of inward-directed force at a fixed location within the matrix. These inward-directed forces create a visible constriction of the parasite’s plasma membrane, reflecting a circular zone of tight attachment of the parasite to the matrix through which the parasite passes as it progresses forward along its helical trajectory. In the absence of this circular attachment zone, the parasite is still able to move but this movement loses much of its directionality.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Development of a quantitative 3D traction force mapping assay</title><p>As a first step toward visualizing the forces exerted by parasites moving in 3D, we used a bead displacement assay in the well-established Matrigel extracellular matrix model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Leung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Whitelaw et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gras et al., 2017</xref>).

The fact that the displacements were directed inwards rather than away from the parasite indicates that the pinching of the parasite membrane results from pulling forces generated by the parasite rather than the parasite squeezing through a narrow pore within the matrix, which would push the matrix away. When a constriction persisted over multiple time points, the fibrin continued to deform into the constriction and/or to hold the deformation over those same time points as the parasite passed through (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>The time it took a parasite to move completely through a constriction ranged from 1.6 to 56.2 seconds (average 6.8±5.2 seconds, measured in brightfield; n=99 parasites, 188 constrictions) with the longer times due to a stall in forward progression of a constricting parasite. The time between one constriction finishing and another beginning was also variable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Most importantly, all parasites that move at least one body length undergo a constriction and the total trajectory length is directly proportional to the number of constrictions observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), strongly suggesting that the parasite-generated forces that create the constriction play an important role in forward movement.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The constrictions are tightly linked with motility and are sufficiently narrow to deform the parasite nucleus.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The time interval between constrictions during motility of individual parasites (n=99 parasites, 188 constrictions).

It was, therefore, unexpected that the predominant forces revealed by our 3D traction force mapping assay were instead periodic and highly localized, pointing inwards from all directions towards a circumferential location on the parasite surface. This annular band of parasite-generated, inward-directed force forms at a fixed position within the matrix and creates a visible constriction at the parasite periphery. The constriction passes from the anterior to the posterior end of the parasite as the parasite moves forward. Typically, when the constriction reaches the parasite’s posterior end a new constriction forms at the apical end and the cycle repeats. These results suggest that the moving parasite periodically assembles ring-shaped zones of tight attachment to the matrix, which deform the matrix and serve as stationary platforms that the parasite propels itself through, one body length at a time.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Attachment to the substrate, force generation, and motility in 2D <italic>vs</italic>. 3D</title><p>Both malaria sporozoites and <italic>T. gondii</italic> tachyzoites are capable of moving in circles on 2D surfaces.

They concluded that the parasite adheres to the substrate at its apical and posterior ends; each of these adhesion sites produces stalling forces parallel to the long axis of the parasite, and disengagement of the adhesion sites drives forward motion. Traction forces perpendicular to the direction of movement were also detected at the center of the parasite but these were interpreted as nonspecific and nonproductive. The apical and posterior adhesion sites were shown to move forward <italic>with</italic> the parasite, rather than remaining stationary with respect to the substrate.</p><p><italic>T. gondii</italic> tachyzoites demonstrate a second form of productive motility on 2D surfaces called helical gliding: the banana-shaped parasite starts with its left side in contact with the substrate (where the convex face is defined as dorsal), moves forward one body length while rotating along its longitudinal axis until it lies on its right side, and then flips back to its left side to repeat the cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Håkansson et al., 1999</xref>). This form of motility is the equivalent of the fully helical trajectories seen in 3D but constrained in 2D by contact of the curved parasite with the rigid substrate. In RICM studies of 2D helical gliding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tosetti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pavlou et al., 2020</xref>) the tachyzoite was seen to first attach to the substrate at its apical end. The zone of attachment then expanded along the length of the parasite and, as the parasite moved forward and its apical end twisted up off the cover slip, the zone of attachment shrunk until it was reduced to a spot at the posterior end. In contrast to <italic>Plasmodium</italic> sporozoites, the position of the tachyzoite adhesion site remained fixed relative to the substrate and the parasite slid over this attachment site as the parasite moved forward. 2D traction force mapping revealed forces parallel, but not perpendicular, to the longitudinal axis of the tachyzoite; these traction forces, together with spring-like forces generated by the parasite’s microtubule cytoskeleton, were postulated to produce forward motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pavlou et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>When these previous studies of <italic>T. gondii</italic> 2D motility are combined with the 3D results presented here, a consensus emerges that the basic unit of motility consists of apical attachment to the substrate, followed by apical-to-posterior translocation of the adhesion site, which is fixed in its position relative to the substrate. When the adhesion site reaches the posterior end of the parasite, a new apical attachment site is formed, and the cycle begins again. The adhesion site in a 3D matrix is circular, and the pulling forces exerted by the parasite on the matrix manifest as a visible constriction in the parasite’s plasma membrane. In 2D, no deformation of the parasite has been reported at the adhesion site, likely reflecting differences in attachment to the substrate via a point/patch on the parasite surface <italic>vs</italic>. circumferential attachment. We also saw no evidence in 3D for a persistent stall force at the rear of the parasite. The biggest difference between the 2D and 3D force mapping data is that, in 3D, all force vectors point towards one highly localized circumferential region on the surface of the parasite, and many of these force vectors contained a strong component perpendicular to the long axis of the parasite.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Munera Lopez et al., 2022</xref> also recently noted that tachyzoites undergo constrictions as they move through Matrigel. These authors ascribed the constrictions to the parasite having to squeeze through small pores in the matrix. Our force mapping results and the regularity with which the constrictions form at the apical end of the parasite argue strongly that the constrictions do not result from the parasite pushing its way through pores, but rather from parasite-generated pulling forces on the matrix. Annular constrictions that remain stationary relative to the surrounding environment have also previously been reported along the length of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> ookinetes as they move through peritrophic membrane and microvillar network of the mosquito midgut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Freyvogel, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vlachou et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zieler and Dvorak, 2000</xref>), suggesting that parasite-generated circular zones of attachment to the environment may be a conserved feature of apicomplexan motility in 3D.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>3D motility and invasion: variations on a theme</title><p>During the invasion of host cells by <italic>T. gondii</italic> and other apicomplexan parasites, proteins secreted from the parasite’s apical organelles assemble a ring-shaped zone of tight attachment between the membranes of the two cells. This ‘moving junction’ does not in fact move: it is anchored to the host cytoskeleton and is hypothesized to provide a fixed platform against which the parasite exerts force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Besteiro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dubremetz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lebrun et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Porchet-Hennere and Torpier, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aikawa et al., 1978</xref>). Parasite surface adhesins, which are engaged with the junction via their extracellular domains, are thought to be translocated by MyoA in an anterior-to-posterior direction, pushing the parasite through the junction and into the host cell. The body of the parasite narrows dramatically as it passes through the moving junction, bearing a striking resemblance to the constrictions we report here during 3D motility.</p><p>Two central players in moving junction formation in <italic>T. gondii</italic> are TgAMA1, an adhesin secreted onto the parasite surface from the micronemes, and TgRON2, which is secreted by the parasites into the host cell plasma membrane and serves the ligand to which TgAMA1 binds. Neither TgAMA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bargieri et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mital et al., 2005</xref>) nor TgRON2 (RVS and GEW, unpublished data) plays any detectable role in parasite motility. Instead, TgMIC2 – another microneme protein secreted onto the parasite surface – likely plays an analogous role during motility to that of TgAMA1 during invasion, with TgMIC2 binding to ligands in the extracellular matrix rather than to TgRON2 in the host cell membrane.</p><p>As the parasite moves forward during both invasion and 3D motility, it simultaneously rotates around its long axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Leung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Håkansson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pavlou et al., 2018</xref>). Our results provide a possible explanation for this rotational motion. In both cases, parasite receptors bind to their cognate ligands in the form of a circular ring of attachment that is fixed in position relative to either the host cell (in the case of invasion) or the extracellular matrix (in the case of 3D motility). It has long been proposed that the TgMyoA motor driving invasion and motility is arranged helically within the parasite, along the spiraling subcortical microtubules (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pavlou et al., 2020</xref>). Alternatively, a recent modeling study suggests that the unique geometry of the parasite periphery can generate a self-organized helical pattern of anterior-to-posterior actin flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hueschen et al., 2022</xref>). In either case, if the actin filaments flow helically and are connected to the tails of transmembrane adhesins engaged circumferentially with the host cell surface or extracellular matrix, the forward motion of the parasite either into the cell or through the matrix will by definition be accompanied by rotational twist. Some portion of the perpendicular force that we observed directed towards the annular constriction in our traction force assays may in fact reflect torque on the matrix produced by the parasite as it twists through this circular zone of attachment.</p><p>As a parasite invades a host cell, antibodies are ‘shaved’ off the parasite surface at the moving junction by an as yet unknown mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dubremetz et al., 1985</xref>). Remarkably, a similar phenomenon is observed during 3D motility: fluorescent antibody against the surface protein TgSAG1 is lost from the parasite surface anterior to the constriction and shed as a helical trail of fluorescence behind the moving parasite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video10">Video 10</xref>).</p><p>The numerous parallels between invasion and 3D motility noted here suggest that the two processes may be more mechanistically similar than previously recognized, with implications for our understanding of each. For example, our data suggest that 3D motility can be best described as the parasite undergoing sequential invasion-like events through circular zones of attachment to the matrix; during invasion the parasite only needs to move a single body length to penetrate into the host cell, but during motility the parasite can string multiple constriction events together to move multiple body lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The data also raise the possibility that the characteristic constriction of the parasite seen at the moving junction during invasion does not reflect the parasite being squeezed as it <italic>pushes</italic> itself through the small diameter opening into the host cell, as is commonly thought (e.g<italic>.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Herm-Götz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mordue et al., 1999</xref>), but rather the parasite attaching to and <italic>pulling</italic> on the host cell plasma membrane as it penetrates.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The linear motor model</title><p>The data presented here with wild-type parasites are at least partially consistent with the linear motor model of motility, in which: (a) actin polymerization is nucleated at the apical tip of the parasite by formin1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tosetti et al., 2019</xref>); (b) TgMyoA translocates the actin filaments in an anterior-to- posterior direction along the length of the parasite; and (c) binding of the rearward flowing actin filaments to transmembrane adhesins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jacot et al., 2016</xref>), whose extracellular domains are attached to the substrate, drives the forward motion of the parasite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). While anterior-to-posterior actin flux may occur along the entire length of the parasite periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hueschen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Quadt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stadler et al., 2017</xref>), we propose a modification to the linear motor model in which force is generated, in whole or in part, by the rearward translocation of the subset of actin filaments that are coupled to adhesins at the circular ring of attachment. We were unable to detect any anterior-to-posterior bias in the force vectors at the constriction, which would be expected if the parasite pulls against this zone of attachment in order to move forward. These forces may be below our limit of detection (~0.72 pN). Alternatively, compression of the fibrin immediately adjacent to the constriction might increase the local elastic modulus of the matrix, making it more difficult to see proximal displacements because of a local increase in the displacement detection threshold. Because the fibrin gel behaves primarily as an elastic matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), the relationship between acceleration and force is complex and we cannot calculate with any confidence how much total matrix displacement / force would be required to achieve a given parasite velocity and relate this to the displacement detection threshold of the assay.</p><p>The regularity with which the parasite generates the circular zones of attachment on its surface, yielding on average one constriction per body length of motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), could be due to periodic bursts of formin1-mediated actin polymerization at the parasite’s apical tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tosetti et al., 2019</xref>) or to periodic release of adhesins such as TgMIC2 from the micronemes. Alternatively, the observation that constrictions occur back-to-back almost 50% of the time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), may suggest that a new constriction forms at the apical tip before the prior constriction has ended, but this new constriction stalls as the TgMyoA (or possibly TgMyoH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tosetti et al., 2019</xref>) to which it is connected pulls against the adhesive forces of the more posterior previous constriction. Future real-time analysis of actin polymerization and microneme secretion in motile parasites, together with higher sensitivity force mapping, will be necessary to further interrogate the periodic nature of ring assembly.</p><p>The lack of a motility-associated constriction in TgMyoA-deficient parasites could reflect an inability either to assemble ring of adhesins at the apical tip of these parasites or, more likely, to move through the incipient ring once it has formed. Alternatively, it could be that the ring-shaped structures that form during motility are contractile, and contractility requires TgMyoA. The inward deformation of the fibrin matrix towards the constriction reported here is consistent with a contractile ring, as is the physical constriction of the parasite plasma membrane. Intriguingly, the speed of the parasite’s forward motion increases once the constriction passes the halfway point on the parasite’s longitudinal axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This observation suggests that physical squeezing of the tapering posterior end of the parasite by the narrow (and potentially contractile) constriction may contribute to the parasite’s forward motion.</p><p>If the coupling of actin flow to the circular zone of attachment is important for forward motion, how do the parasites lacking TgMIC2 that move do so at near normal speeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gras et al., 2017</xref>) in the absence of constrictions? First, it is possible that both the wild-type and mutant parasites generate small forces distributed over their entire surface (in addition to larger forces that may be generated at the constriction in wildtype), which are collectively sufficient to drive motility but individually below our level of detection. Alternatively, the loss of TgMyoA or TgMIC2 might lead to compensatory changes in the expression of other genes with overlapping or redundant function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Meissner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frénal and Soldati-Favre, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lamarque et al., 2014</xref>). The TgMIC2 KO parasites do in fact show changes in the expression of several other microneme and motility-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gras et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, it is possible that parasites lacking TgMyoA and/or TgMIC2 use a motility mechanism that is entirely different from that of wild-type parasites (<italic>e.g</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Egarter et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gras et al., 2019</xref>) and does not involve a constriction but is nevertheless capable of supporting motility and sustaining the parasite’s lytic cycle. By analogy with observations from animal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lämmermann et al., 2008</xref>), parasites might use different mechanisms for motility in different situations such as squeezing through tight junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barragan et al., 2005</xref>) <italic>vs</italic>. migrating through loose interstitial tissues.

The mutant parasites can still generate relatively long trajectories, but the trajectories take them less far from their starting point than wild-type parasites. As discussed above, attachment to the matrix via a circular ring of adhesion likely contributes to the rotational twisting of the parasite as it moves forward and thereby to the helicity of the parasite’s trajectory. Extensive studies of the helical swimming behavior of bacteria have shown that a curved cell shape and helical trajectory are a particularly efficient way for small cells to move through viscous media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berg and Turner, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ferrero and Lee, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hazell et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaiser and Doetsch, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kimsey and Spielman, 1990</xref>).

Aliquots of 50 µl were flash frozen and stored at –80 C until use. Fibrin gels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Owen et al., 2017</xref>) containing parasites were prepared in Pitta chambers as follows. The parasite culture medium was replaced with LCIS buffer before harvesting via syringe release and filtering. A total of 500 µl of the parasite suspension were pelleted and resuspended in LCIS buffer to achieve a higher parasite concentration. Parasites were mixed with fibrinogen (final fibrinogen concentration of 2.25, 4.5, or 9 mg/ml). LCIS buffer containing thrombin (Sigma, Burlington, MA) and FBS was added to the parasite-fibrinogen suspension for final concentrations of 1.5x10<sup>8</sup> parasites per ml, 1 unit/ml of thrombin, and 10% FBS. The mixture was immediately pipetted into a Pitta chamber and allowed to polymerize at room temperature for three minutes before mounting on the microscope and imaging.</p><p>A Nikon A1R-ER point-scanning confocal microscope was used to visualize the porosity of the fluorescent fibrin matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>), Using Galvano scanning, image (1024×1,024 pixel) stacks were captured with 60×Apo (0.1 µm/pixel, NA 1.49 l) objective with 0.25 µm spacing over 25 µm. The LUNV laser was used at wavelength 633 nm and the pinhole size was 28.10 µm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Image acquisition</title><p>All other imaging was done on a Nikon Eclipse TE300 widefield epifluorescence microscope (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY) equipped with a NanoScanZ piezo Z stage insert (Prior Scientific, Rockland, MA). See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> for details of the imaging setup. Time-lapse video stacks were collected with an iXON Life 888 EMCCD camera (Andor Technology, Belfast, Ireland) using NIS Elements software v.5.11 (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY). Fluorescently labeled parasites were imaged using a pE-4000 LED illuminator (CoolLED, Andover England) and a 89402 Quad filter (Chroma, Bellows Falls, VT). Stacks consisting of individual images (1024 pixel ×384 pixel) captured 0.5–1 µm apart in <italic>z</italic>, covering a total of 10–40 µm, were collected using either a 20×PlanApo λ (0.65 pixel/µm, NA 0.75) or 60×PlanApo λ (0.22 pixel/µm, NA 1.4) objective as described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. The same volume was successively imaged 60–360 times over the course of 64–302 seconds. The camera was set to trigger mode, no binning, readout speed of 35 MHz, conversion gain of 3.8 x, and EM gain setting of 300.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Tracking parasite motility</title><p>Datasets were analyzed in Imaris ×64 v. 9.2.0 (Bitplane AG, Zurich, Switzerland). Fluorescently labeled parasite nuclei were tracked using the ImarisTrack module within a 1018 pixel ×380 pixel region of interest to prevent artifacts from tracking objects near the border. Spot detection used an estimated spot diameter of 3.0×3.0 × 6.0 µm (<italic>x, y, z</italic>). A maximum distance of 6.0 µm and a maximum gap size of 2 frames were applied to the tracking algorithm. Tracks with durations under 10 seconds or displacements of less than 2 µm were discarded to avoid tracking artifacts and parasites moving by Brownian motion, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Leung et al., 2014</xref>). Accurate tracking was confirmed by visual inspection of parasite movements superimposed on their calculated trajectories. All 3D trajectory analysis was done using data from three biological replicates, each consisting of three technical replicates. Student’s t-tests were used to determine statistical significance between samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Fibrin deformation with FIDVC</title><p>The Fast Iterative Digital Volume Correlation (FIDVC) algorithm was used to calculate 3D fibrin displacements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">BarKochba et al., 2015</xref>) by comparing two consecutive image volumes. The image volumes were cropped to 384×384 pixels (<italic>x,y</italic>)×48 slices (<italic>z</italic>) before running FIDVC. The initial interrogation window size was set to 32×32 × 32 and the program was run incrementally. The displacements arrows were plotted using a combination of previously described MATLAB code for 2D quiver color-coding for directionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Owen et al., 2017</xref>) and custom MATLAB code (see accompanying source code file). To determine the displacement detection threshold, we calculated the mean magnitude of the 16,807 displacement vectors for each time point comparison in each dataset. The displacement detection threshold for that dataset was set as three standard deviations above the lowest of these mean values.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Rheology</title><p>A Lumicks C-Trap laser trap was used to determine the viscoelasticity of the fibrin. First, the power density spectrum (PDS) was calculated with 0.91 µm styrene beads in a flow cell. The beads were embedded in a fibrin gel, and a bead was captured in the laser trap. The flow cell was oscillated on the stage in the <italic>y</italic> dimension at different frequencies (1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 Hz), each for 5 s, at a fixed amplitude of 100 nm. The trap position and force in the <italic>y</italic> dimension were captured at 78 kHz. The elastic (in-phase) and viscous (out-of-phase) moduli were calculated using the bead’s force trace. The data were analyzed in R studio. A sliding two-sided window filter, size 78, was applied to both traces.

locomotion on 3D matrixes that are fluorescently labelled and hence allow the detection of their displacements and calculation of force vectors. The authors discover that tachyzoites move by a high degree of continuous constrictions reminiscent of those seen during cell invasion. They probe not only wild type parasites but also two key mutants, which reveal a striking absence of the constrictions and changed trajectories. Due to the uniqueness of eukaryotic gliding motility, its high speed and the importance of infection, this manuscript will be of general interest not only to cell biologists studying cell migration in context of infectious diseases but also appealing to biophysicists looking at cellular force generation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85171.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Soldati-Favre</surname><given-names>Dominique</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01swzsf04</institution-id><institution>University of Geneva</institution></institution-wrap><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p>[Editors' note: this paper was reviewed by <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.reviewcommons.org/">Review Commons</ext-link>.]</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85171.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We thank the reviewers for their thoughtful comments and suggestions.

In the video it looks like it goes completely back, maybe exchange the last panel of the figure with a last frame from the video? Or maybe better: replace with frames from video 2, which is more striking and shows many beads being displaced?</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, Figure 1B now shows frames from the other video (former Video 2), where bead movement is more obvious.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Please add the entire figure S1 to Figure 1. This is important for readers to understand and 'deserves' full figure status. Same for Figure S2.</p></disp-quote><p>We have moved most of former Figure S1 into a new main Figure 2, as suggested. We left the two graphs as Supplemental data (new Figure S1), since these graphs simply show that parasite motility in fibrin is similar to the previously described motility of parasites in Matrigel.</p><p>Figure S2 has been moved to the main text, as suggested (in new Figures 3 and 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) I would encourage the authors to elaborate more on the data on Figure S2. It appears that motile parasites did mostly not exert forces above the level for non-motile parasites; for how much motility did they observe forces? The meaning of the x-axis does not become clear. Are those individual parasites per time point or time points of one parasite or of the analyzed matrix volumes over several parasites? How many parasites where observed? This is stated more clearly later but needs to be done already here.</p></disp-quote><p>We have moved the data in former Suppl. Figure S2 into the main figures, broken it into two parts (Figures 3 and 6B-E) and included a new 3D volume view and additional explanatory detail in the figure legends and text to clarify these points of confusion (lines 100116, 500-507, 564-570).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Please change 0.042 μm into 42 nm etc</p></disp-quote><p>Done, lines 113-116.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Please move some of the data in Figure S8 to the main figures e.g. Figure 4, where it would make a nice contrast / comparison to the mic2 mutant. Please also put a WT for comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>Done; see revised Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) I wonder if the defect in directional migration of the mic2 mutant is also partly due to the parasite not being able to squeeze through narrow matrix pores and hence is deflected more often. While I understand (and agree) with the authors observation (interpretation) of the wt parasites not squeezing but pulling, it's hard to think that such squeezing would not still play a part.</p></disp-quote><p>The idea that the parasite needs to squeeze its way through pores in the matrix is intuitively appealing (and, in fact, what we had expected to see) but there is currently no data to support it. If squeezing were occurring, we should see an outward deformation of the matrix as the parasite pushes on the matrix fibers, but this is something we have never observed. We therefore think it is unlikely that the loss of directional migration is due to an inability to squeeze through pores in order to “stay on track”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Hueschen et al. is now on BioRXiv</p></disp-quote><p>The BioRXiv citation has been added (lines 293, 320).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) The shaving off of antibodies could be brought into context to the work on sporozoites by Aliprandini Nat Micro 2018 and on trypanosomes by Enstler Cell 2007 (but not a must)</p></disp-quote><p>The two studies mentioned are intriguing and may be related to the well-documented anterior to posterior flux and shedding of GPI-anchored proteins from the surface of gliding Toxoplasma tachyzoites. What we are showing here is slightly different: the fluorescent antibodies on the cell surface seem to be “shaved” backwards at the constriction, much like surface bound antibodies are shaved backwards at the moving junction during invasion (Dubremetz 1985). In other words, there is a discontinuity in the density of surface staining at the constriction/junction. All of these processes may be related, but this is only speculation at this point and since the shaving of antibody at the constriction is a minor point of the paper (meant only to illustrate another similarity between 3D motility and invasion), we would prefer not to try to tie it to these other observations which may or may not be related.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) Anterior-posterior flux: best experimental evidence for this is Quadt et al. ACS Nano 2016 for Plasmodium and Stadler MBoC 2017 for Toxoplasma. The common observations and differences could be discussed as they pertain to the current study</p></disp-quote><p>These two papers are now cited in our discussion of the linear motor model along with our speculation that the constriction reflects the motility-relevant zone of engagement of this rearward flux with ligands in the matrix (lines 319-322).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) The loss of mic2 could lead to the loss of the capability to form discrete adhesion sites that reveal themselves as the observed rings in 3D. I suggest to be careful to hypothesize that the absence of this and MyoA reveals a completely different motility mechanism. To me it seems more likely that the absence of the proteins means that the existing mechanism doesn't work perfectly any more, ie the highly tuned migration machinery misses a key part and malfunctions.</p></disp-quote><p>The paragraph in question offered possible explanations for how parasites lacking the constriction could in fact move at normal speeds, not that motility was negatively affected. We have tried to make this more clear in the revision (lines 352-354), before describing the 3 possible explanations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) Maybe reflect on whether 'search strategy' might be a better word than 'guidance system'</p></disp-quote><p>We have replaced the term “guidance system” in the title (lines 1-2), abstract (lines 3336) and introduction (line 75) with more conservative references to the ability of the parasite to move directionally. The only place the term “guidance system” remains is in the final paragraph of the discussion, which is more speculative in nature, and where we now suggest it to be “part of” a guidance system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3</p><p>1) Extracellular matrix choice. The authors track the parasite movement first on Matrigel and next on fibrin. The authors exemplify the fibrin matrix on an image on Suppl. Figure 1 that shows a relatively quite large pore size, similar or greater than parasite size. Was the analysis done on parasites touching the fibers?</p></disp-quote><p>Previous Suppl Figure 1A showed a confocal image at only one z-plane which did indeed give the impression that the pores are relatively large. We have changed this image to a more informative maximum intensity projection (New Figure 2A) and included a video showing the entire imaging volume (new Video 4), which makes clear that the matrix contains many small fibers and that the pores are smaller than the previous single z-plane suggested, so the parasite is likely to be near to or in contact with fibers of the matrix at all times. In Suppl Figure 1D we purposely used a less dense matrix in order to make the matrix deformation more obvious to the eye. The density of the matrix in Figure 1D has been added to the legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Lack of movement of parasites. In many figures of the articles it is revealed that the majority of parasites in fibrin remain immobile (Suppl Figure 1, Figure 2, Video 5, Suppl Figure 2, Suppl Figure 8). The number of immobile parasites in Matrigel seem to be lower than in fibrin (Suppl Figure 1B) although no quantification is shown. How does the movement in fibrin and Matrigel compare? How does this compares with movement in stiff substrates in 2D? Could the lack of movement be caused by the large pore site in fibrin?.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a panel to Suppl. Figure S1 showing that the proportions of parasites moving in fibrin vs Matrigel are not significantly different. In fact, none of our measured motility parameters are different between fibrin and Matrigel. Not all parasites move during the 80s of capture used for these matrix comparisons; some of the parasites are likely dead, but others may have simply not initiated motility during this time window. We typically see between 30-50% movement in 3D motility assays of this duration and similar numbers in 2D trail assays although we have not explored the effect of 2D substrate stiffness.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Considering parasite movement: The authors consider that 3SD is a cutoff for considering parasite displacement. However, several timepoints fall behind this cutoff in the control without parasites and the knockouts with restricted movement.</p></disp-quote><p>We chose three standard deviations from the mean as our cutoff, in order to eliminate 99.7% of the noise. Since we calculate 16807 vectors per comparison, this leaves us with ~50 vectors above the cutoff even in samples with no moving parasites. Not surprisingly, these vectors are found at random locations in the volume. New Figures 3 and 6B-E and the associated text (lines 100-116, 500-507, 564-570) hopefully clarify this point adequately; it is quite obvious in Figure 3C which vectors correspond to parasite-induced displacements and which correspond to random noise.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Imaging: Although the authors show a very detailed an illustrative table of the imaging acquisition conditions in table 1, it is unclear which microscope the authors used, as two microscopes are described in the methods section, a Nikon Eclipse TE300 widefield microscope and a Nikon AIR-ER confocal microscope. Which images were taken in each system? For the location of Table1 in the manuscript it seems that most images were taken with the Nikon Eclipse. Although this microscope has control over z, the images are quite noisy. How does the lack of confocallity might interfere with the analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>The high temporal resolution needed for 3D force mapping of cells that move several microns per second meant that all these experiments were done using a widefield microscope equipped with a piezo-driven z-stage. The fastest confocal we tested was not as fast as the widefield. However, spatial resolution suffered as a result of having to use widefield, particularly in z, and this did indeed make our data more noisy as suggested by the reviewer. This may be why we were unable to detect fibrin deformation in the knockout parasites. The only data collected on the confocal microscope were those shown in new Figure 2A; we have clarified this on lines 421-427. Future studies will explore other imaging modalities such as light sheet microscopy in an attempt to achieve better spatial resolution while maintaining the high frame rates required for force mapping.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Nuclear constriction. The authors did not show any image or video exemplifying this.</p></disp-quote><p>The images in Suppl. Figure 6 have been replaced with data that show the nuclear shape more clearly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Knockouts: The authors did not explain how did they generated the knockouts in the methods or did now show the efficacy of the knockout in any figure. If these knockout strains were a gift (I did not find it on the manuscript), the authors should indicate this more explicitly and reference the manuscript where they were described for the first time.</p></disp-quote><p>Both of the stable knockout lines used were generous gifts from Dr. Markus Meissner. We cited the original papers describing these lines in the text and thanked Dr. Meissner for providing them in the Acknowledgements section. We have now included an additional citation at the first mention of each of the knockouts (lines 174, 188) to make it even clearer where they came from.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Discussion: Although the experimental methodology is sound the authors seem to make many assumptions and speculations on the discussion as how the appearance of this ring/constriction on the parasite translates into the helical movement of the parasite or the coupling of the ring with the cytoskeleton. Live imaging of actin dynamics or mathematical modelling could be used to support their claims.</p></disp-quote><p>We imaged parasites expressing the actin chromobody but were unable to visualize a ring of actin at the constriction. However, due to the speed of the parasites and the need for a fast frame rate (~15 ms per image) to reconstruct the 3D image volumes, the actin chromobody signal could be under our threshold of detection. We need to develop new, more sensitive ways to visualize proteins at the constriction, and this will be a major focus of our work going forward. &gt; We fully concur that mathematical modeling such as the work recently done by Hueschen et al. on actin flow during motility and by Pavlou et al. on the role of parasite twist during invasion has much to offer our understanding of these processes. Similar approaches may provide support to the speculations (not claims!) we offer in the discussion and, although beyond the scope of the current study, are a direction we intend to take this work in the future – particularly if we are able to improve the signal-to-noise in our force mapping.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Quantification of experiments missing: Overall, the main figures lack quantification that sometimes can be found in the supplemental information and sometimes is missing. I would suggest including quantifications next to the events described in the main figures). Likewise, some of the supplemental figures lack quantification (Suppl Figure 7, how many parasites showed this protein trail?)… Overall, the authors should indicate how many parasites were quantified in each figure. As they usually refer to number of constrictions. This is overall a problem in main figures 3 and 5. Or for example in Suppl Figure 5: How many parasites were quantified in this figure? The authors only show number of constrictions, and as the authors described, a parasite might have more than one constriction.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added further detail on the number of events/parasites quantified to both the figure legends and text throughout the manuscript, including the specific examples noted by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Videos: The videos lack scale of time. Although this that can be found in main figures, it would be helpful to have the annotation in the videos. Likewise, some references for positions in videos, such as the cross found on Figure 1 would be helpful for parasites that present little movement.</p></disp-quote><p>Time stamps have been added to all videos as suggested, and crosshairs have been applied to new Figure 1B and Suppl. Figures 7 and 8 to make the movement of the parasites more obvious.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4</p><p>1) I am not sure about the premise that the &quot;linear model&quot; of gliding motility predicts uniformly forward direction. Previous videos of 2D gliding show sporadic motility, changes in direction, or even reversal of direction are not infrequent. However, the current model could explain these behaviors if one or more of the following conditions occur: 1) myosin motors might be coordinating activated to initiate motility, followed by relaxation, 2) actin fibers might be transiently arrayed in clusters that change density and polarity over time, or 3) adhesins, necessary to generate traction, might vary in density and spatial orientation across the surface of the parasite. Changes in these properties would be expected result in zones that promote or disfavor local forces needed for motility – and reversal of direction could occur when forward forces relax and external elastic forces predominate.</p></disp-quote><p>The potential explanations offered by the reviewer for the frequent changes in direction of zoite motility are intriguing and worth exploring experimentally. The ability of actin fibers to periodically reverse polarity, or the presence of counteracting elastic forces are not components of the “standard” linear motor model of motility but, if they occur, could explain the patch gliding phenomenon and help refine our understanding of motility. Since the data in this manuscript do not in the end either strongly support or disprove the linear motor model – this may ultimately require higher resolution force mapping methods that can detect the forces responsible for forward motion – we have de-emphasized potential problems with the model in the introduction and deleted specific discussion of patch gliding as one of these problems (lines 61-64).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The model favored here: &quot;we propose that force is generated, at least in part, by the rearward translocation of the subset of actin filaments that are coupled to adhesins at the circular ring of attachment&quot; does not seem fundamentally different from the current model – other than it focuses the forces at a critical junction that the parasite migrates through. It seems to me that this is a refinement of the current model and not a replacement. As such, the authors might focus on how their data improve the model rather than pointing out prior deficiencies (although I get that editors like this style).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and have modified the text to be more circumspect on this issue (lines 319-331).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The finding that the absence of MIC2 affects the constriction formed by inward pull on the matrix is quite convincing and interesting. However, mutants that cannot form the constriction, still move at similar speeds. This suggest that the inward force is different from the motor itself and affects its ability to impart direction, rather than the ability to move per see. The interpretation of the MyoA defect is complicated since motility is certain to be disrupted, the potential role of an independent inward force may no longer be detectable.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer on this point as well: the forces we have observed to date cannot explain forward motion. We stated this previously and have now emphasized the point further (lines 322-324, 352-357). Because the parasite is moving forward, the forces responsible must be there but are likely below our threshold of detection. In order to visualize these forces, we are going to need new imaging modalities that can achieve better signal-tonoise than our current setup at the high frame rates required for force mapping. That said, we new data we have added to the manuscript are at least consistent with the narrow diameter ring of the constriction making a contribution to the parasite’s forward motion (new Suppl. Figure 10 and lines 347-351)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Although I agree with the authors that there are striking parallels between motility in 3D and cell invasion, I am not certain about their conclusion that the construction seen during cell entry is due to the parasite pulling inwardly. When entering the host cell, the parasite must also navigate the dense subcortical actin network, which likely also aids in forming the constriction that is observed. It would be interesting to record this pattern under conditions where host cell actin is destabilized while parasite motility is intact- for example using cytochalasin D to treat wild type host cells during invasion by resistant parasites.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not conclude that the constriction during invasion is due to the parasites pulling inwardly, but we do propose that this possibility needs to be considered based on the noted similarities between invasion and motility and our clear (and somewhat surprising) demonstration that the moving parasite pulls on the matrix at the constriction during motility. During invasion, the parasite may indeed have to squeeze through the dense subcortical network – or it may use secreted proteins to loosen up the network so that no squeezing is required. We just don’t know, and our purpose here was simply to put this alternative possibility on the table because we believe it is a viable possibility that follows from the data presented.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion of testing what happens when cytoD resistant parasites invade in the presence of cytoD; this is a clever idea that we will likely pursue in future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Not all of the color patterns shown in Figure 1A are consistent with the model. For example, GAP40 (yellow) does not appear in the model, there are two MLC boxes, but they are different shades, and ELC1/2 does not appear in the model.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for catching this error; it has now been fixed.</p></body></sub-article></article>
