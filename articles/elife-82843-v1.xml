enzymes. We previously showed that the rate-limiting and first oxygen-dependent enzyme of the committed cholesterol synthesis pathway, squalene monooxygenase (SM), can undergo partial proteasomal degradation that renders it constitutively active. Here, we show hypoxia is a physiological trigger for this truncation, which occurs through a two-part mechanism: (1) increased targeting of SM to the proteasome via stabilization of the E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCHF6 and (2) accumulation of the SM substrate, squalene, which impedes the complete degradation of SM and liberates its truncated form. This preserves SM activity and downstream pathway flux during hypoxia. These results uncover a feedforward mechanism that allows SM to accommodate fluctuating substrate levels and may contribute to its widely reported oncogenic properties.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells need cholesterol to work properly but too much cholesterol is harmful and can contribute to atherosclerosis (narrowing of blood vessels), cancer and other diseases. Cells therefore carefully control the activity of the enzymes that are involved in making cholesterol, including an enzyme known as squalene monooxygenase.</p><p>When the level of cholesterol in a cell rises, a protein called MARCHF6 adds molecules of ubiquitin to squalene monooxygenase. These molecules act as tags that direct the enzyme to be destroyed by a machine inside cells, known as the proteasome, thereby preventing further (unnecessary) production of cholesterol.</p><p>Previous studies found that squalene monooxygenase is sometimes only partially broken down to make a shorter (truncated) form of the enzyme that is permanently active, even when the level of cholesterol in the cell is high. However, it was unclear what triggers this partial breakdown.</p><p>The process of making cholesterol uses a lot of oxygen, yet many cancer cells thrive in tumours with low levels of oxygen. Here, Coates et al. used biochemical and cell biology approaches to study the effect of low oxygen levels on the activity of squalene monooxygenase in human cells. The experiments revealed that low oxygen levels trigger squalene monooxygenase to be partially degraded to make the truncated form of the enzyme.</p><p>Firstly, MARCHF6 accumulates and adds ubiquitin to the enzyme to accelerate its delivery to the proteasome. Secondly, as the proteasome starts to degrade the enzyme, a build-up of squalene molecules impedes further breakdown of the enzyme. This mechanism preserves squalene monooxygenase activity when oxygen levels drop in cells, which may compensate for temporary oxygen shortfalls and allow cells to continue to make cholesterol.</p><p>Squalene monooxygenase is overactive in individuals with a wide variety of diseases including fatty liver and prostate cancer. Drugs that block squalene monooxygenase activity have been shown to stop cancer cells from growing, but unfortunately these drugs are also toxic to mammals. These findings suggest that reducing the activity of squalene monooxygenase in more subtle ways, such as stopping it from being partially degraded, may be a more viable treatment strategy for cancer and other diseases associated with high levels of cholesterol.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Squalene monooxygenase</kwd><kwd>Cholesterol</kwd><kwd>Hypoxia</kwd><kwd>proteasome</kwd><kwd>protein degradation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100015539</institution-id><institution>Australian Government</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Training Program Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Coates</surname><given-names>Hudson W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001773</institution-id><institution>University of New South Wales</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Scientia PhD Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Capell-Hattam</surname><given-names>Isabelle M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001104</institution-id><institution>RANZCOG Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Mary Elizabeth Courier Research Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Farrell</surname><given-names>Rhonda</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001171</institution-id><institution>Cancer Institute NSW</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Career Development Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Byrne</surname><given-names>Frances L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant DP170101178</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>Andrew J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009287</institution-id><institution>NSW Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator Development Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>Andrew J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001171</institution-id><institution>Cancer Institute NSW</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021/CDF1120</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Byrne</surname><given-names>Frances L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Hypoxic accumulation of squalene, the substrate of squalene monooxygenase, triggers its proteasomal truncation to a constitutively active variant that preserves downstream sterol synthesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cholesterol is an essential component of mammalian cell membranes, yet its aberrant accumulation is detrimental (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baigent et al., 2010</xref>). Most cellular cholesterol arises from an energetically expensive biosynthetic pathway requiring eleven oxygen molecules and over one hundred ATP equivalents per molecule of product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, many intermediates of this pathway are toxic in excess (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Porter and Herman, 2011</xref>). Coordinated regulation of cholesterol synthesis enzymes is therefore vital to ensure the pathway is active only when required, and sufficient substrates and cofactors are available to maintain flux through the full length of the pathway.</p><p>Squalene monooxygenase (SM, also known as squalene epoxidase or SQLE, EC:1.14.14.17) catalyzes the rate-limiting conversion of squalene to monooxidosqualene in the committed cholesterol synthesis pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gill et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chua et al., 2020</xref>). This reaction is the first in the pathway to require molecular oxygen, with the introduced epoxide group ultimately forming the signature C3-hydroxyl group of cholesterol. SM can also act a second time on monooxidosqualene to produce dioxidosqualene, the precursor of the potent regulatory oxysterol 24(<italic>S</italic>),25-epoxycholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bai et al., 1992</xref>). As a flux-controlling enzyme, SM is subject to metabolic regulation at both the transcriptional level via sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Horton et al., 2003</xref>) and the post-translational level via ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gill et al., 2011</xref>). The latter is mediated by the N-terminal regulatory domain of SM (SM-N100), which senses lipid levels in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and accelerates or attenuates SM degradation in response to excess cholesterol or squalene, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chua et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yoshioka et al., 2020</xref>). These reciprocal feedback and feedforward loops fine-tune SM activity according to metabolic supply and demand. SM is typically fully degraded by the proteasome; however, incomplete proteolysis produces a truncated form of SM (trunSM) that lacks a large portion of the lipid-sensing SM-N100 domain but retains the full catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Coates et al., 2021</xref>). This renders trunSM cholesterol-resistant and therefore constitutively active. Although truncation is induced by the SM inhibitor NB-598, human cell lines express similar levels of full-length and truncated SM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Coates et al., 2021</xref>). This points to the existence of an unknown physiological trigger for truncation.</p><p>Clarifying the mechanisms of SM regulation is particularly pertinent given the importance of the enzyme, and cholesterol more generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kuzu et al., 2016</xref>), in oncogenesis. Overexpression of the SM gene <italic>SQLE</italic> is associated with greater invasiveness and lethality in breast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2016</xref>), prostate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stopsack et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pudova et al., 2020</xref>), and pancreatic cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai et al., 2021</xref>), amongst others. At the protein level, aberrant SM expression is implicated in colorectal cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">He et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jun et al., 2021</xref>) and the development of both nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). Given its key role in oxygen-dependent cholesterol synthesis, SM may be particularly critical for cancer cell survival during hypoxia, which is common in the poorly vascularized cores of solid tumors and often associated with poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rankin and Giaccia, 2016</xref>). In support of this idea, SM inhibition sensitizes breast and colorectal cancer cells to hypoxia-induced cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haider et al., 2016</xref>). Although hypoxic cells tend to accumulate cholesterol, there are conflicting reports on changes in biosynthetic flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mukodani et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parathath et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, with the notable exception of the early pathway enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nguyen et al., 2007</xref>), the effects of hypoxia on individual biosynthetic enzymes are unknown. It is also unclear if these might be perturbed in a tumor context to favor continued cholesterol synthesis and cell proliferation.</p><p>Here, we show hypoxic conditions induce SM truncation in a variety of cell lines through a combination of accelerated proteasomal degradation and inhibition of its complete proteolysis. This occurs due to the accumulation of both MARCHF6, the major E3 ubiquitin ligase for SM, and squalene, which impedes SM degradation through a mechanism involving the SM-N100 regulatory domain. Taken together, our findings point towards a role for the constitutively active trunSM in adaptations to hypoxic conditions and suggest it may contribute to the oncogenic impacts of SM activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Oxygen availability regulates SM truncation</title><p>We previously showed that SM is post-translationally regulated by its substrate squalene and pathway end-product cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gill et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yoshioka et al., 2020</xref>). The enzyme also undergoes partial proteasomal degradation of its N-terminus to liberate a truncated protein (trunSM) that is cholesterol-resistant and thus constitutively active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Coates et al., 2021</xref>), although physiological triggers are unknown. As SM is a rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol synthesis and catalyzes its first oxygen-dependent reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), we tested if SM protein levels are affected by oxygen availability. Incubation of HEK293T cells under hypoxic conditions (1% O<sub>2</sub>) stabilized hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF1α; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and upregulated its target genes <italic>VEGF</italic> and <italic>CA9</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), confirming the induction of a hypoxic response. We also noted a striking increase in SM truncation caused by the disappearance of full-length SM and a four-fold accumulation of trunSM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This led to trunSM becoming the predominant SM variant, as indicated by the elevated trunSM:SM ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Hypoxia-induced truncation of SM increased over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>) and according to the magnitude of oxygen deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>), with the net result of increased total enzyme levels (expressed as the sum of full-length SM and trunSM levels; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Importantly, trunSM accumulation was greater under the severely hypoxic conditions characteristic of solid tumors (0.5–2% O<sub>2</sub>) than the ‘physoxic’ conditions experienced by normal human tissues in situ (3–7.5% O<sub>2</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McKeown, 2014</xref>). This suggested that increased SM truncation is a feature of pathophysiological hypoxia. We also noted our experiments, which for technical reasons used a variety of cell seeding densities, showed variation in the normoxic trunSM:SM ratio. Indeed, we confirmed SM truncation is increased at higher cell densities and accompanied by slight stabilization of HIF1α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>), consistent with other reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sheta et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dayan et al., 2009</xref>).

Squalene is converted to monooxidosqualene by the rate-limiting enzyme squalene monooxygenase (SM, grey) and cyclized by lanosterol synthase (LSS). Lanosterol is then converted by lanosterol 14α-demethylase (LDM) to testis meiosis-activating sterol (T-MAS), which is ultimately converted to cholesterol.

Like full-length SM, levels of SM-N100-GFP-V5 were reduced by hypoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Proteasomal inhibition using MG132 increased the levels of SM and SM-N100-GFP-V5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and blocked their hypoxia-induced degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), confirming this degradation occurs via the proteasome. We also noted that protein levels and hypoxia-induced accumulation of trunSM were ablated by MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>), consistent with this protein arising from partial proteasomal proteolysis of SM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Coates et al., 2021</xref>).

To identify residues required for hypoxia-induced degradation of SM, we utilized protein constructs with mutations of previously identified ubiquitination sites. The magnitude of hypoxic degradation was blunted by disruption of Lys-82/90/100, a cluster of redundant ubiquitination sites previously found to promote truncation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Coates et al., 2021</xref>), but not by disruption of Lys-290 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hornbeck et al., 2015</xref>). Non-canonical cysteine, serine and threonine ubiquitination sites required for the cholesterol-induced degradation of SM (SM-N100 C/S/T) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chua et al., 2019</xref>) also contributed to hypoxia-induced degradation, suggesting multiple ubiquitin signals are involved. Contrary to the expectation that loss of ubiquitination would stabilize SM, the mutation of Lys-82/90/100 reduced SM levels under normoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

As there is extensive precedent for metabolic regulation of cholesterol synthesis enzymes and the pathway contains multiple oxygen-dependent reactions, we considered if accumulation of a pathway intermediate might underlie this phenomenon. Hypoxia-induced accumulation of trunSM occurred in cells incubated under both lipoprotein-replete and lipoprotein-deficient conditions, in which the cholesterol synthesis pathway is active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). However, the magnitude of this accumulation was diminished when lipoprotein-deficient cells were co-treated with a statin to inhibit HMGCR and the early cholesterol synthesis pathway. By contrast, there was no effect of sterol depletion on the hypoxia-induced reduction in full-length SM. This indicated that an intermediate or end-product of cholesterol synthesis promotes the partial rather than complete degradation of SM at the proteasome. We therefore turned our attention to the SM substrate squalene, as it allosterically regulates SM degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yoshioka et al., 2020</xref>) and is the substrate for the first oxygen-dependent step of cholesterol synthesis.

Accumulation of trunSM was also induced by the oxygenated squalene derivatives monooxidosqualene and dioxidosqualene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) but not by its saturated analogue squalane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>), which has similar biophysical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hauß et al., 2002</xref>). This indicated truncation is promoted by squalene and its structurally related molecules in a specific manner, rather than through bulk membrane effects caused by lipid accumulation.

There was no significant accumulation of the truncated fragment in cells transfected with wild-type SM, likely due to clearance of exogenous squalene by the overexpressed protein and downstream enzymes.</p><p>To confirm if endogenously synthesized squalene is sufficient to trigger SM truncation, cells were treated with inhibitors of the relevant cholesterol synthesis enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The SM inhibitor NB-598 was excluded because of its ability to induce truncation through direct binding and stabilization of the SM catalytic domain that renders it resistant to proteasomal unfolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Padyana et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Coates et al., 2021</xref>). Inhibiting squalene synthesis from farnesyl diphosphate (TAK-475) increased trunSM levels but abolished its hypoxia-induced accumulation, whereas significant accumulation still occurred under conditions where squalene synthesis was preserved: inhibition of lanosterol synthesis from monooxidosqualene (BIBB 515), or inhibition of lanosterol demethylation (GR70585X) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E</xref>). This confirmed that lanosterol, which also accumulates during hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nguyen et al., 2007</xref>), has no effect on SM truncation. We further noted that the inhibition of squalene or lanosterol synthesis, but not lanosterol demethylation, increased the levels of full-length SM and SM-N100-GFP-V5 under normoxic conditions. This was consistent with our previous finding that farnesyl-containing molecules, including monooxidosqualene, dioxidosqualene and a squalene-derived photoaffinity probe, stabilize SM via its regulatory domain in a similar manner to squalene itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yoshioka et al., 2020</xref>). The increase in normoxic trunSM levels upon treatment with TAK-475 and BIBB 515 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E</xref>) suggested farnesyl-containing cholesterol synthesis intermediates can also induce SM truncation. Nevertheless, as the primary substrate of oxygen-dependent SM catalysis, squalene is likely to be the major driver of this process under hypoxic conditions.</p><p>SM contains two known squalene binding sites: the SM-N100 regulatory domain and the active site of the catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yoshioka et al., 2020</xref>). As the SM inhibitor NB-598 induces SM truncation by binding and stabilizing the catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Coates et al., 2021</xref>), we considered if squalene exerts its effects on truncation through a similar mechanism. To eliminate the contribution of the SM-N100 domain, we transfected <italic>SQLE</italic>-knockout cells with an ectopic form of trunSM (SM[ΔN65]-V5). Consistent with past findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yoshioka et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Padyana et al., 2019</xref>), this construct was stabilized by NB-598 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). However, significant stabilization did not occur when cells expressing an inactive SM(ΔN65)-V5 mutant (Y195F) were treated with squalene. We concluded that squalene promotes SM truncation via the SM-N100 regulatory domain, rather than direct binding and stabilization of the SM catalytic domain. Previous work showed squalene directly binds the SM-N100 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yoshioka et al., 2020</xref>), with the hydrophobic re-entrant loop (residues ~ 15–40) as the most logical interaction site. Aromatic residues and leucine residues line the SM active site and are required for catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Padyana et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting they directly interact with squalene. Similar residues in the SM-N100 re-entrant loop may likewise be involved in squalene binding, and possibly the partial degradation of SM. We therefore mutated phenylalanine and leucine residues in the re-entrant loop to test if they are required for SM truncation. However, these mutations, either alone or in combination, did not prevent the hypoxia-induced accumulation of truncated SM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). This indicated that partial degradation of SM is independent of these putative squalene-binding residues, with further work required to clarify the mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>SM activity is preserved during hypoxia</title><p>trunSM has a long half-life and is constitutively active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Coates et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that hypoxia-induced truncation of SM is a compensatory mechanism to preserve enzymatic activity during oxygen shortfalls. To investigate this possibility, Huh7 cells were radiolabeled with [<sup>14</sup>C]-acetate and downstream flux through cholesterol synthesis was assayed using thin-layer chromatography. This cell line was chosen due to its tissue of origin, the liver, being a major site of cholesterol synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Turley et al., 1995</xref>), as well as its robust hypoxia-induced truncation of SM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F</xref>).

By contrast, upstream accumulation of squalene was minimal even after 24 hr. This confirmed that despite its dependence on oxygen, SM activity is preserved during hypoxia, likely due to its truncation to a degradation-resistant form.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>SM activity is preserved during hypoxia.</title><p>Huh7 cells were labelled with 2 µCi [<sup>14</sup>C]-acetate and incubated under normoxic or hypoxic conditions for the indicated times.

We previously showed that partial proteasomal degradation of SM produces a truncated and constitutively active form of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Coates et al., 2021</xref>). In this study, we identified hypoxia as a physiological trigger for trunSM formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Hypoxia-induced truncation occurs through a two-part mechanism: (1) increased levels of MARCHF6, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets SM to the proteasome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and (2) accumulation of squalene, which impedes the complete degradation of SM and yields trunSM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Truncation of SM preserves its activity and facilitates downstream pathway flux during hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Taken together, our results point towards SM truncation as an adaptive mechanism to clear excess substrate, as well as a likely contributor to the widely reported oncogenic properties of SM.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cholesterol synthesis during hypoxia</title><p>Hypoxia places great strain on metabolic processes and necessitates the strict allotment of available oxygen and energy reserves. Cholesterol synthesis is a particularly resource-intensive pathway requiring eleven oxygen molecules and over one hundred ATP equivalents per molecule of product. However, there are conflicting reports on changes in overall flux from acetyl-CoA to cholesterol during hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mukodani et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parathath et al., 2011</xref>), suggestive of cell type-specific responses. The small number of studies into individual biosynthetic enzymes nevertheless indicate their activity is suppressed by hypoxia at multiple regulatory levels, and this is supported by the accumulation of various pathway intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nguyen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kucharzewska et al., 2015</xref>). Lanosterol 14α-demethylase, which requires three oxygen molecules for catalysis, is transcriptionally downregulated by HIF2α and the hypoxia-induced long non-coding RNA <italic>lincNORS</italic>, contributing to the characteristic accumulation of lanosterol under hypoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>). Lanosterol in turn triggers ubiquitin-dependent degradation of the early cholesterol synthesis enzyme HMGCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nguyen et al., 2007</xref>), suppressing further oxygen consumption by the pathway. Our study establishes that oxygen availability also regulates SM, a rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol synthesis and the first to require molecular oxygen.</p><p>We found that SM is transcriptionally downregulated in hypoxic HEK293T cells but not MDA-MB-231 cells, consistent with previously reported cell-type specific changes in <italic>SQLE</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haider et al., 2016</xref>). This accounted in part for the hypoxia-induced decline in full-length SM levels, although reduced <italic>SQLE</italic> translation through mechanisms such as mTOR suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2006</xref>) cannot be ruled out as a contributing factor. We also found that like HMGCR, the SM protein is targeted for proteasomal degradation during hypoxia. However, in stark contrast to HMGCR, the net result of SM degradation under these conditions is the preservation of, or even an increase in, the number of enzyme molecules available for catalysis. Indeed, SM activity is preserved during hypoxia, with only minimal accumulation of its substrate squalene. This is enabled by increased partial proteolysis of SM to form trunSM, which lacks a functional SM-N100 regulatory domain and has a dramatically extended half-life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Coates et al., 2021</xref>). Disruption of the SM-N100 domain also renders trunSM resistant to cholesterol-induced degradation, which is central to the metabolic regulation of full-length SM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gill et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Coates et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, hypoxia-induced SM truncation ensures total enzyme levels remain constant even under cholesterol-replete conditions that typically trigger its degradation.</p><p>Although preservation of oxygen-dependent SM activity during hypoxia appears paradoxical, there are numerous advantages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). During transient or low-level hypoxia, it likely promotes compensatory cholesterol synthesis and maintenance of cell viability. Supporting this idea, hypoxia-induced cell death is exacerbated by SM inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haider et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, the longevity of trunSM would enable rapid resumption of pathway activity when normoxia is restored. During long-term or severe hypoxia, where there is insufficient oxygen for flux through downstream cholesterol synthesis, the role of trunSM in hypoxia may shift towards efficient clearance of squalene. While generally considered an inert intermediate, excess squalene induces ER stress and is toxic in cells lacking SM activity or the ability to sequester squalene to lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hong et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mahoney et al., 2019</xref>). A secondary effect of squalene clearance is its downstream conversion to lanosterol, which accelerates degradation of HMGCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nguyen et al., 2007</xref>). We and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nguyen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kucharzewska et al., 2015</xref>) observed a stark contrast between acute lanosterol accumulation and minimal squalene accumulation during hypoxia, supporting both of these putative functions for trunSM. Thus, hypoxia-induced SM truncation is likely critical for curtailing HMGCR activity and flux through oxygen-intensive cholesterol synthesis. Stabilization of MARCHF6, which targets lanosterol 14α-demethylase for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Scott et al., 2020</xref>), may also contribute to hypoxic lanosterol accumulation. SM activity also promotes synthesis of dioxidosqualene and ultimately 24(<italic>S</italic>),25-epoxycholesterol, a potent suppressor of cholesterol accretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wong et al., 2008</xref>).

This is enhanced during hypoxia by a novel ubiquitin signal at the Lys-82/90/100 cluster and accumulation of MARCHF6, which facilitates the basal and metabolically-regulated degradation of SM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Foresti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zelcer et al., 2014</xref>). Non-canonical ubiquitination sites required for cholesterol-induced SM degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chua et al., 2019</xref>) also contribute to its hypoxic degradation, which can be reconciled by a combination of increased MARCHF6 levels and the sterol-replete conditions in which these experiments were performed. The mechanism by which hypoxia stabilizes MARCHF6 requires further study. Interestingly, NADPH binds MARCHF6 and activates its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nguyen et al., 2022</xref>). Hypoxic cells upregulate NADPH production to counter oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Samanta et al., 2016</xref>), which may contribute to MARCHF6-dependent proteasomal targeting of SM under these conditions.</p><p>A key finding of this study is that upon hypoxic delivery of SM to the proteasome, accumulated squalene inhibits its complete degradation and liberates the constitutively active trunSM. This feedforward mechanism, by which the substrate of SM preserves its activity, is mediated by the SM-N100 regulatory domain. It also functions under normoxic conditions, where it likely buffers against transient squalene fluctuations. Hypoxia-induced trunSM accumulation persists even when MARCHF6 is depleted; therefore, squalene also impedes SM degradation when other E3 ubiquitin ligases target it to the proteasome. These other regulators, and the factors controlling their ubiquitination of SM, await future discovery and may shed light on how the SM-N100 domain undergoes MARCHF6-independent proteasomal degradation during hypoxia. Taken together, our findings expand on the ability of the SM-N100 domain to sense ER membrane lipids and regulate SM degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Although hypoxia and lipid accumulation trigger ER stress and changes to proteostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bi et al., 2005</xref>), the ability of squalene and other farnesyl-containing compounds to allosterically bind the SM-N100 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yoshioka et al., 2020</xref>) strongly suggests truncation is induced directly by squalene, rather than bulk membrane effects. The specificity of this effect is supported by the inability of the saturated squalene analog, squalane, to induce truncation. Squalene is the most likely of the farnesyl-containing cholesterol synthesis intermediates to accumulate under both normal and hypoxic conditions, owing to the rate-limiting and oxygen-dependent nature of SM activity. However, our current and previous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yoshioka et al., 2020</xref>) data suggest a farnesyl group alone is sufficient to promote truncation. Precisely how this lipophilic moiety interferes with SM degradation is unknown, although interaction with the membrane-embedded SM-N100 re-entrant loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Howe et al., 2015</xref>) is a likely possibility. We ruled out putative squalene-binding residues within this loop as a requirement for hypoxia-induced truncation, although a stronger understanding of the exact squalene binding site in SM-N100 is needed to further test its role in SM truncation.</p><p>Previously, we reported farnesyl-containing compounds also blunt the MARCHF6-mediated ubiquitination of SM-N100, leading to stabilization of full-length SM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yoshioka et al., 2020</xref>). The existence of dual mechanisms enabling squalene to sustain SM activity is intriguing, particularly as trunSM formation is itself dependent on ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Coates et al., 2021</xref>). One possibility is that truncation is stimulated at a lower squalene threshold than the inhibition of SM ubiquitination, allowing for a biphasic response to accumulating substrate. We found squalene is at the lower limit of detection in normoxic cells, and only the highly sensitive gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method could detect its accumulation during acute hypoxia. The strong trunSM-squalene correlation thus suggests truncation is triggered by very small quantities of squalene. Another possibility is that squalene-induced truncation is a ‘failsafe’ mechanism to preserve SM activity. This may be necessary when a reduction in MARCHF6-mediated ubiquitination is insufficient to completely prevent targeting of SM to the proteasome. It may also apply when SM ubiquitination is promoted by other, simultaneous cellular stimuli. For instance, hypoxic MARCHF6 stabilization may override the inhibitory effects of accumulated squalene.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Physiological consequences of truncation</title><p>Overexpression and overactivity of SM occurs in a wide range of malignancies including hepatocellular carcinoma and prostate cancer, where it is positively correlated with severity and lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kalogirou et al., 2021</xref>).

Thus, the ability of squalene to stimulate the truncation and constitutive activation of SM may play a key role in regulating flux through cholesterol synthesis under various physiological conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>SQLE</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RefSeq</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">6713, NM_003129.4</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HEK293T</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gift from UNSW School of <break/>Medical Sciences (UNSW <break/>Sydney, Australia)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Highly transfectable human embryonic kidney cells</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HCT116</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gift from Dr Ewa Goldys <break/>(UNSW Sydney, Australia)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Epithelial colorectal carcinoma cells</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Huh7</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gift from Centre for <break/>Cardiovascular Research <break/>(UNSW Sydney, Australia)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Epithelial-like hepatocellular carcinoma cells</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HeLaT</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gift from Drs Louise Lutze-<break/>Mann and Noel Whitaker <break/>(UNSW Sydney, Australia)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Highly transfectable cervical adenocarcinoma cells</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MDA-MB-231</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gift from Drs Louise Lutze-Mann <break/>and Noel Whitaker (UNSW <break/>Sydney, Australia)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Epithelial breast <break/>adenocarcinoma cells</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HEK SM-N100-GFP-V5</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Generated previously using the <break/>Flp-In T-REx system <break/>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zelcer et al., 2014</xref>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">HEK293 cells stably expressing the N-terminal 100 amino acids of SM (SM-N100) fused with green fluorescent protein and a V5 epitope tag.

A squalene standard curve ranging from 3.125–100 ng/µL was used to quantify squalene levels, with data adjusted to the total protein content of the cell lysate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Generation of SM knockout cells</title><p>To knock out SM using CRISPR/Cas9, guide RNAs targeting the <italic>SQLE</italic> proximal promoter (hg38 chr8:124998048–124998067; <named-content content-type="sequence">AATGGAAACGTTCCGACCCG</named-content>) and first exon (hg38 chr8:124999588–124999607; <named-content content-type="sequence">ATCCGAGAAGAGGGCGAACT</named-content>) were designed using CHOPCHOP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Labun et al., 2019</xref>) and cloned into the Cas9- and GFP-encoding PX598 vector using BbsI restriction enzyme cloning, as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ran et al., 2013</xref>, and primers listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table2">Appendix 1—table 2</xref>. HEK293T cells were seeded into 10 cm dishes and transfected with 5 µg of both vectors using Lipofectamine 3000, as described above. After 24 hr, cells were trypsinized, washed with PBS and resuspended in FACS buffer (5% [v/v] FCS and 10 mM EDTA in PBS). Cells were sorted based on GFP fluorescence using a BD FACSAria III at the UNSW Flow Cytometry Facility. GFP-positive cells were seeded into 10 cm dishes at a low density (6,000–12,000 cells/dish) and allowed to adhere for 2–3 weeks. Single colonies were picked, expanded, and screened for <italic>SQLE</italic> mRNA expression and SM protein expression via qRT-PCR and immunoblotting, as described above. To identify the genomic lesion, genomic DNA was isolated from clones using the PureLink Genomic DNA Mini kit. The CRISPR/Cas9 target region was amplified and cloned into a pcDNA3.1 vector for Sanger sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Cholesterol synthesis assays</title><p>To assay flux through cholesterol synthesis, radiolabeling and thin-layer chromatography were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Capell-Hattam et al., 2022</xref>). Briefly, cells were seeded into 6-well plates and incubated in maintenance medium containing 2 µCi/well [<sup>14</sup>C]-acetic acid sodium salt as specified in figure legends. Cells were lysed in 1 mL 0.05 M sodium hydroxide and protein content was determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay. Samples were normalized to the lowest protein concentration within each experiment by discarding the required volume and making up to 1 mL with 0.05 M sodium hydroxide. Lysates were mixed with 1 mL ethanol, 500 µL 75% (w/v) potassium hydroxide, 1 µL 20 mM butylated hydroxytoluene, and 20 µL 20 mM EDTA, and saponified by incubation in a 70 °C water bath for 1 hr. Once cooled to room temperature, non-saponifiable lipids were extracted by mixing samples with 1 mL ethanol and 2.5 mL hexane, vortexing for 30 s, and centrifuging at 2,000 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min. The upper organic phase (2 mL) was collected and evaporated to dryness in a fume cupboard. Dried lipids were resuspended in 50 µL hexane and separated by thin layer chromatography on TLC Silica gel 60 F254 plates (Supelco) using a heptane:ethyl acetate (2:1, v/v) mobile phase. Silica plates were dried, exposed to BAS-IP SR phosphor screens (Fujifilm) for 5–7 days, and imaged using a Typhoon FLA 9500 imager (GE Healthcare). Densitometry analysis was performed using Image Studio Lite software and levels of each analyte were normalized to the condition with the highest abundance.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Data analysis and presentation</title><p>Data were normalized as described in figure legends. To quantify overall changes in the predominant SM variant, the trunSM:SM ratio was calculated. To compare hypoxia- or squalene-induced changes in individual protein levels under different conditions, data were normalized to the respective normoxic condition for each variable. To compare basal (normoxic) protein levels under different conditions, data were normalized to a single control condition. All data were obtained in n≥3 independent experiments, and visualization and statistical testing were performed using GraphPad Prism software as specified in figure legends. Grey lines on graphs indicate statistical comparisons. Where multiple statistical comparisons were made in a single experiment, p-values were corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>) with a false discovery threshold of 5%. Thresholds for statistical significance were defined as: *, p≤0.05; **, p≤0.01. Values of 0.05&lt;p &lt; 0.075 are indicated in text on graphs, and n.s. indicates p≥0.075. Figures were assembled using Adobe Illustrator software (Adobe Inc).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources, Funding acquisition</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Resources, Funding acquisition</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources, Funding acquisition, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-82843-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in the manuscript.

cholesterol consumes 11 molecules of oxygen. This valuable paper provides a new link between oxygen sensing and cholesterol synthesis by showing that under conditions of hypoxia (oxygen deprivation), a key cholesterol synthesis enzyme called squalene monooxygenase (SM) is partially degraded to a truncated form that is constitutively active. The supporting evidence is solid and suggests that unregulated activation of SM under oxygen-deficient conditions could reduce the toxicity of squalene and other sterol intermediates.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82843.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Radhakrishnan</surname><given-names>Arun</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05byvp690</institution-id><institution>University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.08.18.504470">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.18.504470v2">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and David Ron as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, the reviewers were positive about this work and felt that the induction of truncated squalene monooxygenase (truncSM) by hypoxia (relieving it from cholesterol-mediated degradation) was a convincing and exciting result. This result is the core of the manuscript and should be shored up as much as possible. To improve the clarity and presentation, the reviewers suggest some key revisions, which are listed below. Please address these in full and also address the other points raised in the detailed reviews which are appended below.</p><p>1) All reviewers were concerned/confused by some of the immunoblot quantification. The interpretations would be simplified if the authors were to show results of quantification for each band in the immunoblots (higher quality immunoblots should be presented if possible). In many cases the graphs of the quantifications seem to be off, it is not clear how the graphs are derived from the blots, which should be representative – see further comments by Reviewers 2 and 3 below on this point.</p><p>2) The MARCH6 connection is preliminary/confusing and the inhibitor studies are not clear. A new band appears upon inhibition of VCP/p97 and MG-132 treatment causes a decrease in the protein's expression. This needs to be addressed. The interpretation of Figure 2E is somewhat overstated. Please also see other points about MARCH6 experiments raised below. If it cannot be clarified, the reviewers felt that the MARCH6 angle could be significantly toned down (with some panels removed) without detraction from the main point about hypoxia inducing truncSM.</p><p>3) Finally, results shown in Figure 5 showing that truncation of SM correlates with hypoxia in endometrial cancer tissues is a little preliminary. Multiple bands are detected in SM immunoblots, which interferes with interpretation. This experiment could be removed and speculated upon in the discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I do have a couple of expository suggestions.</p><p>1) You have GOT to include a picture or schematic of the sterol pathway with the relevant enzymes. I have been studying aspects of this pathway for over 30 years (I am old) and I still need one. The people who are new to these ideas will be even more appreciative of this graphic concession.</p><p>2) Can you make some kind of summary cartoon of the various regulation processes happening with this key enzyme? I am not sure what it would look like, but it would be a nice summary of the complex and cool story.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Is it a clear accumulation of truncSM that results in increased flux through the pathway and sterol metabolic changes? If yes, does this provide a significant advantage to cells under hypoxia? The accumulation of squalene in hypoxia argues against significant truncSM activity. Even if truncSM can be active, oxygen unavailability possibly limits its activity. This possibility is in fact acknowledged by the authors in Line 313 (&quot;consistent with reduced SM activity under low-oxygen conditions&quot;).</p><p>Another important open question is the role of squalene in promoting truncSM. Under normoxia, MARCHF6 induces the degradation of full-length SM. How is the generation of truncSM favoured by squalene? Does it act directly on MARCHF6? Any additional information to address these issues would significantly strengthen this study. The analysis and some of the data on the relative abundance of SM and truncSM could also be improved.</p><p>1. There is huge variability between the control condition (cells grown at 21% O2). For example, in Figure 1D, at .5% O2 the ratio between SM/truncSM is big (probably &gt;5). In contrast, at 3% or 10% O2 the SM/truncSM ratio is probably ~1. It would be important to understand the causes of variability that are observed throughout the manuscript.</p><p>2. Another important aspect is the quantification and presentation of the data. The levels of SM and truncSM at 21%O2 are used as references and the two versions of the protein are quantified separately. This is misleading because often cells have different levels of total protein (SM+truncSM) (see for example figure 2). Throughout the manuscript, the levels of truncated protein should be presented in a ratio to full length to provide a better indication of their relative abundance. Another example of strange quantification is in Figures 2C (and 2E). The gel on the left shows very high levels of SM-N100-GFP-V5 in cells treated with MG132. However, in the quantification on the right, those conditions appear to have less SM-N100-GFP-V5 than untreated cells under 21% O2.</p><p>3- Figure 2E shows a clear increase in truncSM in MARCHF6 depleted cells. The effect is not insignificant if the truncSM/SM ratio is analysed. In contrast, the effect of MARCHF6 depletion is clear on full-length accumulation. Is this result compatible with the conclusion that &quot;truncation occurs post-ubiquitination by MARCHF6&quot;?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The availability of data, code, reagents and other issues is adequate.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82843.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, the reviewers were positive about this work and felt that the induction of truncated squalene monooxygenase (truncSM) by hypoxia (relieving it from cholesterol-mediated degradation) was a convincing and exciting result. This result is the core of the manuscript and should be shored up as much as possible. To improve the clarity and presentation, the reviewers suggest some key revisions, which are listed below. Please address these in full and also address the other points raised in the detailed reviews which are appended below.</p><p>1) All reviewers were concerned/confused by some of the immunoblot quantification. The interpretations would be simplified if the authors were to show results of quantification for each band in the immunoblots (higher quality immunoblots should be presented if possible). In many cases the graphs of the quantifications seem to be off, it is not clear how the graphs are derived from the blots, which should be representative – see further comments by Reviewers 2 and 3 below on this point.</p></disp-quote><p>Clarifying our quantification method is clearly essential. Below we address the specific recommendations of Reviewers #2 and #3, and the revised manuscript incorporates these where possible. However, in some cases, we believe alternative quantification methods would distract from our aim to identify factors required for hypoxia-induced SM degradation and trunSM accumulation. We have nevertheless made major updates to the text, figure legends, and axis labels to improve clarity, as outlined below.</p><p><underline>Presenting data for all immunoblot lanes:</underline> We agree this quantification method, suggested by Reviewer #3, is informative in situations where a condition dramatically affects protein levels at the normoxic baseline. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> for an example based on the original Figure 2C, where normalizing to a single control condition (the normoxic vehicle treatment, set to 1) clearly demonstrates the MG132-induced accumulation of SM and SM‑N100‑GFP‑V5, as seen in the accompanying immunoblot.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-82843-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>However, a limitation of this normalization method is that the magnitude of hypoxia-induced changes in protein levels cannot be directly compared across multiple treatments or conditions. This was the principle we used to investigate the mechanism of SM truncation, and the rationale behind our original quantification method where protein levels were normalized to the normoxic control for each individual treatment (set to 1). We acknowledge our original visualization of this data, with a single bar representing all normoxic conditions in an experiment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>), was confusing and potentially misleading. The main figures of the revised manuscript still contain quantification of hypoxia-induced protein changes, but the graphs are updated to show all normoxic conditions used for normalization, and thus provide a numerical value for each immunoblot lane. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref> for an example of the revised Figure 2C (now Figure 3A) compared with the quantification in the original submission. Where treatments cause normoxic protein accumulation with the potential to confuse interpretation, the supplemental data is updated to include quantification relative to a single control condition, as in the example on the previous page. We have elected to include this additional quantification for the revised Figure 2C (as Figure 2—figure supplement 1C), Figure 2D (as Figure 2—figure supplement 1E) Figure 3A (as Figure 3—figure supplement 1B), and Figure 4—figure supplement 2E, which were flagged by reviewers as points of particular concern.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-82843-sa2-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We have also updated axis labels and figure legends to improve clarity about the normalization process. For instance, the above graphs replace the original “relative protein levels” label with a more informative “hypoxia-induced reduction” label. The Materials and methods section is also updated to better describe the quantification methods used in the manuscript.</p><p><underline>Presenting the trunSM:SM ratio:</underline> This quantification method, suggested by Reviewer #2, is useful for visualizing the overall shift from full-length to truncated SM during hypoxia, as was the focus of Figure 1. Expressing the data as a ratio increases variability, but nevertheless supports our original conclusions from these experiments. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref> for an example of trunSM:SM quantification from Figure 1D, which Reviewer #2 flagged as a concern due to differences in the normoxic ratio. We also note that cell confluency influences the trunSM:SM ratio—for more information, please refer to our response to Reviewer #2, point #1. The revised manuscript incorporates trunSM:SM quantification for all Figure 1 experiments as Figure 1—figure supplement 2B–D, F and Figure 1—figure supplement 3B.</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-82843-sa2-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><p>When investigating the mechanism of truncation in Figure 2 onwards, we believe presenting the trunSM:SM ratio risks obscuring factors that specifically affect only one of the two steps in the truncation process: (1) proteasomal targeting and (2) partial degradation. This is best illustrated by Figure 4A, which uses different serum types. Here, individual quantification of the two SM variants clearly shows that statin treatment blocks the hypoxia-induced generation of trunSM without an effect on the disappearance (i.e., proteasomal targeting) of full-length SM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref>, left). This observation was critical, as it led directly to our discovery that squalene promotes the partial, rather than complete, degradation of SM. However, there remains a significant increase in the trunSM:SM ratio in the presence of statin due to the continued disappearance of full-length SM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref>, red box). Expressing the data in this way makes the differential effects on each SM variant much less apparent, and we believe it may lead to confusion about our conclusions. In the revised manuscript, the Materials and methods section is updated to justify our decisions regarding this quantification method.</p><fig id="sa2fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-82843-sa2-fig4-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The MARCH6 connection is preliminary/confusing and the inhibitor studies are not clear. A new band appears upon inhibition of VCP/p97 and MG-132 treatment causes a decrease in the protein's expression. This needs to be addressed. The interpretation of Figure 2E is somewhat overstated. Please also see other points about MARCH6 experiments raised below. If it cannot be clarified, the reviewers felt that the MARCH6 angle could be significantly toned down (with some panels removed) without detraction from the main point about hypoxia inducing truncSM.</p></disp-quote><p>We accept that some of our MARCHF6 experiments are preliminary, and the two MARCHF6‑V5 bands confound their interpretation. The revised manuscript contains only the <italic>MARCHF6</italic> knockdown experiment in Figure 2E (showing MARCHF6 is required for hypoxia-induced SM degradation) and the observation of hypoxic MARCHF6 stabilization in Figure 3A. These results are merged into an updated Figure 3. Experiments to determine the mechanism of MARCHF6 stabilization (the original Figure 3B–C, Supplemental Figure S3, Supplemental Figure S5F) are removed and will be the focus of a future study. The working model in Figure 6 and results and discussion sections are revised accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Finally, results shown in Figure 5 showing that truncation of SM correlates with hypoxia in endometrial cancer tissues is a little preliminary. Multiple bands are detected in SM immunoblots, which interferes with interpretation. This experiment could be removed and speculated upon in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>While the correlation between HIF1α levels and SM truncation in endometrial cancer tissues supports our cell culture work, we acknowledge it could be seen as somewhat preliminary. The original Figure 5 is removed from the revised manuscript and the Discussion section is revised to highlight the role of trunSM in SM-related oncogenesis as a future direction for study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I do have a couple of expository suggestions.</p><p>1) You have GOT to include a picture or schematic of the sterol pathway with the relevant enzymes. I have been studying aspects of this pathway for over 30 years (I am old) and I still need one. The people who are new to these ideas will be even more appreciative of this graphic concession.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, the revised manuscript includes a schematic of the cholesterol synthesis pathway highlighting key enzymes mentioned in the study. This is incorporated as Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Can you make some kind of summary cartoon of the various regulation processes happening with this key enzyme? I am not sure what it would look like, but it would be a nice summary of the complex and cool story.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, the revised manuscript includes a graphical summary of metabolic regulation of SM. This is incorporated as Figure 6—figure supplement 1 and the Discussion section is updated accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Is it a clear accumulation of truncSM that results in increased flux through the pathway and sterol metabolic changes? If yes, does this provide a significant advantage to cells under hypoxia? The accumulation of squalene in hypoxia argues against significant truncSM activity. Even if truncSM can be active, oxygen unavailability possibly limits its activity. This possibility is in fact acknowledged by the authors in Line 313 (&quot;consistent with reduced SM activity under low-oxygen conditions&quot;).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree it is important to determine if trunSM activity is preserved during hypoxia. In the revised manuscript, we use [<sup>14</sup>C]‑acetate labelling and thin-layer chromatography to assay flux through cholesterol synthesis in hypoxic Huh7 cells. This liver-derived cell line shows robust hypoxia-induced truncation of SM (Figure 1—figure supplement 2F). While cholesterol synthesis is reduced during hypoxia, we observed acute accumulation of lanosterol (consistent with other reports, e.g., Nguyen <italic>et al.</italic> 2007 <italic>JBC</italic>) yet minimal upstream accumulation of squalene even after a prolonged incubation. This confirms that despite trunSM being oxygen-dependent, its catalytic activity is preserved during hypoxia. We posit that a major function of SM truncation in this context is to ensure efficient clearance of squalene to form lanosterol, which induces degradation of the early cholesterol synthesis enzyme HMGCR and thus suppresses oxygen-intensive pathway flux.</p><p>Although we detected squalene accumulation at early hypoxic timepoints in earlier gas chromatography-mass spectrometry experiments (Figure 4B), we attribute this to the much greater sensitivity of mass spectrometry compared with thin-layer chromatography. Indeed, squalene levels are at the lower level of detection in normoxic cells (Figure 4—figure supplement 1) and the strong correlation between trunSM and squalene levels, as determined by mass spectrometry, points towards truncation responding to extremely small changes in squalene levels. The revised manuscript incorporates the new thin-layer chromatography experiment as Figure 5, and the working model in Figure 6 and results, discussion and Materials and methods sections are updated accordingly. Please note the addition of a new author, Isabelle M. Capell-Hattam, who contributed to these experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another important open question is the role of squalene in promoting truncSM. Under normoxia, MARCHF6 induces the degradation of full-length SM. How is the generation of truncSM favoured by squalene? Does it act directly on MARCHF6? Any additional information to address these issues would significantly strengthen this study.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, the revised manuscript tests another possible mechanism by which squalene induces SM truncation. Previous work showed squalene directly binds the SM‑N100 regulatory domain (Yoshioka <italic>et al.</italic> 2020 <italic>PNAS</italic>), with the hydrophobic re-entrant loop (residues ~15–40) as the most logical binding site. Aromatic residues and leucine residues line the SM active site and are required for catalysis (Padyana <italic>et al.</italic> 2019 <italic>Nat Commun</italic>, Abe <italic>et al.</italic> 2007 <italic>BBRC</italic>), suggesting they directly interact with squalene. Similar residues in the SM‑N100 re-entrant loop may likewise be involved in squalene binding, and possibly the partial degradation of SM. We therefore mutated phenylalanine (Phe‑20, Phe‑35) and leucine (Leu‑30, Leu‑42) residues in the re-entrant loop to test if they are required for SM truncation. However, these mutations, either alone or in combination, did not prevent the hypoxia-induced accumulation of truncated SM. A better understanding of the precise squalene-binding site in SM‑N100 is needed to further investigate its possible role in SM truncation, but this is beyond the scope of the current study. The revised manuscript incorporates this new SM mutant experiment as Figure 4—figure supplement 4, and the results and discussion sections are updated accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The analysis and some of the data on the relative abundance of SM and truncSM could also be improved.</p></disp-quote><p>Please refer below for our responses to specific concerns, and to our response to Essential Revisions comment #2 for overall changes to data normalization and visualization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. There is huge variability between the control condition (cells grown at 21% O2). For example, in Figure 1D, at .5% O2 the ratio between SM/truncSM is big (probably &gt;5). In contrast, at 3% or 10% O2 the SM/truncSM ratio is probably ~1. It would be important to understand the causes of variability that are observed throughout the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Due to equipment limitations affecting the number of oxygen concentrations testable at one time, experiments in Figure 1D were staggered across multiple days after cell seeding. This meant that some cells were incubated for longer than others prior to their hypoxic exposure. While steps were taken to obtain a similar cell density at the start of each hypoxic incubation, unavoidable differences in confluency may explain the variability in basal trunSM:SM ratios. We have formally tested the effect of HEK293T seeding density on SM truncation and found a higher confluency indeed promotes a greater trunSM:SM ratio. This is accompanied by a small increase in HIF1α levels that likely reflects increased oxygen consumption of confluent cell monolayers, as reported by other studies (Sheta <italic>et al.</italic> 2001 <italic>Oncogene</italic>, Dayan <italic>et al.</italic> 2009 <italic>JCP</italic>). Therefore, this observation lends additional support to our model of hypoxia-induced truncation. In other manuscript figures, differences in the basal trunSM:SM ratio likely reflect variation amongst HEK sublines (e.g., HEK293T in Figure 1A, HEK SM‑N100‑GFP‑V5 in Figure 2C, and HEK MARCHF6‑V5 in Figure 3B). The revised manuscript incorporates the new cell confluency experiment as Figure 1—figure supplement 2D, and the Results section is updated accordingly. To improve readability, the original Supplemental Figure S1D–E is moved to a new Figure 1—figure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Another important aspect is the quantification and presentation of the data. The levels of SM and truncSM at 21%O2 are used as references and the two versions of the protein are quantified separately. This is misleading because often cells have different levels of total protein (SM+truncSM) (see for example figure 2). Throughout the manuscript, the levels of truncated protein should be presented in a ratio to full length to provide a better indication of their relative abundance. Another example of strange quantification is in Figures 2C (and 2E). The gel on the left shows very high levels of SM-N100-GFP-V5 in cells treated with MG132.

This is also reflected in the trunSM:SM ratio, which remains significantly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig5">Author response image 5</xref>). Our interpretation is that MARCHF6 is not the sole E3 ubiquitin ligase promoting trunSM formation, and although it is responsible for hypoxia-induced degradation of SM, other proteasomal degradation pathways can cause partial degradation of SM when hypoxia-induced squalene accumulation occurs. To better convey this idea, we have modified our conclusion as follows: “The basal levels and hypoxic accumulation of trunSM were also reduced, consistent with MARCHF6 contributing to the proteasomal targeting, and therefore partial degradation, of SM. Hypoxia-induced accumulation of trunSM was not completely abolished, however, indicating SM can be truncated even when targeted to the proteasome by hypoxia-independent mechanisms.”</p><fig id="sa2fig5" position="float"><label>Author response image 5.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-82843-sa2-fig5-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The availability of data, code, reagents and other issues is adequate.</p></disp-quote><p>The revised manuscript includes availability information for all new experiments.</p></body></sub-article></article>
