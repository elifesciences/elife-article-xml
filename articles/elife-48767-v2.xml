the testis that regulate the process of spermatogenesis and establish the immune-privileged environment of the blood-testis-barrier (BTB). Here, we report the in vitro reprogramming of fibroblasts to human induced Sertoli-like cells (hiSCs). Initially, five transcriptional factors and a gene reporter carrying the <italic>AMH</italic> promoter were utilized to obtain the hiSCs. We further reduce the number of reprogramming factors to two, NR5A1 and GATA4, and show that these hiSCs have transcriptome profiles and cellular properties that are similar to those of primary human Sertoli cells. Moreover, hiSCs can sustain the viability of spermatogonia cells harvested from mouse seminiferous tubules. hiSCs suppress the proliferation of human T lymphocytes and protect xenotransplanted human cells in mice with normal immune systems. hiSCs also allow us to determine a gene associated with Sertoli cell only syndrome (SCO), CX43, is indeed important in regulating the maturation of Sertoli cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>human cell lines</kwd><kwd>Sertoli cells</kwd><kwd>mouse</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018YFA0107703</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kee</surname><given-names>Kehkooi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017YFC1001601</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kee</surname><given-names>Kehkooi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In vitro reprogramming of human fibroblasts to Sertoli-like cells with immunosuppressive properties provides platforms for basic research and clinical application.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sertoli cells are the first somatic cell type to differentiate in the testis and the only somatic cell type inside the seminiferous tubules. Sertoli cells play a critical role in directing testis morphogenesis and the creation of an immune-privileged microenvironment, which is required for male germ cell development. During early gonad development, male somatic cells express the male sex-determining gene <italic>SRY</italic>, which directs the sex-specific vascular development and seminiferous cord formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bott et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brennan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koopman et al., 1990</xref>) via the initiation of a cascade of genes, including <italic>SOX9, FGF9, AMH</italic> and <italic>PGD2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barrionuevo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moniot et al., 2009</xref>). <italic>NR5A1</italic> (or <italic>SF1</italic>), <italic>GATA4</italic>, and <italic>WT1</italic> are major transcriptional factors that direct somatic cells to become fetal Sertoli cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rotgers et al., 2018</xref>). Five transcriptional factors have been demonstrated to successfully reprogram mouse fibroblasts to Sertoli cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buganim et al., 2012</xref>). The expanding fetal Sertoli cells and another type of testicular somatic cell (i.e., peritubular cells) regulate the final organization and morphogenesis of the developing gonad into a testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Griswold, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McLaren, 2000</xref>).</p><p>Sertoli cells are the pivotal somatic cell regulators inside the seminiferous cord. Sertoli cells embed male germ cells during all differentiating stages and provide immunological, nutritional and structural support for germ cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Oatley and Brinster, 2012</xref>). Sertoli cells secrete the growth factors and cytokines needed for proper spermatogenesis, including the maintenance of spermatogonial stem cells, meiosis initiation of spermatocytes, and maturation of spermatozoa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hai et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, Sertoli cells have the unique ability to modulate immunoreactions that protect the developing germ cells from immunological attacks. The immune-privileged potential of Sertoli cells has been utilized in many allo- and xeno-grafts to reduce the immune response in the field of cell transplantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaur et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mital et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">ValdÃ©s-GonzÃ¡lez et al., 2005</xref>). Preclinical studies have transplanted Sertoli cells with various other cell types for the treatment of diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, skin allografts and other diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Luca et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Recently, co-cultures of differentiated rodent primordial germ cells and neonatal testicular somatic cells have successfully enabled meiosis completion and round spermatid formation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>), highlighting the potential use of testicular somatic cells in the field of reproductive medicine although more experimental validations and improvements are needed. Human pluripotent stem cells have been differentiated to spermatid-like cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Easley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kee et al., 2009</xref>), but the co-culturing of stem cells with Sertoli cells could enhance the efficiencies of obtaining functional male gametes. However, the procurement of human Sertoli cells is not feasible because of biological and ethical constraints. The availability of donated Sertoli cells is limited, and expanding the limited number of human Sertoli cells in vitro remains a challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chaudhary et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kulibin and Malolina, 2016</xref>). Therefore, the generation of Sertoli cells from fibroblasts could alleviate these issues and fulfill the basic research and clinical demands.</p><p>Direct lineage reprogramming has been considered a promising strategy for obtaining functional cell types with lower teratoma risks than directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cherry and Daley, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). The induction of cell type conversion between divergent lineages has been achieved using combinations of lineage-specific transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hendry et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nam et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yamanaka and Blau, 2010</xref>). Fibroblasts are common cells in animal connective tissues that can be conveniently obtained from patients. Therefore, fibroblasts are often used as initiating cells in many lineage reprogramming experiments. The direct reprogramming of Sertoli cells from fibroblasts has been demonstrated in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buganim et al., 2012</xref>), but the direct lineage conversion of human Sertoli cells from fibroblasts has not been described. Here, we report the efficient induction of human Sertoli cells (hiSCs) from both primary human fibroblasts and fibroblasts derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). These hiSCs exhibit an epithelial morphology, lipid droplet accumulation, and transcriptomes similar to those of primary Sertoli cells; sustain the growth of mouse spermatogonia cells; and perform immune-privileged function during transplantation experiments.</p><p>Connexin 43 (CX43) is a predominant gap junction protein expressed in BTBs that affects the maturation of Sertoli cells and spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brehm et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gerber et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sridharan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Weider et al., 2011</xref>). The deletion of <italic>CX43</italic> in Sertoli cells, but not germ cells, causes infertility in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brehm et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">GÃ¼nther et al., 2013</xref>). The absence of CX43 expression in human Sertoli cells is associated with Sertoli cell-only syndrome (SCO) and impaired spermatogenesis in male patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brehm et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Defamie et al., 2003</xref>), but whether the deletion of <italic>CX43</italic> directly affects the characteristics of human Sertoli cells has not been demonstrated. Utilizing our in vitro hiSC model, we demonstrate that the deletion of <italic>CX43</italic> affects the transcriptome profile and maturation of hiSCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Testing the reprogramming capability of five putative transcriptional factors</title><p>Based on the reprogramming capability of the transcriptional factors reported in a mouse study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buganim et al., 2012</xref>), we first tested the reprogramming capabilities of the human homologs of the five transcriptional factors (5TFs: NR5A1, GATA4, WT1, SOX9 and DMRT1) to convert human fibroblasts to hiSCs. All five human homologs were correctly cloned into lentiviral vectors and expressed at high levels as verified by immunofluorescent staining of HPFs and transcriptional level in human embryonic kidney cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). After the lentiviral transduction with all five factors and culturing in selective medium for 5 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), many HPFs started to transform from the typical elongated morphology of fibroblasts into the squamous morphology that typically appears in epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). The analysis of the transcriptional expression showed that genes enriched in mesenchymal-to-epithelial transitionÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buganim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Samavarchi-Tehrani et al., 2010</xref>), including <italic>MUC1</italic>, <italic>CLDN1</italic>, <italic>CLDN7</italic>, <italic>CLDN11 and TJP1</italic>, exhibited increased expression in this mixed population of transformed HPFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). In addition, the transcriptional expression of genes enriched in Sertoli cells, such as <italic>AR, KRT18</italic>, <italic>CLU</italic>, <italic>PTGDS</italic>, <italic>SCF</italic>, <italic>BMP4 and INHA</italic>, exhibited increased expression in this mixed population of transformed HPFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). To determine whether these 5TFs were able to reprogram other fibroblast sources, we derived human fibroblast-like cells from hESC line H1 (dH1) and reprogrammed these cells as described for the HPFs. The dH1 morphology resembled that of fibroblasts, and no detectable expression of pluripotent markers was observed, but the expression of many markers of fibroblasts was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A, B and C</xref>). After the transduction of the 5TFs, dH1 underwent a fibroblast to epithelial transformation similar to that observed in the HPFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2D</xref>), suggesting that the 5TFs can transform both types of fibroblasts into epithelial-like cells and increase the expression of Sertoli cell markers.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Induction of Sertoli-like cells (hiSCs) from human fibroblasts.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunostaining of NR5A1, GATA4, WT1, SOX9 and DMRT1 (red signal) in fibroblasts (HPF) 3 days post infection.Â DAPI (blue signal) was used to indicate nucleus.

Recent report of single-cell transcriptome analysis also confirms that AMH is specifically expressed in Sertoli cells but not other somatic cells of adult human testisÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). We constructed a gene reporter carrying <italic>AMH</italic> promoter fusing to EGFP gene and transduced the reporter into adult human Sertoli cells to confirm EGFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>). When the lentivector carrying the reporter, AMH:EGFP, was stably integrated into HPFs and dH1, none of the cells would express EGFP without transcriptional induction. After the transduction and selection of the fibroblasts, some reprogrammed cells were expected to express EGFP to allow us to isolate them by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). We found that both HPF and dH1 reproducibly yielded a clear AMH:EGFP-positive population after 10 days of transduction with the 5TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Intriguingly, the AMH:EGFP+ population in the dH1 group (~15%) was much higher than that in the HPF group (~6%), indicating that the conversion of the dH1 cells was more efficient. The AMH:EGFP+ cells were isolated by FACS and adhered to culture dishes and exhibited an epithelial morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We verified that the endogenous AMH expression was activated because the expression level of the <italic>AMH</italic> gene was significantly upregulated in the AMH:EGFP+ cell population compared to that in the control dH1 cells (CTRL) and AMH:EGFP- cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The specific expression of endogenous <italic>AMH</italic> in AMH:EGFP+ cells validated the function of the reporter to isolate the reprogrammed Sertoli cells from the mixed populations which might contain other cell types. Moreover, an epithelial marker expressed in Sertoli cells, thatÂ is, KRT18, was used to validate the transformation of the fibroblasts to Sertoli cells as one kind of epithelial cells. The cytoskeleton pattern of KRT18 expression was observed in the AMH:EGFP+ cells but not the control dH1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Whole-genome transcriptional profiling of hiSCs resembling adult Sertoli cells</title><p>To determine whether hiSCs reprogrammed with the 5TFs (5F-hiSCs) are similar to human Sertoli cells, we compared the transcriptomes of the AMH:EGFP+ 5F-hiSCs, dH1 cells infected with p2k7 empty virus (dH1-2K7) as negative controls, and primary adult Sertoli cells (aSCs) from human biopsy samplesÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wen et al., 2017</xref>). We focused our analysis on the differentially expressed genes (DEGs,&gt;2 fold change, p-value&lt;0.05) between 5F-hiSCs and dH1-2K7 and between aSCs and dH1-2K7. In total, 7533 genes were differentially expressed between 5F-hiSCs and dH1-2K7, including 4528 upregulated genes and 3005 downregulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Additionally, 5377 genes were differentially expressed between aSCs and dH1-2K7, including 3343 upregulated genes and 2034 down-regulated genes. The Venn analysis showed that 3626 genes were shared among the DEGs in both hiSCs and aSCs, accounting for approximately 67% of the DEGs in aSCs. Among this shared group of DEGs (CO-DEGs), 1973 genes were upregulated, while 1314 genes were down-regulated in both the hiSCs and aSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), indicating that the trends in transcriptional expression between the hiSCs and aSCs were the same in these genes. The cluster analysis of dH1-2K7, hiSCs and aSCs also showed that the CO-DEGs had a similar expression pattern between the hiSCs and aSCs, and consistency was observed between duplicate samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of the CO-DEGs showed that among the 1973 upregulated genes, many genes were involved in the regulation of cell communication, regulation of immune response processes, response to hormones, and lipid metabolic process, whereas among the 1314 down-regulated genes, many genes were involved in the mitotic cell cycle and microtubule-based processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These changes in gene expression indicated that the hiSCs acquired unique cellular characteristics that were distinct from the original fibroblasts. To further confirm that the AMH:EGFP+ 5F-hiSCs have the signature of Sertoli cells, we examined the expression of several Sertoli cell markers, including <italic>CLU, NCAM2, DHH, ERBB4, INHB, INHA, SHBG, GATA6, CDKN1B, TGFÎ±</italic> and <italic>LMMA3</italic>, by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Compared to the control cells, all Sertoli cell markers were highly enriched in the AMH:EGFP+ 5F-hiSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

The analysis revealed that the transcriptome profiles of the 2F-hiSCs were more similar to the profiles of the 5F-hiSCs and adult Sertoli cells (aSCs) than to the dH1 and HPF profiles (data not shown). To identify the putative signature genes similar among the 2F-hiSCs, 5F-hiSCs and aSCs, we generated a heat map of the 1638 CO-DEGs and carried out gene correlation clustering. Notably, the differentially expressed genes were grouped into three groups of 512, 689 and 437 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

Previous studies have shown this unique function, which has been exploited in therapeutic transplantation for the protection of many other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaur et al., 2015</xref>). We first investigated whether the medium from the 2F-hiSCs cells exhibited any suppressive effect on the proliferation of Jurkat E6 cells (human T lymphocytes) to examine whether the 2F-hiSCs could suppress the immunoreaction of immunological cells. The suppressive effect was evaluated using an assay commonly used to determine the active metabolism of a proliferating cell, thatÂ is, WST-1Â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chui et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Therefore, the expression level of CX43 in the cells was indirectly proportional to the percentage of AMH:EGFP+ cells. This result is consistent with the higher AMH expression in CX43 knockout mice reported in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Weider et al., 2011</xref>) and suggests that the effect of the CX43 deletion leads to the dedifferentiation of Sertoli cells to a less mature state.</p><p>The high percentage of AMH:EGFP+ cells in the CX43KO cells may be due to their more immature status than that of WT AMH:EGFP+ hiSCs. Therefore, we compared the transcriptional profiles of these two populations to examine whether CX43KO affected gene expression or any cellular processes.

Fibroblasts from two sources, thatÂ is, human pulmonary fibroblasts and fibroblasts derived from human embryonic stem cells, were reprogrammed to Sertoli-like cells and exhibited transcriptomes similar to those of primary adult Sertoli cells. The present study generated a Sertoli cell-specific gene reporter, thatÂ is, AMH:EGFP, to enhance the efficiency of isolating a relatively pure population of hiSCs from a mixed population of cells at different reprogramming stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). AMH has been used in many conditioned knockout studies to specify the expression of Cre recombinase in mouse Sertoli cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">LÃ©cureuil et al., 2002</xref>). Recent single-cell transcriptome study of adult human testicular cells indeed confirmed that AMH is specifically expressed in Sertoli cells but not other somatic cells or germ cellsÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). We cloned the human promoter of <italic>AMH</italic> and fused it to EGFP and showed that the cell population expressing EGFP appeared only after reprogramming, and these cells expressed many Sertoli cell marker genes. This isolation step eliminates the possibility that the reprogrammed cells we studied were other somatic cells such as Leydig cells which share some gene markers. The success of reprogramming human fibroblasts with the same factors used in a previous mouse study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buganim et al., 2012</xref>) confirms that the reprogramming capability of these 5TFs is conserved between humans and mice.</p><p>Another achievement of this study was the reduction in the reprogramming factors from 5TFs to 2TFs. NR5A1, which is often called SF1, was the most essential of the five factors because almost no AMH:EGFP+ cells appeared in the reprogramming experiments without NR5A1, even if GATA4, WT1, DMRT1 and SOX9 were overexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Notably, only the addition of GATA4, but not the addition of the three other TFs, to the reprogramming combination increased the percentage of AMH:EGFP+ cells. Several TFs, including NR5A1 and GATA4, are key regulators establishing the mouse Sertoli cell identityÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rotgers et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, unsurprisingly, NR5A1 and GATA4 were sufficient to reprogram human fibroblasts to Sertoli-like cells. WT1 and SOX9 are also determining factors in mouse Sertoli cells, but their reprogramming abilities were lower than those of NR5A1 and GATA4. SOX9 interacts with NR5A1 to trigger the specific onset of AMH expressionÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rotgers et al., 2018</xref>), but SOX9 overexpression in our reprogramming experiments only slightly increased the percentage of AMH:EGFP+ cells in a few combinations of TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>).</p><p>The cellular characterizations of the 2F-hiSCs showed that these cells carried many known properties of Sertoli cells. Lipid metabolism in Sertoli cells is important for providing nutritional and energy supplies to germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gorga et al., 2017</xref>). Previous studies have shown that the high metabolic activity requirements for lipid and steroid synthesis are associated with the differentiated status of Sertoli cellsÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johnston et al., 2008</xref>). Notably, the hiSCs in the present study exhibited a high expression of lipid and steroid related genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), and the WT hiSCs exhibited a higher expression than the CX43KO hiSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). These results suggest that the hiSCs were similar to terminally differentiated Sertoli cells in vivo. The lipid droplet staining assays clearly showed the presence of high numbers of lipid droplets in the hiSCs but not the fibroblasts used for reprogramming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p>Sustaining the viability and differentiation of spermatogonia cells is the most essential function of Sertoli cells. We examined the ability of hiSCs to sustain mouse spermatogonia cells because of the inaccessible procurement of human spermatogonia cells from hospitals. Previous studies performing xenotransplantation experiments transplanting primate spermatogonia stem cells into mouse testis demonstrated that primate germ cells colonized in the seminiferous tubules of the recipient mice, but the primate germ cells did not differentiate because of the evolutionary differences between these speciesÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nagano et al., 2001</xref>). The isolated mouse spermatogonia cells in our study attached and survived on the hiSCs, but no differentiated spermatocytes were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; data not shown). These results suggest that the reprogrammed Sertoli cells were only capable of providing a niche for the survival of male germ cells in vitro. Recent studies have reported in vitro derivations of immature human gametes from hESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Easley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kee et al., 2009</xref>). The male and female gametes in these studies were immature likely due to the absence of fully competent somatic cells in the differentiating culture. Therefore, adding induced Sertoli cells or granulosa cells to in vitro differentiating cultures may be a key step in obtaining fully functional gametes in vitro.</p><p>Another prominent role of Sertoli cells is the creation of an immune-privileged environment to protect germ cells from immune attacks of lymphocytes. Many studies have documented that Sertoli cells secrete factors that suppress the proliferation of T cells, B cells and NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaur et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Luca et al., 2018</xref>), including the suppression of IL-2 from T cellsÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Selawry et al., 1991</xref>). Our results indicate that culture medium incubated with hiSCs suppress the proliferation of Jurkat cells (the immortalized cell line of human T lymphocytes) and reduce IL-2 production in Jurkat cells treated with hiSC-conditioned medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). Many genes previously known to participate in immune effector processes were upregulated in the hiSCs compared to those in fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), suggesting that hiSCs modulate immune suppression via multiple immunological pathways. Notably, all 293FT cells co-transplanted with hiSCs into two different immunocompetent mice survived longer than their counterpart control cells co-transplanted with fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A,B</xref>). These results suggest that the hiSCs protected the xenotransplanted 293FT cells from host immune cells. Previous studies have reported that Sertoli cells protect many cell types in allogenic and xenogenic transplantation, and several studies used immunosuppressive drugs or immune-deficient mice in long-term follow-up experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaur et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mital et al., 2010</xref>). One study xenotransplanted porcine Sertoli cells with rat islet cells into the kidney capsule of immunocompetent ratsÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yin et al., 2009</xref>). The islet allografts survived 8 to 9 days when 1.5Â ÃÂ 10<sup>6</sup> porcine Sertoli cells were co-transplanted. In our experiments, 2.5Â ÃÂ 10<sup>5</sup> hiSCs were co-transplanted with 293FT cells and survived at least 10 days in two mice. Therefore, our xenotransplanted 293FT cells survived a similar or longer duration with lower numbers of reprogrammed human Sertoli cells in immunocompetent mice. Long-term transplantations of hiSCs with clinically relevant cell types, including pancreatic islets and skin grafts, should be investigated for potential clinical applications, such as the treatment of diabetes and skin burns. Our hiSCs have the advantage of being of human origin, which alleviates the issue of xenotransplantation and potential of animal virus infection.</p><p>Reprogrammed Sertoli cells may be used as a model for examining the cellular and genetic mechanisms of human Sertoli cell biology. A previous study reported an association between Sertoli-only syndrome (SCO) and the lower mRNA expression of CX43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Defamie et al., 2003</xref>) and suggested that the absence of CX43 rendered the Sertoli cells more immature. However, the precise mechanism by which the absence of CX43 causes infertility is unclear. Our studies revealed that multiple pathways, including lipid metabolism and nucleobase catabolism, were more highly expressed in the WT than in the CX43KO hiSCs, indicating that the absence of CX43 disrupts these molecular pathways in Sertoli cells. The expression of several markers of immature Sertoli cells was higher and the expression of markers of mature Sertoli cells was lower in CX43KO than in the WT hiSCs. Taken together, our results suggest that the deletion of CX43 disrupts multiple molecular pathways and delays the maturation of Sertoli cells. Infertility in men may be caused by genetic mutations in germ cells or Sertoli cells. Genetic or cellular defects in Sertoli cells have not been well studied to understand how they cause infertility due to a lack of in vitro model of human Sertoli cells. Our in vitro induced system now provides a platform for basic research and potential treatment of male infertility caused by Sertoli cells in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Mouse</td><td valign="top">C57BL/6</td><td valign="top">Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">293FT cells</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td valign="top">Cat# R70007</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">H1 ES cells</td><td valign="top">WiCell Research Institute</td><td valign="top">Cat# WA01</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Human Pulmonary Fibroblasts</td><td valign="top">National Infrastructure of Cell Line Resource</td><td valign="top">Cat# CCC-HPF-1 (PUMC, Beijing)</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">p2k7-EF1alpha-NR5A1</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Lentiviral construct to express target gene</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">p2k7-EF1alpha-GATA4</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Lentiviral construct to express target gene</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">p2k7-EF1alpha-SOX9</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Lentiviral construct to express target gene</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">p2k7-EF1alpha-WT1</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Lentiviral construct to express target gene</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">p2k7-EF1alpha-DMRT1</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Lentiviral construct to express target gene</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct</td><td valign="top">p2k7-EF1alpha-luciferin</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Lentiviral construct to express target gene</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">p2k7-EF1alpha-CX43</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Lentiviral construct to express target gene</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">p2k7-AMH-GFP</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Lentiviral construct for AMH reporter</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pX335-U6-Chimeric_BB-CBh-hSpCas9n(D10A)</td><td valign="top">Addgene #42335</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Expressing Cas9 and gRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cong et al., 2013</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Biological sample (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Primary adult human Sertoli cells</td><td valign="top">Shanghai Jiao Tong University</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Freshly isolated</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-DAZL(Mouse polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">AbD Serotec</td><td valign="top">Cat#: MCA2336;

The spermatogonia cells were collected by gently washing with fresh medium and transferred to the well plated with the dH1 or 2F-hiSCs in DMEM/F12 medium with 10% FBS.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-10"><title>Co-transplantation of hiSCs with 293FT cells</title><p>All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at Tsinghua University.Â ~Â 1.3Â ÃÂ 10<sup>6</sup> number of 293FT cells stably transduced with a luciferase reporter were mixed with 2.5Â ÃÂ 10<sup>5</sup> cells of either dH1 or 2F-hiSCs in 100 Î¼l Matrigel. The suspension was transplanted into C57BL/6 (Purchased from Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology) mice with normal immune system by subcutaneous injection. Live imaging of transplanted mice was performed at the indicative day after transplantation. 15 min prior to live imaging, 100 Î¼l of D-luciferin (15 mg/ml, 10 Î¼L/g mouse weight) was injected to the mice by intraperitoneal injection and luciferase activity was measured in the IVIS Spectrum machine (PerkinElmer Health Sciences, Inc).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-11"><title>BODIPY and Oil Red O staining of lipid droplets</title><p>Cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% PFA for 15 min. For BODIPY staining, cells were stained with BODIPY (Invitrogen, working solution1 Î¼g/ml) at room temperature for 15 min and washed in PBS for three times. Then, mounted cells with Prolong gold anti-fade reagent (Invitrogen).</p><p>For Oil Red O staining, 0.5% Oil Red O Stock Solution (in isopropanol) was used. Staining solution contains 6 parts of stock Oil Red O and 4 parts of distilled water, filtered with Whitman paper before used. After cell fixation, stained the cells with 1 ml staining solution for 15 min, then clear background using 60% isopropanol. Finally, wash with distilled water.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-12"><title>Cell lines</title><p>All primary cells and cell lines have been tested to confirm no mycoplasma contamination before they were used in the experiments.

The gene expression level was calculated by Cufflinks (version 2.2.1) using the protein coding genes GTF file extracted from Ensembl database (Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.75.gtf). Read counts were obtained using HTSeq (version 0.9.1). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed using R package DESeq2 and selected using p-value&lt;0.01 as a threshold. Heat map was plotted using heatmap.2 function of R, and gene expressions were scaled to FPKM or Z-scores. We used R function cor to do sample correlation clustering and principal component analysis (PCA). K-means clustering was performed using Cluster 3.0 package (KÂ =Â 3, Spearman Correlation, Complete-linkage) and clustered heat maps were produced by TreeView.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are indebted to Prof. Zuping He helping us to obtain primary human Sertoli cells, Prof. Ting Chen for providing us the primary human keratinocytes, and Prof. Jianbin Wang for helping us to analyze CNV of Sertoli cells.

you for submitting your article &quot;Induction of Sertoli-like cells from human fibroblasts by NR5A1 and GATA4&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Utpal Banerjee as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers and this editor generally agree that this manuscript represents an important advance in the generation of human Sertoli cells, and goes beyond previously published work in mouse models. However, the reviewers raised several important issues that, if addressed, could potentially make the study acceptable for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All of the reviewer comments are relevant, and none appeared to raise issues that are beyond the scope of the study. We hope that you can carefully and thoughtfully respond to these reviews, with new data, where applicable.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This study establishes methodology for direct reprogramming of human fibroblasts in Sertoli-like cells via expression of transcription factors expressed in fetal Sertoli cells. Given the dependence of spermatogonia upon somatic support cells, deriving human Sertoli cells is an important step toward the goal of producing mature gametes in vitro.</p><p>This is a thorough and careful study in which the authors optimize the number and combination of factors for reprogramming, show that fibroblasts from two different sources can be reprogrammed, and interrogate gene expression and function in the cells they derive. Functional tests include chemoattraction of endothelial cells, suppression of T cell proliferation, accumulation of lipid droplets, and capacity to support mouse spermatogonial survival. The most definitive test of function for in vitro-derived Sertoli cells would be their demonstrated support of complete spermatogenesis, however a barrier to this revealed by previous work of others is the failure of primate spermatogonia to complete maturation in the mouse testis. The most reasonable alternative is a transplant into non-human primate testes, which lies beyond the scope of the current study. Finally, the demonstration that connexin 43 deficient fibroblasts cannot produce Sertoli-like cells with equivalent function adds to rigor of the work. The results and approaches are well described in the figures and with cartoons.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this study, human fibroblast was first reprogrammed into Sertoli-like cells with five transcriptional factors and a gene reporter carrying the AMH promoter. they further reduce the number of reprogramming factors to two, NR5A1 and GATA4, and show that the hiSCs have transcriptome profiles and cellular properties that are similar to those of primary human Sertoli cells. The function of hiSCs was further tested by sustain of mouse spermatogonia cells, suppress the proliferation of human T lymphocytes and protect xenotransplanted human cells in mice. They also find that 2F-hiSCs attract human endothelial cells and accumulate lipid droplets. This is the first time induce human fibroblast to transform into Sertoli-like cells, the results are potentially interesting. The in vitro induced system provides a platform for basic research and potential treatment of male infertility in the future. However, there are several issues need to be addressed.</p><p>1) In this study, AMH was used as a reporter to identify the hiSCs. It has been reported that AMH is abundantly expressed in mouse Sertoli cells during embryonic stage and AMH protein is not detected in Sertoli cells after birth. The expression of AMH is probably different from other species. It is necessary to examine the expression of AMH in human Sertoli cells by immunostaining. The specificity of AMH promoter also need to be verified by transfecting human adult Sertoli cells.</p><p>2) The authors claim that human fibroblasts could be transformed into hiSCs by two TFs. WT1 and SOX9 are two very important marker genes, loss of WT1 results in defect of Sertoli function and germ cell loss. In this study, the expression of endogenous WT1 and SOX9 in two TFs induced hiSCs need to be examined by immunostaining and other approaches.</p><p>3) The lipid droplet was stained with BODIPY, it is very hard to tell the morphology of lipid droplet. Oil Red O staining is suggested to examine the morphology of lipid droplet in hiSCs and control Sertoli cells.</p><p>4) SF1 is a very important TF for steroidogenic cell development and many genes which involved in steroidogenesis are induced by SF1. The authors only examined the expression of 3Î²-HSD, the expression of other genes also need to be examined in hiSCs.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Liang et al. report experiments in which they have transdifferentiated human fibroblast cells into Sertoli-like cells (hiSCs) that are morphologically, physiologically, and transcriptionally similar to adult human Sertoli cells. Moreover, they successfully reduced the number of transcription factors necessary for cell reprogramming from five to two. The authors have displayed an incredible amount of work, and their results have considerable implications for infertility treatment in humans. However, this is a rehash of the mouse work with no conceptional advancement from what was done by the Church lab.</p><p>- Were all TFs in separate plasmids or were the RNAs being expressed from a single promoter. There is significant variability in 5TF expression in the IF data. Actually how many of the transformed cells express multiple TFs.</p><p>- In Figure 1D â there is no clear separation or conversion of HPF to AMH:EGFP+ cells. The dH1 induced Sertoli cells still look very much fibroblasty. Do these cells express <italic>SOX9</italic>?</p><p>- Although the authors demonstrate a strong trend of similarity between hiSCs and aSCs, their analysis nonetheless clearly demonstrates that differences remain between these groups (e.g., there are numerous transcriptomic differences visible in Figure 2). However, the authors never detail what the differences between hiSCs and aSCs are.</p><p>- The PCA plot Hierarchical clustering needs to be shown when comparing 5TF, 2TF, vs. aSCs. The authors opted not to include the data.</p><p>- aSCs make for an important positive control, but a direct comparison between aSCs and hiSCs is often missing (e.g. co-plating isolated spermatogonia with SCs; human IL-2 assay (Figure 6C); luciferase assay in xenotransplants; and CX43 deletion experiments).</p><p>- Methods on germ cell/Sertoli cell coculture need to be further detailed â what strain of mice was used for SSC culture. A two day culture is not sufficient to show the 2F Sertoli cells can support germ cell maintenance â comparing this to aSC is important.</p><p>- In the CX43 experiment itâs not clear why the authors think loss of CX43 affect Sertoli cell specification when in humans the testis has Sertoli cells but actually males don't have germ cells. Also it's not clear why they would see an increase in reprogramming efficiency or decrease when overexpression. It is unclear how the authors concluded that CX43 deletion lead to dedifferentiation of Sertoli cells to a less mature state (subsection âCX43 deletion disrupts gap junctions and alters the expression profile of hiSCsâ, second paragraph). If you mix with germ cells can the Sertoli cells differentiate. why not stain with SOX9 â this is not affected by maturation.</p><p>- It was frequently unclear how many cells were used in a given replicate or how many replicates were included in an experiment.</p><p>- Authors should use consistent labeling in their graphs (e.g. &quot;2K7&quot; vs. &quot;CTRL&quot;) and use the same scale (and ideally range) for their axes. The scale of the y-axes in Figure 4B are confusing.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48767.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[â¦] 1) In this study, AMH was used as a reporter to identify the hiSCs.

This is supported by the recent single-cell sequencing study of adult human testis by an independent research group (Wang et al., 2018). They concluded that AMH is specifically expressed in Sertoli cells but not in other somatic cells including Leydig cells of adult human testis. (See Figure 1D from Wang et al., 2018).</p><p>We have also confirmed the specificity of AMH promoter and expression of EGFP in our reporter system by transfecting the vector into human adult Sertoli cells (Figure 1âfigure supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors claim that human fibroblasts could be transformed into hiSCs by two TFs.

When we tried to immunostain WT1, we were not able to detect the proteins in the nuclei of both cell types (data not shown). However, we detected similar level of SOX9 in the nuclei of aSCs and 2F-hiSCs (Figure 3âfigure supplement 3). The immunostaining results are consistent with the RNA-seq results. We speculate that WT1 may be important during in vivo development of Sertoli cells, but it may not be important during in vitro reprogramming of fibroblasts to Sertoli cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The lipid droplet was stained with BODIPY, it is very hard to tell the morphology of lipid droplet.

Two of these genes were detectable (STAR and PGD), but they are also expressed in aSCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[â¦] The authors have displayed an incredible amount of work, and their results have considerable implications for infertility treatment in humans.

Figure 1A showed the fibroblasts transduced with lentivirus of each TF plasmid. The first experiment aim was to confirm that the transduced fibroblasts expressed high level of each TF in the expected subcellular location, nucleus. When we mixed all five TFs to obtain AMH:EGFP+ cells, we detected high expression of all five TFs (Figure 3âfigure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In Figure 1D â there is no clear separation or conversion of HPF to AMH:EGFP+ cells.

In contrast to dH1 transduced with p2k7 control cell that showed fibroblast morphology, AMH:EGFP+ cells became more epithelial-like morphology.

Indeed, more of the characteristics are similar between these two cell types. There were some minor differences such as expression level of some genes as shown in Figure 3âfigure supplement 1.

In the revised manuscript, we have added more control experiments using aSCs, including co-plating with isolated spermatogonia (Figure 5âfigure supplement 2), IL-2 assays (Figure 6âfigure supplement 1C). We are not able to create CX43 deletion cell lines in aSCs because they are primary cells and not proliferative. In addition, the original goal of CX43 experiment is to determine whether CX43 is important during Sertoli cell formation or induction. aSCs is not an ideal positive control in this experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Methods on germ cell/Sertoli cell coculture need to be further detailed â what strain of mice was used for SSC culture.
