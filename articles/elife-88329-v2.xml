sequestering pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family members, an activity that frequently contributes to tumorigenesis. Thus, the development of small-molecule inhibitors for anti-apoptotic proteins, termed BH3-mimetics, is revolutionizing how we treat cancer. BH3 mimetics kill cells by displacing sequestered pro-apoptotic proteins to initiate tumor-cell death. Recent evidence has demonstrated that in live cells the BH3-only proteins PUMA and BIM resist displacement by BH3-mimetics, while others like tBID do not. Analysis of the molecular mechanism by which PUMA resists BH3-mimetic mediated displacement from full-length anti-apoptotic proteins (BCL-X<sub>L</sub>, BCL-2, BCL-W, and MCL-1) reveals that both the BH3-motif and a novel binding site within the carboxyl-terminal sequence (CTS) of PUMA contribute to binding. Together these sequences bind to anti-apoptotic proteins, which effectively ‘double-bolt locks’ the proteins to resist BH3-mimetic displacement. The pro-apoptotic protein BIM has also been shown to double-bolt lock to anti-apoptotic proteins however, the novel binding sequence in PUMA is unrelated to that in the CTS of BIM and functions independent of PUMA binding to membranes. Moreover, contrary to previous reports, we find that when exogenously expressed, the CTS of PUMA directs the protein primarily to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) rather than mitochondria and that residues I175 and P180 within the CTS are required for both ER localization and BH3-mimetic resistance. Understanding how PUMA resists BH3-mimetic displacement will be useful in designing more efficacious small-molecule inhibitors of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>programmed cell death</kwd><kwd>BH3-proteins</kwd><kwd>Bcl-XL</kwd><kwd>anti-apoptotic proteins</kwd><kwd>double bolt lock mechanism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FDN143312</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andrews</surname><given-names>David W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001804</institution-id><institution>Canada Research Chairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Tier 1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andrews</surname><given-names>David W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000196</institution-id><institution>Canada Foundation for Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andrews</surname><given-names>David W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100015668</institution-id><institution>Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andrews</surname><given-names>David W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>CQDM</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andrews</surname><given-names>David W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A second anti-apoptotic protein binding site in PUMA confers resistance to BH3 mimetic drugs and binds the protein to membranes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death, is an essential physiological process responsible for the elimination and disposal of malignant or excessive cells in multicellular organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fuchs and Steller, 2011</xref>). The loss of outer-mitochondrial membrane integrity, known as mitochondrial outer-membrane (MOM) permeabilization (MOMP), is regarded as an irreversible event, resulting in the release of cytochrome c and apoptotic factors from the mitochondria that leads to the activation of caspases and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kale et al., 2018</xref>). MOMP is tightly regulated by BCL-2 protein family proteins, including both pro- and anti-apoptotic regulators that share from one to four homology motifs (BH1 to BH4). BCL-2 and its anti-apoptotic homologs possess all four BH motifs and keep the effector pore-forming multi-BH domain pro-apoptotic proteins, BAX and BAK, from inducing MOMP through direct binary protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kale et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bogner et al., 2020</xref>). Anti-apoptotic proteins can also prevent MOMP by binding BH3-only proteins, which are pro-apoptotic proteins that share only the BH3 region with other BCL-2 family proteins. The interaction of pro-apoptotic proteins with anti-apoptotic proteins, which is often but not always binary, results in a mutual sequestration that inhibits both proteins. BH3-only ‘activator’ proteins, like BIM and BID, bind to and activate BAX and BAK. BH3-only ‘sensitizer’ proteins, like BAD and HRK, bind to and inhibit anti-apoptotic proteins but do not activate BAX or BAK. Unlike the other BH3-proteins where there is a clear distinction, whether the BH3-protein PUMA functions primarily as an inhibitor of anti-apoptotic proteins (sensitizer) or as an activator of BAX and BAK remains unclear and may depend on the cell type analyzed. Although first identified as a p53 transcriptional target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nakano and Vousden, 2001</xref>), PUMA has been characterized as a mediator of cell death induced by DNA damage, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and oxidative damage. All these stresses are induced by common chemotherapeutics and ionizing radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jeffers et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jiang et al., 2006</xref>) suggesting that PUMA may play a role in chemotherapy responses. As the overexpression of pro-survival BCL-2 proteins is not only a hallmark of cancer progression but also critical for tumor cells to sustain a high proliferative rate and survive genomic instability, apoptosis modulation has been proposed as a therapeutic approach to selectively target cancer cells for elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Delbridge et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The development of small molecule inhibitors that mimic the BH3-motif of pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins and function as competitive inhibitors for BH3-protein binding to anti-apoptotic proteins (BH3-mimetics) is an area of active academic and pharmaceutical research. BH3-mimetics result in the death of cancer cells that depend on anti-apoptotic proteins for survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Delbridge et al., 2016</xref>). Among BH3-mimetics, the selective BCL-2 inhibitor, Venetoclax (ABT-199) is leading advancement to the clinic, and is FDA approved for the treatment of relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia in patients not fit for standard induction chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Delbridge et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Roberts et al., 2016</xref>). Navitoclax (ABT-263), a BH3-mimetic that inhibits BCL-2, BCL-X<sub>L</sub>, and BCL-W results in undesirable but manageable on-target thrombocytopenia due to the dependence of platelets on BCL-X<sub>L</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tse et al., 2008</xref>). Unexpectedly complexes of anti-apoptotic proteins bound to PUMA and BIM, are highly resistant to all known BH3-mimetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aranovich et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). Resistance can be partly attributed to membrane binding by both the BH3-protein and its anti-apoptotic target increasing the local concentrations and therefore binding interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pécot et al., 2016</xref>). However, we recently demonstrated that in addition to the BH3-sequence, there is a second anti-apoptotic protein binding motif in the carboxyl-terminal sequence (CTS) of BIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). Together the two binding sequences enable BIM to ‘double-bolt lock’ to anti-apoptotic proteins. The increased avidity that results from two independent binding sequences is presumed to confer resistance to displacement by BH3 mimetics.</p><p>Similar to BIM, PUMA is an intrinsically disordered protein containing a BH3 motif important for binding other BCL-2 family proteins and a CTS reported to function as a tail-anchor that integrates the protein in the MOM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rogers et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wilfling et al., 2012</xref>). However, unlike conventional tail-anchor sequences and the CTS of BIM, the CTS of PUMA contains multiple prolines and charged residues, and an unusually short span of hydrophobic amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borgese et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mehlhorn et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, we investigated whether the unusual CTS of PUMA contributes to resistance to BH3-mimetics. Our results suggest that similar to BIM, PUMA ‘double-bolt locks’ the anti-apoptotic proteins BCL-X<sub>L</sub>, BCL-2 and BCL-W. Unexpectedly, in multiple cell types, exogenously expressed PUMA is primarily localized at the ER and not the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM). Furthermore, replacing the PUMA CTS with ER-specific tail-anchor sequences from other proteins resulted in PUMA mutants that bound specifically to ER membranes, retained pro-apoptotic function as a sensitizer binding to anti-apoptotic protein(s) but were not resistant to BH3-mimetics, suggesting that the sequence of the PUMA CTS rather than membrane binding is responsible for BH3-mimetic resistance. Mutagenesis and live cell experiments identified PUMA CTS residues I175 and P180 as required for both ER localization and resistance to BH3-mimetics. Our data indicate that inhibition of both BH3 and CTS binding to anti-apoptotic proteins may be required to mobilize PUMA for the treatment of cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The PUMA CTS contributes to BH3-mimetic resistance independent of membranes in vitro</title><p>To understand how PUMA resists BH3-mimetic displacement from BCL-X<sub>L</sub>, full-length recombinant BCL-X<sub>L</sub> (CAA80661) and full-length PUMA (AAB51243) were purified, and their interaction was measured in vitro using Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pogmore et al., 2016</xref>). Previously, it was shown that PUMA and BCL-X<sub>L</sub> complexes are highly resistant to BH3-mimetic displacement when bound to membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pécot et al., 2016</xref>), and that mutations in the BCL-X<sub>L</sub> CTS abolished both membrane binding and BH3-mimetic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pécot et al., 2016</xref>). However, PUMA also contains a CTS that binds the protein to membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wilfling et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yee and Vousden, 2008</xref>) and it remains unclear whether it contributes to BH3-mimetic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, PUMA with a deletion of the last 26 amino acids (PUMA-d26) that encompasses the CTS was also purified. To measure function, purified PUMA protein was added to a 'SMAC-mCherry MOMP assay', as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chi et al., 2020</xref>). In brief, mitochondria were isolated from baby mouse kidney (BMK) cells deficient for <italic>Bax</italic> and <italic>Bak</italic> (BMK-dko cells) expressing a fluorescent protein (FP), mCherry, fused to the N-terminal sequence of SMAC (SMAC-mCherry). SMAC-mCherry localizes to the intermembrane space of mitochondria, and is released upon MOMP. Isolated SMAC-mCherry containing mitochondria were reconstituted with recombinant BCL-2 family protein(s), and % SMAC-mCherry release (MOMP) was measured by monitoring SMAC-mCherry fluorescence in the supernatant after pelleting mitochondria, relative to the detergent-induced full permeabilization.</p><p>As expected, the addition of each BH3-protein alone was insufficient to induce MOMP as indicated by the low % Smac-mCherry Release (≈20%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, columns 2,3,9,10). However, the combination of recombinant tBID [4 nM] and BAX [20 nM] was sufficient to induce MOMP at ≈60% release (column 4), which was inhibited by [10 nM] of BCL-X<sub>L</sub> (column 5). Addition of the BCL-X<sub>L</sub> inhibitor BAD [50 nM] (column 6), recombinant PUMA (column 7) or PUMA-d26 (column 8) was sufficient to functionally inhibit BCL-X<sub>L</sub>, thereby inducing SMAC-mCherry release (MOMP) in a BAX-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This confirms that recombinant PUMA and PUMA-d26 function as sensitizers by inhibiting BCL-X<sub>L</sub> to indirectly activate BAX.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The PUMA CTS contributes to BH3-mimetic resistance independent of membranes in vitro.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left panel, legend indicating the combinations of recombinant proteins incubated with purified mitochondria encapsulating SMAC-mCherry.

Here we use a Venus-fused to the N-terminus of the BH3-only protein BIM (<sup>V</sup>Bim) or PUMA (<sup>V</sup>PUMA) to identify the transfected cells expressing the BH3-proteins by fluorescence intensity. As we previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chi et al., 2020</xref>), HEK293 cell lines are unprimed and can only be killed efficiently by an activator protein such as BIM (60% Annexin V positive), whereas PUMA and the previously established sensitizer-only BIM mutant (BIM-dCTS) did not induce cell death in HEK293. On the other hand, BIM, PUMA and PUMA-d26 killed BMK and HCT116, which are primed cells that can be killed by a sensitizer protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chi et al., 2020</xref>). Similar to sensitizer proteins, BH3-mimetics are designed to target anti-apoptotic proteins and do not activate BAX or BAK. Thus, we used a combination of two BH3-mimetics S63845 (MCL-1 inhibitor) and ABT-263 (BCL-X<sub>L</sub>, BCL-2, and BCL-W inhibitor) to validate the apoptotic priming of these stable cell lines by doing a two-way titration of the two drugs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Upon BH3-mimetics treatment, activator proteins and/or active BAX/BAK are displaced from the antiapoptotic proteins in the primed cells resulting in cell death. The combination of these drugs at 10 µM resulted in 47% and 73% Annexin V positivity in HCT116 and BMK, respectively, but did not increase Annexin V positivity in HEK293, confirming that HEK293 is the only unprimed cell line among the three. Taken together, the data show that PUMA acts as a sensitizer and that its CTS is not required for sensitizer function, as truncated PUMA without its CTS can still bind to and inhibit BCL-X<sub>L</sub>.</p><p>Binding of recombinant Alexafluor 647 (A<sup>*647</sup>) labeled BCL-X<sub>L</sub> to Alexafluor 568 (A<sup>*568</sup>) PUMA and PUMA-d26 was measured directly by FRET in the presence of liposomes with a phospholipid composition similar to that of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–E</xref>). In the absence of BH3-mimetics, (indicated as Concentration, 0 nM) the FRET efficiency was ~40% between the donor PUMA<sup>*A568</sup> and the acceptor BCL-X<sub>L</sub><sup>*A647</sup>. The addition of the selective BCL-X<sub>L</sub> BH3-mimetic, A-1155463, did not result in a significant decrease in FRET efficiency, demonstrating that binding of PUMA<sup>*A568</sup> to BCL-X<sub>L</sub><sup>*A647</sup> remains unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, black line). A FRET efficiency of ~40% was also measured with the same concentrations of PUMA-d26<sup>*A568</sup> incubated with BCL-X<sub>L</sub><sup>*A647</sup>, indicating similar protein binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, grey line). However, the addition of low concentrations of A-1155463 reduced FRET efficiency to less than 10%, demonstrating BH3-mimetic mediated displacement of PUMA-d26<sup>*A568</sup> from BCL-X<sub>L</sub><sup>*A647</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Thus, removing the PUMA CTS increases PUMA susceptibility to BH3-mimetic displacement from BCL-X<sub>L</sub>.</p><p>When the same experiment was performed in solution, full length PUMA<sup>*A568</sup> was more resistant to BH3-mimetic displacement than PUMA-d26<sup>*A568</sup> suggesting that the CTS of PUMA contributes to BH3-mimetic resistance by binding to BCL-X<sub>L</sub> even in the absence of membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To corroborate the result the experiment was repeated using the less potent but better studied BCL-X<sub>L</sub> inhibitor ABT-263.

However, to clearly differentiate binding from collisions that can occur at high frequency for colocalized proteins it is necessary to demonstrate that the qF<sup>3</sup> data can be better fit to Hill equation than to a straight line. For this purpose, values that are directly related to the fraction of donor molecules in the bound state, the fractional change in angular frequency (Δω) obtained from polar plots of the data, were plotted as a function of the concentrations of the unbound donor (Free Venus) and fit to a Hill equation to enable calculating apparent dissociation constants for each binding curve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Osterlund et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Addition of the dual BCL-2/BCL-X<sub>L</sub> inhibitors ABT-263 [30 μM], AZD-4320 [20 μM] or a newer BCL-X<sub>L</sub> inhibitor related to A-1155463, A-1331852 [2.5 μM] caused increases in the apparent dissociation constants that were more pronounced for <sup>V</sup>PUMA-d26 than for <sup>V</sup>PUMA binding to <sup>C</sup>BCL-X<sub>L</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

A larger change in Δω results in a greater dynamic range in the assay and therefore the possibility of detecting smaller changes in binding.

To disable the PUMA BH3 region sufficiently to measure the importance of the CTS separately but without abolishing the interaction entirely we replaced PUMA (residues 133–151) with the BH3 region from the protein BID. Unlike PUMA, BID is a pro-apoptotic BH3-protein that is easily displaced from anti-apoptotic proteins by BH3-mimetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aranovich et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pécot et al., 2016</xref>).

Also as anticipated, deletion of the PUMA CTS (PUMA-d26<sup>V</sup>) resulted in increased BH3-mimetic mediated displacement from BCL-X<sub>L</sub>, but not for BCL-2 and BCL-W as reported above (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

While resistance to AZD-4320 was reduced for PUMA(BID-BH3)-d26<sup>V</sup> for binding to <sup>C</sup>BCL-W the apparent K<sub>d</sub> remained substantially lower than for <sup>V</sup>tBID. Overall, these data suggest that both the PUMA BH3 and CTS regions contribute to the high affinity interaction of PUMA with anti-apoptotic proteins, and that the primary mechanism of resistance to BH3-mimetics is a ‘double-bolt lock’, similar to BIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The CTS of PUMA localizes the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum</title><p>The data above demonstrate a previously unrecognized function of the PUMA CTS in double-bolt locking to BCL-X<sub>L</sub> and BCL-2 and that PUMA-BCL-X<sub>L</sub> complexes can form in the absence of membranes. Although, BCL-X<sub>L</sub> is found in both the cytoplasm and bound to intracellular membranes, previous reports suggest that PUMA is localized in a CTS dependent manner primarily to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nakano and Vousden, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wilfling et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yee and Vousden, 2008</xref>).

Briefly, NMuMG (normal murine mammary gland) cells were infected with lentivirus to express a fusion protein consisting of EGFP fused to the N-terminus of a BH3-4E mutant PUMA to visualize the fusion protein (<sup>EGFP</sup>PUMA-4E) without it binding to anti-apoptotic proteins or killing the cells. Using automated-confocal microscopy, 2225 images of individual cells expressing <sup>EGFP</sup>PUMA-4E were classified as the landmark from the reference library they most resemble. To our surprise, 55% of <sup>EGFP</sup>PUMA-4E cell micrographs were classified as most similar to one of the resident endoplasmic reticulum (ER) markers (blue bars), indicating ER localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In contrast, smaller fractions of the cells were classified as patterns resembling that of a protein that recycles between the ER and Golgi (Calr-KDEL) or that is resident at mitochondria (MAO, monoamine oxidase).

Because it lacks both BAX and BAK, the BMK-dko cell line will not undergo apoptosis in response to expression of PUMA or BIK. Therefore, inactivating mutations that might affect localization are not required. To calculate correlation values between PUMA and landmarks for two locations in the same cell, the fluorescent protein mCerulean3 was fused to the N-terminus of PUMA (<sup>C</sup>PUMA). The ER membrane and mitochondria were visualized using the dyes BODIPY FL thapsigargin (green) and MitoTracker Red, respectively. Individual cells were identified using far red nuclear stain DRAQ5. Images of cells were obtained by automated confocal microscopy (Opera Phenix, PerkinElmer) and analyzed with Harmony software (V4.9). To assess localization to the ER membrane, Pearson’s correlation coefficients were calculated between BODIPY FL thapsigargin and mCerulean3 fluorescence intensity for each cell. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, the expression of the negative control mCerulean3 alone resulted in a median coefficient close to zero, indicating no correlation. The positive control for ER localization, mCerulean3 fused to the N-terminus of BIK (<sup>C</sup>BIK), resulted in a median coefficient close to 0.75, suggesting this value represents localization at the ER membrane. Both <sup>C</sup>PUMA and <sup>C</sup>PUMA-4E have Pearson’s coefficient values with BODIPY FL thapsigargin of ~0.6 similar to what was seen for <sup>C</sup>BIK. In contrast, the Pearson’s correlation coefficient for <sup>C</sup>PUMA-d26 with BODIPY FL thapsigargin was similar to the negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) suggesting <sup>C</sup>PUMA-d26 is located in the cytoplasm. Overall, this data indicates that exogenously expressed PUMA localizes to the ER in a BH3-independent, CTS-dependent manner.</p><p>The same approach was used to assess protein localization at the mitochondria. As expected, the Pearson’s correlation coefficients calculated between mCerulean3 alone and MitoTracker Red resulted in a median coefficient close to zero, indicating no correlation. As a positive control for perfect mitochondrial localization, the calculated median coefficient between the dyes MitoTracker Green and MitoTracker Red was close to 0.85 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). As expected, the median Pearson’s coefficient for the ER localized control <sup>C</sup>BIK with MitoTracker Red was only slightly higher than the cytoplasmic control mCerulean3 alone. The Pearson’s correlation coefficients for both <sup>C</sup>PUMA and <sup>C</sup>PUMA-4E with MitoTracker Red were less than 0.2, much lower than those calculated for these proteins with the ER marker BIK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, compare the bottom and top panels), but slightly higher than values obtained for the cytoplasmic protein mCerulean3. Indeed, the Pearson’s correlation coefficients for <sup>C</sup>PUMA and <sup>C</sup>PUMA-4E with MitoTracker Red were similar to the values obtained for the ER marker <sup>C</sup>BIK and MitoTracker Red. Consistent with these observations, the Pearson’s correlation coefficients for <sup>C</sup>PUMA-d26 (lacking the CTS) and mCerulean3 with mitochondria were both close to zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, lower panel). Finally, images of <sup>C</sup>BCL-X<sub>L</sub>, a protein known to be both cytoplasmic and localized to multiple membranes resulted in intermediate Pearson’s correlation coefficients. Together, this data suggests that when exogenously expressed the PUMA CTS localizes the protein primarily to the ER.</p><p>To further dissect the PUMA CTS and identify the region responsible for directing PUMA localization additional mutants were generated. Incremental deletions of the PUMA CTS decreased the Pearson’s correlation coefficient of the mutant proteins with ER localization suggesting that deleting as few as the last 11 amino acids (<sup>V</sup>PUMA-d11) impacts ER localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). As progressive deletion of the CTS correlated with decreasing ER localization, this suggests that the entire CTS contributes to PUMA localization. Unexpectedly, the fusion protein with Venus at the C-terminus of PUMA (PUMA<sup>V</sup>) retained ER localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>), suggesting that unlike CTS of BIK which fully inserts into the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wilfling et al., 2012</xref>) the CTS of PUMA is not a conventional tail-anchor that spans the membrane bilayer. This conclusion is also congruent with the data indicating that the PUMA CTS sequence is too short to span the ER membrane.</p><p>Our data showed that exogenously expressed PUMA mostly localizes to the ER while BCL-X<sub>L</sub> localized to both mitochondria and ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Osterlund et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kaufmann et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Osterlund et al., 2023</xref>). Despite this, in BMK cells, PUMA bound to BCL-X<sub>L</sub> with an apparent K<sub>d</sub> of 5.5 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). To further investigate the subcellular localization of PUMA:BCL-X<sub>L</sub> heterodimers, FLIM-FRET experiments with <sup>V</sup>PUMA were done using MCF-7 cells stably expressing <sup>C</sup>BCL-X<sub>L</sub> and as a localization marker, mCherry fused to the tail anchor sequence of ActA (<sup>Ch</sup>ActA) or of Cytochrome-b5 (<sup>Ch</sup>Cb5). This enables the differentiation of the mitochondrial (<sup>Ch</sup>ActA) and ER (<sup>Ch</sup>Cb5) subcellular regions within the cells where <sup>V</sup>PUMA could interact with <sup>C</sup>BCL-X<sub>L</sub> facilitating localization of complexes. The mCherry channel was used to generate a mitochondrial or ER ‘mask’ and select ROIs for which the mCerulean3 fluorescence lifetime and % FRET were calculated. The plateau observed for the data indicate that both PUMA and PUMA-d26 bind to BCL-X<sub>L</sub> at both the ER and the mitochondria. In contrast, the FLIM data for the BH3-4E negative controls (<sup>V</sup>PUMA-4E and <sup>V</sup>PUMA-d26-4E) can be fit to a straight-line, indicating collisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The simplest explanation for exogenously expressed <sup>V</sup>PUMA binding to BCL-X<sub>L</sub> at mitochondria is that BH3-dependent binding of PUMA to mitochondrial localized BCL-XL results in localization of <sup>V</sup>PUMA at or close to mitochondria. Supporting this hypothesis, immunofluorescence staining in MCF-7 cells for endogenous PUMA which is expressed at levels more similar to that of BCL-X<sub>L</sub> and BCL-2 in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antony et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mukherjee et al., 2015</xref>) revealed that endogenous PUMA co-localized more with the mitochondrial landmark (<sup>Ch</sup>ActA) (Pearson correlation coefficient ≈ 0.6) than the ER landmark (<sup>Ch</sup>Cb5) (Pearson correlation coefficient ≈ 0.4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C</xref>, column 4, 8, and 12).</p><p>Given the relatively lower co-localization of endogenous PUMA to the ER marker in MCF-7 cells, we examined localization of endogenous PUMA after the induction of PUMA expression by ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reimertz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yu and Zhang, 2008</xref>) or genotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Meyerkord et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jamil et al., 2015</xref>). Previous results suggest that a P53-dependent response to genotoxic stress results in the extension of peripheral tubular ER and promotes the formation of ER-mitochondrial contact sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2007</xref>) which may be binding sites for PUMA. Therefore, to test this hypothesis, immunofluorescence staining for endogenous PUMA was done in <sup>Ch</sup>ActA (mitochondria marker) or <sup>Ch</sup>Cb5 expressing (ER marker) MCF-7 cells treated with Thapsigargin (TG) or Tunicamycin (TN) to induce ER stress and Etoposide (ETOP) to induce genotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>). As expected, we observed an increase in the intensity of the Alexa-488 immunofluorescence signal for PUMA in cells treated with the drugs compared to the DMSO-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Intriguingly, we saw an increase in Pearson correlation coefficients for PUMA to both the ER and the mitochondria, most notably at the highest concentrations of the 3 drugs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C</xref>). As genotoxic stressors can also induce expression of the anti-apoptotic BCL-X<sub>L</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jamil et al., 2015</xref>) which is both ER and mitochondria-localized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), we speculate that binding to BCL-X<sub>L</sub> contributes to increased localization of PUMA with the mitochondrial marker <sup>Ch</sup>ActA. Moreover, stress induced changes in ER structure and increased MAMs would also result in apparent localization at mitochondria. Taken together, these data suggest that PUMA subcellular localization in living cells is dynamic and dependent not only on the inherent specificity of the PUMA CTS but also on the abundance and localization of its binding partners. This phenomenon has been observed with another BH3-only protein, BIK whereby the predominantly-ER localized BIK can localized to the mitochondria in BMK-dko upon expression of a mitochondria-localized BCL-X<sub>L</sub> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Osterlund et al., 2023</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Restoring ER localization to PUMA-d26 does not result in BH3-mimetic resistance</title><p>Together the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> demonstrate that the CTS of PUMA is required for the protein to resist BH3-mimetic-mediated displacement from BCL-X<sub>L</sub> in vitro and in live cells. For purified proteins resistance to BH3-mimetic displacement is independent of binding of the proteins to membranes. However, it remains possible that in live cells, PUMA-d26 no longer resists BH3-mimetic displacement because the protein no longer binds subcellular membranes. To test this hypothesis, we constructed two mutants in which the CTS of PUMA was replaced by the tail-anchor sequences of the two proteins used as ER localized controls: BIK (<sup>V</sup>PUMA-d26-ER1) or cytochrome b5 (CB5) (<sup>V</sup>PUMA-d26-ER2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Restoring ER localization to PUMA-d26 does not confer resistance to BH3-mimetic displacement.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon depiction of fusion proteins created.

In addition to binding to <sup>C</sup>BCL-X<sub>L</sub>, <sup>V</sup>PUMA, <sup>V</sup>PUMA-d26-ER1 and <sup>V</sup>PUMA-d26-ER2 also bound to <sup>C</sup>MCL-1 in live BMK-dko cells. Similar to the results obtained for binding to <sup>C</sup>BCL-X<sub>L</sub>, the addition of MCL-1 specific BH3-mimetics; S63845 and S64315, resulted in higher dissociation constants for binding to MCL-1 by both mutant proteins compared to <sup>V</sup>PUMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). However, these data also demonstrate that the MCL-1 inhibitors only partially displaced <sup>V</sup>PUMA-d26-ER1 and <sup>V</sup>PUMA-d26-ER2 compared to mutation of the PUMA BH3 sequence. Thus, similar to BCL-2 and BCL-W the BH3 sequence of PUMA is sufficient to confer partial resistance of binding to MCL-1 to the drugs.</p><p>Thus, these data indicate that reintroducing ER membrane localization to <sup>V</sup>PUMA-d26 does not restore resistance to BH3-mimetic displacement, suggesting that specific residues or sequences within the PUMA CTS contribute to BH3-mimetic resistance.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Residues I175 and P180 in the PUMA CTS contribute to both ER localization and BH3-mimetic resistance</title><p>Data with the CTS substitutions above indicated that localization at the ER is not sufficient to confer resistance to BH3 mimetics. Thus, we sought to identify which regions and residues within the CTS of PUMA are required to confer resistance to BH3 mimetics and if such regions/residues are also required for membrane binding. To this end, mutants were generated containing serial deletions of the PUMA CTS sequence. These mutants were then used to measure binding to membranes and to <sup>C</sup>BCL-X<sub>L</sub> in live cells using qF<sup>3</sup>. Deletion of the last 11 residues (<sup>V</sup>PUMA-d11) had no effect on localization, binding to BCL-X<sub>L</sub> or resistance of the complex to BH3-mimetic inhibition (apparent K<sub>d</sub>’s: DMSO = 6 μM, plus 2.5 mM A-1331852=14 μM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>). Deletion of the last 20 residues (<sup>V</sup>PUMA-d20) negatively impacted localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) and substantially altered binding (∆ω). However, the data still resemble a binding curve and although there is substantial noise at low free Venus concentrations where there was no clear change in resistance to addition of BH3-mimetic (apparent K<sub>d</sub>’s: DMSO = 2 μM, plus 2.5 mM A-1331852=13 μM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The observed change in ∆ω could be due to a conformational change in the protein that increased the distance or altered the dipole orientations between the FRET donor (<sup>C</sup>BCL-X<sub>L</sub>) and acceptor (<sup>V</sup>PUMA-d20) rather than a change in binding affinity. In contrast, deletion of the last 26 amino acids of PUMA (<sup>V</sup>PUMA-d26) eliminated both ER localization and BH3 mimetic resistant binding to <sup>C</sup>BCL-X<sub>L</sub> (apparent K<sub>d</sub>’s: DMSO = 8 μM, plus 2.5 mM A-1331852=38 μM). Therefore, the residues between <sup>V</sup>PUMA-d11 and <sup>V</sup>PUMA-d20 affect localization and ∆ω, but the effect on BH3 mimetic resistance is less certain. Moreover, this region of the PUMA CTS is the most hydrophobic and contains two proline residues which are unusual for a membrane binding region. Therefore, to probe this region of the protein, nine mutants of PUMA<sup>V</sup> were generated in which individual residues were replaced with glutamic acid (E). Although replacement with E is a non-conservative mutation, for the DMSO controls similar dissociation constants were measured for all the mutants of PUMA<sup>V</sup> for binding to <sup>C</sup>BCL-X<sub>L</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Therefore, none of the mutations abolished binding of PUMA to BCL-X<sub>L</sub>. Addition of the potent BCL-X<sub>L</sub> inhibitor A-1331852 resulted in an increase in the apparent K<sub>d</sub>’s for all the mutants. However, for I175E and P180E, the K<sub>d</sub>’s increased substantially, indicating displacement from BCL-X<sub>L</sub> equivalent to that observed for PUMA-d26<sup>V</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Residues I175 and P180 in the PUMA CTS contribute to both ER localization and BH3-mimetic resistance.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Amino acid composition of the PUMA CTS.

PUMA<sup>V</sup> mutant P180A appeared cytoplasmic, and resulted in a Pearson’s coefficient with the ER-localized control that was similar to that of the Venus cytoplasmic control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). This indicates residue P180 is required for PUMA binding to membranes in live cells.

Briefly, the FLIM-FRET efficiency at the acceptor/donor ratio of two was calculated from the fitted Hill-slope equation for expression of the proteins alone and in the presence of the BH3-mimetic, and the change in these values was used to calculate the % Resistance (ie the % of complexes that remain intact). Therefore, a low % Resistance is indicative of protein displacement by BH3-mimetic treatment. In the presence of 2.5 μM A-1331852, PUMA<sup>V</sup> has a high calculated % Resistance (~90%), while PUMA-d26<sup>V</sup> has a lower % Resistance (~50%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). PUMA<sup>V</sup> mutants I175E, I175A, P180E and P180A all have low % Resistance values similar to PUMA-d26<sup>V</sup>, suggesting that all of the mutant PUMA<sup>V</sup> proteins were displaced from BCL-X<sub>L</sub> similarly to PUMA-d26<sup>V</sup>. Even PUMA<sup>V</sup> I175A that localized partially to the ER (<italic>P</italic>=0.04) did not resist displacement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–F</xref>).

The development of the first true BH3-mimetic, ABT-737, was based on the structure of the BH3 sequence of BAD bound to BCL-X<sub>L</sub> and efficacy defined by displacement of BAD BH3-peptides from truncated BCL-X<sub>L</sub> in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Oltersdorf et al., 2005</xref>). The other BH3-mimetics currently under pharmaceutical development were all derived based on the structures of BH3-peptides and their corresponding binding sites in the different anti-apoptotic proteins. However, other factors that contribute to BCL-2 family interactions have been discovered. For instance, the MOM and the ER membrane act as both the platform and an active participant in BCL-2 family interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pécot et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lovell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bleicken et al., 2017</xref>). Not surprisingly, full-length proteins have different affinities than truncated proteins binding to BH3 peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kale et al., 2018</xref>). This is most dramatically shown for the BH3 protein BIM binding to BCL-X<sub>L</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chi et al., 2020</xref>). Studies with truncated protein and BH3 peptides showed binding affinities in the micromolar to millimolar range while studies with full length proteins in the presence of membranes revealed a nanomolar affinity between BIM and BCL-X<sub>L</sub> (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In the latter studies, both BH3 regions and the CTS previously thought exclusively involved in binding of BIM to membranes were discovered to contribute to BIM function. Moreover, both the BH3 sequence and the CTS are required for BIM to bind BCL-X<sub>L</sub>, forming a “double-bolt lock”, in a manner that is resistant to inhibition by BH3-mimetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Collectively the data presented here demonstrate that like BIM, the PUMA CTS functions in binding the protein to membranes and together with the BH3 sequence is required for BH3-mimetic resistant binding to anti-apoptotic proteins. However, unlike BIM, the CTS of PUMA localizes primarily at ER instead of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and together with the PUMA BH3 region results in almost complete resistance to all currently known BH3 mimetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Endogenous PUMA was observed predominantly at mitochondria in MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting other factors besides the CTS may influence PUMA localization, such as the presence of PUMA-binding partners including the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-X<sub>L</sub> at both the ER and mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Unexpectedly, when analyzed using purified proteins the CTS of PUMA conferred resistance to BH3 mimetics in the absence of membranes, demonstrating that inhibition of anti-apoptotic proteins by PUMA does not require binding to membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and suggesting the PUMA CTS binds to BCL-X<sub>L</sub>. Furthermore, when the PUMA CTS sequence was replaced with classical tail-anchor sequences from each of two other proteins, the mutant proteins were localized at the ER in live cells but remained sensitive to displacement from BCL-X<sub>L</sub> by BH3 mimetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Thus, we conclude that membrane binding is not sufficient for the PUMA CTS to confer resistance to displacement from BCL-X<sub>L</sub> by BH3 mimetics. Instead binding of both the BH3 region and CTS of PUMA to BCL-X<sub>L</sub> increases both the affinity and avidity of the interaction.</p><p>To our surprise delineating the specific residues involved in resistance to BH3 mimetics and localization of PUMA at membranes by mutagenesis revealed that residues I175 and P180 are required for both localization and resistance to BH3-mimetics. This suggests that, at least in live cells, binding to membranes and resistance to BH3-mimetics may not be separable. This is very different from the CTS of BIM in which separate regions of the CTS are involved in binding BIM to mitochondria and binding it to BCL-X<sub>L</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). It remains to be determined how residues I175 and P180 are involved in PUMA binding to both membranes and anti-apoptotic proteins. We speculate that for P180E or P180A mutation, the diminished membrane binding and resistance to BH3-mimetic displacement might be due to disruption of the structure of the PUMA CTS. As the CTS sequence contains 4 prolines in the last 14 amino acids and there are 6 prolines in the last 30 amino acids of PUMA the structure of this region is expected to be very unlike other tail-anchor sequences that localize proteins at the ER or mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Unexpectedly, we find using two different quantitative approaches that the PUMA CTS localizes the protein primarily to the ER, and not the MOM as previously claimed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wilfling et al., 2012</xref>). Random forest image classification is an unbiased approach to assess the localization of <sup>EGFP</sup>PUMA-4E in live NMuMG cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). A caveat of this approach is that it assumes that the 4E mutation that disrupts the BH3 region and abrogated pro-apoptotic function has no effect on PUMA subcellular localization. Therefore, since binding to anti-apoptotic proteins such as BCL-X<sub>L</sub> and MCL-1 requires an intact BH3 region, localization due to binding these proteins would not be observed using <sup>EGFP</sup>PUMA-4E. For this reason, we also calculated Pearson’s Correlation values for the overlap between exogenously expressed <sup>C</sup>PUMA or <sup>V</sup>PUMA, with ER membrane and mitochondrial markers in live BMK-dko cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, C and D</xref>). Moreover, fusion of the PUMA CTS (residues 167–193 of PUMA) to the carboxyl-terminus of the fluorescent protein Venus (<sup>V</sup>PUMA-CTS) and expression of this mutant in BMK-dko cells results primarily in ER localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that the CTS of PUMA alone is sufficient to direct ER localization. Although we have shown that PUMA with an N-terminal fluorescence protein for visualization is functional as a sensitizer and can activate BAX or BAK indirectly to kill cells, it remains possible that the absence of available pro-apoptotic protein binding partners (BAX and BAK) may alter PUMA localization. Nevertheless, taken together the two approaches provide strong evidence that in epithelial cells, in the absence of cellular stress, the majority of exogenously expressed PUMA is located at the ER. In contrast, endogenous PUMA was located primarily at mitochondria and when expression increased in response to stress agonists, PUMA localization was increased at both ER and mitochondria. We speculate that the localization of PUMA may be determined by the availability and localization of anti-apoptotic binding partners such as BCL-X<sub>L</sub>. It is also possible that the protein localizes at ER-mitochondrial contact sites similar to the BH3-protein BIK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Osterlund et al., 2023</xref>) or that localization at the ER may be required for a non-apoptotic function of the protein, sometimes referred to as a ‘day job’.</p><p>Our data demonstrate that PUMA residues I175 and P180 are required for BH3-mimetic resistance of PUMA<sup>V</sup> binding to <sup>C</sup>BCL-X<sub>L</sub>. However, in the absence of a BH3-mimetic, the entire CTS region is dispensable for binding of the two proteins as shown by binding of PUMA-d26<sup>V</sup> to <sup>C</sup>BCL-X<sub>L</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In contrast, disabling the BH3 region of PUMA<sup>V</sup> (BH3-4E mutation) resulted in no binding to anti-apoptotic proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This may suggest that a conformational change in either PUMA or the anti-apoptotic proteins that results from binding of the PUMA BH3 sequence increases the affinity of the interaction with the PUMA CTS. Further delineation of the molecular mechanism may require high resolution structure determination. Nevertheless, our data using purified proteins clearly demonstrate that high affinity binding of PUMA conferred by the CTS occurs in solution and strongly suggests direct binding of the PUMA CTS to BCL-X<sub>L</sub> is distinct from the BH3-binding site. Thus, PUMA CTS binding would increase both the affinity and avidity of the interaction via a mechanism that does not require PUMA binding to membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). That BH3-mimetic resistant binding requires only PUMA and <sup>C</sup>BCL-X<sub>L</sub> in solution suggests that future structural studies may be possible.</p><p>Finally, our demonstration that PUMA-d26 binding to BCL-2 is more resistant to inhibition by BCL-2 specific BH3-mimetics suggests that the BH3 sequence of PUMA makes unique contacts with BCL-2 not seen with other BH3-proteins. Only when the BH3-motif is changed to a susceptible one (BID-BH3) and the CTS is deleted (PUMA(BID-BH3)-d26<sup>V</sup>) can BH3-mimetic treatment fully inhibit PUMA binding to BCL-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Thus, it may be possible to design BH3-mimetics selective for inhibition of PUMA binding to specific anti-apoptotic proteins. PUMA(BID-BH3)<sup>V</sup> that contains the BH3-mimetic displaceable BH3 sequence and the PUMA CTS was more resistant than <sup>V</sup>tBID, to displacement by the cognate BH3-mimetics (e.g. <sup>C</sup>BCL-2 with ABT-263 and <sup>C</sup>BCL-W with AZD-4320). Together these results suggest a role for the PUMA CTS in binding to anti-apoptotic proteins that depends on BH3 sequence binding but is independent of the specific BH3 sequence. We speculate that binding of a BH3 sequence may lead to a conformational change in the anti-apoptotic protein that facilitates binding of the PUMA CTS. Finally, the unique amino acid sequence of the PUMA CTS argues that generating an efficient specific inhibitor of PUMA binding to anti-apoptotic proteins may require inhibiting binding of both the PUMA BH3-motif and its CTS.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody to PUMA (polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell Signaling Technology</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat. #: 4976 S; RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2064551">AB_2064551</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dilution (1:400)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Alexa-488 anti-Rabbit IgG secondary antibody (polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Abcam</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat: # ab150077; RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2630356">AB_2630356</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dilution (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Baby Mouse Kidney (BMK)- WT</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11836241">11836241</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dr. Eileen White (Rutgers University)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Baby Mouse Kidney (BMK)- DKO</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11836241">11836241</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dr. Eileen White (Rutgers University)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NMuMG</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_0075">CVCL_0075</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dr. Jeff Wrana (University of Toronto)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HEK293</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Graham et al., 1977</xref>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_0045">CVCL_0045</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Provided by Dr. Frank Graham (McMaster University).</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HCT-116</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Polyak et al., 1996</xref>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_0291">CVCL_0291</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Provided by Dr. Bert Vogelstein (John Hopkins University).</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MCF-7</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3790748">3790748</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_0031">CVCL_0031</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Provided by Dr. Ronald N.

Fluorescein (10 nM in 0.1 M NaOH) and quenched fluorescein (30 μM Fluorescein in 8.3 M NaI and 100 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> (pH 10)) were also added to the plate for instrument calibration. Data acquisition was performed on the INO-FHS microscope as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Osterlund et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Data from each replicate was analyzed to generate binned binding curves. All biological replicates (3 or more) were combined and fit to a Hill equation to generate binding curves and calculate dissociation constants. A 1:1 binding between donor (mCerulean3) fused protein and acceptor (Venus) fused protein was assumed for all protein pairs. Regions of interest (ROIs) were automatically identified within images via a watershed algorithm applied to the TCSPC channel. Pixels within each ROI were combined and used to calculate the fluorescence lifetime. Change in angular frequency is then calculated from corresponding phasor analysis as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Osterlund et al., 2022</xref>. The intensity of mCerulean3 and Venus per ROI was measured and then converted to concentration values based on measured standard curves prepared using recombinant fluorescent proteins and imaged on the same plate. We applied a narrow physiologically relevant range of mCerulean3 expression (1–3 µM) for our binding curves, and 0–50 µM range for Venus. In the 10–20 µM Venus<sub>Free</sub> range, the difference in angular frequency between positive control (Venus-BH3) and negative (Venus-BH3-4E mutant) must be greater than 0.05 to be considered as sufficient dynamic range in the assay to reliably detect changes. For each curve, the Bmax (saturation parameter) was estimated from the median of the points in the far right of each binding curve (30–50 µM Venus<sub>Free</sub>). The minimum sRatio, a threshold value representing the curvature of the binding data used to differentiate binding from collisions, was set to 1.5 based on previous analyses and theoretical modelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Osterlund et al., 2022</xref>). For each protein pair data were combined from independent replicates (n≥3), and the average K<sub>d</sub> reported. In heatmaps, ‘binding’ was represented in blue and ‘no binding’ in red. However, the colors are strictly to enable easy visual comparison of the data. In addition, the numerical value of the apparent K<sub>d</sub> values are provided in each cell of the heatmaps.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>FLIM–FRET with ER or mitochondrial segmentation</title><p>In all other experiments in this paper, to extract FLIM-FRET binding curves ROIs were selected by applying a watershed segmentation algorithm to the TCSPC image of mCerulean3 (e.g. <sup>C</sup>BCL-XL). Our standard segmentation approach was run on all data as a positive control for detection of binding throughout the cell (<italic>see</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> “mC3 total cell”). BCL-XL is found at the ER, mitochondria and in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kaufmann et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Osterlund et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>The purpose of this experiment was to express mCherry-tagged landmarks for ER or mitochondria in the same cells as PUMA and BCL-XL, then use the expression of the mCherry landmark to define the boundaries of ROI segmentation. This modification in ROI selection allows us to examine interactions in the ER verses mitochondria. MCF-7 cells stably expressing both <sup>C</sup>BCL-XL and mCherry (red channel)- tagged markers for ER (mCherry-Cb5) or mitochondria (mCherry-ActA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Osterlund et al., 2023</xref>) were transiently transfected with constructs to express <sup>V</sup>PUMA, <sup>V</sup>PUMA-4E, <sup>V</sup>PUMAd26 or<sup>V</sup>PUMAd26-4E. Data were collected using two imaging configurations as we recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Osterlund et al., 2023</xref>). The two imaging configurations are rapidly exchanged to acquire signal from mCerulean3 and Venus (fluorescent proteins) by time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) FLIM, and Venus and mCherry by using a 64-channel hyperspectral detector. Altogether, the Venus protein expression was captured in both configurations and may be used to confirm alignment images acquired in configurations 1 and 2. In contrast to our previous publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Osterlund et al., 2022</xref>), we observed low transient expression of Venus. As a result, we modified our analysis pipeline to calculate relative Venus expression as a measure of intensity (arbitrary units) from the TCSPC FLIM image, rather than use the hyperspectral data, which requires background subtraction.</p><p>In detail, the intensity of signal from mCherry was determined by summing the hyperspectral counts at wavelengths 592–660 nm. The same parameters were used to segment all images of mCherry expression (Red Channel): background threshold (1000), Laplacian of a Gaussian kernel size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Delbridge et al., 2016</xref>) with sigma (0.13), structural element size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wilfling et al., 2012</xref>), minimum ROI size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chi et al., 2020</xref>), erode factor (0). Nevertheless, the resulting ROIs selected by the Watershed Algorithm were distinct (example images given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref> <italic>compare</italic> <sup>Ch</sup>ActA Mitochondria to <sup>Ch</sup>Cb5 ER). As expected, ROIs selected based on the mCherry-Cb5 expression appear more elongated and mesh-like compared to the more punctate ROIs selected based on mCherry-ActA (mitochondria). We provide the MATLAB analysis package on DataVerse (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5683/SP3/ZKXQW8">https://doi.org/10.5683/SP3/ZKXQW8</ext-link>).</p><p>The ROIs selected from mCherry-marker expression, were directly applied to extract for each ROI the average intensity and lifetime of mCerulean3 (donor) and the average intensity of Venus (acceptor). These data were used to generate FLIM-FRET binding curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref> for ER- versus mitochondria-segmented ROIs as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Osterlund et al., 2023</xref>). The % FRET efficiency was calculated using the phasor approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Osterlund et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ranjit et al., 2018</xref>) and “Acceptor:Donor intensity ratio” represents the ratio of the average intensity per ROI of Venus to mCerulean3 both recorded by TCSPC. During acquisition, a 10 nM fluorescein sample in 0.1 M NaOH was used to standardize the instrument response for the three biological replicates to enable combining the binding curve data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Image Colocalization</title><p>Analyses of colocalization by image classification were carried out as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schormann et al., 2020</xref>). Conventional colocalization studies to measure Pearson’s correlation coefficients were carried out in BMK-dko cells. We utilized multiple fluorescent proteins and dyes to validate protein localization. To identify the endoplasmic reticulum, we either used a dye (BODIPY FL thapsigargin, ThermoFisher Scientific) or an overexpressed ER resident protein composed of EGFP fused to the ER specific tail anchor of BIK (<sup>C</sup>BIK). To identify mitochondria, the dyes MitoTracker Red and MitoTracker Green (ThermoFisher Scientific) were used. The cells were also stained with the nuclear stain, DRAQ5 to permit segmentation and quality control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Oltersdorf et al., 2005</xref>). Query proteins fused to the fluorescent proteins mCerulean3 or Venus were expressed by transfection of BMK-dko cells with gene encoding plasmids. Images were acquired using a 63 X water immersion objective, on the Opera Phenix microscope (PerkinElmer) and colocalization analyzed using an analysis pipeline created in Harmony software. In this pipeline, the DRAQ5 fluorescence signal was used to identify images of individual cells and create a mask for the nuclear and cytoplasmic areas. A low-intensity fluorescence threshold was applied to all cells in order to select for those successfully transfected and expressing the query protein (i.e. Venus or mCerulean3 fused BH3 only protein). Background was subtracted for each image and a Pearson’s correlation coefficient between fluorescent protein-fused query protein and fluorescently labelled organelle was calculated for all remaining objects within the cytoplasmic area. The median Pearson’s correlation coefficient for each replicate is plotted in Graphpad Prism software with a line indicating the average between all three replicates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Cell death assay</title><p>Cell death in response to exogenous expression of <sup>v</sup>BH3-only proteins in HEK293, BMK, and HCT116 cells, was measured as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chi et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, cells were trypsinized and seeded in CellCarrier-Ultra 384-well plates. One day later, cells were transfected with plasmids encoding <sup>v</sup>BimL or <sup>v</sup>Puma (or the mutant proteins) using Mirus TransIT-X2 transfecting reagent. The media was aspirated prior to the addition of the transfection mix into each well. Four hr after transfection, the media was exchanged to remove the transfection mix. To measure cell death in response to BH3 mimetic treatments, cells were seeded as described above and the BH3 mimetics were added the next day as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chi et al., 2020</xref>). After 24 hr of transfection or drug treatment, cells nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 and Alexa 647 labelled Annexin V was added to detect externalized phosphatidylserine on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane in dead or dying cells. Stained cells were imaged by automated confocal microscopy (Opera Phenix, PerkinElmer) and analyzed with Harmony software (V4.9) to obtain %Annexin V positivity for the population of cells in each treatment. Cell death due to <sup>v</sup>BimL or <sup>v</sup>Puma expression was quantified as percentage of Venus positive, Annexin V positive cells out of all Venus positive cells. Background Venus intensities in the un-transfected cells were used to determine the threshold for Venus positivity (2 standard deviations above the mean Venus intensity in the un-transfected wells).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Image-based analysis of subcellular localization by machine learning</title><p>NMuMG cells expressing either EGFP-BIK-L61G or EGFP-PUMA4E were seeded (3000 cells per well) in multiple wells (at least 3) of a 384-well microplate (CellCarrier-384 ultra, B128 SRI/160; Perkin Elmer) and allowed to grow for 24 hr before staining with the nuclear dye DRAQ5 (5 nM; Biostatus). Cells were imaged (&gt;15 field of views) on a spinning disk automated confocal microscope (PerkinElmer) with a 40 x water objective (NA = 0.9) in a defined temperature (37 °C) and CO<sub>2</sub> (5%) environment. Images were collected using 3-Peltier cooled 12-bit CCD cameras (Type sensiCam, camera resolution 1.3 megapixels; PCO.imaging), unbinned.

Using a SMACmCherry based MOMP assay on isolated mitochondria, FRET in the presence of liposomes with a phospholipid composition similar to that of mitochondria as well as quantitative fast fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (Frster resonance energy transfer - qF3) they show that the C-terminal region of PUMA (CTS), together with its BH3-domain, effectively &quot;doublebolt&quot; locks its interaction with BCL-XL and BCL-2 to resist displacement by the BCL-XL-specific BH3-mimetic A-1155463 or the BCL-2/BCL-XL inhibitor ABT-263 and AZD-4320. Although a similar mechanism has previously been published for BIM, the novel C-terminal binding sequence in PUMA is unrelated to that in the CTS of BIM and functions independent of PUMA binding to membranes. First, in contrast to BIM, PUMA contains multiple prolines and charged residues, and an unusually short span of hydrophobic amino acids, secondly, full length PUMA was more resistant to BH3-mimetic displacement than a PUMA mutant lacking the CTS (PUMAd26) even in solution suggesting that the CTS of PUMA contributes to BH3-mimetic resistance even in the absence of membranes.</p><p>The second, quite unexpected finding of this paper is that, in contrast to previous publications, the CTS of PUMA does not target the protein to mitochondria but to the ER. The authors show this by FLIM-FRET imaging and confocal microscopy, and they created mutants to identify the CTS residues (I175 and P180) that mediate binding to ER membranes.</p><p>The authors did an excellent job to show the mechanism of displacement resistance of PUMA from BCL-2 survival factors from different angles (in vitro, on isolated mitochondria, liposomes and inside living cells), generating respective BH3 and CTS mutants and also domain swaps with other BH3-only proteins such as tBID. Also, the unexpected finding that PUMA primarily localizes to the ER has been extensively scrutinized and the data presented are convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the favourable comments and that the reviewer found the data presented convincing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comments:</p><p>I have only three questions which I like the authors to address before this MS can be published.</p><p>1) How can PUMA perform its pro-apoptotic action on MOMP from its site on the ER? Does</p><p>PUMA eventually localize to MAMs (mitochondrial/ER contact sites)? Is it possible to co-IP PUMA with BCL-XL or BCL-2 from ER membranes or show such an interaction inside cells with PLA?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an important point. One of the main conclusions from this paper is that the primary localization of exogenously expressed PUMA is at the ER. Our intent was to highlight the inherent specificity of the PUMA CTS sequence. However, we agree that identifying the localization of PUMA-BCL-XL complexes would add significantly to the manuscript. We carefully considered using co-IP or a proximity ligation assay (PLA) in order to investigate the localization of PUMA-BCL-XL complexes. In our experience the use of co-IP is very difficult to interpret due to the well characterized detergent-induced artifacts previously shown for BCL-2 family protein interactions (PMID: 9553144, PMID: 33794146). Moreover, PLAs are a proximity assay with a detection range of ~&gt;20nm, and are difficult to quantify beyond enumerating frequency (ie counting spots). In contrast, the detection of FRET by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) is very sensitive to distance with a maximum that is &lt;10nm, and the results can be interpreted quantitatively as apparent dissociation constants (manuscript Figures 2-3). Therefore we elected to use FLIM-FRET to address this question. We examined PUMA-specific interactions with BCL-X<sub>L</sub> at the ER and mitochondria by differentially segmenting the FLIM-FRET image data based on the signal from a mCherry-fused landmark expressed at the ER (mCherry-Cb5) or mitochondria (mCherry-ActA). This approach has similar spatial resolution to PLA yet retains more rigorous requirement for proximity and the quantitative interpretability of FLIM-FRET.</p><p>For these experiments we used a recently described the method of mitochondrial image segmentation using hyperspectral image data collected during FLIM-FRET imaging (Osterlund et al., 2023). In this approach, a watershed segmentation algorithm was used to identify mitochondria areas from mCherry-ActA images collected simultaneously with the FLIM data. The ER was identified in separate samples using the same approach with mCherry-Cb5 image data. Simultaneous collection of the images ensures that the data are not affected by movement within the cells. Example images showing the segmentation results for each organelle have been added to the manuscript as Figure 4 - Figure Supplement 2A.</p><p>The results of this FLIM-FRET experiment described in the text lines 581-598, revealed that <sup>V</sup>PUMA interacts with <sup>C</sup>BCL-X<sub>L</sub> within both ER and mitochondria-segmented ROIs (new Figure 4 - Figure Supplement 2B). These results can be explained by the fact that <sup>V</sup>PUMA is targeted to the ER, and BCL-X<sub>L</sub> is known to localize to the ER and mitochondria when bound to BH3 proteins in cells (Kale et al., 2018, PMID: 29149100). This result is similar to what we reported for BIK, another ER-localized BH3 protein that exerts its pro-apoptotic function from ER membranes (PMID: 11884414 and PMID: 15809295). Our recent data for ER localized BIK binding to mitochondria-targeted BCL-XL (Osterlund et al., 2023), suggests that, as the referee suggested, binding to occurs via a membrane-spanning interaction at MAMs (ER-mitochondia contact sites) and/or via relocalization of BIK and/or BCL-XL in response to their co-expression (Osterlund et al., 2023). Consistent with these interpretations, when expression of endogenous PUMA was upregulated in response to stress (Figure 4- figure supplement 3A-B), the amount of PUMA increased at both ER and mitochondria (Figure 4- figure supplement 3C). We have presented this data and interpretation on lines 599-621 and discussed the localization results and the similarity to BIK in the manuscript discussion, lines 1029-1035.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Since PUMA seems to be &quot;double-bolt&quot; locked to BCL-2 or BCL-XL via its BH3-domain and CTS, how can it act as a pro-apoptotic inducer? Is its main function to act as an inhibitor of BCL-2 and BCL-XL rather than a direct BAX/BAK activator? And if it acts as a BAX/BAK activator, how can it be released from BCL-2/ BCL-XL, for example by another BH3-only protein which is induced by apoptosis stimulation? Or would in this case PUMA remain bound to BCL-2/ BCL-XL in order to activate BAX/BAK (which would be a kind of new activation mechanism)?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers queries and have clarified the text to indicate that our interpretation is that by binding to BCL-XL, PUMA releases active BAX that is sequestered by BCL-XL (as shown in Figure 1A for purified proteins). Double bolt locking increases both affinity and avidity of PUMA for BCL-XL enabling competition to favor PUMA binding and displacement of sequestered BAX. To further address the reviewers point we added two additional experiments now shown in figure supplements to Figure 1. The data shown in new Figure 1 – figure supplement 1A (described on lines 182-191 of the revised manuscript) demonstrates that PUMA kills HCT116 and BMK cells but not HEK293 cells. New Figure 1 – figure supplement 1B shows that inhibition of BCL-XL and MCL-1 using BH3 mimetics is sufficient to kill HCT116 and BMK cells while HEK293 cells are not killed by even high concentrations of these BH3 mimetics. To kill HEK293 cells requires activation of BAX (described on lines 191-201). Together this data indicates that the primary pro-apoptotic function of PUMA is inhibiting BCL-XL and MCL-1 rather than by activating BAX. This data fits very well with PUMA double-bolt locking resulting in very tight binding of PUMA to BCL-XL and likely MCL-1 as the primary mode of PUMA mediated induction of cell death, at least in the three cell lines investigated here. The importance and role of PUMA mediated BAX activation is an interesting area of active investigation that is beyond the purview of the current paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Is PUMA still bound to the ER when it is transcriptionally induced by genotoxic stress. In this case, the extra amount of PUMA produced is supposed to directly activate BAX/BAK. Does it do this on the ER or on mitochondria?</p></disp-quote><p>The referee raises a very interesting point. Interestingly, Zheng et al., 2022 highlighted a P53dependent death response to genotoxic stress, which results in the extension of peripheral, tubular ER and promotes the formation of ER-mitochondria contact sites (PMID: 30030520). Furthermore, PUMA is transcriptionally activated by P53 (PMID: 17360476). Therefore, we hypothesized the induction of PUMA would increase the fraction of PUMA at ER membranes and MAMs. As the latter resemble mitochondria in micrographs of cells we anticipated an increase in apparent mitochondrial localization. To address this question experimentally, we treated MCF-7 cells with genotoxic stress and ER stressors and tracked the expression of endogenous PUMA by immunofluorescence. The results are described in the manuscript (line 603-613, page 28) and shown in Figure 4 figure supplement 3. The immunofluorescence data confirmed that PUMA protein levels increase after genotoxic stress, as expected (Reference 39, 40 in the manuscript) and to a lessor but still significant extent after ER stress (Figure 4 figure supplements 3A and B). In response to stress the amount of PUMA increased at both ER and mitochondria, however, in unstressed cells the endogenous Puma co-localized more to the mitochondria than to the ER (Figure 4- figure supplement 3C). This suggests that similar to BIK localization of PUMA is dynamic. In particular, the abundance and localization of PUMA binding partners such as BCL-X<sub>L</sub> also affects PUMA localization (the new data are described on pages 2728, Lines 591-621). As described above, the extra PUMA induced by genotoxic stress can indirectly activate BAX by binding BCL-X<sub>L</sub> and displacing sequestered activated BAX. Our FLIMFRET data suggest PUMA can bind BCL-X<sub>L</sub> at both the mitochondria and the ER. Moreover, given the expansion of ER-mitochondrial contact sites that occurs during stress we cannot rule out the possibility that ER-localized PUMA can inhibit mitochondria-localized anti-apoptotic proteins (both BCL-X<sub>L</sub> and MCL-1) at the ER (for BCL-XL) and MAMs for both proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>Very significant contribution to the field. Quite novel</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>This study by Pemberton and colleagues investigates interactions of pro-apoptotic PUMA with anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins, employing a variety of BH3-mimetics. The authors demonstrate that the PUMA/aa BCL-2 interactions are mediated not only via BH3-domain/groove interactions, but also dependent on a C-terminal sequence of PUMA. This mirrors (with distinct differences) what the authors have previously reported for BIM. They then, reveal that unexpectedly PUMA is often localising to the ER (as opposed to mitochondria), though this localisation is not important for the resistance of PUMA/BCL-2 complexes to BH3-mimetic treatment, authors speculate that ER localised PUMA may have a day job.</p><p>In my opinion, the study is important for several reasons, not least it strongly argues that BH3mimetics are not optimal (in themselves) to promote apoptosis dependent on PUMA, and that approaches to disrupt the &quot;double-lock&quot; mechanisms should be sought - this has clear clinical importance, but equally important is it adds a new layer of complexity to how BCL-2 family members &quot;work&quot;, how the double-lock mechanism is overcome in physiological apoptosis remains an open question, for instance. The data support the authors' conclusions, I have a few points that could be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>The positive comments from the reviewer are greatly appreciated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors data in cells is consistent with a membrane recruitment effect of the PUMA CTS making a contribution to the resistance of PUMA/aa BCL-2 complexes to BH3-mimetics. What I found really intriguing, is that the CTS also influences affinity in the absence of membranes (Figure 1) - could the authors speculate why they think CTS may be affecting PUMA/aaBCL-2 binding in the absence of membranes?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that membrane binding contributes to BH3 mimetic resistant binding of PUMA to BCL-XL consistent with elegant data presented previously (Pécot et al., 2016; PMID: 28009301). However, we show in Figure 5D that mutants of <sup>V</sup>PUMA-d26 with restored membrane binding (<sup>V</sup>PUMA-d26-ER1 and <sup>V</sup>PUMA-d26-ER2) remain sensitive to BH3-mimetic displacement, indicating that membrane binding alone is not sufficient to confer resistance to BH3-mimetics. Furthermore, as the reviewer pointed out BH3 mimetic resistant binding is observed in the absence of membranes (Figure 1).</p><p>The data using purified proteins strongly suggests that the CTS of PUMA binds to BCL-XL and is directly involved in the protein-protein interaction. The fact that PUMA with the C-terminal fusion to the fluorescent protein Venus (PUMA<sup>V</sup>) still localizes to membranes in live cells (Figure 4 D,E) suggests that the C-terminus of PUMA does not span the membrane bilayer. Instead, we hypothesize that the C-terminus of PUMA binds peripherally to the membrane making it available to physically contribute to a protein interaction with anti-apoptotic proteins. This interpretation is consistent with the low hydrophobicity and high proline content (6 of 28 residues) of the amino acid sequence of the PUMA CTS as shown in Figure 6 and compared to the transmembrane tail anchor sequences of other proteins, including the BH3-protein BIK, in Figure 5 supplement 1. Binding of Bcl-XL by both the BH3 region and CTS of PUMA would increase both the affinity and avidity of the interaction. The presentation of this data has been revised to add clarity on pages Page 8, lines 215-223 and in the discussion (Lines 988-997 and 1044-1050).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Interestingly, the CTS of PUMA directs the protein to the ER membrane and residues I175 and P180 within the CTS are required for both ER localization and BH3-mimetic resistance.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1. BH3-mimetics kill cells by displacing sequestered pro-apoptotic proteins to initiate apoptosis.</p><p>However, PUMA resists BH3-mimetic mediated displacement, and PUMA-d26 and PUMA</p><p>I175A/P180A (CTS) do not. Thus, are these mutants sensitive to BH3-mimetics cell killing? In other words, do BH3-mimetics kill PUMA-/- cells that express either PUMA-d26 or PUMA I175A/P180A but not PUMA-/- cells that express wild type PUMA?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises a very interesting question that unfortunately we have been unable to address unambiguously. To answer this question requires separating the effects of PUMA on anti-apoptosis proteins and on activation of BAX and BAK as exogenous expression of either PUMA-d26 or PUMA I175A/P180A is sufficient to kill PUMA-/- cells without the addition of a BH3 mimetic. To date we have been unable to identify mutants that inhibit anti-apoptotic proteins but that do not activate BAX and BAK as both PUMA-d26 and PUMA I175A/P180A have impaired BAX-activation function. This is additionally complicated by PUMA mediated inhibition of MCL-1, BCL-2 and BCL-W. Further, it isn’t possible to separate the function(s) using BAX/BAK knock-out cells because then PUMA induced cell death is completely abrogated. Understanding the direct activation of BAX by PUMA is an area of current investigation that is out of the scope of this paper as here we are focused on the interaction(s) of PUMA with anti-apoptotic proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors elegantly demonstrate using microscopic analysis that over expressed PUMA mostly localizes to the ER membrane. Since this is a major conclusion in the paper which is different than previously reported, the authors should confirm these findings using sub-cellular fractions followed by Western blot analysis. They should demonstrate that endogenous and over-expressed PUMA are mainly localized to the ER membrane and that the PUMA-d26 and PUMA I175A/P180A are mainly localized to the cytoplasm.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate that the reviewer found the microscopic analysis convincing. We also tested the idea of sub-cellular fractionation proposed by the reviewer. However, we have found it to be very difficult to separate mitochondria and MAMs. To address the question raised we instead performed new co-localization experiments, in addition to those reported for PUMAd26 and the point mutants in Figure 6 (images in Figure 6 - figure supplement 3). The new experiments are for endogenous PUMA at steady state and with increased expressed in response to stress. These immunofluorescence experiments are reported in Figure 4 -figure supplements 3. We also added FLIM-FRET experiments in which ROIs were derived from areas of the cell enriched in either ER or mitochondria (Figure 4 - figure supplement 2). The results of these experiments indicate that PUMA localization is dynamic and are described in detail above in response to reviewer 1 question 3 and in the manuscript from line 579 to 621 and discussed on lines 1029-1036.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>The advance in this paper is significant and the paper should be published once the specific comments are adequately addressed.</p></disp-quote></body></sub-article></article>
